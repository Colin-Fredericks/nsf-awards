 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed herein to continue sampling along the San                        Andreas fault in order to find more old-aged trees that have                    been disturbed by earthquakes.  These disturbed trees can                       provide information about timing and extent of prehistoric                      earthquake events as their records of annual growth rings are                   dated and deciphered.                                                                                                                                           Previous tree-ring ssampling and new samples from the first                     supported part of this project confirm the effects of the 1857                  earthquake in certain trees in southern California.  Samples                    along a 10 km length of the San Andreas fault just northwest of                 Cajon Pass show evidence of strong disturbance between the                      growing seasons of 1812 and 1813.  A reported great earthquake                  in 1812 encourages the interpretation that tree-ring data can                   define the location of this earthquake, which is known in time                  but not in space.  Further sampling and study will ensue in                     this area, because the interval of only 44 years, between 1812                  (December) and 1857 (January), is much shorter than previous                    estimated recurrence intervals along this segment.  Precise                     delineation of extent of rupture in late 1812 will be the                       primary focus of this research.  Studies will also continue on                  samples from other segments of the San Andreas fault.  Within                   constraints of time, efforts will continue in northern                          California.  The concentration there will be on the extent of                   the 1838 event in the Bay Area region.",
