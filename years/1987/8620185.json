 "awd_abstract_narration": "Northern wintertime atmospheric fluctuations on very large              (near global) spatial scales and monthly to seasonal temporal                   scales are associated with geographically-fixed standing                        oscillations with large wavelike structure.  One such pattern                   which often influences the seasonal character over the U.S. is                  referred to as the PNA pattern because of clear connections                     between atmospheric states over the near-equatorial Pacific Ocean               and North America.  This pattern (called PNA teleconnection                     pattern) is often enhanced during warming events (El                            Nino/Southern Oscillation episodes) in the equatorial Pacific                   Ocean.  While the spatial pattern is well known, its time                       behavior, including onset, maturity, and decay, are not yet                     understood.  These properties are important to understanding the                dynamical nature of intra-seasonal variability and to developing                numerical methods for their prediction.                                                 The PIs, Drs. Wallace and Kushnir are proposing to carry out            systematic diagnostic studies of the temporal behavior of such                  teleconnection patterns.                                                                The proposal concerns the study of atmospheric                          teleconnection patterns on time scales of 30-150 days.  The                     analysis emphasizes a comparison between the observations and                   general circulation model data from the NCAR CCM.  The 30-150 day               fluctuations will be isolated in the data using digital                         filtering.  The patterns will be identified using a rotated                     principal component analysis.  The goals of the study are:                              (a)To determine the characteristics of the temporal                     evolution of the patterns                                                               (b)To identify the changes in the circulation during                    periods of onset and decay of the patterns.",
