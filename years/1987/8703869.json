 "awd_abstract_narration": "An International Symposium on Strangeness in Hadronic Matter            is planned for June 1-5, 1987 in Bad Honnef, West Germany.  The                 theoretical problem of how normal hadronic matter, made up of                   neutrons and protons, is changed when strange hadronic matter is                added, is a very interesting and important one.  (Strange                       hadronic matter consists of particles which contain strange                     quarks, such as lambda and sigma particles.)  This Symposium                    would bring together the world's experts in this field to                       discuss the latest developments and theories.                                           The discussions and interactions at the proposed Symposium              should lead to significant progress in the understanding of                     strange hadronic matter.  Fruitful collaborations will also be                  established at the Symposium, which will produce new                            investigations in this exciting field of research.  Support for                 U.S. speakers to participate in this important Symposium is                     highly recommended.",
