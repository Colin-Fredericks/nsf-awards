Speakers from fields of molecular biology, morphology and                anatomy, systematics, and paleontology will address problems                    related to the origin of novel biological structures, molecular                 pathways, and functions, at the levels of population, species,                  and lineage through time.  A major focus of the discussions will                be efforts to disentangle cause and effect in the study of                      evolutionary innovations, defined as new structures or functions                that open up new ways of life for particular groups of animals or               plants.                                                                                 Dr. Nitecki and the Field Museum have a strong record of                managing and hosting symposia addressing significant topics in                  the field of systematic and evolutionary biology.  The symposia                 attract over 200 researchers, including many students, and have                 been held since 1978.  Results are published promptly, and these                publications have been regarded as of high quality.",
