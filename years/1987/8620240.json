 "awd_abstract_narration": "The experimental method to be employed by Dr. Dyke will be infrared             absorption spectroscopy.  Diode lasers will be used to study the                spectral region from 350 - 3500 reciprocal cm., utilizing both                  molecular beams and static gas samples to provide varying degrees of            simplicity and information content in the observed spectra.                     Microwave-infrared double resonance techniques will be used to                  increase the spectral resolution and to aid in assigning spectra.  To           access the important spectral region below 350 recoprocal cm., a far            infrared Fourier transform spectrometer with high sensitivity                   detectors will be employed, allowing many of the low frequency                  intermolecular modes of complexes to be directly examined.  Specific            systems to be studied include hydrogen-containing dimers and mixed              complexes of monomers.                                                                                                                                          Intermolecular forces manifested in hydrogen bonds and van der Waals            interactions play an important part in determining the properties of a          wide variety of condensed phase and macromolecule systems.  Theories            of liquid water, aqueous solutions and macromolecule conformations are          examples of areas where these interactions are of particular interest.          To understand these systems, accurate information concerning                    intermolecular potential energy surfaces is vital.  One way to attack           this problem is to form complexes held together by hydrogen bonds or            van der Waals interactions, and to study them by various spectroscopic          techniques.  If enough spectroscopic data is in hand, substantial               information about the relevant potential energy surfaces can be                 gained, and when available, combined with scattering or thermodynamic           data to give a more comprehensive view of intermolecular forces and             the nature of these weak interactions.",
