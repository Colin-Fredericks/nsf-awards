 "awd_abstract_narration": "Members of the palm family (Arecaceae), like most other                     monocotyledons, have a unique organ, the haustorium, which functions            during germination and seedling establishment.  It is the distal portion        of the cotyledon which remains within the seed and grows in conjunction         with endosperm degradation.  This project (with a structural emphasis)          employing a multidisciplinary approach is proposed to elucidate the             function of the haustorium and the interaction between the haustorium           and endosperm tissue.  Structural and functional aspects of the                 interaction of the haustorium and endosperm tissue in the palm family           will be conducted by 1) studying seed structure and developmental               changes accompanying germination in the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera),          2) observing phosphate uptake and development of haustorial phosphate           granules and their structural characteristics using chemical and                physical fixation conditions and 3) using enzyme assays and techniques          of localization on sections to determine the location and controls of           hydrolase production.                                                               The plants Dr. De Mason is working with are economically and                scientifically important and little understood.  These studies will lead        to a better basic understanding of the processes that occur during              germination of palm seeds and the role of the haustorium in germination.",
