These conferences provide the main                forum for the presentation of the latest developments in research               and applications of artificial intelligence. (AI).  Funding is                  needed because of travel budget limitations, especially for                     younger faculty members and graduate students, particularly those               who are presenting papers or otherwise participating in the                     technical program of the conference.                                                  The importance of this award is that while a substantial                  amount of research in AI continues to be done in the U.S., the                  activities in other countries are steadily increasing and it is                 critical for U.S. specialists to be well informed about that                    work.  Scientific progress in the field requires exchanges of                   ideas among groups in different countries.  However, it is not                  sufficient just to read proceedings.  Personal and informal                     interactions are essential, particularly where work in progress                 involves different viewpoints and styles of research.",
