 "awd_abstract_narration": "Approximately twenty-five cognitive scientists, mathematicians                  educators, and philosophers will meet for a three-day conference in the         fall of 1988 that will be supported jointly with the Sloan Foundation.          The conference will be held in an isolated setting (at a conference             center, probably Pajaro Dunes) to promote the substantive, sustained            interaction of the conference participants.  To establish a context and         some uniform background for the conference, conference participants will        be mailed two \"baseline\" documents:  the manuscript of Cognitive Science        and Mathematics Education and the report \"Establishing a research base          for science education:  Challenges, trends and recommendations\".                Two advisory boards, one for mathematics and one for cognitive science,         will help select attendees and set the conference agenda.  The                  mathematics advisory board consists of Ingram Olkin (Statistics,                Stanford), Robert Osserman (Mathematics, Stanford), Henry Pollak (former        vice president, Bell Communications Research), and Lynn Steen                   (Mathematics, St. Olaf); the cognition advisory board consists of James         Greeno (Education and Psychology, Stanford), Lauren Resnick (Learning           Research and Development Center, Pittsburgh), and Alan Schoenfeld               (Education and Mathematics, Berkeley).                                                                                                                          The advisory boards will frame key issues regarding mathematical                understanding that they hope to see addressed by conference                     participants, including issues regarding a possible research agenda.            The participants who prepare papers will be asked to write about those          issues in such a way that (a) the papers are accessible to the broad            range of participants, and (b) there is enough specific detail (research        findings, examples of problems or instructional methods, etc.) to               provide a base for substantive discussion.  The papers will be mailed to        the reactors a month before the meeting.  The meeting will open with a          general introduction.  For the first two days of the conference, papers         will be presented in one-hour sessions, with critiques  and open                discussion.                                                                                                                                                     Readers for each paper will be chosen from a cross-section of the               disciplines represented, to foster the kinds of interactions the                conference is supposed to induce.  The third day will be devoted to             synthesis and an attempt to set a research agenda.  Summary reaction            talks will attempt to draw together various themes of the conference:           identifying commonalities among the various perspectives, identifying           points of controversy, and pointing to lines of communications among the        various constituencies that might be pursued.  A final session will             focus directly on a proposed research agenda.  What issues do the               participants believe are a important and approachable?  What do we need         to know in order to make progress?                                                                                                                              The conference will generate a number of papers which will be compiled          as Conference Proceedings.  The Proceedings will be edited by the               members of the two advisory boards and published through a dissemination        medium such as the Mathematical Association of America's MAA Notes              series, or through a commercial publisher known for disseminating such          work (e.g. Lawrence Eribaum).  Presentations based on the results of the        conference will be made at meetings of the American Educational Research        Association, Mathematical Association of America, and National Council          of Teachers of Mathematics.",
