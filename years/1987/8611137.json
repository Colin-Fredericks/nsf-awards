 "awd_abstract_narration": "A continuing research program designed to investigate new approaches to         nucleophilic conjugate addition is proposed.  Conceptually it will be           tested whether or not charge-directed 1,4-addition reactions are                facilitated by carbonyl-deactivation in unsaturated systems using               deactivators such as: silylated carboxylates, enolates, sulfenylated            enolates and transition metallates.  New approaches to sterically               directed conjugate addition, with and without Lewis acid catalysts,             will be examined.  Complex ring construction through lithium-halogen            exchange-initiated cyclization reactions will also be explored.                                                                                                 The facilities available to Professor Cooke are suitable for the                research to be conducted, and the prior results of the Principal                Investigator demonstrate his ability to make use of the equipment and           facilities.",
