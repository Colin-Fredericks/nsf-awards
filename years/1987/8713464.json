 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to a Project Solicitation, the University of Georgia's              Advanced Computational Methods Center submitted a proposal to conduct           a Supercomputer Summer Institute in 1987.  This proposal and eight              others were evaluated by a review panel.                                                                                                                        Georgia proposed a two week Institute for 25 young researchers from             July 12 to 24.  Emphasis would be on developing familiarity with the            University's Cyber 205 supercomputer, gaining an understanding of the           concepts of vector computers and code optimization techniques, and              becoming more familiar with advanced use of the Fortran programming             language.  The second week of the Institute would be focussed on                specific software application programs, with an emphasis on three               disciplinary areas: computational chemistry, computational fluid                dynamics, and simulational physics.                                                                                                                             The panel found this to be a good, basic, but not innovative,                   proposal.  Students could be expected to receive a particularly strong          grounding in the Cyber 205, enhanced by the 24 hour per day access to           the machine through terminals in dormitory rooms.  The instructors              proposed were adequate, but in general not of national reputation.              The cost of the proposal seemed excessive.                                                                                                                      Georgia has experience in supercomputing training and education,                having conducted three seminars in 1986, one of which was supported by          the Centers Program.  This year's proposal is particularly strong on            application packages which are important to the majority of                     supercomputer users who do not write their own programs from scratch.           These applications packages are also available across a broad variety           of computer types and manufacturers and are useful on machines other            than supercomputers.                                                                                                                                            After negotiations, Georgia has agreed to a considerable amount of              cost sharing, which reduces the proposal budget from $122,578 to the            very reasonable amount of $53,109.  In addition, an undergraduate               component of $4000 has been identified.                                                                                                                         With the reduced budget, the Georgia proposal is an excellent value             and will offer a strong training and education experience to its                attendees.  The Centers Program recommends support of a 1987 Summer             Institute in the amount of $57,109.",
