 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a request for continued funding to carry               out an ongoing research program on the genesis of comagmatic                    igneous rock associations.  The primary aim of this research is                 to clarify the petrogenesis of igneous suites and to examine                    modifications of mantle-derived magmas with the continental                     crust environment.  An auxiliary goal is to determine the                       character of the magma source  regions and the temporal nature                  of the magma production events in order to advance our                          understanding of intraplate magmatism in a geodynamic context.                  The localities of study are alkaline complexes in New England,                  southern Quebec, and Zimbabwe.  These are generally small,                      epizonal bodies composed of successive intrusions of varying                    composition. The methodology uses petrographic, major and trace                 element, and stable and radiogenic isotopic relationships with                  close temporal control to formulate specific petrogenetic                       models.  Recent research efforts have yielded valuable                          information on the nature and details of the general open-                      system evolution of these magmatic complexes and on the nature                  of the sources and the timing of magmatism.  Continued research                 should be highly rewarding not only for the specific localities                 and provinces under study but also for analogs elsewhere.",
