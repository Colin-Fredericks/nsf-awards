 "awd_abstract_narration": "The molecular basis for substrate adhesion in fibroblastic                 cells will be analyzed in terms of two distinct adhesive cell-                  substrate contacts, the close and focal contacts, and at the                    level of three interacting components-the cytoplasmic, cell                     surface, and substrate ligands.  An adhesion defective mutant                   cell line will be used to probe for critical components in                      contact formation. A time-resolved analysis of changes in                       structure and protein composition of the cytoplasmic                            precursor of the focal contact that occur before and after                      contact is made will define a sequence of potential functional                  interactions at the  cytoplasmic face of the membrane.  An                      analysis of the ability of natural matrix substrate-ligands to                  elicit focal and close contacts will define the role of the                     matrix in controlling expression of the contacts and                            identify different cell surface receptors involved in contact                   formation.  The myosin affinity technique will be used to                       selectively isolate, on the basis of transmembrane linkage to                   actin, cell-surface glycoproteins functional in these two                       contacts.                                                                            Collectively, the studies will provide an understanding of                 the molecular basis of adhesion that will permit future                         experiments on the regulation of adhesion at the level of                       transmembrane interations, and on the control of cell movement in               development, through changes in adhesion.",
