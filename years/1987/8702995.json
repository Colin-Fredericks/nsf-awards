 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extratropical cyclogenesis occurs preferentially in certain                geographical regions including the lee of major mountain ranges and             the \"storm tracks\" roughly coincident with the eastward extension of            western boundary currents: the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic and            the Kuroshio in the North Pacific.  However, explosive cyclogenesis,            characterized by a large rate of decrease in central pressure and               severe winds, is almost exclusively a marine phenomenon.  Synoptic              meteorologists classify certain cyclones as \"bombs\"; a \"bomb\" is an             extratropical cyclone with its central pressure decreasing at a rate                               -1                                                           of at least 1 mb hr   for 24 hours.  Recent observational studies               have identified a number of crucial elements common to \"bombs\".                 However, a theoretical synthesis has yet to emerge.                                  Under this project the explosive cyclogenesis will be treated as           an initial value problem (IVP) from which a theory will be derived.             This approach to instability contrasts with the more traditional and            common approach of normal modes.  In the IVP theory, cyclogenesis               results from the growth of favorably configured perturbations in a              baroclinic flow; intensification proceeds whether or not the flow               supports exponential instabilities and gives growth rates which are             greater than the normal mode growth rates in cases where normal modes           exist.  As part of the project, synoptic predictors for explosive               cyclogenesis will also be identified and put in the context of the              new theory.",
