 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will explore electromagnetic                      characteristics and properties of dielectric wave guiding and resonant          structures using extensions of rigorous methodology developed by the PI         under NSF Grant No. ECS-8320249.  Due to the present availability and           rapid improvements of extremely low loss, high dielectric constant              materials and their relative simplicity, these structures will find new         and innovative applications in many subsystems and components such as           guiding transmission media, filters, couplers, and possibly high power          sources and components in the microwave, millimeter, and optical region.        The structures to be analyzed have circular cylindrical cross sections,         an outer perfectly conducting enclosure partially filled with dielectric        cylinders of various radii.  They are rigorously modeled by sections of         partially filled (dielectric loaded) or homogeneously filled waveguides.        Detailed analytical and numerical investigations of the properties of           complex waves on the uniform dielectric loaded waveguides will be               carried out.  The guiding structures will be analyzed as periodic               structures and computer programs will be developed to implement the             numerical solutions. Experimental verifications of the predicted                characteristics will be made for the purpose of ensuring the adequacy           and accuracy of the analyses and the models used.                                       The proposed research will explore electromagnetic                      characteristics and properties of dielectric waveguiding and resonant           structures.  In the last decade, the progress in the development of low         loss, temperature stable, high dielectric constant materials has been           quite impressive, and consequently the utilization of these materials           has increased substantially in several applications for components at           microwave, millimeter wave, and optical frequencies.  Major advantages          that are achieved by using high dielectric constant materials are the           miniaturization of the components, lower manufacturing and production           costs, and potential compatibility with microwave integrated circuits           and monolithic microwave integrated circuits.",
