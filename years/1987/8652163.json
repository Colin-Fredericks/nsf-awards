 "awd_abstract_narration": "Commercial television is a powerful medium that has rarely                      succeeded in bringing scientific and technological information to               its vast viewing public.  For approximately eight years Don                     Herbert and his series \"HOW ABOUT...\"  has brought science news                 to millions of viewers across the country.  This series is                      carried on over 150 commercial TV stations in 80% of the major                  markets.  The objectives of the program are to further the                      public's understanding and appreciation of the importance of                    science, technology and medical research to our way of life.                                                                                                    Research Communications Ltd. will conduct a two-tiered study to                 determine the impact and effectiveness of these news inserts.  A                telephone survey will be conducted with station managers and news               directors to document the decision-making process.  The second                  step involves a series of focus groups with home viewers to                     determine the effectiveness of the series.  Viewers will be asked               a series of questions as well as responding to sample news                      segments.                                                                                                                                                       The research firm and Prinicpal Investigator have extensive                     experience in the media research area.  This project of $27,700                 is a modest evaluation investment which could provide clues and                 insights in mapping further commercial media strategies.",
