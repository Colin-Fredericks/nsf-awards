 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the general problem of how the tools of symbolic         computation can be used in the context of calculus instruction in high          schools.  For many years there have been programs, such as REDUCE,              MASCYMA, SCRATCHPAD, and MuMATH which can perform symbolic computations         that are required for the solutions of calculus exercises.  But these           powerful programs have been used mainly by researchers in many areas of         pure and applied mathematics and in practical engineering applications.         REDUCE algebra system will be adapted for instructional purposes by             building a set of sample computer-based lessons in integral calculus.                                                                                           These lessons, combined with earlier work on the differential calculus,         will cover all the standard material of the College Board's recommended         curriculum for advanced placement calculus, AB.  In addition to the use         of REDUCE as an \"algebra engine\" the lessons make full use of high-             resolution graphics, and the software is intended to be delivered to            students on individual workstations.                                                                                                                            Most importantly, the software for problem-solving and calculus                 exercises will be able to keep track of the validity of the steps the           student makes and detect and inform the student about incorrect steps.          The overall environment is one in which algebraic and graphics tools are        embedded in a framework of valid mathematical inference.  In addition,          this project is developing an interactive theorem proving system in             which very able students can prove the main theorems of real analysis           which are relevant to concepts in first-year calculus.                                                                                                          During the academic year 1988-89 the lessons will be tested with a small        number of high school students.  The lessons will be available for wider        use in January 1990.",
