 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research applies recent solid mechanics advances to shear                   localization behavior and develops a verified approach to predict the           stability of geo-materials such as rock and concrete structures.  The           main goal of this work is to understand the physical process of strain          localization in geo-materials and provide a theoretical framework for           the extrapolation of laboratory observation to applications.                    Comprehensive studies are conducted on shear localization in rocks and          other geo-materials that exhibit sensitivity of inelastic deformation           and inelastic volume change.  The studies combine theoretical analyses          with computational and experimental work.  Improved constitutive                relations for multiaxial and inelastic deformation will be formulated           and a framework will be developed for the use of constitutive models in         numerical codes.  Specifically, shear rupture in pressure-sensitive and         inelastically compressible solids will be investigated based on models          involving bifurcation from homogeneous deformation.  The investigations         of localization will then be used with experimental observations and            numerical calculations to study the performance of inelastic                    constitutive relations for multiaxial deformation of geo-structures.",
