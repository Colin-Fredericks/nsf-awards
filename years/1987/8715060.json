 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to determine what fraction of             the aerosols and gases deposited in snowfall is due to liquid cloud             water removal by the riming mechanism, whether by snow crystal riming           or by high mountain-surface riming.                                                 This study will focus on how and where the various trace                    constituents of the atmospheric aerosol are distributed among the               three water substance components within the cloud: ice, liquid water            and water vapor.  The results will be interpreted using acquired                knowledge of the microphysical properties of the cloud at the study             site.  Estimates of the microphysical conditions within which the ice           particles grew will be made from observed meteorological conditions             and the use of a simple ice crystal trajectory and growth model.                Knowledge of the atmospheric conditions which occur and careful                 on-site characterization of the cloud droplets, ice particles and               aerosol particles should permit a better understanding of what                  scavenging and growth processes lead to the final observed ice                  crystal chemical composition.                                                       Key questions of atmospheric chemistry pertain to the mechanisms            by which airborne aerosol particles and gases are scavenged by clouds           and rain, and deposited at the earth's surface.  Under freezing                 conditions a significant fraction of these scavenged materials is               deposited in rime ice, which is the ice that results from freezing of           supercooled fog or cloud droplets either on preformed snow crystals             or on objects at the earth's surface.  The scavenging of aerosols and           gases under snowing conditions is believed to occur predominantly by            collection in liquid droplets and subsequent deposition in the rime,            rather than in the snow crystals.  Data on the relative importance of           competing deposition mechanisms will contribute to the understanding            of the global cycling of the chemical elements in nature.  In                   particular, this knowledge should help to understand the conditions             governing the deposition of acidic materials at high mountain                   elevations.  The recognition of forest damage at the highest                    elevations has raised questions about what mechanisms cause these               effects to be so sharply delimited in areal extent.  A detailed                 understanding of atmospheric deposition processes should help to sort           out the roles of acids, oxidants, or other airborne constituents.",
