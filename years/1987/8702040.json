 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of Dr. Sajovic's project is to do preliminary                     experiments to identify and study molecules involved in the                     general phenomenon of binding of growth cones to target cells.                  In particular he hopes to be able to focus on those growth cones                that have specific high affinity GABA uptake systems.  He will                  use the calcium phosphate coprecipitate method of DNA-mediated                  gene transfer to generate transfected cells expressing target                   cell proteins involved in the binding of growth cones.  These                   cells will be screened for the binding of radiolabelled growth                  cones made by the fractionation of neonatal rat forebrain.                      Membrane preparations from binding-positive transfectants will be               used to immunize guinea pigs.  Monospecific reagents will be                    generated from polyclonal antisera by absorption with naive                     (untransfected) L cell membranes, and the use of a Lambda gtll                  cDNA expression library made from embryonic brain.  In this                     approach, each positive recombinant phage isolate that is                       selected from the library with one serum is grown in bulk, and                  its fusion protein used to affinity purify a monospecifc activity               from that serum.  At the same time he will generate and                         characterize monclonal antibodies against proteins of the growth                cone proper.  All of these reagents will be characterized as                    follows:  ability to block binding of growth cones to                           transfectants or other target cells; biochemical specificity in                 immunoprecipitations and Western blots; and immunohistochemical                 staining pattern.  Each monospecific reagent will thus allow him                to characterize a particular protein involved in growth                         cone-target binding.",
