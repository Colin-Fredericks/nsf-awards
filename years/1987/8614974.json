 "awd_abstract_narration": "A mathematical model of the transport of lighting energy in buildings in        the nonsteady state will be developed.  This model will then be                 implemented as a system of computer programs that can be used to study          the dynamic effects of lighting systems on building thermal and luminous        enmvironments.  In particular, these programs will allow study of               complex interactions among lamp fixtures, ballasts, ventilation system,         furnishings, and elements of the room enclosure accounting for combined         modes of radiative, convective and conductive heat transfer.  The               programs will also allow study of illumination produced at various              points in the room, including effects of lamp temperature on luminous           output.                                                                                                                                                         This work will be done in conjunction with ongoing research projects at         the National Bureau of Standard (NBS) and at the Lawrence Berkeley              Laboratory (LBL).  The NBS project is experimental in nature, employing         a full-scale test room.  The computer models developed in the work              proposed here will be validated using the NBS experimental results, and         used to extend the experimental findings to a wider class of buildings          and lighting systems.  The LBL project endeavors ot create a software           Kernel System for generalized building simulation models.  The work             proposed herein will serve as a test case for the LBL system by                 implementing the lighting system models using elements of the prototype         Kernel System, as well as with conventional programming techniques.                                                                                             The significance of this work is its potential impact on the energy             usage by the heating, air-conditioning and lighting systems in                  buildings, while maintaining the quality of living conditions and the           work environment.  This potential will be realized through modifications        to present design practices made possible by expected results of this           work.",
