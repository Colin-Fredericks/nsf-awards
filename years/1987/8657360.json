 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Vogel will conduct a research program with this Presidential                Young Investigator award which will focus on the application of                 millimeter and centimeter wavelength astronomy techniques to the                study of the interstellar medium and star formation.  Three areas               will be emphasized: the protostellar collapse phase, the                        evolution of ultracompact HII regions, and star formation in                    nearby spiral galaxies.                                                                                                                                         Conclusive evidence for the collapse of an interstellar molecular               cloud to make a star has been extremely difficult to obtain.  One               problem has been that the characteristic signatures of collapse                 become evident only on the smallest spatial scales, which makes                 high angular resolution observations essential.  Another problem                is that other gas motions such as outflow occur as the collapse                 continues.  Dr. Vogel will concentrate on a sample of objects                   which do not show evidence of masking gas motions, and he will                  use newly available observational facilities and techniques in an               attempt to obtain the elusive direct evidence of a cloud                        collapsing to form a star.",
