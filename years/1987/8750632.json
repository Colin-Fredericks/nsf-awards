 "awd_abstract_narration": "This equipment is providing the Biology Department with the ability to          isolate DNA and RNA through ultracentrifugation.  The microfuges are            being used for the easy manipulation of small volumes (10-200 ul) of RNA        and DNA.  Protein purification experiments and isozyme studies are being        done in Cell Biology and in Plant Physiology using slab gel                     electrophoresis techniques which make cross sample comparisons easier           than with tube gel electrophoretic systems.  By working in the                  laboratory with DNA, RNA, and protein, the students gain hands on               experience and greater insight into the major conceptual underpinnings          of molecular biology and molecular genetics.  In addition to its                applications in six upper division courses, the equipment will support a        newly instituted Honors Program in Biology.",
