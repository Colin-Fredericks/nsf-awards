 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extracellular ATP is a potential neurotransmitter.  It                     activates many types of cells, but its mechanism is unknown.  Dr.               Talamo has found that extracellular MgATP elevates cytoplasmic                  calcium levels in rat parotid cells through a novel mechanism.                  In the proposed studies, she will compare ATP and muscarinic                    effects to study how calcium levels and ion secretion are                       regulated.  Her preliminary evidence indicates that ATP may not                 act through inositol-phosphate intermediates, and that ATP and                  muscarinic agonists regulate calcium and Na flux through                        different routes.                                                                                                                                                    To evaluate the role of phospholipase C activation in                      elevating cytoplasmic calcium levels, she will quantitate the                   time course of formation of (3H)-inositol phosphate metabolites                 and diglyceride for ATP and carbachol.  Using the intracellular                 fluorescent indicator quin2 to monitor intracellular Ca++, and                  radiotracer ions to measure ion flux, she will explore the                      requirement for extracellular calcium and elevated intracellular                calcium to activate Na, K and Cl transport.                                                                                                                          These studies will advance our knowledge of how ATP may                    activate many different types of cells, and will be integrated                  with electrophysiological studies utilizing patch clamp                         technology to develop a model for the mechanism of ion and fluid                secretion in epithelial cells.",
