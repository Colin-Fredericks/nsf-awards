 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for the Manufacturing Studies Board of the             National Academy of Sciences to establish a committee to conduct a              study to examine the causes and consequences of the strategic                   responses by manufacturing firms to increasing international                    competition.  Such strategies include foreign direct investment,                outsourcing, joint ventures with foreign firms, licensing                       agreements, direct investment by foreign companies in the United                States, and cooperative R&D agreements. The committee will comprise             approximately 25 members who have expertise in general                          manufacturing, international operations, marketing, labor relations,            engineering, research, and finance.                                                     This study should provide a comprehensive evaluation of the             motivations for and consequences of the strategies used by U.S.                 manufacturers to remain competitive in the international                        marketplace.  The committee plans to identify trends in the                     international manufacturing environment in terms of factors such as             comparative labor and capital costs, R&D expenditures, and the                  state, availability, and utilization of advanced manufacturing                  technologies.  The study should determine why corporate managers are            choosing different responses to international competition, identify             the effects of government policies on their decisions, examine how              such decisions may affect the long-term ability of U.S.                         manufacturers to conduct advanced R&D to innovate and compete                   effectively, and assess the long-term repercussions of these various            strategies on continued U.S. economic, technical, and military                  strength.                                                                               Phase I will develop and test the methodology in the domestic           arena (involves 3-4 companies and a couple of industries).  Phase II            will expand the investigation to include additional firms and                   industries in the domestic arena (involves up to 20 companies and 5-            6 industries).  Phase III will be conducted if additional funds                 become available from other sources.  Phase III, if conducted, would            compare the pressures and responses of domestic manufacturers to                selected foreign counterparts (would involve up to 20 domestic                  companies, 5-6 domestic industries; up to 20 foreign companies and              5-6 foreign industries; Japan and Europe).",
