 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are many unanswered questions concerning the evolution and ecology        of aggressive behavior in animals.  It is, for example, unclear why the         members of one species may be typically highly aggressive while those of        a closely related species are relatively passive.  Similarly, within a          species or even among littermates, some individuals are frequently much         more aggressive than others.  These experiments will explore the causes,        development, and function of species and individual differences in what         is perhaps the most critical (and unstudied) aspect of animal                   aggression--defensive attacks directed by animals at predators.                                                                                                 The experiments will be conducted using several species of newborn              garter snakes.  These animals are excellent for the investigation of            defensive strategies in animals.  They have large litters and newborns          can be tested from the day of birth which allows for the study of the           influence of heredity on behavior.  They are also, like many newborn            animals, preyed upon by a wide variety of predators from the moment they        are born.  In this project, the development of antipredator behaviors,          particularly defensive attacks, will be studied in several species which        are known to differ in characteristic levels of aggressiveness.  In             addition, the stimuli which cause inexperienced newborn animals to              attack will be explored.  Finally, the function of species and                  individual differences in defensive tactics will be assessed.  In               summary, this research will shed light on the significance of individual        differences in behavior and on the factors that generate such                   differences.",
