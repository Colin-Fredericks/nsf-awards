In sociological                       theory, crowding (or density) has also been thought to be                       associated with adverse social consequences. However, among                     humans, studies of crowding in the United States and in Canada                  have produced inconsistent results.                                                                                                                             Different study results may be due to the fact that crowding in                 North America tends to vary only from low to moderate when                      viewed in global terms. Perhaps there is a crowding \"threshold;\"                that is, some number of persons per household above which the                   adverse effects of crowding may be observed. Bangkok, Thailand                  is a highly appropriate site in which to conduct this type of                   research because of the extreme rates of crowding found in some                 Thai communities.                                                                                                                                               This study brings together American and Cambodian research                      teams. Their survey, in metropolitan Bankok, will assess whether                a greater density of persons in households is associated with                   more stress related physical illnesses (e.g. hypertension,                      angina) and greater tension between spouses and between parents                 and children. The investigators' crowding--stress model will be                 assessed with Lisrel analysis.",
