 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parallel Processing has been widely used in image                       processing.  A number of parallel architectures such as cellular                arrays, memory augmented arrays, and pyramids have been proposed                for these tasks.  In the past, many problems in low- and medium-                level vision have been solved on these architectures.  This                     research will explore parallel architectures for a range of                     problems in computer vision and develop efficient parallel                      algorithms for them.  As part of the research, several novel VLSI               arrays including arrays with efficient global communication                     features, arrays with reduced processing requirements, as well as               reconfigurable VLSI arrays will be developed.  While these                      architectures are also suitable for many other problems, they                   seem to be particularly well-suited for vision applications due                 to inherent properties of problems in low-level vision.  This                   research will also investigate parallel algorithms for medium-and               high-level vision problems.  Finally, the use of information                    theoretic techniques to study the interprocessor communication                  requirements and inherent parallel complexity of solving several                fundamental problems in vision will be investigated.",
