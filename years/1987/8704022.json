 "awd_abstract_narration": "Isolation of a Receptor for a Fungal-Wall-Derived Elicitor              of Phytoalexins:  The long term goal of the research described                  in this proposal is the isolation and characterization of a                     hepta-B-glucoside receptor from soybean tissue.  Fungal-derived                 B-glucans of the type from which the hepta-B-glucoside was                      isolated are active as inducers or enhancers of a variety of                    defense mechanisms in both plants and animals.  No receptor for                 oligosaccharide(s) of this type has been isolated from any                      source.  The only biologically active B-glucan fragment that                    has been purified to homogeneity and structurally characterized                 is a hepta-B-glucoside that is active at nanomolar                              concentrations in stimulating phytoalexin (antibiotic)                          accumulation in soybean tissue.  The specific goals for the                     initial period of funding are to identify the most suitable                     soybean tissue from which to isolate the receptor for the                       active hepta-B-glucoside elicitor, to prepare various                           derivatives of the hepta-B-glucoside elicitor and to compare                    their biological activity with that of the native elicitor.                     These derivatives will be used to prepare (i) radiolabeled                      elicitor for ligand-binding studies, (ii) photo-affinity                        labeling reagents for receptor localization and identification                  studies, and (iii) affinity chromatography matrices for                         receptor purification.  Time permitting, the elicitor                           derivatives will be used to initiate studies to identify                        putative receptors in plant extracts.                                                                                                                                   Phytoalexin accumulation is believed to play an important               role in plant disease resistance and also is an excellent model                 system for studying the regulation of gene expression in                        plants.  Purification of the hepta-B-glucoside receptor is                      necessary before studies can be undertaken to identify the role                 the receptor(s) play in the signal pathway that results in                      altered gene expression leading to phytoalexin accumulation in                  affected plant cells.  The research should increase our                         understanding of how plants perceive invasive microorganisms and                how the recognition leads to activation of specific plant                       defenses.",
