 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of investigators in chemical and biological                    oceanography are using benthic flux chambers to measure chemical                fluxes across the sediment-water interface.  Flux chamber                       measurements are expected to be a major component of the Global                 Ocean Flux Program during the next decade.  Placing a flux                      chamber on the sea floor may in itself alter the flux of                        dissolved species into, or out of, the sediments.  Transport                    through the boundary layer lying just above the sediment-water                  interface represents a significant impedance to chemical fluxes                 in certain cases.  Benthic chambers can provide accurate                        measurements of chemical fluxes occurring on the unperturbed sea                floor only if transfer coefficients through the boundary layer                  are known, both inside and outside the chamber.                                         This grant provides funds to improve the reliability of a               benthic lander, a device to place experimental devices on the                   seafloor, and also to develop a method for measuring transfer                   coefficients both within and outside of an experimental chambers.                       In two years, upon completion of this work, a simple,                   reliable, and relatively inexpensive system capable of measuring                boundary layer transfer coefficients (previously referred to as                 boundary layer film thickness) at a large number of sites will be               available.                                                                              The system will be made available on a collaborative basis              to other investigators involved in benthic studies.",
