Those to be invited will be           scientists who have been active in various aspects of regeneration              research during the past few years.  Their presence will insure an              exchange of ideas between European, Third Workd and North American              scientists, post-doctoral associates, and graduate students who are             presently active in regeneration research.  This exchange is expected to        lead to new approaches and collaborataive research efforts.                                                                                                     There is a great deal of research activity abroad in this field and in          the past meetings have been either American national meeting or European        meetings.  The organizers hope by breaking this pattern to encourage            more productive interchange and collaboration between these communities         of scientits with resulting benefits for the field.",
