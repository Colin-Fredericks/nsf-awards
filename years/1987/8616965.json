 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this research is to understand the cellular               mechanisms that establish the topographically organized regions                 of the vertebrate brain.  Topographic organization involves                     spatial and temporal patterns of neuroblast and axon migration.                 A search for the molecules that might be involved in these                      processes, using immunofluorescent screens on rat embryo neural                 tissue and antibodies raised against fetal rat retina, has                      resulted in the identification of a ganglioside antigen                         recognized by a monoclonal antibody (Jones).  The developmental                 profile of Jones binding suggests that, in the fetal and neonate                brain, the Jones ganglioside is associated with the selective                   migration of populations of cells and cell processes.                                                                                                           If the Jones antigen is involved in the differential control of                 cell and axon motility, a preferential distribution of this                     molecule on growth cones and/or on the substrate they contact                   would be expected.  Dr. Constantine Paton will test this                        hypothesis by applying electron microscope (EM)                                 immunocytochemical analyses to pseudopodial and filopodial                      contacts of cultured cells.  The results obtained from these                    ultrastructural localization studies will increase our                          understanding of early brain morphogenesis.  In addition, since                 gangliosides have been implicated in many processes of neural                   growth and repair, this study may contribute to the general                     understanding of regenerative ability in the central nervous                    system.",
