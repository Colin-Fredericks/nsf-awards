 "awd_abstract_narration": "A theory of organizing and role enactment during the emergency period of        disaster will be refined and field tested over a two-year period in this        project.  Organizing has been observed in earlier work by the principal         investigator as interrelationships among four core elements:  domains,          tasks, human and material resources, and activities.  The four elements         have proved to be useful for describing how organization is improvised          in communities threatened by earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and               tornadoes. The data bases will be archival data on earlier disasters and        primary data on two disaster events collected during the current                project.  The findings will yield principles of emergency management            that are both historically based and contemporary.",
