 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of Julia R. Weertman of                   Northwestern University in a program of joint research with Jose G.             Cabanas of the Instituto Polytecnico Nacional of Mexico with the goal           of improving our understanding of fatigue in metals and alloys.  The            experience of the Northwestern University research group in the study           of micro-damage at grain boundaries, in the growth of bicrystalline             materials for these studies, and in techniques for high-temperature             fatiguing, will be combined with the experience at the Mexican                  institution in scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Single            or bicrystalline copper will be grown, cut in predetermined                     orientations, and fatigued, at Northwestern.  Selected-area                     channeling studies using a scanning electron microscope, and other              analyses using transmission electron microscopy, will be performed at           the Instituto Polytecnico Nacional to study the interdependence in              fatigued material of grain boundary migration and sliding,                      cavitation, and dislocation structure in the region near where                  cavitation occurs.  From these measurements light should be thrown on           the relationship between cavities and dislocation structure, on the             migration of grain boundaries, and the dynamics of void growth.                                                                                                 Fatigue in metals and alloys, and the relationship of fatigue failure           to microscopic voids and other defects in materials particularly as             they occur at grain boundaries, are of increasing importance as more            is asked of modern materials.  In order to facilitate the performance           of controlled experiments on grain-boundary effects, \"model grain               boundaries\" which are isolated from properly oriented bicrystals, may           be used.  After fatiguing under controlled conditions, scanning                 electron microscopy channeling studies of crystalline orientation and           perfection and transmission electron microscope investigation of the            boundaries themselves can give an indication of the motion of grain             boundaries and the relationship of this motion to micro-defects                 related to the fatigue.  The Northwestern University principal                  investigator is an expert in the growth and orientation of such                 bicrystals while the Mexican collaborator has complementary expertise           in specialized electron microscopy.  This research should help answer           certain fundamental questions regarding intergranular damage produced           by high-temperature fatigue, and thereby contribute to the                      development of materials suitable for high-stress use in                        high-temperature environments.",
