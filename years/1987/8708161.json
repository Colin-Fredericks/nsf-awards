 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the most interesting new organometallic compounds to be                   synthesized in the last several years are the compounds of the                  metal samarium which are the under study in this research                       project. These compounds are very powerful reagents for the                     addition of electrons to other molecules, rivalling the very                    reactive metal sodium in their ability to so, but having the                    advantage over sodium of being soluble in a variety of organic                  solvents. The Principal Investigator has used these samarium                    compounds to bring about a wide variety of unusual                              transformations of small molecules, and these reagents are                      expected to be valuable in the development of new syntheses of                  complex organic molecules.                                                                                                                                      The objectives of this investigation are (1) to define fully                    the reactivity of organometallic Sm(II) complexes and (2) to                    exploit this reactivity in (a) unusual transformations of small                 molecules, (b) new syntheses of complex organic molecules,                      (c) the development of unusual inorganic materials, and (d) the                 enhancement of understanding of organometallic chemistry in                     general. These objectives will be accomplished by studying in                   detail the activation of CO, alkynes, RN=NR, and isonitriles by                 the bis-THF adduct of bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienide)-                        samarium(II); by also exploring how this reagent activates                      nitriles, imides, NO and carbon dioxide; by investigating the                   unusual bent structure of bis-(Cp*)Sm(II) with appropriate                      reactivity studies; by contrasting the chemistry of                             bis-(Cp*)Sm(II) and of its bis-THF adduct; by investigating the                 reactivity of organosamarium(II) complexes with inorganic                       substrates; and by exploring new types of Ln(II) species.",
