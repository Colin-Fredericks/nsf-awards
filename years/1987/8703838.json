 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will describe the knowledge and uses of medical plants by         the Mayan peoples of the highlands of Chiapas, Mexico.  The long-term           objectives of the research are to produce a detailed comparative                inventory of those plant species deemed to have medicinal value by the          indigenous Tzeltal and Tzotzil peoples of the highland region, and              identify those species that merit chemical evaluation because of their          potentially beneficial properties; to identify and describe in Western          bio-medical terms the folk syndromes of illness for which medicinal             plants are employed in recognized folk remedies; to develop textual,            audio- and video-taped recordings of the preparation and administration         of plant-derived medications for the recognized native categories of            affliction and disease; and to publish a multilingual, illustrated atlas        and ethnomedical encyclopedia in English, Spanish, Tzeltal and Tzotzil          that compares regional variation in ethnobotanical knowledge and uses of        medicinal plants as reflected in the differential distribution of plant         species, ethnomedical and ethnobotanical nomenclature, type of                  affliction treated, and methods of preparation and application.                                                                                                 The research will be conducted with the active collaboration of state           and local representatives of the Chiapas Public Health Service.  The            results of this broad study will serve to codify the significance of            traditional medical knowledge for both indigenous and non-native peoples        at a time when the loss of this knowledge is seriously threatened by            rapid economic and social change. This type of research is important            because the analysis of specific folk systems of nature helps us to             understand knowlege systems in general.",
