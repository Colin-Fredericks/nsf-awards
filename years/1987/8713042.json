 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support theoretical research in 3 areas, -                      The solar magnetic field is continuously regenerated and                   reconfigured by a hydromagnetic dynamo in the solar interior.                   The field emerges at the surface in the form of thin flux ropes                 and active regions.  The strength and topology of the interior                  field are not directly observable; neither is the depth at which                it fragments into flux tubes.  However, by computing the effect                 of the field on the acoustic oscillation frequencies it is                      possible to use helioseismology to constrain the properties of                  the interior field.                                                                  The magnetic field emerges from the photosphere and plays a                dominant role in the structure and energetics of the solar                      corona.  Energy is stored in the field by photospheric motions;                 these motions may cause current sheets to develop.  Dissipation                 of these current sheets can heat the corona in a patchy or                      episodic fashion which is masked by low resolution observations.                Energy stored in the field can also be released by                              magnetohydrodynamic instabilities.                                                   The magnetic field also plays a role in the origin and                     propagation of shock waves in the corona and heliosphere.  Shocks               can accelerate particles; the resulting nonthermal particle                     distribution can be unstable to the growth of waves, which modify               the upstream medium so that the shock evolves.  These ideas may                 explain observed evolution of shocks in the solar wind.                              All of the above is very relevant to solar terrestrial                     relations; the origin of the magnetic field, the heating of the                 corona and the propagation of the shocks all have impact on the                 terrestrial environment.",
