 "awd_abstract_narration": "Regulation of the frequency of transcription initiation from                    promoters recognized by eukaryotic RNAase II plays a major                      role in changing the pattern of gene expression during                          development and differentiation.  Very little is known about                    the mechanism(s) of this regulation, or, indeed, about the                      basic mechanism of transcription initiation upon which                          regulation is imposed.  The goal here is to dissect                             transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II into different                    mechanistic steps, to identify the proteins and DNA sequences                   that contribute to each step, and to test the generality of                     the mechanisms among various class II promoters with the hope                   of understanding which of these steps are targets of                            regulation and how is this regulation accomplished.  Four                       protein factors have been partially purified that are                           required in addition to RNA polymerase II for reconstitution                    transcription in vivo.  Their apparent roles suggest that a                     multi-protein complex assembles at the promoter prior to                        transcription initiation.  This can be investigated in this                     system.  Dr. Hawley has worked with both prokaryotic and                        eukaryotic RNA polymerase during her training and brings a real                 expertise to the field.  This project takes a very high priority                                                                                                for funding.",
