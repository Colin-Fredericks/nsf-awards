 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposed joint research effort among three institutions:              Hughes Research Laboratory (HRL, James G. Nash), University of Southern         California (USC, S.Y. Kung), and the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn,         Richard P. Paul).  This effort is to develop a special-purpose                  systolic-array computer for use in a robotics environment.  Each of the         three parties has special talents with regard to this proposed                  research:  HRL is concerned with the architecture and algorithms for            matrix-based linear algebraic computers; the research at USC is aimed           at mapping problems into arrays; and UPenn specializes in robot                 manipulator control problems.  The purposes of this effort are to               interface a high-performance systolic-array processor to a robot                manipulator, to re-evaluate and improve on the design of the processor,         to develop new parallel algorithms for such machines, to develop and            evaluate various appropriate kinematic control algorithms, and to               develop algorithms for projecting problems onto machines of this type.          In the opinion of the program director, these are three first-class             researchers who propose research on an experimental system that may             significantly impact the robotics control area.  Funding with the               revised budgets and added conditions in the attached documents is               strongly recommended.",
