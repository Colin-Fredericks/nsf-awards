 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ultimate objective of this research is to obtain insight into           the mechanisms concerned in the activation of the egg during                    fertilization.  Emphasis will be on investigating how membrane potential        changes as signals are transduced into intracellular processes following        sperm attachment.  Electrophysiological measurements on voltage clamped         eggs will be combined with video digital image processing to correlate          electrical events with (a) morphological changes in the living cell             difficult otherwise to resolve, (b) the occurrence of cortical actin            filament assembly using fluorescently labeled actin or phallicidin, and         (c) changes in intracellular \u0131Ca2+! and pH and the localization of these        changes using fluorescent indicators and image ratioing methods.                Investigation of the mechanism whereby membrane potentials in the               neighborhood of resting (-70mV) suppress sperm entry (although                  activation proceeds) will be pursued.  The possibility that the                 suppression of sperm entry is the consequence of an effect of negative          membrane potential on assembly of actin filaments will be investigated.             Dr. Chambers's laboratory has been active for many years in the             study of the physiology of sea urchin egg activation at fertilization.          The sea urchin egg is chosen in these studies because this egg (which           has about the same size and yolk content as the human egg) is                   transparent, large, readily available in large numbers and withstands           laboratory manipulations.  In a more general context, the research is           directed toward understanding the mechanisms whereby a quiescent cell,          at rest, is activated to undergo mitosis, cell division and growth.",
