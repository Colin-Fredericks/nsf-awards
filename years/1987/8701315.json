 "awd_abstract_narration": "The application of base isolation systems to structures provides an             excellent alternative for seismic protection.  Many base isolation              systems are available but an economic and effective system has not been         developed for residential structures.                                                                                                                           The purpose of the proposed research is to identify and evaluate the            physical characteristics that are required to make a \"sand-joint\"               isolation scheme effective and practicable for a seismic design of              masonry dwellings.  The basic idea of the sand-joint is to form a               relatively weak frictional plane at the base of a masonry wall by               separating the wall from the foundation with a thin layer of sand.  This        joint isolates the structure from strong ground motion in much the same         manner as do more sophisticated base isolation mechanisms currently             being implemented in larger structures.  Although the                           sand-joint approach already has been introduced in the Peoples Republic         of China (PRC) on a very limited basis, the optimal characteristics of          this mechanism have not yet been determined.",
