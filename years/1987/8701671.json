 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with improving the performance of                    asynchronous algorithms.  These algorithms involve a number of                  independent activities which generally access common data.  Activities          must synchronize with one another to insure that data is kept                   consistent.  Unfortunately, synchronization impairs performance.  The           overall goal of the research is to develop techniques for reducing              synchronization requirements.                                                                                                                                   Much of the research will be concerned with concurrency control in              database systems and will focus on optimistic algorithms. Such                  algorithms are based on the assumption that synchronization is rarely           needed.  They allow activities to execute in an asynchronous fashion            and rely on rollback if situations are detected in which activities             should have synchronized.  Thus, rollback is the major cost and one             goal of the proposed research is to develop techniques for reducing the         probability of its occurence.  These include the use of semantic                information about activities, the use of special techniques for                 handling heavily accessed regions of the data (hotspots), and the use           of information that can be gathered about an activity when it is                formulated as a Prolog program.                                                                                                                                 The application of optimistic algorithms to replicated databases is             another area of interest.  Such databases have been proposed to                 improved the availability of data in failure situations and can also            serve to enhance performance.                                                                                                                                   Finally, research will be done on strategies for performing non-atomic          updates on certain shared data structures.  The goal is to guarantee            that readers, which execute asynchronously, always function correctly.",
