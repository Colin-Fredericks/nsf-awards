 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is a novel attempt to develop a better understanding of             hepatic solute transport processes at the anatomic sites where it               occurs.  This has not been attempted previously.  The liver is unique           in the body since the vascular wall of the capillaries is perforated,           thereby permitting intimate contact between solutes in the bloodstream          and the hepatocyte cell membrane.  The specific objective is to develop         an electro-optical method to experimentally quantify solute transport           and uptake at this hepatocyte-blood interface.  Such information is not         presently available due to the complexity of the experiments involved           and the three-dimensional structure of the liver.  Most of the                  theoretical models presently available are developed using whole-organ          experiments that require assumptions about the rates of uptake at the           cellular level.  The overall goal of this work is not to eliminate the          use of black-box experiments, but rather, to test the assumptions made          and to complement the data obtained on solute extraction using these            models.",
