 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design and maintenance of structures requires the help of sensor            technology to measure the parameters that control their integrity.              Although important advances have been made in the area of sensors,              measurements are limited to point determination or to two dimensional           geometries.                                                                                                                                                     A very successful approach to integrate optical techniques that measure         structural properties and current computer technology has been carried          out.  The developed techniques yield full field analysis and have been          applied to important technical problems.  However these methods are             limited to two dimensional geometries.  A very important step in their          application to in-service structures is to add three dimensional                capabilities.                                                                                                                                                   In the proposed work the experience so far accumulated in this area will        be utilized:                                                                                                                                                         a.  to develop 3-D techniques to measure displacements and strains                  in structures;                                                              b.  to achieve real time or quasi-real time operation;                          c.  to apply these developments to structures.                                                                                                             These new technologies will have considerable potential in increasing           the range of application of optical techniques to include monitoring the        integrity of in-service structures.  In addition structures and their           components may be analyzed in testing stands under load representative          of the service conditions.                                                                                                                                      Results of the successfully completed research are likely to stimulate          engineering research activities by reducing drastically time required to        evaluate experimental data and to test their reliability, and by                enabling the researcher to pay more attention to underlying theoretical         issues.",
