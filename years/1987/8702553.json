 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI has previously developed a cubic systolic array for matrix               multiplication.  Answers are now being sought for the following pair of         questions concerning such arrays:  Can they be used in conjunction with         a general purpose processor to create a \"matrix computer\" in the same           way that a \"vector processor\" is used in a \"vector computer\"?  Could            such a computer be used to efficiently solve various other linear               algebra problems?  Cubic systolic arrays allow matrix multiplication in         time sublinear in the matrix size.  Designs are sought for further              systolic devices that will solve further algebra problems in time               sublinear in the matrix size. This research is directed toward                  adaptation of known parallel solutions of computational problems for            efficient execution on more readily implementable parallel computers.           The significance of this research is in the additional insight it is            expected to provide into aspects of parallel computation.",
