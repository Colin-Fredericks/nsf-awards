 "awd_abstract_narration": "Exsymbiotic, Chlorella-like eukaryotic green algae act as                  hosts for a group of large double-stranded DNA-containing                       viruses.  The algae can be readily cultured in the presence of                  light.  The viruses synchronously infect, rapidly replicate, and                ultimately lyse their algal host.  As a result of the development               of a plaque assay, this is the first and, thus far, only example                of a plant-virus system which lends itself to investigation using               established technology adapted from bacteriophage studies.  An                  additional benefit of this system is that the viral-algal lysate                is a rich source of cell wall degrading enzyme activity which can               be used to produce protoplasts into which recombinant DNA may be                introduced.                                                                          The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an algal                   transformation system.  Toward this end, it is proposed to:  (1)                develop a protoplast regeneration system for this alga; (2)                     search for DNA sequences from either the virus or the host which                will confer autonomous replication of plasmids in this alga; (3)                determine the intracellular sites of viral DNA replication; (4)                 study viral DNA for clues as to the regulation of viral gene                    expression; (5) study vectors containing reporter molecules, to                 measure transient expression; and (6) construct vectors with                    selectable markers.  Success in these goals will allow the                      characterization and exploitation of this interesting algal                     system, and will have significant impact on plant genetics and                  cell biology.",
