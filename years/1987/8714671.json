 "awd_abstract_narration": "Late Cenozoic marine deposits blanketing terraces and coastal                   plains in western and northern Alaska provide an exceptionally                  detailed record of high sea level events, the most complete known               in any part of the Arctic.  Interbedded with glacial drift                      sequences, these deposits contain an invaluable almanac of Arctic               paleoclimates, and establish the time of origin and much of the                 subsequent history of the Arctic Ocean ice cover.  Fossils in the               late Cenozoic marine deposits also record both marine and                       continental dispersal events and thus supplement and interoceanic               correlations.                                                                                                                                                   This investigation will apply amino-acid geochronology,                         thermoluminescence, and paleomagnetic studies to marine                         transgressive deposits exposed on St. Lawrence Island, Seward                   Peninsula, and around Kotzebue Sound in order to evaluate and                   correct previously published age correlations.  The study will                  thus result in a much firmer knowledge of the extent and timing of              sea-level changes in western and northern Alaska and will provide               an extremely useful series of time planes for the development of                synoptic knowledge of Arctic paleoclimates and paleo-oceanographic              regimes.",
