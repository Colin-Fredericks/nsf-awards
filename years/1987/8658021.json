 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research of this Presidential Young Investigator has two               goals.  The first goal is to create software techniques to estimate             automatically manufacturing costs based on a part description stored            in a computer-aided design (CAD) system as a solid model.                       Manufacturing costs are a function of the machining process, and, in            turn, the machining process is a function of the features of a part.            The proposed cost estimator consists of two modules: a feature                  recognizer and a feature interpreter.  The recognizer acts on a                 solid model boundary representation to extract form features.  The              interpreter uses the features in selecting manufacturing processes              and determining processing costs.  In addition to the clear benefit             of being able to estimate costs during the design process, the                  estimator will help determine a useful set of form features for                 manufacturing in general.                                                            The second goal is to develop a feature language that can be               used to describe features in terms of geometric and topological                 primitives such as faces, edges, vertices, and vertex-edge loops.               The use of feature in CAD is in its infancy, primarily because no               complete taxonomy has been developed.  The taxonomy depends on the              capability to sort features based upon certain characteristics.  A              feature language with a well-formed grammar would allow unambiguous             definitions to be written for various classes of features.                      Candidate language constructs include syntactic pattern grammars and            graph grammars.                                                                      The results of this research will yield a compendium of                    features together with an organized and mathematical way to define              and store them.  This advances will aid those involved in both                  feature recognition and feature-based design.",
