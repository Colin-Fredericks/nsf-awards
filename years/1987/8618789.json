 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is in support of continued study of sediment                    deposition processes in Glacier Bay, Alaska, near the termini of                tidewater glaciers (It is a companion proposal to DPP-8619153,                  submitted by Dr. Ross Powell).  During the past two years these                 processes have been investigated near the termini of Riggs and                  McBride Glaciers.  The study will now be extended to:  (1) McMuir               Glacier, a tidewater glacier similar to McBride but fronting a                  less restricted basin, where the distribution and origin of fine                laminated sediments as well as sedimentation raters versus                      distance from the glacier will be investigated; (2) Wachusett                   Basin, a restricted basin, a restricted basin fronting Carroll                  Glacier where the production and distribution of bergstone                      diamicton (a sediment type) will be studied, and (3) Wachusett                  Delta, where hypotheses developed from the study of Riggs glacier               regarding sediment storage and release will be tested.  A field                 laboratory will permit rapid on-site processing of water and                    sediment traps samples.                                                              An understanding of modern glaciomarine sedimentation is                   essential for interpretation of deposits left by the Pleistocene                ice sheets, which are now recognized to have been extensively                   grounded below sea level.  Dr. Norman Smith and his colleague Dr.               Ross Powell are well-known for their work on this problem in                    Glacier Bay.",
