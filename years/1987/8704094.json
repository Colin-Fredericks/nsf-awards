 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Robert Kelly  will conduct one season of archaeological                     fieldwork in the Carson Sink region of western Nevada. Because of               heavy rains in this area in recent years major runoff has                       occurred and this has exposed an archaeological treasure trove of               buried houses as well as cultural materials and human skeletal                  remains. Because these sites will be subjected to further erosion               and possible looting it is important that archaeological research               be begun as quickly as possible. Dr. Kelly and his collaborators                will conduct a basic reconnaissance of sites and determine which                are the most promising for further large scale excavation. This                 will be determined by mapping site features, controlled surface                 grid collection, and test excavations of a sample of features.                  With this data it will be possible to develop a detailed                        excavation plan for future years.                                                                                                                               Occupation of the Carson Sink area began about 5000 B.P. and the                first villages appeared about 1500 B.P. Over most of that period                the region was marshy and the inhabitants presumably made use of                local resources. This project will provide the first thorough                   investigation of pithouse villages and of the origins of a                      sedentary, marsh-oriented economy. It will contribute to our                    understanding of the relationship between subsistence and hunter-               gatherer mobility and to an understanding of the sedentarization                process.                                                                                                                                                        This research is important for several reasons. It will increase                our understanding of how, over the long run, humans at a simple                 level of organization cope with shifting and unpredictable                      environments and thus shed light on the process of human                        adaptation. It will also rescue extremely important                             archaeological materials which otherwise would be lost.",
