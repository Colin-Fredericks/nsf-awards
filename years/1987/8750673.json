 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Life Sciences Department is requiring an independent research               project as a component of its curriculum for majors.  This Senior-year          project is involving students in research with a particular focus upon          Molecular Biology.  Powerful motivators, the projects provide students          an environment for developing modern laboratory skills and techniques           while pursuing a currently important biological question.  As a result,         these undergraduates better comprehend the essence of science while at          the same time they gain better preparation for entering careers based on        scientific processes.  Participants are being encouraged to communicate         the results of their research to their peers and to other scientists            through publication and/or oral presentation of their work.                                                                                                     The new equipment provided through this grant is being used for basic           work in Molecular Biology, including the purification and experimental          manipulation of nucleic acids.  The simplicity of many of the techniques        employed in Molecular Biology makes it feasible for undergraduates to           accomplish significant work if properly motivated and supervised.",
