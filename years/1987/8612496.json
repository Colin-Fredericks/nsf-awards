 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of Dr. David C. Spray and                 others of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in a program of               cooperative research with Dr. Antonio Campos de Carvalho of the                 Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in a project aimed at                      understanding the role of gap junctions in the heart ventricle in               maintaining normal cardiac function.  Gap junctions are a class of              membrane channels that uniquely span the membranes of adjacent cells            to form intercellular pathways for ions and uncharged molecules.  The           functional and biochemical properties of these junctions, and of the            ions which they transmit, may be of profound importance in                      understanding how muscle impulses are transmitted within the heart.                                                                                             The U.S. principal investigator has participated in pioneering work             on gap junctions between isolated pairs of ventricular myocytes, and            has also studied the electrical behavior of adult rat ventricular               myocytes and cell pairs.  He has also studied the properties of                 junctional proteins in liver tissue, thereby becoming expert in                 techniques that he will extend, in this research, to the study of               heart tissue.  The Brazilian collaborator has considerable experience           in the isolation of cardiac gap junctions, and also has experience in           cardiac tissue electro-physiology.  Complementary expertise will be             utilized as U.S. investigators perform electrophysiological                     experiments in Brazil, on gap junctions isolated there; and in a                subsequent visit by the Brazilian collaborators to the U.S., where              they will participate in biochemical studies.  By increasing our                understanding of the operation and function of these important                  components of the heart, more will be learned about the maintenance             of normal human cardiac function.",
