During the                  two year period beginning 1 July 1987, Professor Miller will                    pursue studies in U.S. and Japanese laboratories through which                  she will develop expertise in surface spectroscopy that will                    complement her already robust abilities in organic                              electrochemistry.  The new research expertise gained in this                    activity will enhance Professor Miller's present NSF-supported                  research program in organic electrosynthesis and should enable                  her to take new and unprecedented strides in the development of                 electroprepared organometallic materials as catalysts for highly                selective synthetic processes.  Support provided by the                         Foundation for this activity is leveraged through the University                of Minnesota's waiving of indirect costs on this grant.",
