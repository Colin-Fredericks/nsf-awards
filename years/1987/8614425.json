 "awd_abstract_narration": "Behavior is an important aspect of an organism's                        evolutionary history.  It dictates when and where mating will                   occur, if and how offspring will be nurtured, the types of food                 eaten, and the habitats lived in.  Can researchers use behavioral               characteristics to determine anything about the relationships                   between species?  Some researchers argue that the closely-related               species exhibit quite similar behaviors, while more distantly-                  related forms display radically different behaviors.  In this                   sense, behavior would be a good (though untested) tool for                      constructing phylogenies.  However, many other researchers state                that behavior would not be a good indicator of genealogical                     relationships because it is plastic, labile, and easily modified.               There have been many instances of behavioral modifications                      between species that have, for example, led to speciation.                              The proposed study will evaluate the phylogenetic content of            behavioral data by comparing nuptial and agonistic behaviors                    exhibited by a group of African fishes against a more traditional               phylogeny generated for these fishes from anatomical                            characteristics.  These fish were chosen for study because                      numerous prior studies have been based upon them, and because of                the rich repertoire of behaviors these fishes display.  The                     results of the research will be of considerable interest to                     behavioralists, systematists, evolutionary biologists, and                      psychologists interested in the question of 'nature vs. nurture.'",
