 "awd_abstract_narration": "Analyses of paleomagnetic data generally assume that the                earth's magnetic field, when averaged over several thousand                     years, conforms to that of a geocentric axial dipole.                           Nevertheless, long-term non-dipolar components have been found to               be important. In fact, recent analyses suggest that during the                  Cenozoic, multipolar field components have varied so as to                      produce alternating \"far-sided\" and \"near-sided\" effects of                     significant magnitude. Understanding the nature and magnitude of                these deviations from an axial dipole are important in plate                    tectonic reconstructions using paleomagnetic data, since such                   reconstructions generally assume that the deviations are small                  when compared to other uncertainties in the paleomagnetic data.                         The objective of the present recommended award is to                    assemble and compile the paleomagnetic data from a large number                 of piston core sites from the Pacific Ocean. These data were                    generated during a number of separate projects during the last                  fifteen years and form an ideal data set for examining both                     spatial and temporal aspects of the non-dipole field. Initial                   activity on this project will be to determine sediment ages using               a consistent stratigraphy for the cores.  Additionally,                         individual data points will be examined for both their                          consistency and potential source of error.  Once this task is                   completed, the nondipole field will be examined in several areas                of the Pacific Ocean basin.                                                             The principal investigator on this project is highly                    qualified to undertake the proposed study. Funding is highly                    recommended at $85,000 in FY87 for 18 months.",
