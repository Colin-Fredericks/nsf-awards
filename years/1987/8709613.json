 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study examines the social and technical dimensions of                    computerization in work groups where they are dominant                          elements of work life. The basic research question posed in                     the study is, \"How does worklife change (if at all) when                        computing is a pervasive and salient feature of work places                     and information handling?\" The study focuses on desktop                         computing, defined as computer-based services accessible                        through terminals or microcomputers near people's immediate                     work places.  This style of computing is the focus of most                      scenarios of offices of the future and is of tremendous                         practical and theoretical importance.                                             The study examines the use of desktop computing and changes                   in work life as they are experienced by a variety of white                      collar workers.   A longitudinal study of 25 work groups with                   substantial amounts of desktop computing over a period of                       three years will provide data to analyze characteristics of                     these groups (e.g., work organization, technology) in their                     organizational contexts, as well as individual jobs. The                        primary forms of data collection are a questionnaire                            administered to approximately 300 users at three points in                      time and interviews with a variety of users and resource                        controllers in those same work groups at the same point in                      time.                                                                             The study is the first systematic, empirically based, one                     on the subject and is significant for the contribution to                       theory about the role of computers in organizations and for                     the knowledge it can shed on the integration of desktop                         computing with human work in organizations.",
