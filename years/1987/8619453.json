 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past decade, scholars have turned their attention                 to examining the dynamics of decisionmaking in the criminal                     justice system.  Much of this work has focused on the courts and                important decisions surrounding sentencing and parole.  Of equal                importance are the decisions made by prosecuting attorneys in                   confronting whether to issue warrants, file charges, or plea                    bargain a case.  While studies exist on prosecutors' behavior,                  research to date has typically concentrated either on individual                decisonmaking or on the organizational context of the court.                    Attempts to merge the two have not been very successful due in                  part to a lack of consideration of appropriate organizational and               cognitive models.                                                                    Dr. Rauma seeks to integrate individual and organizational                 perspectives by investigating prosecutors' use of schemas, or                   cognitive models, in their processing of criminal cases.  It is                 hypothesized that these schemas are derived primarily from the                  organizational context in which prosecutors work.  The basic                    design calls for a two-step data collection:  Phase one consists                of in-depth interviews, systematic observation, and archival data               drawn from approximately 1500 case files.  The Phase two data                   collection is based on a computer-assisted interview of                         prosecutors who will respond to case vignettes on a sample of                   real cases.  The computer will record the variables that                        prosecutors select to make decisions, the order in which the                    variables are selected, and the time to do so, permitting                       analysis of sequential decisionmaking.                                               This research promises to advance our understanding of the                 influence of organizational factors on individual level                         decisionmaking in the criminal justice system.  The vignette                    analysis in particular tests for schema use with more complex                   situations and more formal procedures than in previous studies.                 Also, the use of vignettes for the study of sequential                          decisionmaking and information search is a new approach that may                be useful for other settings.",
