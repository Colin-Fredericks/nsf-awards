 "awd_abstract_narration": "In contrast to the elegant multiple-annulation procedures of                    carbocyclic chemistry, there have been few efforts to incorporate               similar strategies in the synthesis of natural products                         containing furan rings.  Dr. Jacobi has pioneered new highly                    compact syntheses of these latter materials which are important                 in certain medicinal compounds.                                                                                                                                 This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  will further develop the concept of bis-heteroannulation, in                    which fused ring furans are readily prepared with complete                      regiochemical control.  The key element of this approach involves               an intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction between an oxazole and an                acetylene.  This is currently being employed for the synthesis of               the guaiane sesquiterpene geigerin and the butenolide-alkaloid                  norsecurinine.                                                                                                                                                  In addition are described the direct conversion of either                       acetylenic alcohols or enones to methylenecyclopentenones or to                 phenols via tandem sigmatropic rearrangements.  These                           transformations are of considerable mechanistic interest and                    could be utilized in the synthesis of materials as diverse as the               acoranes, methyleneomycin antibiotics, hirsutanes and various                   naturally occurring phenols.  The syntheses of methyleneomycins B               and A, the antitumor agent sarkomycin, acorone, hirsutene and                   juncusol are planned as representative examples.",
