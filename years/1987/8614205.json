 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many engineering products, the shape of a design can                    have considerable affect on performance.  The performance of                    dams, transmission towers, fillets, aircraft, and automobiles                   are all affected by their geometric shape.  Shape optimal                       design can be applied to any structures for which a                             mathematical model exists.  The basic approach in shape optimal                 design is to choose a set of design variables that defines                      the shape of the structure.  Changes in the geometric structure                 can then be related via changes in the finite-element mesh to                   changes in the design variables.   The Principal Investigators                  propose to develop a new approach for shape optimization of                     structures.  The design variables will be represented as                        fictitious loads on the structure.  The displacements produced                  by these fictitious loads are added to the finite-element mesh                  to obtain a new shape.  This new approach is computationally                    superior to the standard approaches and allows the possibility                  of physical interpretation of optimality criteria for a class                   of problems.                                                                         This research is a joint research project with Ashok                       Belegundu at Pennsylvania State University who is being funded                  separately under grant DMC-8613438.",
