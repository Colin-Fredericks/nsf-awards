 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biology is upgrading its basic Animal Physiology              course with the acquisition of sophisticated, state-of-the-art                  equipment.  The new equipment includes such electrophysiological                instrumentation as microcomputers to interface with dual channel                oscilloscopes, pressure transducers, polygraphs, and accessory equipment        -- all of which have a wide range of applicability and flexibility.             Students taught on this new equipment will be prepared to enter the             upper level courses in the Department in such diverse subdisciplines as         Physiological Ecology, Endocrinology, Advanced Cellular Physiology and          Neurophysiology.  The high percentage of students who pursue graduate           education in Biomedical fields and the historically high demand for             training in Physiology indicate that this equipment is being used               productively.",
