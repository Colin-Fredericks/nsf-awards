 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this research is to understand the                     function of calcium channels.  Previous results have indicated                  that the selectivity of the channel for calcium is dependent upon               both channel diameter and a high affinity, calcium binding site                 within the channel.  These results formed the basis for a                       theoretical model which quantitatively describes the essential                  features of calcium channel selectivity of the vertebrate                       skeletal muscle calcium channel.  Current studies are directed                  toward understanding the phenomenon of calcium-induced                          inactivation of the calcium channel and toward comparing the                    voltage gating of calcium channels in skeletal and cardiac                      muscle.  Experiments are also planned to study the turnover of                  calcium channels in neuronal membranes using as a probe the                     channel binding protein, omega conotoxin.                                            Controlled entry of calcium into cells by way of calcium                   channels is a critical factor in control of skeletal muscle                     contraction and heart beat, in communication between nerve cells,               and in release of many hormones.  The results of this research                  will enhance our understanding of this important process.",
