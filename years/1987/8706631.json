 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bargaining is an essential element in the resolution of the                     conflict in many situations.  The situations range in importance                from a couple's decision to attend a ballet to the negotiations                 over nuclear disarmament.  In these situations, cooperative                     actions can result in gains to all involved but conflicts arise                 over the selection of a particular action because this choice                   determines the distribution of these gains.  Through implicit or                explicit bargaining, parties often reach mutually acceptable                    outcomes.  That these conflicts more often result in agreements                 rather than in deadlocks suggests that bargaining behavior is                   systematic.  Experimental evidence on bargaining problems also                  suggests that bargaining behavior is systematic.                                                                                                                This project continues to develop an original and very promising                way of modelling the systematic features of bargaining behavior.                The approach taken breaks each bargaining problem into a series                 of interrelated simple bargaining problems.  A multilateral                     solution to the bargaining problem is derived from solving each                 of the simple bargaining problems in a way that captures their                  interrelationship.  This is exciting research because only one                  of the traditional solution concepts for cooperative games has                  yielded significant insights into economic problems.  The                       development of a second useful solution concept for cooperative                 bargaining games would be a major contribution.                                                                                                                 The basic theory of multilateral bargaining was developed by the                investigator under her previous NSF award.  This award permits                  her to use multilateral bargaining to analyze bargaining                        equilibria for marriage markets with nontransferable utility and                two-sided matching markets, such as labor markets, where                        desirable matches may involve more than one participant on one                  side of the market.  She also plans to show that multilateral                   bargaining is consistent with rational behavior by proving that                 the multilateral bargaining solutions of noncooperative games                   coincide with the set of Nash equilibria outcomes.",
