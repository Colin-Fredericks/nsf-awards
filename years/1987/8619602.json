 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advanced secondary battery systems using a solvated electron                    electrode will be optimized.  The lithium electrode investigated                consisted of lithium initially dissolved in liquid ammonia to                   give either a \"solvated electron\" or \"bronze\" solution.                         Containment of this liquid negative active material from direct                 contact with a nonaqueous electrolyte present in the cell                       positive electrode compartment is addressed via the use of a                    lithium intercalated electronically conducting ceramic membrane                 of the general composition LixWO2 (0.1 < x < 1;0).  Secondary                   electrochemical cells having the general configuration:                                                                                                         Li,NH3/LixWO2/LiCF3SO3,PC/TiS2                                                  and                                                                             LiNH3/LixWO2/LiCF,CuC12,SO2,CH3CN/C                                                                                                                             were identified during Phase I which possessed respective open-                 circuit potentials of 2.5 and 3.4V, were electrochemically                      reversible and had theoretical energy densities of 454 and 929                  Wh/kg based upon 20 m/o lithium in liquid ammonia.                                                                                                              The high energy densities that can be predicted from batteries                  incorporating this novel lithium electrode together with their                  anticipated long cycle life, make them attractive candidates for                such varied applications as utility load leveling, electric                     vehicle propulsion and aerospace power sources.",
