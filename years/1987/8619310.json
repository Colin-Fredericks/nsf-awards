 "awd_abstract_narration": "Late-Quaternary paleoenvironments of southwestern Alaska have received          little study, and the relationship of past environmental changes in             this region to those in more-interior regions of Beringia is not yet            completely understood.  Analyses of fossil insect and pollen                    assemblages from late-Quaternary sediments of the Nushagak, Holitna,            and Upper Kuskokwin lowlands have yielded significant new information           on this previously neglected region of the Beringian refugium.                  Conditions somewhat more humid than those at interior sites apparently          persisted in southwestern Alaska during the late-Pleistocene, and this          region may have provided refugial environments for insects that could           not survive at more-continental localities.  Fossil assemblages of              stenothermic insect taxa also provide a means of constraining past              summer temperatures in this portion of Alaska, contributing to our              knowledge of climatic conditions in Beringia as a whole.                                                                                                        One of the strengths of the research project is the analysis of                 multiple sites from the southwestern Alaska region, allowing a clearer          picture of the regional paleoenvironmental signal and the degree of             local variability.  These paleoentomological and palynological studies          will provide a more complete late-Quaternary paleoenvironmental record          for southwestern Alaska, with emphasis on (1) the transition from               last-glacial to Holocene climates and (2) the possibility of a Middle           Wisconsinan warm interval previously recognized only in interior                regions of eastern Beringia.  The results of the study will contribute          substantially toward the determination of late-Quaternary climatic and          environmental gradients across the Beringian subcontinent and toward            an understanding of the ecological dynamics of this late-Pleistocene            refugium.",
