 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a renewal of NSF grant ECS-8314488 on a Study                  of Nonlinear Wave Plasma Interaction.  The experiments                          will concentrate on laboratory studies of two dimensional and                   time dependent plasma sheaths in DC and RF plasmas.  Specific                   attention will be paid to the understanding of sheaths associated               with Plasma Source Ion Implantation (PSII), a technique the PI's have           recently begun to develop.  Experiments will take advantage of                  previous emissive probe diagnostic development which allow plasma               potential measurements with good spatial and temporal resolution.               Studies of the spatial and temporal characteristics of DC, pulsed and           sinusoidal sheaths will be conducted.  Experiments will build on                recent results which indicate that one-dimensional descriptions of              sheaths cannot explain the self-consistent plasma potential far from            electrodes or plasma potential dips near positive electrodes in                 filament produced plasmas.  Continued development of PSII, which                implants ions by applying large negative pulses to materials immersed           in plasmas, requires an understanding of both two dimensional and               pulsed sheath effects.  Laboratory experiments will be combined with            small scale efforts on computer modeling of experimental results.                                                                                               This renewal proposal will concentrate on laboratory studies                    oftwo dimensional plasma sheaths - one example of nonlinear plasma              structures.  Sheaths are non-neutral plasma regions that are                    almost always present at plasma boundaries and are sometimes                    found disconnected from boundaries, i.e. double layers.  They are               among the oldest known phenomena in plasmas yet many important                  aspects of them are poorly understood.  They play an important role             in many commercial devices and applications, and hence investigations           of sheath phenomena can have considerable economic impact.",
