 "awd_abstract_narration": "Narrative: The principal investigators propose to develop a                     family of novel microreactors that could simulate the reaction                  kinetic performance to be expected in commercial-scale fluid                    beds of powdered catalysts.  Design of the microreactors will                   exploit a newly discovered phenomenon: about 0.5 mm layer of                    fluid cracking catalyst (FCC) powder on the floor of a                          horizontal duct of rectangular cross-section, vibrated                          vertically at about 25 Hertz with an amplitude of several                       milimeters, appears to enjoy intimate contact with \"supernatant\"                gas flowing laterally above the powder.  Cold-model experiments                 would study the dispersion of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas in                  the ducts.  Variables in experiments would be humidity (causing                 SF6 adsorptivity to vary), degree of solid back-mixing, and, in                 the models with flow of powder, the ratio of flow of solid and                  gas.  Later, a hot microreactor would be built for kinetic                      studies of a catalytic reaction with once-through flow of                       solids.  The ultimate objective would be development of a family                of microreactors for hot kinetic studies with capabilities for                  commercial size fluid bed reactors.",
