 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a field and laboratory study of the                             relationship between the sediment physical properties and                       subduction processes in the Nankai trough in the western                        Pacific.  The study is providing important new data on the                      processes that control the formation of geological structures                   in the sediments of active continent margins.  The primary                      technique for the field program is advanced multichannel                        seismic reflection data acquisition including expanding spread                  profiles that require two ship operations.  The R/V MOORE of                    the University of Texas will be used together with the R/V                      TANSEA MASU of Japan.  The data will be jointly analyzed and                    define variations in physical properties with time and                          increasing deformation of the sediments.  The project will also                 provide the detailed control needed to site a future ODP                        drilling deep hole for calibration of the seismic data and                      direct measurements of the geology and fluid content of the                     sediments.                                                                                                                                                      Dr. G. Moore (Univ. Tulsa) and Dr. T. Shipley (Univ. Texas) are                 collaborating on this study with the Japanese.  Together with                   Dr. D. Karig (Cornell) and their co-investigators, they form a                  very strong research team with experience in all components of                  the work.  This includes field operations, seismic data                         analysis, continental margin geology and tectonics, and                         physical property measurements.",
