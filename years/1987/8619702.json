 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most species have evolved reproductive strategies to insure that            offspring are born during a time of year that provides maximum survival         potential.  Length of day supplemented by other environmental cues are          used to predict these times. Although much progress has been made in            understanding how photoperiodic information is perceived by animals, the        tranduction of this information to hormonal signals that control                reproductive function is still not well understood. The overall                 objectives of these studies is to identify brain mechanisms by which            daylength influences the release of pituitary hormone that in turn              regulate reproductive function. The golden hamster becomes                      reproductively active in the long days of summer and reproductively             quiesent during winter. Natural changes in length of the light and dark         portions of the day (less the 12.5h of light secretion rates of                 pituitary) hormones.  Then, he will use drugs that affect specific              chemical (neurotransmitter) systems in the brain to see if he can  mimic        or block the affects of daylength on hormone secretion and reproductive         activity.                                                                            The pineal gland, a small structure within the brain, is important         in mediating the effects of daylength on reproductive function.  The            action of melatonin, the principal hormone of the pineal gland, on              neurotransmitters and hormone secretion is not understood.  He plans to         study the effects of melatonin administration or removal of the pineal          gland on the metabolism of brain neurotransmitters and hormone                  secretion.  The results of these experiments should have important              implications for understanding the control of reproductive function by          both internal and external factors.  Although he is specifically                studying affects of daylength on reproductive function, the conclusions         based on these studies are applicable to our understanding of how a             variety of external stimuli such as food affect reproductive function.",
