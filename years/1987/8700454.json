 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project contributes to game theory, decision theory, and                   utilitarian ethics.  The investigator is a very distinguished                   scholar.  His early work helped define these fields and he remains an           active contributor in all of these areas.  His recent research is               partly responsible for a breakthrough in game theory.  He is capable            of pursuing this ambitious research agenda.                                                                                                                     The project consists of three parts.  The first part builds on a                major breakthrough by the investigator in game theory, i. e., the               development of a principled systematic theory that defines a unique             outcome for any game.  This is an important advance because almost              any nontrivial noncooperative game will have very many and sometimes            even infinitely many significantly dissimilar outcomes.  This means             that without this new theory specific testable predictions can be               derived from game-theoretic models only by imposing various ad hoc              restrictions on acceptable solutions.   Further work is needed to               define the assumptions that underpin this new theory, contrast the              theory with other methods used to obtain unique solutions such as               stability theory, and make this theory easier for economists to use.                                                                                            The second part demonstrates that utilitarian theories of ethics are            not inconsistent with nonutilitarian concepts of moral obigation and            moral rights.  The investigator justifies a rule that gives                     precedence to certain individual moral rights over direct                       social-utility maximization on the grounds that such a rule has                 enormous social utility in its own right.  If this line of research             is successful it could provide a way of rationally justifying moral             rights and obligations that modern philosophies now can only define             as important.                                                                                                                                                   The third part continues the development of a general theory of                 inductive logic based on Bayesian decision theory.  This project                explores the relationship between rational presumption of truth and             probabilities.  It extends earlier work on the relationship between             the simplicity of empirical hypotheses and their prior probability.",
