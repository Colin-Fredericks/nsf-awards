 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will address an important question that must be                 answered before reliable climatic records are deduced from core                 in glaciers.  An observed two degree (Centigrade) termperature                  difference at ten meters depth in coreholes less than two                       kilometers apart near the divide of Agassiz ice cap on Ellesmere                Island, Northwest Territories, Canada, show that climatic                       intepretations are vulnerable to microclimatic effects, at least                near these coreholes.  The two degree difference is important                   because it is 20% of the total probable temperature change                      between the late Wiconsinan glacial maximum and the present at                  that location.  The study consists of two parts:  (1) a strain                  and temperature survey at that surface that will provide input                  data for a finite element model that will be eventually be used                 to determine how ice dynamics determines the paleoclimatic record               down the coreholes, and (2) a microclimate investigation to learn               the precise mechanisms that cause the two degree temperature                    difference.  Wind pumping--that is, frictional dissipation caused               by forcing of air through the porous firn by surface turbulence--               is tentatively proposed as the cause of warmer ten meter                        temperatures at the ice divide.",
