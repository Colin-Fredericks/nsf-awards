 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evaluation of government spending or regulatory programs is often           difficult, and especially so when comparisons must be made about                programs that save or extend lives at different points in time.  How            are we to evaluate a program saving 10 lives this year against one              saving 10 lives 20 years from now?  Economists often assign a \"discount         rate\" to future costs or benefits, but extending or saving future lives         cannot be assigned a clear monetary discounted value.  One way to               proceed in the face of this difficulty is to examine individuals                preferences for present as opposed to future life saving.                       Specifically, this project will allow an economist, a sociologist and a         philosopher to explore several different methods of eliciting                   information about the implicit rate(s) at which individuals' discount           future life saving (if at all) when asked to choose between                     hypothetical but nevertheless realistic government regulatory or                spending programs to prevent premature mortality.  The methods include          in-person interviews, mail surveys, and telephone surveys.  Each one of         these methods will identify aspects of life-saving programs that are            intrinsic to individuals' discounting judgments.  Extrinsic factors             that could affect the validity of the findings will also be identified,         and steps taken to overcome them.                                                                                                                               This is the first study that attempts to probe, in a systematic way,            the difficult issues associated with comparative choices between life           saving programs and individual attitudes towards them.  Its results             will contribute to our understanding of the normative implications of           these choices, and to the development of new and more sophisticated             techniques for undertaking these kinds of studies and analyses.  The            investigators are exceptionally well qualified; institutional support           is good; costs are reasonable; the research plan is very appropriate            for this exploratory phase; results are likely to be influential.  This         is exactly the kind of cross-disciplinary collaborative research EVS            should encourage.  Total support in the amount of $55,439 is                    recommended, of which $40,000 is awarded now.",
