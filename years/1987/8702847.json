 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nature of freezing in orientational glasses is as yet an            open question.  The proposed experimental work will investigate                 whether the freezing is random.  Temperature-jump nuclear                       magnetic resonance will be employed to determine whether                        individual molecules return to the same orientation upon repeated               melting and freezing.  The experiments will use the well-studied                orientational glasses potassium cyanide-bromide and sodium-                     potassium cyanide.  The experiments should lead to a more                       detailed understanding of the glassy state of matter.                                                                                                                   Studies of simple molecular solids at high pressures have               found new solid phases.  However, almost none of the work to date               has studied the dynamics of these solids.  In particular, it is                 not known whether the orientational disorder in the high pressure               disordered phases is static or dynamic.  Nuclear magnetic                       resonance in diamond anvil cells, a recently developed technique,               will be used to study the orientational dynamics.  Diffusion will               also be measured to look for a change in mechanism at high                      densities.  The work will begin with nitrogen and carbon monoxide               because reliable phase diagrams are available and because of                    their molecular similarities.  The work should extend the                       understanding of high density materials.",
