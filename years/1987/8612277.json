 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this project is to research the status and             trends in the law of public liability for losses due to natural hazards         including earthquakes, floods, mudflows, and mudfloods, avalanches and          other hazards.  The project will build upon past research efforts               dealing with individual natural hazards with emphasis upon updating             earlier work, synthesis and analysis.  The project will analyze                 commonalities and differences between hazards, trends in the law and            possible technological implications of these trends with regard to              prediction and warning systems, building and hazard reduction works             (e.g., dams), and the design and the permitting of private buildings.                                                                                           A secondary objective o\u001a the project will be to assess the impact of            court decisions upon 20 communities through a questionnaire and a               telephone survey.  Based upon both the legal research and survey the            study will identify strategies for reducing the impacts of earthquakes          and other natural hazards without generating liability problems.  The           project final report will be of use to agencies, engineers, architects          and others designing, constructing or operating loss reduction programs         and to local governments concerned about legal liability issues.                                                                                                The investigator is qualified to carry out this project which builds on         previous work he has done in the hazard reduction field.  An award is           recommended.",
