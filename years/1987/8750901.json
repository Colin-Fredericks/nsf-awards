 "awd_abstract_narration": "The high-speed centrifuge, chromatography refrigerator, fraction                collector and support equipment acquired in part through this grant are         being used to strengthen upper-division laboratory courses in                   Biochemistry and Cellular Biology for students who are predominantly            female, American Indian, and older than the traditional undergraduate.          During the past year, this relatively new independent institution has           received accreditation and instituted a four-year curriculum in Science         and Mathematics.  Funds were obtained from Federal and corporate sources        to implement the basic curriculum.  The goal of the current project is          to develop and enhance capabilities for giving students needed                  laboratory experiences in upper-level courses in such areas as protein          purification and characterization, and the investigation of cellular            components.  The new instruments are essential components of technical          skill training in Biochemistry and Cellular Biology in that they support        approximately one third of the experiments in these laboratory courses.         This instrumentation also is being used to support experiments in other         upper- and lower-division courses in the Science curriculum.                                                                                                    The program is designed to meet the needs of students who, despite              limitations in their precollegiate science training, are seeking an             education that will adequately prepare them for successful careers in           technology, teaching or nursing.",
