 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to establish a Biological Facilities               Center for the Study of Cell Morphology and Function.  Five major               instruments are requested:                                                                                                                                      l.  A transmission electron microscope with facilities to section               and process specimens at low temperature.  It will be used for                  immunogold localization of a wide variety of antigens and for                   ultrastructural visualization of cell and cytoskeletal                          morphology.                                                                                                                                                     2.  A high-spatial-resolution low-light fluorescence microscope                 system to track the dynamics of fluorescently labeled                           cytoskeletal proteins and the position and shape of labeled cells               in developing embryos while minimizing photodynamic damage.                                                                                                     3.  A workstation that combines electrophysiological equipment                  with imaging of fluorescence ratios from fura-2 to map spatial                  patterns of neuronal activity and intracellular Ca2a in                         electrically stimulated neural assemblies.                                                                                                                      4.  A laser-scanning confocal microscope that rejects out-of-                   focus fluorescence that will enable high-speed optical sectioning               of thick or dynamically changing specimens for studying the role                of Ca2+ in controlling the cytoskeleton and for measuring local                 demains of Ca2+ or pH in single neurons, thick ganglia, or                      heterogeneous epithelia.                                                                                                                                        5.  A Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer                 that will permit continuous monitoring of intracellular                         metabolites, pH, sodium, and hemoglobin polymerization in cell                  and organelle suspensions such as cyanobacteria, oxyntic cell                   vesicles, and erythrocytes.                                                                                                                                     This equipment will be used by the forty research groups to be                  housed in a new Life Sciences building as well as hundreds of                   graduate students who are involved in ongoing research projects.                Expected contributions will be the development of a scanning                    confocal microscope for high-speed biological observation as well               as innovative solutions to current problems in molecular biology.",
