 "awd_abstract_narration": "The area of research is in the tools and methods for performance                measurement and analysis of parallel and distributed programs.  The             research is based on two main principles.  The first principle is that          programmers should be supplied with the maximum information about their         program.  This information should be available from all levels of               abstraction.  To prevent the programmer from being inundate with                irrelevant details, there must a logical and intuitive organization to          this data.  The second principle is that programmers should be supplied         with answers, not numbers.  The performance tool should be able to guide        the programmer to the location of the performance problem, and describe         the problem in terms of the source program.                                                                                                                     The current research is in techniques for automatically guiding the             programmer to performance problems.  The techniques for identifying             critical resource utilization, determining interaction and scheduling           affects, and detecting program time phase behavior will be explored.  The       investigators will include user interface issues to relate performance          results and measurement specification to the program source code.  The          combination of these techniques will provide programmers with information       needed to more easily make significant improvements in their programs.",
