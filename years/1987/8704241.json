 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of a complex organ such as a leaf depends               on the integrated differentiation of multiple cell types.  The                  alterations in gene expression which contribute to the                          differentiation of the two interacting photosynthetic cell                      types in maize leaves (bundle sheath and mesophyll) are most                    dramatic among the genes for enzymes which interact in C4                       carbon fixation.  Each C4 enzyme is specific to one cell type,                  and accumulates in a fixed spatial pattern within the leaf.                     The means by which expression of each photosynthetic C4 gene                    occurs specifically in one of the two leaf cell types during                    development are unknown.  Several of the C4 enzymes are members                 of small multigene families which also contribute enzyme                        isoforms which perform housekeeping functions and are regulated                 in drastically differing manner from the photosynthetic forms.                                                                                                          This project seeks to extend previous studies of C4 enzyme              genes and patterns of cellular development in leaves by                         directly comparing genes for the photosynthetic and non-                        photosynthetic isoforms.  The gene cloning, sequencing and                      comparative studies will also provide gene-specific probes to                   aid in subsequent analysis of cell-specific and organ-specific                  gene expression.",
