 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite abundant pathological evidence indicating that the                      striatum, a brain structure (caudate-putamen) is an important                   component of the motor system, little is known about the                        physiology of the striatum during normal behavior.  This is                     true for several reasons.  First, the use of anesthesia in                      physiological experiments, while allowing progress in                           understanding other regions of the brain has obscured our                       understanding of the striatum due to its drastic reduction in                   neuronal activity in this system.  Furthermore, anesthetics                     have been shown to alter measures of dopaminergic function in                   the striatum (as compared with awake animals).  Second, unit                    recordings from single striatal neurons in awake animals have                   seldom shown the clear, consistent correlations with motor and                  sensory events typical of neurons in primary motor and sensory                  areas.  Instead responses, when present, are conditional and                    the details regarding the necessary conditions remain unknown.                  Third, single unit recordings during conscious behavior have been               restricted almost entirely to the primate during head restraint.                                                                                                The involvement of the striatum in movement could, however,                     encompass a broader integration of whole body sensorimotor                      processing.  Coordinated active movement is achieved both by                    causing rotational and translational movement of joints (primary                movement), and by stabilizing other body parts and shifting the                 center of gravity so that the primary movement can occur.  It is                possible that conditions allowing unrestrained movement and the                 accompanying sensory feedback may be required for full                          manifestation of striatal participation in such processes.  If                  so, electrophysiological recordings in freely moving animals, may               reveal previously unobserved features elucidating the unique                    contribution of the striatum and basal ganglia to behavior.                                                                                                     Dr. Mark West will study the role of the behavior of the striatum               in awake, intact, unanesthetized animals.",
