 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor R. Jensen is one of the leading researchers in the            world regarding the classical and quantum descriptions of chaotic               systems.  By studying the experimental results for the microwave                ionization of highly excited hydrogen atoms, he plans to explore                the problem of quantum chaos.  In particular, he wants to study                 the connection between classical chaos and quantum chaos.  In                   addition, he hopes to gain new insight into the strong                          interaction of radiation with matter and the interaction of                     strongly coupled many-body systems.                                                     Professor Jensen is the most active and versatile young                 physics theorist interested in the fundamental problem of the                   relation between classical and quantum chaos.  He proposes to                   study this problem by focussing on the coupling of microwave                    radiation with atomic hydrogen.  This work provides one of the                  best opportunities to explore the apparent inconsistency between                quantum mechanics and deterministic chaos.  There is a strong                   coupling between theory and experiments in the proposed work,                   which also involves the study of the behavior of atoms under the                influence of intense external fields.  This research will                       eventually lead to a greater understanding of the value of                      semiclassical methods in quantum dynamics.",
