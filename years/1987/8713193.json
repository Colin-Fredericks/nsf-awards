 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glycoproteins are currently receiving increasing attention                      because of those of central role in biological processes,                       especially recognition.  These ubiquitous sustances have                        been implicated in many important biological functions:                         e.g., a role in differentiation, growth, intercellular                          recognition, control of glycoprotein uptake by cells,                           export of synthesize proteins, control of the lifetime of                       glycoproteins in the circulating systems of higher animals                      and specification of the human blood types.  Found on cell                      surfaces, they play a critical role in the interaction                          between cells and the response of cells to the external                         environment which may contain biologically active substances.                   The permeability of the cell surface is partially affected by                   the glyco moeity, thus indirectly regulating the metabolism                     of the cell.                                                                                                                                                    There is still much to be learned about the conformation of                     glycopeptides and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is one                   of the simplest methods of choice.  Dr. Fasman will                             synthesize glycosylated peptides in order to study the                          conformation of glycosylated regions of glycoproteins.  The                     conformation of the synthetic glycopeptides will be studied                     by CD and then by NMR and Raman spectroscopy to determine the                   influence of the glycosylation on peptide conformation.",
