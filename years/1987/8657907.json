 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the sharing of data in distributed                environments.  The Andrew File System addressed the issue of providing a        secure, location transparent name space in a large distributed                  environment.  This system is now operational and widely used on the CMU         campus and elsewhere.  As dependence on such systems grows, it becomes          increasingly important to be able to access data at all times.  The             inaccessibility of data due to server and network failures causes               considerable inconvenience in a system such as Andrew.                                                                                                          Replication of data at multiple sites is a technique that has been the          subject of much recent theoretical investigation.  The project's goal is        to use these algorithms in the design and implementation of CODA, a             distributed file system that is resilient to server and network                 failures. In normal operation, the performance of this system should be         no worse than that of an equivalent non-resilient distributed file              system.  Since replication involves data transfer to multiple servers,          the development of parallel network protocols is an essential part of           this effort.  The evaluation of alternative replication algorithms, the         development of techniques to handle network partitions, and the analysis        and modeling of such a system are necessary parts of the project.",
