 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical studies are proposed for laser-induced energy               transfer in molecular collision systems and chemical reactions                  under several different kinds of physical conditions.                           Calculations involving semiclassical and quantum-mechanical                     scattering theory will be undertaken on the following projects:                 (1) Laser-induced gas-phase bimolecular reactions between a rare                gas atom and a halogen molecule, in which a non-resonant laser                  pulse excites the van der Waals complex, leading to the formation               of an electronically excited product.  (2) Manipulation of                      ultrashort laser pulses to determine the outcome of a collision                 event.  (3)  Photodissociation of a molecule near a grating,                    including the particular case of predissociation.  Effects due to               neighboring molecules and possible laser-assisted heterogeneous                 catalysis are also considered.  (4)  Laser-induced reactions in a               solid-rare gas matrix to determine potential energy surfaces and                reactions between halogen and rare-gas atoms.                                           This is a fundamental theoretical study directed towards                understanding the details of how a pulse of laser light can cause               particular chemical reactions to occur.  The possibility of                     controlling the outcomes of chemical reactions by varying the                   wavelength of the laser light depends on such an understanding;                 the present studies are directed to this end.",
