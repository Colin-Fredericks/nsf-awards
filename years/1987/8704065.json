 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is collaborative research with Thomas Marschak at                     The University of Caifornia-Berkeley (Grant 8704244).  The                      research concerns the design of efficient organizational                        schemes.  In particular, it considers the comparative                           advantages of hierarchical arrangements. The authors posit a                    group of agents who are to take actions in a changing                           environment.  The joint action has to meet a performance                        standard, i.e., it has to lie in a set that depends on the                      environment.  Each member observes some component of the                        actual environment and chooses her action after receiving                       messages from others.  A network mechanism prescribes                           messages sent and actions taken and may be hierarchical.  A                     network mechanism is efficient if it satisfies the                              performance standard and no other mechanism does so at a                        smaller informational cost.  Cost is measured by the size of                    the set of messages that agents can send or receive.                                 General techniques for constructing efficient mechanisms                   have been applied to a multi-plant firm example and an                          exchange-economy example.  The broader significance of this                     work is that it seeks to generalize these results to find                       those basic properties of performance standards that make                       hierarchies efficient.  In the same context the researchers                     study: (1) dynamic issues, i.e., the number of steps until                      actions are obtained; (2) reward structures, i.e., contracts                    among the group's agents, so that hierarchies can be examined                   in light of the incentive problems; and (3) promising links                     to the \"communication complexity\" literature in computer                        science",
