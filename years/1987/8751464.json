 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Lawrence Hall of Science proposes to develop two 1400 square foot           interactive exhibitions based on the latest research findings on the            structure and function of the human brain; one for permanent display at         the Hall, and one for circulation to 12 science museums over a five year        period. The exhibition will use large scale models and equipment from           two television programs on the brain.  Substantial input from scientists        and psychologists will be combined with the educational expertise of            curriculum development, museum, and design staff from the Lawrence Hall         of Science to create the exhibitions.  Visitor and school related               curriculum materials will be developed, including a video library and an        auditorium show for large group school use.                                                                                                                     The Lawrence Hall of Science has more than 300,000 visitors per year and        is a major science education research and development facility; the             twelve host museums will reflect museums in both large and medium sized         cities well distributed geographically.  More than three million people         will view the exhibits over a five year period.                                                                                                                 The topic is timely, the treatment substantive and educational, and the         qualifications of staff and advisors high.  The re-use and relationship         to a major television series, \"The Brain\", is an ingenious and effective        strategy.  The Lawrence Hall of Science is matching the National Science        Foundation contribution with comparable private funds.  A 24-month FY87         award of $          is recommended.",
