 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides support for research, by Drs.  Mariano A. Estoque         and T. Nejat Veziroglu of the University of Miami, and by Dr. A. A. Junejo      of Pakistan's Appropriate Technology Development Organization, and Dr.          M.Y. Akhtar of the National Institute of Power, to develop models for           determining detailed wind distribution over complex terrain, and to apply       the models to selected regions of Pakistan.  Input for these models are         the prevailing flow field and geographical distribution of the terrain          elevation.  The modeling results are expected to provide data for               preparing detailed wind atlases for selected regions of Pakistan.  These        will provide important information for the development of wind energy in        that country, both for agriculture and industrial use.  The U.S.-Pakistan       Program supports joint research where the technical capabilities of             scientists and the facilities complement each other, and where the              research is likely to benefit both countries.  These conditions are met in      this project.                                                                                                                                                   The U.S. researchers have worked on energy research for many years with         considerable results and publications.  Dr. Estoque has extensive research      experience in meteorology and boundary layer studies.  The Pakistani            collaborators are well-qualified scientists with long research experience       in their fields.  The research is of particular importance to Pakistan          because of its interest in developing renewable energy sources.  It is          also important to the U.S. since modeling weather conditions in various         regions of the world could lead to better understanding of the weather in       the U.S.  The project has the support of the Government of Pakistan which       is providing the costs of the activities to be carried by that country's        scientists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The project is to be funded over three years as follows:                                                                                                        1.
