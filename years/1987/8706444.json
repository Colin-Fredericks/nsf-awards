 "awd_abstract_narration": "Results of more than 50 years of scientific investigation at               the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory have established the site as a                national and international center for forest ecosystem and                      hydrology research.  The 2185-ha Laboratory, located in the                     Southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, is a USDA                     Forest Service property where cooperative research is jointly                   administered by the Southeastern Forest Experiment Station and                  the University of Georgia.  In 1986 the research program included               more than 50 senior investigators and over 50 graduate students                 and technicians from 19 different universities and agencies.                         Although current research use of the site is high, lack of                 adequate overnight facilities has significantly restricted use by               important segments of the scientific community.  One house                      trailer with accommodations for eight persons is the only on-site               facility currently available for overnight occupancy.  This                     project provides support to renovate and refurbish an existing                  building for dormitory, living and work space to accommodate up                 to 30 investigators.  Funds are also provided for a microcomputer               to be placed in the facility and a four-wheel-drive vehicle for                 shared investigator use.  Support for these items will                          substantially enhance the value of the site for environmental and               hydrologic research.",
