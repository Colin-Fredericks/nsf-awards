 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor F. R. Harvey is one of the top researchers in                 complex analysis from the viewpoint of differential geometry.                   With his coworkers he has developed a new branch of geometry--                  calibrations, which has applications to Cayley geometry and                     spinors.  He proposes to continue his work on calibrated                        geometry, particularly with regard to area minimizing                           submanifolds.  Professor J. C. Polking is an expert regarding                   the solution of partial differential equations containing                       several complex variables.  His construction with Harvey of an                  explicit kernel for the complex Neumann problem is an important                 piece of work.  Polking proposes to continue his work on                        explicit kernels for solving the Cauchy-Riemann equations and                   related equations in several complex variables.                                         Professor Harvey is a world-leader in the field of                      differential geometry involving complex analysis and has                        developed with collaborators a new field of geometry, known as                  calibrated geometry.  Calibrated geometries possess the                         property of absolute area minimizing.  Professor Harvey                         proposes to continue his research on this exciting new topic                    which should lead to important results.  Professor Polking is                   an expert on solving partial differential equations in several                  complex variables.  He proposes to continue his research in                     this area by                                                                    looking for the solutions of equations for problems for which                   very little is known.  A good understanding of these problems                   would be of great interest.",
