 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a small genetically isolated population, chance events of            genealogy affect the genetic structure of the population, the                   number and variety of genes, and the pattern of similarity and                  difference between population subdivisions.  Conversely, detailed               patterns of genetic variation between individuals convey                        information about the recent genealogical history of the                        population, and thence about patterns of gene flow.  The research               proposed will develop methods to analyze effects of detailed                    genealogical structure upon gene survival, and for inference of                 genealogy from current genetic data.  The latter question will be               studied in a natural plant population.  The methods developed                   will be applicable also to any other small natural animal or                    plant population, in which genetic data on individuals can be                   obtained but genealogical relationships cannot be precisely                     observed.                                                                               The effects of genealogical structure on the number and                 variety of surviving genes in a small isolated population have                  implications for the genetic management of species isolates.                    Many species now exist only in small numbers and some only in                   captivity, and quantitative approaches to the maintenance of                    genetic variability can be of practical importance in assessing                 the future of a population.                                                             This research will also produce a package of computer                   programs to handle, store, access and update large complex                      genealogies within an efficient data base structure.  These                     programs can provide a convenient data management structure for                 many persons involved in data of this type, whatever their                      computing expertise or objectives.",
