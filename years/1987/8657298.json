 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research of this Presidential Young Investigator involves              the creation of a new generation of preliminary design environments.            This new environment will integrate architectural and structural                engineering so that the concepts and considerations of a structural             engineering can be introduced into the preliminary design of a                  building.  The emphasis of this research is knowledge and design                representation.  Knowledge will be presented with a generalized                 representation accepted by both the computer and human engineer.  To            demonstrate the power of the design knowledge base, a prototype CAD             system will be developed.  A primary goal of the system is to                   facilitate human design decision making, which will be the                      foundation of full-scale design automation systems.  After the basic            design skills have been incorporated into the system, intelligent               features, such as providing advice or solutions to parts of the                 design problem, will be added.  Achieving this latter goal requires             that higher level knowledge be integrated into the knowledge base.",
