 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the effects of the structure of the                     surface of gallium arsenide substrates upon the molecular beam                  epitaxial growth of compound semiconductors and thin films of                   metals.  The study utilizes reflection high-energy electron                     diffraction and transmission electron microscopy to characterize                the structures.  The effects of misorientation of the crystals on               the stability of growth and the diffusion of atoms will be                      determined.  The results of the research will enable the                        formulation of a model for the epitaxial growth of compound                     semiconductors.                                                                                                                                                      Under the previous grant (DMR-8319821).  Professor Cohen                   made significant advances in the field:  (i.) improved                          understanding of reflection high-energy electron diffraction                    processes in these materials, e.g., determination of the effects                of interference on angular dependence of diffraction                            oscillations, (ii.) measurement of surface diffusion on gallium                 arsenide, (iii.) determination of means to control the                          evaporation and growth of gallium arsenide on the level of                      individual atomic layers, (iv.) measurement of the thickness that               indium gallium arsenide thin films can be grown before the onset                of strain-related defects.  These and other advances are                        described in more than seven scientific publications.                                                                                                                Professor Cohen is acknowledged as one of the leading                      scientists in the field.  The facilities and the institutional                  environment are excellent for the performance of the research and               training of students.  His research under the previous NSF grant                has been classified by his peers as the pioneering work in the                  field.  The program includes a Research Experience for                          Undergraduates Supplement for two undergraduate students to get                 hands-on experience in research.  It is hoped that this                         experience will serve as a stimulus to attract highly-gifted                    students into research and teaching careers as well as to                       contribute to the overall goals of this program.",
