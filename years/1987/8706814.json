 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the remaining gaps in the quantitative record of U.S. economic           history is the lack of detailed information on the fiscal activities of         state and local governments.  Annual time-series data on federal                revenues and expenditures are available from 1798 on, but similar               information for state and local governments is very sparse,                     particularly before 1900.  In the course of the previous NSF award, the         investigators have made good progress in beginning to close this gap.           They have managed to assemble a carefully constructed data-set for the          Atlantic seaboard states from 1790 to the present.  The purpose of this         project is to expand this data set to include the sixteen midwestern            states.  State documents, published and unpublished, will furnish the           basis for complete state level expenditure and revenue estimates.               Local government estimates will be based on sampling procedures.                                                                                                                                                                                This data set will be extremely valuable to scholars interested                 in the role of government in the economic development of the United             States.  It will allow researchers to address, in a quantitative way, a         host of questions regarding the interaction of the public and private           sectors over time.   The principal investigators have demonstrated              their capabilities to construct and to begin analyzing this expanded            data set.  The investigators combine to form a productive research              team, and there is every reason to believe that this project will prove         as successful as the previous one.",
