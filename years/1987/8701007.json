 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is important because of the many technological                     applications of transition-metal chalcogenides such as superconducting          materials, battery materials and hydroprocessing catalysts.                                                                                                     It is planned to investigate certain aspects of soluble transition-             metal chalcogenides (compounds of S, Se, Te) with a view toward                 developing a chemistry that is complementary to the solid-state                 efforts.  In particular, it is proposed to concentrate on early                 transition metal selenides and tellurides. Synthetic strategies for             these unknown ions include, for the case of Nb and Ta, solid-state              reactions; these reactions may be applicable to the synthesis of the            corresponding tellurides.  The reaction chemistry to be studied                 includes acidification, heating, and interactions with simple                   chalcogens as well as with inorganic and organic chalcogens.  The use           of Se-77 NMR techniques for characterization of the selenides in                solution and diffraction methods for the characterization of species            isolated from solution is proposed.  The compounds prepared from                solution will provide interesting chemical and structural contrasts to          those compounds that have been prepared by high-temperature solid-state         reactions.",
