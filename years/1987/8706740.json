 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent experience in Japan, Mexico, and elsewhere shows that substantial        damage, even total collapse, can occur to steel buildings.  This project        studies the effects of several recently recognized factors on the               seismic performance of steel frame systems.  These are:  interaction of         multicomponent ground motions, P-delta effect, and the effect of low            ductility members.                                                                                                                                              The study makes use of the established analytical capabilities in               seismic analysis of buildings subjected to interacting ground motions at        the University of Missouri-Rolla, and the extensive research experience         in steel building structures at Lehigh University.  The collaboration           should provide a unique opportunity to develop an improved understanding        of the seismic performance of tall steel buildings and more reliable            methods of evaluating safety of such structures.                                                                                                                The results would be useful for practicing engineers, academic                  researchers, and code writing bodies.",
