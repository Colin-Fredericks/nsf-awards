 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past 10-15 years atmospheric chemistry has evolved from            a young research discipline devoted primarily to local problems of              urban pollution and air quality to a mature science concerned with              the hemispheric to global scale cycling of a wide variety of chemical           species.  To a large extent this change has resulted from an                    increasing realization that human activities can cause chemical                 disturbances to the natural troposphere on scales far beyond local              concerns.  Well-known examples include changes in the                           regional-to-global concentrations of certain nitrogen compounds, lead           and other heavy metals, artificial radionuclides, a number of                   synthetic organic substances, certain acid-forming species, carbon              dioxide and methane.  These chemical changes in the atmosphere can              often extend to the earth's soils, oceans, and biota far from the               original source region.  They can result in alterations in the                  earth's climate, changes in vital nutrient cycles, and impact                   significantly on the public health and quality of life on earth.                    The Atmosphere/Ocean Chemistry Experiment (AEROCE) will be a                coordinated multi-institutional atmospheric and marine chemistry                research project centered in the North Atlantic region.  The ultimate           goal of the AEROCE project will be the development of a predictive              capability for the continentally derived species observed in the                marine troposphere over the North Atlantic.  The selection of sites             and the measurement protocol in AEROCE has been developed jointly by            modelers and field experimentalists.                                                The AEROCE Primary Network Operations Group (PNOG) is located at            the Center for Atmospheric Chemistry Studies, Graduate School of                Oceanography, University of Rhode Island.  This group will establish            Primary Network sites in the North Atlantic Ocean at the following              locations: Daniels Head, Bermuda; Mace Head, Ireland; Ragged Point,             Barbados; and Izania, Tenerife.  These sites will be high quality               state-of-the-art atmospheric sampling stations with facilities to               support a wide range of atmospheric chemistry measurements.  Aerosol,           gas, and precipitation samples will be collected at these sites and             will follow the sampling protocol as outlined in the AEROCE                     Overview.  The PNOG will construct and operate the sampling                     stations.  Each station will have a triplet rain collector and six              aerosol/trace gas collection systems for obtaining continuous daily             grab samples.  Flask samples for certain trace gases will also be               collected twice a week.  Other gases analyzed by on-site techniques             will have essentially a continuous record.  The group will have an              on-site technician with technical expertise at each site.  The group            will receive samples and data from the Primary Network stations and             will redistribute the materials as required by AEROCE investigators.            The Bermuda-West (Daniels Head) site will be operational in August,             1988 and the Mace Head, Ireland site will be operational in May,                1988.",
