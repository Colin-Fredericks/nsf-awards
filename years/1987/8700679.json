 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are specific areas of the brain that are known to regulate a              number of bodily functions.  One such area is the medial preoptic area          (MPOA) of the hypothalamus.  In the male rat, this brain area has been          shown to monitor body temperature and allow response of the body to             changes in environmental temperature.  In addition, the MPOA processes          sensory information and, in the presence of testosterone, this area             mediates hormonal and behavioral aspects of reproduction.  Given this           duality of function within the MPOA, experiments were begun to                  investigate a relationship of temperature, both in the body and in the          MPOA, reproductive function.                                                                                                                                    Using sophisticated telemetric thermosensors, the MPOA and deep body            temperature in male rats will be monitored relative to physiological and        reproductive status.  Preliminary data have shown that there are changes        in MPOA temperature independent of changes in body temperature, but             related to reproductive processes.  Further, rapid and selected cooling         of the MPOA was not related to general changes in body temperature              related to exercise.  The experiments will examine this phenomena in            more detail.  The information gathered in this research will be of great        interest in terms of technological developments of instruments used in          the research.  In addition, the study of the duality in function of the         MPOA will elucidate some of mechanisms involved in the regulation of            temperature and reproductive function.",
