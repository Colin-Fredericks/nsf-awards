 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"visibility region\" of a viewpoint on a surface is wll-             defined.  It contains all of the points that can be joined to the               viewpoint by means of a line-segment that does not pass through                 the surface.  In principle, the visibility region of every point                on the surface can be computed.  In practice, however, its                      computation must be approximated.  In this research, the                        visibility regions of the n vertices of a Delaunay-triangulated                 terrain model are studied.  A major goal of this research is to                 improve the average performance of known hidden-line and hidden-                surface algorithms.  This is accomplished by using several types                of heuristics based on the unique characteristics of the problem.               Algorithms will be developed to apply the resulting visibility                  maps to the location of observation points:  to line-of-sight                   (television, fm, radar) communications and surveillance problems;               to orientation and navigation; to data compression; and to the                  extraction of significant terrain features such as ridges and                   valleys.  It is argued that the global nature of visibility model               provides a useful alternative to partial derivatives for defining               topographic entities.  This research is expected to contribute to               several areas including computational geometry, geographic                      information systems, and to computer communications.",
