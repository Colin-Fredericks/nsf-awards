 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study the deep interior structure of the                      earth by fundamental and overtone modes, including body waves.                  They plan to perform three aspects of mantle structure study                    using digital data such as IDA (International Deployment of                     Accelerometers) and GDSN (Global Digital Seismograph Network).                  First they plan to invert overtone waveform data, which often                   appear on radial component seismograms.  Preliminary study                      suggests that the mantle structure down to about 900 km can be                  resolved.  But it also suggested that weighting of each datum                   is important to uniformly fit all seismograms, since the data                   consists of various size of earthquakes and various kinds of                    instruments.  Unless weighting is done, the results of seismic                  velocity patterns seem to be dominated by large earthquake                      data.  Careful analysis of inversion procedure is required in                   order to understand what are robust features in the solution.                   Secondly, they will attempt to retrieve attenuation structure                   from the same data set by inverting waveforms of fundamental                    and overtone modes in the time domain.  They will use odd and                   even number pairs of fundamental and overtone data such as R1                   and R3, G2 and G4 and X1 and X3, in order to avoid the problem                  of amplitude asymmetry and direct trade-off between estimated                   earthquake moment and attenuation measurement.  Thirdly, they                   plan to extend the frequency range of waveform inversion to 50                  mHz(20 seconds).  Extending the frequency is required to obtain                 structure below about 1000 km, because most of the overtone                     data, other than the X phases used in the above study, are from                 minor arc body waves.",
