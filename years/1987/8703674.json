 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the previous award, the investigators have developed                      the synthesis of 3'-amino-3'-deoxynucleotides and of short                      oligomers derived from them.  Using these compounds,                            oligomerization reactions both in the presence and absence of                   added oligonucleotide or oligodeoxynucleotide templates have                    been carried out.  Preliminary results indicate that an                         oligomer of the 3'-amino-3'-deoxynucleotides can act as a                       template to direct the synthesis of further molecules of the                    template.                                                                                                                                                       The first set of experiments proposed will be directed to the                   demonstration of autocatalysis in the simplest possible                         system:  the combination of the dinucleoside phosphoramidate                    GNHpCNH2 with the azide-derivative pGNHpCN3 to give the                         tetramer GNHpCNHpGNHpCN3.                                                                                                                                       The second set of experiments will study the \"open-ended\"                       oligomerization of pGNHpCNH2.  The earliest step in the                         reaction are expected to be simple, autocatalytic template-                     directed reactions.  However, elongation by \"sliding\" may                       become the predominant mechanism for longer oligomers.                                                                                                          The final set of experiments will study the copolymerization                    of pGNHpUNH2 and pANHpCNH2.  This reaction can, in principle,                   produce families of \"information-carrying\", replicating                         oligomers.  Consequently, it may provide an opportunity to                      study natural selection in a non-enzymatic system.  This                        would open us a novel area of polynucleotide chemistry.",
