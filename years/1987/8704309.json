 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will build initially an environment that supports Milner's         Calculus of Communicating Systems.  CCS provides a simple and general           model of concurrency based on processes communicating via ports, and is         also a formal system in which semantics is represented nonprocedurally,         i.e. via inference and equational rules.  The experiment with the CCS           environment will be performed by using it in several ongoing research           projects involving concurrent systems.  These experiments will provide          critical feedback on the environment's effectiveness.  The CCS                  environment will also serve as a laboratory to investigate how the              principles on which it is based extend to other languages.                                                                                                                                                                                      This is an attempt to develop understanding of environments for the             specification and design of concurrent systems.  Improved understanding         of such environments will be important in future designs.",
