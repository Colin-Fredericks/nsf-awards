 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is enhancing undergraduate training in experimental                psychology.  A three-field tachistoscope, with automatic card changers          and reaction time apparatus for key-press and voice responses, is being         used to expand laboratory assignments and original research projects in         areas of human information-processing that have used basic paradigms            involving timed presentation of visual stimuli.  The project is serving         undergraduates, primarily psychology majors (70% of whom are women),            enrolled in the following courses:  Sensation and Perception; Learning,         Memory, and Cognition; Language and Thought; General; Research Methods;         and Projects (i.e., faculty-supervised independent research).  Students         would use the tachistoscope in conducting laboratory replications of            experiments demonstrating important concepts (e.g., masking in iconic           memory, semantic priming) and in conducting original research                   investigating human information-processing theories.  Increasing                undergraduate experience in scientific research is intended to encourage        graduates to pursue doctoral training in experimental psychology.",
