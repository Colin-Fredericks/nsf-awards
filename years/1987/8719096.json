 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support a three day workshop for review of research            results based on measurements of strong ground motion made by the               SMART 1 array in Taiwan. SMART 1, installed in northeast Taiwan, with           joint support from NSF and from Taiwan's National Science Council               (NSC), is the first large digital array of strong motion seismographs           specially designed for engineering and seismological studies of the             generation and near-field properties of earthquakes.  The high                  quality, digital ground motion measurements recorded by SMART 1                 provide a useful resource for earthquake engineering research.                                                                                                  Under this award, eight U.S. scientists will travel to Taiwan to                review research results relevant to structural siting and                       geotechnical systems.  Participation of scientists from Taiwan will             be funded by the National Science Council of Taiwan.  This workshop             was approved at the 1987 annual joint staff meeting under the                   cooperative science program between the American Institute in Taiwan            and the Coordination Council for North American Affairs.",
