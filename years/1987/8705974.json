 "awd_abstract_narration": "Separation is an area of biotechnology where both fundamental and               developmental research are most needed.  The products that modern               biotechnology can produce often are limited by the effectiveness                of the separation process.  Separation is a major issue when                    biological activity, purity, and safety are of prime concern.                   Yet today, the general separation processes commonly used in                    biotechnology are those that are taken directly from the                        separation of organic and inorganic materials that are not as                   sensitive or complex as biological materials.  Consequently, when               used for the latter, these processes are slow, tedious, and                     generally ineffective.  Research separation in the biochemical area is          frequently based on modification of and minor improvements in the               conventional processes, with little regard for the sensitive nature of          biological materials.  To avoid these, a novel technique known as               \"interfacial condensation\" will be examined in this study for protein           purification.  This involves the use of two aqueous phases (with                polymers and salts) to precipitate the proteins at the interface                (i.e., between the                                                              two phases).                                                                                                                                                    Separation by interfacial condensation promises to:                                                                                                                  o    reduce or eliminate further concentration steps because                         of higher concentration of products and smaller volume                          of associated liquid;                                                                                                                                      o    simplify recovery of products; the interface can be                             recovered by draining or decanting aqueous phases;                                                                                                         o    provide additional purification effects with the                                combined exclusion and salting-out effects of two                               phases; and                                                                                                                                                o    simplify recycling or removal of aqueous polymers and                           salts.",
