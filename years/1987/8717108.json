 "awd_abstract_narration": "The U.S. research program in Antarctica over the last 30 years has              collected surface and upper air weather data at numerous locations.             Most of the year-round station data have been entered into the National         Climatic Data Center; other data are housed at a variety of                     institutions.  No attempt has been made to collate the data into one            set or to achieve a consistent format.  Most individual researchers             find using the data to be impracticable.                                                                                                                        Yet long-term records of antarctic weather are essential to an                  understanding of world weather patterns: the large-scale circulation of         the global atmosphere has its basic driving mechanism in the equator-           to-poles temperature gradients.  To predict and understand the behavior         of the atmosphere in any region, the behavior of the total global fluid         system must be understood.  Groups including the National Academy of            Sciences Polar Research Board, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic            Research, and The Polar Group have published reports pointing to the            need to improve access to antarctic weather data.                                                                                                               The current emphasis on global geosciences in the science community,            the advances in computer capability and networks, and the rise of               meteorological data analysis systems in the United States make the              establishment of a manipulable antarctic weather data set both                  desirable and achievable.                                                                                                                                       This 2-day workshop will assemble some 20 producers, managers, and              users of U.S. antarctic weather data--along with managers of new and            established nonantarctic weather data centers--to produce an achievable         plan for improving access to the antarctic sets.  NSF (Division of              Polar Programs) as manager of the United States Antarctic Research              Program will consider the recommended plan carefully and implement              procedures consistent with scientific need and funding availability.                                                                                            Roger Barry, a geographer with substantive research interests in                meteorology, and the Cooperative Institute for Research in                      Environmental Sciences are well suited to arrange this workshop.  CIRES         reported a Workshop on Antarctic Climate Data in 1984 and is active in          data management and information fields with an emphasis on polar                regions.",
