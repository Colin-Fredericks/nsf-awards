 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives and Relevancey: In a joint project, Dr. Victor Zakkay of New         York Univ. and Dr. V. Krishna Sastri of the Indian Institute of                 Technology, Madras, India, plan to conduct tests on the feasibility of          fluidized bed combustion in a 1 ft diameter test facility to be                 constructed at IIT, Madras, and in a 30 inch diameter facility already          in existence at NYU. The work will 1. test few selected U.S. and Indian         low grade coals; 2. identify optimal design for heat exchanger; 3.              evaluate air versus water cooled heat exchanger tubes; 4. test particle         attrition and hardness; and 5. freeboard heat transfer with and without         fins - over a wide range of parameters including bed pressure,                  temperature, particle size and bed height.  The U.S.-India Program              supports joint research where capabilities complement each other, and           where the research is in an area of interest to the two countries.  This        project meets these criteria.                                                                                                                                   Merit: The research is of interest to those countries that possess              significant deposits of low-grade coal including India, the U.S., as            well as several developing countries. The collaboration is likely to            accelerate the generation of PFBC data base on low grade fuel                   utilization and combustor scale up, both in India and the U.S. The              project is considered of high priority by the Government of India, and          it is expected to enhance the scientific collaboration between the two          countries.                                                                                                                                                      Funding: The project is being funded under two grants over a three year         period as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                              U.S. $      Ind.Cur. $                                                                                          INT86-16664 to NYU, Zakkay           FY87      39,039        7,344                                                   FY88      37,948        7,344                                                   FY89      37,785        7,344                                                                                              INT87-13949 to IIT, Madras, Sastri   FY87       ---         222,438                                                  FY88       ---          35,719                                                  FY89       ---          35,719                                                                                             INT and CBTE are equally sharing in the U.S. dollars funding.",
