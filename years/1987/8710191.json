 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Ph.D dissertation project studies the extent to which scientist's          judgments of evidence relevance and quality are affected by the                 strength and direction of their prior beliefs and by the degree of              their public commitment to a theoretical position.  The research will           determine the extent to which scientific judgments of evidence quality          deviate from the judgments of neutral observers as a function of the            extent to which the evidence meets the expectation of the judge, the            strength with which the expectations are held, and the extent to which          the judge is publicly committed to the belief.                                                                                                                  An important area of research on judgment and decision making involves          ambiguity and uncertainty of information and how individuals seek,              construct and evaluate evidence with which to reduce uncertainty and            how they incorporate uncertainty into their decisions.  Within this             context one of the more pressing topics involves the way individuals            perform these tasks unaided and whether performance can be improved             through training, decision aids or other means.",
