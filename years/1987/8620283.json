 "awd_abstract_narration": "Individuals of many animal species cooperate with each other            to the benefit of the cooperating group.  Some of the best and                  most obvious examples of such cooperation occur in family groups.               Indeed, selection to aid close relatives, \"kin selection\", likely               plays an important role in most cooperative animal groups.                      Because of their small size, abundance and ease of observation,                 many studies of animal cooperation have focused on insects,                     especially social insects (e.g., wasps and honey bees).  In both                of these groups, cooperating individuals are closely related,                   e.g., workers in a honey bee hive are sisters as are the multiple               queens that found some wasp colonies.  In contrast to this trend,               recent research has indicated relatedness is apparently                         unimportant among ant queens in those species which also found                  colonies cooperatively.  Such conclusions, however, are based on                behavioral observations, which provide only an indirect analysis                of relatedness among such cooperating individuals.  This project                will analyze directly the relatedness patterns of cooperating ant               queens.  Relatedness will be determined through an                              electrophoretic analysis of protein patterns of individuals from                cooperating groups (i.e., foundress associations) compared with                 populations as a whole.  Results from this work will contribute                 directly to efforts to understand selective forces that encourage               cooperation among individuals of the same species.",
