 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been demonstrated that it is possible to express                         site-specific bacterial methylase and endonuclease genes in                     eukaryotic cells.  In addition the expression of these genes                    appears to have no deleterious effect on the host cell.  In                     initial studies to express the PaeR7 methylase in mouse L                       cells, the levels of methylase produced varied greatly and                      were insufficient to protect the host cell genomes from the                     activities of the cognate endonucleases.  The problems that                     need to be solved now in this proposal, are (1) the                             incomplete methylation of cell genome by PaeR7 and (2) the                      inefficient restriction of infecting viral DNA.  In order to                    increase methylase and endonuclease activity, methods such as                   multiple rounds of transformation, selection of alternative                     promoters, gene amplification will be tried.  Hopefully, a                      stable expression of the bacterial restriction/modification                     system in animal cells will be achieved.  The ultimate goal                     of the project is to establish this system in cultured                          mammalian cells which would render them more resistant to                       viral infection.  Dr. Gingeras is eminently qualified to                        carry out this work.  Support if possible with a very good                      priority.",
