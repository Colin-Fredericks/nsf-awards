The program is designed to enable            U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research         institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well          as Japan, Australia and New Zealand.  Exchange awards provide                   opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of          unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental                  conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                                                Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to             his/her field of science, the prospective potential of the applicants           for professional growth, as well as criteria relevant to the furthering         of international cooperation in science and engineering.  The program           is particularly directed to scientists and engineers who are embarking          on their resesearch careers.                                                                                                                                    This research project is concerned with the role of polypeptide                 hormones and how they mediate the metabolic activities of different             cells in multicellular organisms.  A key to understanding the                   biological properties of hormonal proteins, both in normal and abnormal         metabolism, is their detailed molecular structure and dynamics.  The            general objective of the proposed research is to characterize the               structure, dynamics and function of avian pancreatic polypeptide (APP)          and bovine pancreatic polypeptide (BPP) in solution by modern nuclear           magnetic resonance techniques (NMR)                                                                                                                             The project is under the direction of Dr. Michael J. Bogusky,                   Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA           19104-6323, and Professor C. M. Dobson, Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory,         University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3QR, England.                                                                                                This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,              international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents                  allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat            administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
