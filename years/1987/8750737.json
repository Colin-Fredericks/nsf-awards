 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to develop a microcomputer based                 psychology student research laboratory.  Perhaps the most important             research tool of contemporary psychology is the microcomputer, with its         ability to present a variety of stimuli, and to collect subjects'               responses to them.  Thus, an important part of preparation for today's          undergraduates must involve providing them with opportunities to learn          to use microcomputers, to design, set up, and run psychological                 research, as well as to collect the data generated thereby, analyze it,         and prepare their findings for communication with other scholars.  The          project is providing such learning experiences for psychology students          across a spectrum of courses.  Students are being introduced to basic           procedures in their introductory courses, and to more advanced                  procedures in more advanced courses, including courses which                    specifically focus on principles and methods of research.  Funding              provided six APPLE microcomputers, peripheral hardware for Networking,          and selected software to complement the software library.",
