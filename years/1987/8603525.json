 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research project is to investigate (1) the effect of            ground motion on ground response, including earthquake motions                  sufficiently severe to induce liquefaction and (2) the associated soil-         pile interaction effects in liquefied soil deposits.                                                                                                            Loose and dense sand and salt samples will be subjected to horizontal           shaking similar to recorded earthquake accelerograms.  Instrumented             model piles and pile groups will be installed in the saturated soil for         the study of dynamic soil-pile interaction.  The models will be tested          in the geotechnical centrifuge at the California Institute of                   Technology, and the model tests will simulate a prototype soil deposit          with a depth of approximately 100 feet and subjected to ground                  accelerations in the range .05 to 0.5g.                                                                                                                         The objective of these tests is to determine:  (1) the effects of strain        levels on ground motions, (2) the ability of existing theories to               predict the observed linear and nonlinear soil behavior, and (3) the            conditions that lead to liquefaction and large permanent ground                 displacements.  The realization of these objectives will contribute             significantly to current procedures for assessing ground failure due to         liquefaction as well as to the methods used to design piles in offshore         areas located in seismic environments.                                                                                                                          Professor Scott is internationally recognized in this area of research          and has the institutional facilities available to conduct the research.
