 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interactions between the solar wind and the Earth's                 magnetosphere are responsible for the complex dissipative                       processes which control the dynamics of the near earth                          environment.  The study of these processes is the basic theme of                solar-terrestrial research.  The plasma sheet, its boundary                     layer, and the high latitude auroral region are of central                      importance in the understanding of these processes.                                     The existence of the plasma sheet in the geomagnetic tail               and the dawn-to-dusk electric field across the tail implies there               is a significant energization of the particles carrying the                     crosstail current.  This energization of particles in the tail                  represents ~2% of the total energy carried by the solar wind over               an area equal to the cross section of the dayside magnetosphere,                and thus this energization is an important, and perhaps the                     dominant means by which solar wind energy is transferred to                     magnetospheric particles.                                                               Current sheet acceleration of ions is responsible for the               unstable ion beams found in the plasma sheet boundary layer                     (PSBL).  The resulting motion of both ion and electron particle                 populations are the likely cause not only of the formation of the               isotropic plasma sheet, but of the high latitude potential                      structure responsible for discrete arcs in the auroral region.                  Discrete auroral arcs are associated with regions of upward                     current carried by downward precipitating electrons which have                  been accelerated through a field-aligned potential difference of                10,000votts.  Cold ionospheric ions are accelerated upward by the               same potential drop.                                                                    This grant is composed of three projects:  A) magnetotail               particle dynamics, B) broadband turbulence and particle diffusion               in the plasma sheet, and C) instabilities in the auroral                        acceleration region.  Both the magnetotail and the auroral region               are dynamically active and of central importance in the mechanics               of the magnetosphere.  They are also intimately coupled to each                 other.  Better understanding of the current and particle self-                  consistencies, acceleration mechanisms, and particle diffusion in               the magnetotail and interactions of beams in the auroral zone                   will lead to an improved global picture of the dynamics of the                  magnetosphere.",
