 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cornell University Biological Field Station is located              on one of the Northeast's largest freshwater lakes and is                       internationally recognized for research on the role of fish                     predators in ecosystem structure and function.  The facility has                been designated as part of the Experimental Ecological Reserve                  network of field sites dedicated to long.term experimental                      research.  Research designed to quantify the role of fish                       predation in structuring the aquatic community spans nearly three               decades at the Station and represents one of the longest records                of its type in North America.  A combination of a well.equipped                 facility, a commitment to long.term research, and a dedicated                   research staff has resulted in numerous peer.reviewed                           publications and a 28.year data set on Oneida Lake.                                     This project will provide funds to replace a vessel on loan             from the New York State Department of Environmental                             Copnservation.  The vessel is key to the continued development of               multidisciplinary research on Oneida Lake and is necessary to                   maintain the long.term commitment to determining indices of fish                abundance that was begun in 1957.",
