 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives and Relevancy:  This project provides support for                    collaboration by Dr. Richard J. Fragaszy of the Department of Civil             Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, and Dr. Farhat H.        Siddiqi of the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR),         Islamabad, Pakistan.  The two scientists plan to study and evaluate             existing models for predicting static and cyclic strength behavior of           soils containing oversized particles.  They plan to test specimens of           selected prototype soils with various maximum size particles similar to         those used in earth-filled foundations and earth-filled dams.  They plan        to study the effects of grain shape and silt/clay content on material           behavior. Static and cyclic tests on 6 inch diameter specimens will be          conducted at Washington State Univ.  All soil classification tests as           well as static and cyclic tests for the molded specimens of 1.4 and 2.8         inch diameter will be conducted in Pakistan.  The U.S.-Pakistan Program         supports joint projects where the capabilities of the participants              complement each other, and the research area is important to both               countries.  This project meets these criteria well.                                                                                                             Merit:  The project is quite important to Pakistan where large dams for         irrigation and for power generation are usually built of earth                  materials. A better understanding of the strength of these materials can        help improve the design of the  structures.  In the U.S. the results can        benefit those designing canals and embankments or designing structures          for earthquake conditions.  The Pakistani scientist has worked on this          problem while at the University of California, Davis and Berkeley, and          has developed specific modeling hypotheses which will be tested in this         project.  The U.S. scientist is actively engaged in this area of                research. The project is likely to strengthen the collaboration between         Pakistan and the U.S. in science and engineering.                                                                                                               Funding:  The project is being funded under two grants:                                                                                                             1.
