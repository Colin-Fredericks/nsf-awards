The general topic of the research project is the                     roles which metal ions play in biological systems. Research                     will be pursued on two fronts: exploring the structural and                     functional roles of metals in novel gene regulatory                             metalloproteins and developing the chemistry of oxygen                          activating metal complexes containing biological ligands. The                   immediate targets are metalloproteins that play key roles in                    cellular metabolism of heavy metals, particularly those                         regulating gene expression or mediating heavy metal                             detoxification. In particular, attention will be given to                       metalloregulatory proteins which act as metal-responsive                        molecular switches, sensing changes in metal ion concentrations                 and adjusting the expression of relevant genes. On the second                   front the activation of oxygen by metal-nucleotide complexes                    will be investigated. Of particular interest is the mechanism                   by which mixtures of ADP and Fe(II) promote lipid peroxidation                  by molecular oxygen. Iron nucleotide complexes will be isolated                 and characterized, and the mechanism of activation of oxygen                    and their utility as epoxidation catalysts will be explored.",
