 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is to explore the integration of             vision and tactile sensing in complex robotic tasks such as                     manipulation and assembly.  The research is being carried on in                 two separate projects.  The first is the creation of a multi-arm                robotic test bed that utilizes high speed, frame-rate vision                    sensing to track a moving part.  The visiion system is mounted on               a robotic arm and the servo control of the arm is modified by the               vision sensing.  The vision system will utilize pyramids and                    scale-space in order to segment and track the objects in real-                  time.Attached to the robotic arm is an intelligent tactile                      sensor/gripper that can monitor contact forces and moments,                     resulting in the secure and stable grasping of the moving part by               the visually-servoed gripper.  Once the object is grasped, it can               be used in coordinated assembly tasks using the two robotic arms.                       The second project involves the Utah/MIT dextrous hand.  The            first task is to build a set of higher-level primitives have been               defined, they can be combined into a grasping language to create                programs of grasping/manipulation sequences.  The next task is to               develop and evaluate new tactile sensors to be used with the hand               in order to support the requirements of intelligent grasping.                   With the addition of tactile sensory feedback, a hybrid control                 algorithm will be developed for the hand that utilizes position,                force and tactile feedback for hand control.",
