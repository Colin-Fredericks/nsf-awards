 "awd_abstract_narration": "This field-based research project will collect information on the               variety of ways in which software design decisions are associated with          values of consequence to designers, the design organization, the user           organization, employees and the public.  It will document the extent to         which designers themselves give explicit consideration to values trade-         offs in making design decisions.  The goal is to enhance understanding          of the influences on and of software design, and to create a set of             descriptive cases, with analyses, that educators can use to help                designers become more aware of the value-related dimensions of their            work.  As designers and users attend to the value implications of their         decisions, the positive effects of new technologies can be enhanced.                                                                                            This project will make a unique contribution to professional and public         understanding of values issues and trade-offs associated with computer          software design.  The investigative team and consultants are very well          qualified to undertake the research and develop the case studies.   The         team has very good institutional support and access to the                      organizations in which the field studies will be done.  The research            design is very appropriate for this exploratory phase; costs are very           reasonable; and results are likely to be widely distributed and useful.         Total support in the amount of $75,000 is recommended, with $36,363 to          be awarded now and $38,637 in the next fiscal year.",
