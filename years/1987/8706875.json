 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will undertake a detailed petrologic and isotopic                  study of volcanic rocks associated with mid-Tertiary, large-                    magnitude extension in the eastern Basin and Range Province.  The               goals are to: 1) completely characterize this moderate- to high-K               calcalkalic suite; 2) petrogenetically model compositional                      changes in the suite with continued extension; and 3) evaluate                  the relative chemical and isotopic contributions of the                         continental crust and underlying mantle.                                        At the onset of extension (-39 Ma), it appears that volcanism was               crudely bimodal (silicic andesite to dacite, and high-silica                    rhyolite) and was characterized by small eruptions from scattered               vents.  At -35 Ma, volcanism shifted to dacite to low-silica                    rhyolite compositions erupted as voluminous, areallly extensive                 tuffs and lavas.  Existing models for magmatism in the region                   suggest a contribution ranging from zero to as much as 50% of mantle-           derived magmas.  The compositional and isotopic diversity of the                suite suggest a complex petrogenetic history involving several                  magma sources during early stages of magmatism, followed by                     large-scale mixing of these magmas in the middle (?) crust with                 continued extension and heat input.  The proposed work is                       multifaceted, including field, petrologic and isotopic studies                  which will compliment ongoing research efforts in the area                      dealing with the structure, metamorphism, and isotopic                          composition of the basement rocks.",
