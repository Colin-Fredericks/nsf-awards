 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will exploit a unique developmental system (in                which mesophyll cells of \u001aZinnia\u001a \u001aelegans\u001a differentiate in                    suspension culture to form tracheary elements with distinctly                   patterned secondary walls) in order to obtain a more integrated                 view of how higher plant cells initiate and control the                         deposition of a patterned wall.  Five major areas of reserach                   will be conducted to meet this goal: (1) Light and electron                     microscopy to clarify the timing and cytology of differentiation;               (2) Investigation of the role of microtubules; (3) Investigation                of the role of microfilaments; (4) Investigation of the role of                 the Golgi apparatus and the functional life of rosettes                         (particles associated with cellulose synthesis) in the plasma                   membrane; and (5) Investigation of calcium.mediated events                      critical to the initiation and continuation of differentiation.                 Light and electron microscopy (coupled with immunochemical and                  cytochemical probes) will be used to monitor changes in                         differentiation.related cellular processes before and after                     application of antagonistic drugs.                                                  The results of this study will increase our knowledge of how                diverse cellular features function together in the control of a                 well.defined developmental event.  They will also enhance our                   understanding of the control of plant morphogenesis, which is                   partly determined by the pattern of microfibrils in cell walls.",
