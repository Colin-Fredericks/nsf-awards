 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a portion of the work of the                    Arcadia project.  Arcadia is a major, joint research effort                     the aim of which is to gain fundamental understandings about                    desirable architectures for the integration of software tools                   into environments and particularly in support of software                       testing, analysis and evaluation.  Arcadia is an experimental                   research project which aims to gain these understandings                        through the creation and experimental evaluation of an actual                   environment prototype--Arcadia-1.  A key innovative feature                     of the approach being taken by Arcadia is to consider                           software processes to be items of software themselves and to                    view an environment as a mechanism for specifying, compiling                    and interpreting these processes, using software workers as                     intepretation primitives.                                                                                                                                       The University of Colorado's participation in the Arcadia                       project will focus on formalisms and media for the expression                   of software processes--an activity which is referred to as                      process programming--on architectures and implementations of                    environments for the support of process programming and on the                  creation, integration and evaluation of software testing,                       analysis and evaluation tools.                                                                                                                                  Major experimental research efforts are needed to provide                       basic understandings of overall software development                            environments.  The Arcadia project is a significant effort                      toward achieving those understandings.",
