 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents a continuation of work on the theory            of quasiconformal mappings on the Heisenberg group.  Problems of                global distortion, extension theorems and relaxation of                         smoothness conditions present in existing results will be                       treated.  The same problems will also be considered on general CR               manifolds with positive Levi form with applications to complex                  variable theory.  A second thrust will be made in the direction                 of harmonic analysis on symmetric cones.  With the use of Jordan                algebras a theory of special functions will be developed.  In                   addition, boundary behavior of harmonic functions on symmetric                  spaces will be analyzed through the use of Tits buildings.  In                  this context a generalized Luzin area function will be sought.                  Finally, the generalization of the geometric properties of the                  Heisenberg group to so-called H-type groups will be carried out.                        The work planned relates to several areas of mathematics,               including classical function theory and quasiconformal mapping.                 Other applications to the gamma function, boundary behavior in                  potential theory and the Plancherel theorem can be made.  New                   insights into the holomorphic equivalence problem are possible",
