 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have isolated and sequenced a gene from petunia (GRP1) which codes           for a glycine rich structural protein (67% gly).  The carboxyterminal           320 amino acids of the protein sequences can be described by the formula        Gly-X-Gly-X, and should form a large b-pleated sheet.  GRP1 is only the         fourth class of structural proteins to be identified in plants.  We have        found that GRP1 RNA expression is developmentally regulated and enhanced        by wounding.  In addition, the predicted amino acid sequence of GRP1            shows that it contains an optimal signal sequence for transport out of          the cytoplasm.  Our working hypothesis therefore is that the GRP1 gene          product functions as a cell wall protein.  In this proposal we will             determine the possible organ specificity of GRP1 RNA, determine the             kinetics of the wound response and determine at what level GRP1 RNA             expression is controlled.  Using a variety of anti-GRP1 antiboidies             raised against synthetic peptide sequences specific to GRP1, we will            determine:  (1) the subcellular location of the GRP1 gene product, (2)          its possible organ and/or cellular specificity and (3) monitor GRP1             protein accumulation in developing or wounded cells.                            Little is known about the structural proteins of plants.  Dr. Carol             Condit of the University of Georgia isolated and characterized a gene           from petunia which encodes a glycine-rich structural protein.  The              protein, based upon codon usage, contains 67% glycine and a signal              sequence for transport of the cytoplasm. The epxression of the gene is          enhanced by wounding.  These characteristics strongly suggest that it is        a cell wall protein.  Dr. Condit proposes to extend these studies by            determining the subcellular location of the protein, determining its            organ or cellular specifity and monitoring its response to wounding.            This work should result in important basic information on plant                 structural proteins, wound response and mechanisms of transport in              plants.",
