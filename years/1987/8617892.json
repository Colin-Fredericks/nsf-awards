 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is found in a variety of structural                 Forms in mammalian nerve and muscle tissues.  These forms are                   different multimers of catalytic subunits, which appear highly                  related by enzymological and immunological critieria.  Some                     heterogeneity among subunits is generated by post.translational                 modifications of the catalytic subunit.  Dr. Rosenberry will                    determine the extent to which multiple AChE genes, distinct                     messenger RNAs (mRNA), and post.transcriptional processing                      contribute to the diversity of AChE forms.  He has isolated a                   cDNA clone from a human brain cDNA library which encodes protein                sequences highly related to those found in Torpedo AChE, BuChE,                 and Torpedo AChE protein sequences will allow the confirmation of               a clone as one encoding AChE or BuChE.  Molecular techniques                    (nucleic acid sequencing and restriction enzyme mapping) will                   reveal whether multiple AChE cDNAs exist, the primary amino acid                sequence of AChE catalytic subunits, whether multiple catalytic                 subunits exists, and by inference, the diversity of AChE mRNAs.                 The latter point will be confirmed by hybridization of AChE                     clones to Northern blot transfers of mRNA from tissues expressing               different AChE forms.  These cDNA clones will ultimately allow                  him to isolate genomic AChE DNA clones.  The diversity or                       singularity of AChE gene sequences can then be determined and the               relation to AChE mRNA forms examined.  Once AChE cloned sequences               are obtained, and the nature of AChE gene and mRNA heterogeneity                examined, the materials and information will be available to                    undertaker examination of the physiological factors regulating                  the expression of diverse AChE forms.",
