 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Tate plans to investigate the political and policymaking               role of the Philippine Supreme Court from 1965 to the present.                  The data base for the study is comprised of some 12,000 cases,                  interviews with justices of the Supreme Court and Court of                      Appeals, and mailed questionnaire surveys to a sample of trial                  court judges and members of the legal profession.  Based on these               data sources, Dr. Tate is able to quantify numerous aspects of                  the institutional role of the Philippine Court over time and                    undertake complex multivariate analyses focusing on the impact of               such events as President Marcos' declaration of martial law or                  the assignment of increased administrative and supervisory duties               to the Court.  Also, time series analyses can assess the impact                 on the Court of annual variables like macroeconomic indicators of               the health of the economy.  The data sets combined permit placing               the Court in its political and legal system contexts, analyzing                 its institutional performance and decisionmaking, and identifying               the patterns of change and continuity as it adapts to radically                 changed political surroundings.  This study has considerable                    scientific promise.  It offers the opportunity to examine the                   political role of courts not only outside of the American context               but also in a setting that serves as a natural experiment because               of major regime changes through the period in question.  Thus, it               should substantially advance knowledge of the interrelationship                 between politics, political regimes, and the judicial process.",
