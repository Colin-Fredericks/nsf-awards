 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide renewed support to the Lamont-Doherty                 Geological Observatory of Columbia University for shipboard technician          activities associated with the research vessel CONRAD.  This is an              extensively instrumented, 209-foot ship that is operated by the                 University, and is specially outfitted for geological and geophysical           research.  A significant portion of the ship's operating schedule               during 1987 is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.                                                                                                   The Shipboard Technician Program has two components: an at-sea                  component and an ashore component.  The at-sea component consists of            instructing scientific personnel in the use of shared shipboard                 equipment; maintenance, repair, and calibration of scientific                   instrumentation; instruction and supervision of deck operations; and            providing logistics assistance to on-coming and off-going scientific            parties.  On shore activities include the maintenance, repair, and              calibration of shared use seagoing equipment and assisting scientific           personnel in preparing for field work on the vessel.  Shipboard                 technicians funded by this award have broad responsibilities for                providing the coordination and assistance needed for the successful             completion of research projects at sea.  The level of activity and              amount of support are closely related to the vessel's operating areas           and schedule for the calendar year, the size and capability of the              vessel, and its scientific outfit and capability.",
