 "awd_abstract_narration": "Forty junior high school science teachers from eleven school districts          will participate in a  four week workshop at the University of Southern         Mississippi.  Instruction on leadership development, content enrichment,        and process skill development will be provided during the workshop.             Field trips that will  enhance the instructional program for students           will be taken by the participants in the summer workshop.  Materials            development and evaluation of materials that are effective for classroom        use will be addressed during the workshop also.                                                                                                                 Each participant will conduct  a minimum of two in-service workshops for        other teachers in their local school districts during the academic year.        A primary objective of this workshop is to involve the participants in          meaningful activities which they can use in their classrooms rather than        providing additional theory only.  Provisions are made for school               administrators to participate in these in-service activities that will          be conducted by the teachers.                                                                                                                                   The participating schools districts and the university staff have made          strong commitments to support the in-service phase of this project.             Some districts are purchasing additional equipment while others are             providing release time and other forms of support.  The university staff        will visit classrooms in each of the school districts and serve as a            clearinghouse and resource center for the area.",
