 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to determine the fundamental                     chemical and physical properties of the \"net 19-electron adducts\"               which are formed in the reactions of 17-electron organometallic                 radicals with ligands which donate two electrons.  The electronic               structures, geometries, reactivities and formation thermodynamics               of the 19-electron adducts will be investigated.  The electronic                structures are of particular interest.  Since only nine valence                 orbitals are available on the metal atom, the nineteenth electron               must enter an antibonding orbital.  The thermodynamics of adduct                formation will be measured and the factors affecting adduct                     stability will be investigated.                                                                                                                                 Organometallic compounds are an important class of industrial                   catalysts and include the most promising comounds for use as                    catalysts in converting light energy into chemical energy and                   electrical energy.  The molecules which will be studied are an                  important class of intermediates which are formed in light-                     induced reactions of organometallic compounds.  The results of                  this study are expected to be useful in understanding                           photocatalytic processes involving organometallic species and in                designing new photocatalytic schemes.  Dr. David R. Tyler is a                  leader in this area of research who was extremely productive                    under a previous NSF grant.",
