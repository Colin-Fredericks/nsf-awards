 "awd_abstract_narration": "Late Cenozoic marine deposits blanketing terraces and coastal plains            in western and northern Alaska provide an exceptionally detailed                record of high sea level events, the most complete known in any part            of the Arctic.  Interbedded with glacial drift sequences, these                 deposits contain an invaluable almanac of Arctic paleoclimates, and             establish the time of origin and much of the subsequent history of the          Arctic Ocean ice cover.  Fossils in the late Cenozoic marine deposits           also record both marine and continental dispersal events and thus               supplement and interoceanic correlations.                                                                                                                       This investigation will apply amino-acid geochronology,                         thermoluminescence, and paleomagnetic studies to marine transgressive           deposits exposed on St. Lawrence Island, Seward Peninsula, and around           Kotzebue Sound in order to evaluate and correct previously published            age correlations.  The study will thus result in a much firmer                  knowledge of the extent and timing of sea-level changes in western and          northern Alaska and will provide an extremely useful series of time             planes for the development of synoptic knowledge of Arctic                      paleoclimates and paleo-oceanographic regimes.",
