 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, the introduction of expert testimony in                   court has become increasingly common.  It has been estimated that               scientific evidence is now presented in about a third of all                    trials and in almost every major civil case.  Despite the                       importance of understanding how legal decisionmakers respond to                 and use scientific evidence presented in court, there is scant                  research on jurors or on the judiciary itself.  Dr. Brekke seeks                to tackle this important scientific issue with respect to the                   jury.  She plans to undertake two experiments that focus on the                 impact of expert scientific testimony, specifically on how jurors               evaluate expert testimony and on how personal and contextual                    factors (e.g., jurors' motivation, the complexity of the                        testimony, adversary versus nonadversary mode of presentation)                  influence these judgments.  This work represents an important                   advance on the literature in several respects.  Realistic case                  simulations (with the expert testimony embedded in a natural way)               are used; experts are cross-examined or faced with testimony from               opposing experts, and a broader range of potential impacts                      (including negative as well as positive effects) are examined.                  In addition, since jurors may be more skeptical of some forms of                scientific evidence than others, these studies are designed to                  illuminate juror responses to various types of expert testimony.",
