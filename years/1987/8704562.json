 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with understanding the so-called                Monster Group.  There are three directions which the principal                  investigator will consider.  One is to consider the relations                   between the group-characters of the Monster and certain classical               modular forms.  The second is the constructions of the group in                 198684-dimension space.  the third is the representation of the                 group in terms of hyperbolic reflections.                                            This research is in the general area of finite group theory.               It is concerned with studying a particular group called the                     Monster Group.  This group is not well understood but has a very                rich structure.  At present calculations in the group are                       difficult, but whenever they have been performed successfully,                  wonderful and simple patterns have emerged.  There are deep                     connections with other branches of mathematics and it seems quite               likely that there are equally fundamental connections with                      theoretical physics.",
