During  the lectures and discussions the current status of practice and         methodologies will be critically assessed.  The participants will pay           particular attention to the future directions open to wind engineering          and its potential for solving problems in building design transport of          hazardous materials, and energy production.                                                                                                                     The meeting will be hosted by the Fluid Dynamics and Wind Engineering           Program  Department of Civil Engineering, Colorado State University.            Graduates from this program now operating in universities, industry and         government in the U.S. and abroad, as well as world renowned specialists        will participate.  The P.I. is highly qualified to carry out this task.         In consequence, an award is recommended.",
