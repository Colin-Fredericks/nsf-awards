 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent acquisition of a core set of ecological instrumentation is           making it possible for this Department to expand its upper-level courses        as well as to widen the range of the student-oriented research projects         it can offer.  This development project thus forms an integral part of          an ongoing University plan to emphasize the sciences.                                                                                                           The specific impact of this project is on undergraduate instruction in          Ecology and the Environmental Sciences.  Among the new resources now            available to the students are an oceanographic field kit, portable              conductivity/salinity meter, dissolved oxygen and biological oxygen             demand meter, core sampler and electronic soil testing lab, recording           weather station, air quality monitoring devices, and sophisticated              laboratory apparati for studying environmental samples brought in from          the field for more exacting analysis.  This improvement will result in a        better prepared graduate of the University who in turn will be better           able to perform at the professional level after graduation.  The                Caribbean area in particular and tropical America in general are in             urgent need of trained ecologists to help stem the current catastrophic         losses of such natural resources as forest cover, soils and biological          diversity, and to help cope with the effects of such losses.",
