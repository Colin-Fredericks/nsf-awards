 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            established to provide support to strengthen the research environments          and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions or                      institutions that have substantial minority student enrollments.                Eligible institutions must also have graduate programs in science or            programs in engineering.  Funding is provided for faculty research in           fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and for           the acquisition of research instrumentation.  Meharry Medical College           will use RIMI support to establish core neurohistological and                   radioimmunoassay laboratories.  These facilities will primarily                 enhance the development of research in neuroscience and physiology at           Meharry.                                                                                                                                                        This project will promote the strengthening of a research environment           that encourages effective collaborations between investigators.  The            principal investigator has published widely in refereed journals and            has commendable experience as a university administrator.  The                  Foundation has supported this project because opportunities for more            minorities to participate in meritorious research in neuroscience and           related areas will be possible.",
