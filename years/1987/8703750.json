 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes a series of experiments aimed at                        addressing the questions of the stability of crystal surfaces at                elevated temperatures.  The relationship of three types of                      instabilities on the relatively open surfaces of metals are                     particularly interesting; surface roughening, surface melting,                  and irreversible surface reconstructions.  Metal surfaces are                   exceptional candidates to study all three instabilities since the               temperatures for these different structural transformations                     (whether already measured or theoretically predicted) are all                   very similar for this face.  All of these studies require                       detailed information on the temperature dependence of the long                  range correlations.  This information will be obtained through                  accurate measurements of low energy electron diffraction                        profiles.  Understanding roughening on metal surfaces will be of                extreme interest since the high concentration of active                         adsorption sites present above the roughening temperature are                   critical to many important catalytic processes.  In addition,                   surface roughening and surface melting are now recognized as                    important factors in the growth of semiconductor superlattices                  and metal-semiconductor interfaces.",
