 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drilling holes in hard rock for excavation and mining construction is           generally carried out with rotary percussion drills.  While advances            have been made in percussion drilling in the past twenty years including        tungsten carbide inserts, hydraulic actuation and water jet process is          till classified as slow and expensive.  New concepts of drilling with           high pressure water jets containing abrasives have shown considerable           promise and could significantly improve productivity in rock drilling.                                                                                          The research program will involve the design, fabrication and testing of        a novel abrasive/water jet drill capable of drilling in hard rock at            high speed with no moving mechanical components.  The design                    incorporates a drill head with a high pressure nozzle to form a water           jet.  Abrasives are fed into the jet in the spreader section after the          high velocity jet has been formed.  The design and fabricaiton of the           drillhead will be evaluated to determine the drilling parameters                including water pressure, water flow rate, abrasive type, abrasive flow         rate, abrasive size and stand-off distance for different penetration            rates.                                                                                                                                                          Flow Industries have extensive experience in developing abrasive water          jet cutting systems for a variety of industrial applications including          turning, milling, cutting and surface finishing.  The principal                 investigator has over 15 years experience with water jets and is a              leading authority in the field.  We anticipate a successful development         which could lead to major cost reduction in hard rock drilling operation        on an international scale.                                                                                                                                      An award is recommended.                                                        8612876                                                                         RUDNICKI                                                                        This is a cooperative research with the Department of Energy (DOE).  DOE        provides the facility and technical personnel to perform experimental           verfication for the analysis on shear localization of geo-materials.            The research applies recent solid mechanics advances to understand shear        localization behavior and develope a verified approach to predict the           stability of geo-materials such as rock and concrete structures.                                                                                                The main goal of this work is to understand the physical process of             strain localization in geo-materials and provide a theoretical framework        for the extrapolation of laboratory observations to applications.  The          research performs comprehensive studies on shear localization in rocks          and other geo-materials that exhibit                                            sensitivity of inelastic deformation and inelastic volume change.  The          studies combine theoretical analyses with computational and experimental        work.                                                                                                                                                           Improved constitutive relations for multiaxial and inelastic deformation        will be formulated and a framework will be developed for the use of             constitutive models in numerical codes.  Specifically, shear rupture in         pressure-sensitive and inelastically compressible solids will be                investigated based on models involving bifurcation from homogeneous             deformation.  The investigations of localization will then be use with          experimental observations and numerical calculations to study the               performance of inelastic constitutive relations for multiaxial                  deformation of geo-structures.                                                                                                                                  The Principal Investigator is a leader in this area of mechanics                research applied to strain localization.  This cooperative research is          cost effective and addresses a critical problem in Solid and                    Geomechanics research.",
