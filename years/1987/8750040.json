 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemometrics has been defined as the field in which mathematical and            statistical techniques are used to extract valuable, but often hidden,          information from measurements. Its introduction into the undergraduate          curriculum has been recommended by the American Chemical Society. The           Chemistry Department at Colorado College is implementing the                    introduction of chemometrics into the undergraduate curriculum through          the recent acquisition of a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer with        selected spectral libraries and an enhanced library search package              attachments. In addition to the usual infrared spectroscopy acitivities,        use of this system is providing students with experiences in fourier            transforms and computerized spectral searches. The courses impacted             include organic chemistry, quantitative analysis, advanced analytical           topics, reaction mechanisms and syntheses, theoretical spectroscopy, and        research participation.",
