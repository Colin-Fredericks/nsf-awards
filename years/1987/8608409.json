 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to develop a new method of analysis for                   non-synchronous automatic assembly systems.  This method                        utilizes recent advances in queuing theory and is based on a                    series of approximations developed in the theory of queues.                     This advanced technique is very promising for the application                   proposed in this research, however substantial modification                     will be required to produce a practical engineering method.                     This proposal will develop these modifications and,in                           particular, will develop the necessary methods to analyze                       circular assembly systems.  Extensive experiments using real                    industry data will be conducted to verify the new approach.                     Methods will be system, to generate thermal property data for                   use in the casting solidification simulation software, to                       investigate high efficiency computational techniques, and to                    investigate heat flux control during solidification by means of                 heat pipe devices. Analytical and experimental methods will be                  employed.                                                                            The results of the proposed research should provide useful                 methodology and software for an important U.S. industry, i.e.                   the foundry industry, and should contribute to improved                         efficiency and quality in castings manufacturing.  The work                     complements joint research to be conducted at another                           university (University of Michigan).",
