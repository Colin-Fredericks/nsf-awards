 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rise of \"Big\" science in the post World War II era has brought              with it large, expensive instruments and the necessity of team                  research.  The nature and social organization of science have been              radically altered.  There is much that needs to be learned about the            impact of these instruments of big science.  Dr. Sullivan's                     exhaustive study of the growth of radio astronomy, begun under                  several previous grants from the History and Philosophy of Science              Program of the NSF, will certainly provide us with an critical study            of one area where the transformation from 'small' to 'big' science              has occurred.  Dr. Sullivan is investigating the worldwide                      development of radio and radar astronomy from the first unsuccessful            attempts in the 1890's until the explosive growth of the early                  1960's.  A major source of information has been 250 taped interviews            with virtually all of the men and women who shaped the history.                 Careful study in radio observatory and private archives and libraries           around the world has also been undertaken.  He has paid special                 attention to the manner in which radio astronomy grew as a discipline           out of radio and radar engineering as well as ionospheric physics,              and how it eventually became an accepted part of astronomy itself.              Under this grant, Dr. Sullivan will complete the first portion of his           study.  The completed work will emphasize the intellectual history of           the field, the important interaction between science and technology             as the field developed, and the characters and motivations of the men           and groups who pioneered in the field and subsequently contributed to           its growth.  This research will carry the study up to 1951.  A                  succeeding volume will carry the research through the 1960's.",
