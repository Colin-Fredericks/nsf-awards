 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research is underway to extend the range of temperatures in which metal         chemistry is understood.  Also to be studied are the reactions                  involving metallic oxides and monohalides.  This higher range (up to            1900K) requires the design of a pseudo static photochemistry reactor            (HTP) where reactions can be initiated and monitored without wall               interference.  In these experimental conditions where the wall                  limitations disappear, the former, well understood, fast flow technique         (HTFFR) can be used in addition, and the cross validation of these two          methods become possible.  The addition of an excimer laser would make           possible the photolytic generation of a broad range of metals from              their compounds.  The reactions contemplated involve Mn, Ba, Cu, Al and         Ca.  The presence of these elements in fly ash and soot is the cause of         problems of corrosion fouling or even dust explosions.  Conversely,             some industrial processes (e.g. carbon black generation, chemical vapor         deposition in electronics manufactures) depend on such chemical                 activities.  The impact on such new knowledge on industrial practice            could be substantial.",
