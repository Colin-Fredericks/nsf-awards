 "awd_abstract_narration": "The textile industry is under severe pressure from foreign                 competition.  Industry is recognizing that research may help lead               the way to alleviate some of this pressure.  An                                 Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Textiles offers              the potential to provide some help.  Clemson University proposes                to study the feasibility and viability of establishing such a                   Center.                                                                              This award is to study the organizational and policy                       alternatives of the industrial interests in university research                 projects, and the potential to form an Industry/university                      Cooperative Research Center.                                                         The Co-Principal Investigators and their colleagues have the               necessary expertise and industrial involvement to undertake this                project.                                                                             This study has been coordinated with Dr. Tapan Mukherjee,                  Program Director, Division of Critical Engineering Systems.                          The Program Manager recommends that Clemson University be                  awarded a $25,000 planning grant for a one (1) year study.                           All future awards are to be on the basis of a new proposal.",
