 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research program is proposed which will yield additional                  experimental data pertinent to two environmental problems of current            interest.  These problems are the possible perturbation of the                  stratospheric ozone layer by man's activities and the possible change           in climate caused by the increase in atmospheric concentration of               radiatively active compounds (CO2, CH4, N2O, etc).  Data pertinent to           these two problems will be obtained by the analysis of infrared solar           spectra obtained from the ground at various locations (Denver, Mauna            Loa and Lauder, New Zealand) at various times of the year.  Solar               spectra will be obtained at various altitudes and solar zenith angles           by means of balloons.  The ground based spectra will be used to study           the temporal and spatial variability of the stratospheric column                density of HCl, HNO3, ClONO2.  They will also be used to compare the            absorption features due to CH4, CO2, N2O, O3 and H2O with theoretical           calculations of the same feature based on our knowledge from other              measurements (GMCC, Dobson, rawinsonde, etc).  Differences between              the calculated and observed spectra will be examined to determine the           cause of the disagreement.  The spectra obtained during the balloon             flight will be used to determine the distribution of various                    constituents with altitude particularly in the stratosphere.  Profile           data will be obtained for HCl, HNO3, ClONO2, NO, NO2, HNO4, CH4 and             N2O and the high resolution spectra will be examined for absorption             due to other compounds which are predicted to be present (HOCl, H2O2)           but have not been observed in solar spectra obtained at lower                   resolution.                                                                         Atmospheric emission spectra will be obtained both from the                 ground and from various altitudes up to 40 km using a balloon-borne             spectrometer system.  Spectra will be obtained while viewing various            angles close to the earth's limb and the nadir.  These spectra will             be used to obtain altitude profile data for NO2, N2O5, ClONO2, HNO3,            O3, and H2O.  The change in concentrations of these compounds with              time during sunrise and/or sunset will also be measured.",
