 "awd_abstract_narration": "IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology) is a           consortium of research institutions created to implement critically             needed national facilities for support of seismological research on the         Earth's interior in the coming quarter century.  IRIS has a membership          of 50 universities and includes nearly all U.S. universities with               seismological research programs.  IRIS will act as the agent of NSF in          implementing IRIS programs.  Coordination with other federal agencies           (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), U.S. Geological             Survey (USGS), Department of Energy (DOE) is effected by an interagency         accord.                                                                                 The FY 1987-89 Program Plan and Budget for IRIS has been                reviewed and approved by the National Science Board at its August, 1986         meeting. The FY 1987 budget for IRIS is $3,700,000 (15 months) which            consists of $3,600,000 to be awarded directly to IRIS and $100,000 to be        transferred directly to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) as                    reimbursement for USGS services performed for IRIS under the terms of           the interagency accord mentioned above.  This action provides for the           transfer of the $100,000 to the USGS.",
