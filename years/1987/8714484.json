 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funds to support travel expense for                 several non US scientists to attend and present talks at the                    1987 Gordon Research Conference of chemical Oceanography, an                    important forum for a broad exchange of ideas and information                   in the expanding field of marine geochemistry.  The central                     theme of the summer 1987 meeting is non-steady state variation                  in key processes that control chemical distributions in marine                  environments  Significant work in this area has been                            accomplished by a number of distinguished foreign scientists                    which have agreed to participate in the meeting.                                        Benefits from participation of internationally recognized               foreign participants to the U.S. Community are obvious.  Many                   current marine geocheimcal research programs incorporate a                      global scale perspective and will benefit from increased                        international exchange of ideas.  The Gordon Research                           Conference provides a unique opportunity for developing closer                  contacts with distinguised leaders for a number of countries.",
