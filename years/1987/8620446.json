 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous research concerning the effects of the 1983 California                 El Nino on living radiolarians in the plankton and the                          recognition of El Nino events in sediments is proposed to be                    continued in an attempt to recognize that 1983 event, documented                in the plankton, in the sediments from three anaerobic southern                 California basins.  Radiolarians from plankton tows taken during                the initiation, peak, and waning of the 1983 El Nino displayed a                sequence of radiolarian characteristics of each phase of that El                Nino (initiation, peak, and waning).  Preliminary investigations                of box-core material collected from the Santa Barbara Basin in                  the summer of 1985 suggest that this same sequence may be                       preserved in the surficial sediment of that basin.  A new method                of freezing that surficial and shallow sediment immediately after               coring has allowed collection of the most complete intact                       sedimentary record from the three southern California anaerobic                 basins (Santa Barbara, Santa Monica, and San Pedro).  The PIs                   propose to carefully subsample these frozen sediments in an                     attempt to; (1) recognize the 1983 event in each basin, (2)                     compare the known radiolarian sequence from the 1983 plankton                   tows with the sequences from each basin, and (3) compare the                    event and sequence of each basin.  This new technique will make                 it possible to examine the geologic record for the frequency and                history of the large El Nino climate events off California.",
