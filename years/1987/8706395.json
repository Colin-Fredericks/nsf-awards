 "awd_abstract_narration": "The atmosphere is in a state of continual motion, and to                   understand and to be able to predict its motions we need to be                  able to make measurements of the winds, waves, and tides in it.                 We need to be able to compare the results with numerical models                 from large computers that simulate atmospheric dynamics.  The                   height region 80-150km altitude is one of the hardest to observe,               being too high for balloons and too low for spacecraft.  New                    radar and optical techniques are being put into the field to                    obtain data for comparison with global models of the region and                 its dynamical coupling with the lower and higher regions.                           The focus for these efforts is the interpretation of radar                  and optical measurements of winds and temperatures during three                 or more 5-6 day world campaigns specifically devoted to the 80-                 150km height region.  One area of study involves the numerical                  simulation of atmospheric tidal propagation from lower to upper                 levels, and interpretation of observed wind and temperature                     oscillations in the mesosphere, lower thermosphere, and upper                   thermosphere.  The way in which ionosphere/thermosphere                         interactions affect the coupling between the low and upper                      thermosphere will also be investigated.                                              The Principal Investigator is playing a leading role in the                organization of this campaign, and will coordinate the assembly                 of results for comparison with models.",
