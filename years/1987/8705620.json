Acquisition of the magnetometer is absolutely essential for the                 research programs of the principal investigators and will enhance               the productivity of research programs currently supported by ONR,               NSF (DMR), and DOE grants by providing critical capability                      currently not available at Rutgers University for variable                      temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements and other                      magnetic studies of various materials in the following areas of                 chemistry and physics:                                                                                                                                          1.  Synthesis and characterization of high temperature                          superconducting copper oxides.                                                  2.  Synthesis and single crystal growth of quasi low-                           dimensional alkali metal molybdenum oxide bronzes and                           characterization of their structural, electronic transport                      and magnetic properties.                                                        3.  Synthesis and characterization of new three-dimensional                     network oxide materials, which are proposed for the                             development of solid electrolytes and cathode materials for                     use in solid state high energy density batteries.                               4.  Preparation and characterization of transition metal                        chalcogenides with quasi low dimensional properties.                            5.  Sol-gel synthesis of electronic materials.                                  6.
