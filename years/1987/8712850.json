New Mexico Institute of Mining and               Technology has ongoing programs in studies of atmospheric electricity           and chemistry centered around the facilities available at the Irving            Langmuir Laboratory for Atmospheric Research located at 3240 m                  altitude in the Magadalena Mountains near Socorro, New Mexico and the           physics and chemistry laboratories on the New Mexico Tech campus.               The New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology has a long-standing           policy of involving undergraduate studies in research activities.               Historically about 80 percent of the B.S. chemistry and physics                 graduates go on to graduate or professional schools after graduation.               A total of 12 faculty (9 from physics and 3 from chemistry) will            be available for involvement in this project.  Ten or more studies              will participate in the summer program and about five students will             continue their research involvement through the academic year.  At              least one half of the summer students will come from other regional             academic institutions.",
