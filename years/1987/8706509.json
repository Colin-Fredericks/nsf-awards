 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Flathead Lake Biological Station (FLBS) was established                in 1896 for research and education in the field sciences.                       Located on the largest freshwater lake in the western United                    States (outside of Alaska), FLBS has a year-round research                      program emphasizing limnology and stream ecology.  A state-of-                  the-art freshwater research laboratory provides the instrumental                basis for a varied aquatic research program in the largely                      pristine environments of northwestern Montana.  Research on                     Flathead Lake has led to a ten-year data base that is fully                     computerized.                                                                        Recent efforts in simulation modeling have helped identify                 priority research topics at FLBS for the next five years,                       including investigations of suspended sediment/microbial                        relationships in phosphorus cycling, ecosystem-level effects of                 accelerated nutrient loading, effects of stream- and lake-level                 regulation on primary productivity, and changes in lake trophic                 relationships caused by the recent introduction of an exotic                    arthropod into the lake.  These studies require acquisition of a                reasonably large and fully instrumented research vessel.  The                   largest vessel currently available at the station is a 16-foot                  research boat which, due to safety considerations, can only be                  used during calm weather.                                                            This project will provide funds for the purchase of a 26 ft,               diesel-powered research vessel and for shipboard equipment.                     These funds will be matched by $45,000 in new equipment by the                  University of Montana.",
