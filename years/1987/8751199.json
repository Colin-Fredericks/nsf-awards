The permanent exhibition, occupying a prominent               place in the newly remodeled Odenheimer building, will be used                  both by 125,000 school children visiting the zoo each year and                  for the more than one million regular visitors.  More than a                    third of the residents of New Orleans are minority group members.                                                                                               Zoos are increasingly emphasizing their science communication and               science education mission in the context of zoological research                 and species preservation.  They have a substantial need for                     improved educational resources to better meet the needs of the                  large and broad cross section of their visitors.  The Audubon                   Zoo's specific plans for interactive exhibits are well thought                  out, with many connections back to the living collection of the                 zoo.  They have assembled an advisory committee and consulting                  team that includes scientists, zoologists, educators and science                education specialists.  They plan a variety of educational                      materials in support of the exhibition, and will communicate the                results of the project to other zoos through reports,                           publications and presentations.  More than $213,000 in direct                   matching support will be provided by private sources.                                                                                                           An FY87 award of $185,915 to the Audubon Zoological Garden is                   recommended.",
