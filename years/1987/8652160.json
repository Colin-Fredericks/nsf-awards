 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will conduct research on the development of students'              conceptions of exponential functions.  These Principal Investigators            have selected exponential functions, a particularly rich and useful set         of concepts, because of its propensity for misconceptions and its               widespread and significant, applications in mathematics, the sciences           and engineering.  Through, the use of clinical interviews and the               teaching experiment, these investigators will examine students'                 conceptions, the relationships between their informal and formal                knowledge, their interjections and use of concepts across a variety of          contexts and the development of metacognitive strategies in the                 application of these concepts.                                                                                                                                  The project will explore the design and use of a multi-representatival          (Laser Disc) instructional systems, to explore options for using its            vast memory storage for tracking student problem-solving strategies and         student control of instruction.                                                                                                                                 Thus, these investigators hope to significantly advance our                     understanding of the development of student concepts and create a               prototype unit in exponential functions for a precalculus course for            high school and college students.",
