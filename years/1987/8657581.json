 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project deals with a study on combinations of C.sC1 (B.2)                   compounds which have potential for the formation of continuous                  solid solutions.  Initial studies will focus on a combination of                ReAl and NiAl which will be produced by Ion.beam mixing.  Ni and                Re should substitute freely on the Ni sub.lattice with the                      possibility of a spinodal decomposition.  Thermodynamic and                     kinetic studies will be performed on alloys based on the                        quasi-binary phase diagram defined by the two B-2 structures.                   Decomposition of the solid solution alloys will be performed                    using a hot stage in situ in an analytical transmission electron                microscope.  In addition, anti.phase domains are expected to form               in the B.2 structure and these features will be studied, if                     feasible, by high resolution microscopy.  In situ deformation                   studies will also be performed with expectation of observing a                  change in the operating slip system of the B.2 structures.  Rapid               solidification processing will be explored for alloys exhibiting                favorable slip behavior.  Additional studies will focus on the                  Heusler.type alloys.",
