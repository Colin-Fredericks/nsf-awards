 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is in the general area of analytical and surface                  chemistry, broadly defined.  During a ten week period between                   1 June 1987 and 31 August 1987, five faculty members from                       colleges and universities that do not offer the PhD degree in                   chemistry will carry out collaborative research in analytical                   chemistry with faculty members from the Department of Chemistry                 of the University of Tennessee at Knoxville (UTK).  Research                    participants from the undergraduate institutions will be selected               from applicants who respond to UTK's announcement of the summer                 research program.  This activity is analogous to the support of                 undergraduate institution faculty through Research Opportunity                  Awards (ROAs).  In this case, however, participating faculty from               the undergraduate institutions will not have necessarily                        prearranged their summer research activities with particular UTK                faculty members.  Rather, they will establish their collaborative               arrangements after they have had an opportunity to consider fully               all of the research programs of the host institution                            participating faculty.  In addition to the research activities of               this program, UTK faculty and scientists from nearby Oak Ridge                  National Laboratory will present a series of tutorials covering                 current resarch tools and topics that constitute modern chemical                analysis. Also, representatives from Federal and private sector                 funding agencies that have strong commitments to the support of                 quality research programs in undergraduate institutions will                    address the participants and describe mechanisms whereby such                   support can be competitively sought.  There is strong indication                that this type of activity can contribute significantly to the                  infrastructure of the participants' home institutions as well as                to the infrastructure of the subdiscipline of analytical and                    surface chemistry.",
