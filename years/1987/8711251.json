 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ocean sciences instrumentation development project involves                constructing a seagoing pumping system to obtain continuous vertical            profiles of nutrients and dissolved gases to depths of 600 meters.              The system is based on a successful prototype that uses a relatively            small diameter hose and a bottom-mounted vane pump.  Tests on the               system's flow characteristics indicate that there is minimal signal             smearing from mixing and the performance is thought to be superior to           water sampling bottles for obtaining dissolved gas samples.  System             improvements to be completed involve fabrication of a combined cable            to encompass the hose, power line, data transmission line, and a                strength-member.  Modifications to a traction winch to handle the               special cable will also be undertaken.  Work will also be undertaken            to develop special colorimetric dissolved oxygen and hydrogen sulfide           analysis methods to better enable the collection of continuous data             in and near oxic/anoxic interfaces.  The pumping system will be                 especially useful on an expedition to the Black Sea scheduled in the            next year.",
