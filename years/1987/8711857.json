 "awd_abstract_narration": "Judicial process and the exercise of judicial judgment may be affected          by the politics of federal judicial appointments; yet, understanding the        impact of the appointment process on the lower federal district courts          remains rudimentary and incommensurate with its importance.   Dr.               Rowland's research addresses fundamental questions about the links              between politics, judgment, and the evolution of American jurisprudence.        In an effort which integrates diverse theories from economics, social           psychology, and political science, Dr. Rowland's investigation includes         the measurement of appointment effects on both the published and                unpublished opinions of judges in the areas of civil rights, civil              liberties, labor, regulation and contract cases decided between 1981 and        1985.  Not only is the effect of the appointing President to be                 examined, but also the \"home state effect,\" as measured by the politics         of those home state forces which generated the appointment.  In                 addition,  attorneys involved in settlement and litigation in two               jurisdictions, Kansas City, Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri, are              interviewed to determine the extent to which their decisions to settle          or litigate were based on the judge's perceived predilections and               political leanings. While there is much conjecture about the                    interrelationship between political and legal processes, this study             should yield systematic knowledge of how the two mesh to influence              judicial behavior.",
