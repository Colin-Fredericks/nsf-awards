 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Wayne T. Shier, Professor,           Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of                 Pharmacy, University of Minnesota, to pursue with                               Dr. William G. Padolina, Director, National Institutes of                       Biotechnology and Applied Microbiology, University of the Philippines,          Los Ba~os, for a period of 24 months, a program of cooperative                  research on cytotoxic and antiviral agents from natural sources in the          Philippines.  A minimal mammalian cell culture capability will be               established in the Philippines.  It will be used to conduct                     cytotoxicity assays against normal and transformed permanent cell               lines and antiviral assays against a DNA virus (Herpes simplex type 1)          and an RNA virus in ethanol extracts from Philippine medicinal plants           with emphasis on plants known to be toxic or to contain anti-fertility          or insecticidal activities.  A second source of extracts will be                marine plants and lower animals, with particular emphasis on sponges            and tunicates.  A third source of  extracts will be toxic fungi from            agricultural extension samples received from all parts of the                   Philippines.  Extraction, purification, and structure identification            efforts will be carried out on any specimen found to have noteworthy            cytotoxic or antiviral activities.  Some 200 medicinal plants, marine           organisms, and fungal isolates will be screened for cytotoxic and               antiviral agents.  The researchers will attempt to gain some insight            into the roles of toxins in the organisms that produce them.                                                                                                    The search for antiviral agents is presently one of the most active             areas of research in the pharmaceutical sciences.  Efforts in this              area have been spurred on by (1) the lack of effective agents for               viral chemotherapy in general, and in particular from widespread                public concern about AIDS and (2) recent successes with synthetic               analogs of marine natural products.  The search for anti-cancer                 (cytotoxic) agents has met with some successes in extracts from marine          plants and lower animals from the Caribbean.  The proposed research             will extend these lines of investigation to the vast and largely                untapped resource of biological and biochemical diversity provided by           the marine and terrestrial environments of the Philippines.  This               project is relevant to the objectives of the Science in Developing              Countries Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation              between U.S. scientists and engineers and their counterparts in                 developing countries through the exchange of scientific information,            ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of          mutual benefit.  In addition, the project will improve Philippine               scientific infrastructure through the establishment of a mammalian              cell culture capability at Los Ba~os.  The U.S. and Philippine                  collaborators are highly respected scientists with extensive research           experience and productive publication records in the field of the               proposal.",
