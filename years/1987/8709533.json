 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are now available more than 100 studies providing data on gender          differences in mathematics performance, many of them having tested              literally thousands of subjects.  What is needed is a systematic, meta-         analytic synthesis of the existing studies.                                                                                                                     The objective of the research is to clarify the nature of gender                differences in mathematics performance.  A detailed meta-analysis of            gender differences in mathematics performance, combined with a                  cognitive-processing analysis, will address important and complex               developmental and cognitive issues.  In particular, the proposed project        will provide answers to the following questions:  (1)  What is the              magnitude of gender differences in mathematics performance, using the d         metric?  (2)  \"Mathematics achievement\" is a general term encompassing a        wide variety of tests, including simple tests of mathematics facts              (addition, multiplication problems), word problems, geometry problems,          calculus problems, and so on; does the magnitude of the gender                  difference vary on these different tasks, perhaps being close to zero on        some and large on others?  (3)  Developmentally, at what ages do gender         differences appear or disappear, and on which kinds of tests?  (4)              Combining Hedges' homogeneity statistics (Hedges, 1982, Journal of              Education Statistics) with cognitive processing analysis, do males and          females differ in some cognitive processes related to mathematics               performance, but not on others?  (5)  To what extent do affective               variables (such as confidence, anxiety, attributions, and so on) mediate        the gender differences in mathematics performance?                                                                                                              The results of the research can make contributions to basic science by          providing answers to the questions summarized above.  In addition, the          research has potential implications for mathematics education (and in           turn for science and engineering education, insofar as they are                 dependent on mathematics education), particularly for sex equity in             mathematics education.",
