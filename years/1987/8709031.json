 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Dr. Eck and his international team of                        collaborators to continue their paleoanthropological research at                Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. This site is of extreme anthropological                significance because its sediments, deposited over an                           approximately 2 million year period contain a series of human                   physical and cultural remains. Much of this material has been                   dated and allows anthropologists to trace human development over                most of the Ice Age. What also makes the site important is its                  wealth of non.human faunal remains. These allow one to                          reconstruct the shifting climates and environments in which                     humans functioned.                                                              The goals of this project are to: 1. address geographical and                   stratigraphic biases in previous faunal collections from the                    site; 2. augment previously documented vertebrate taxa; 3.                      increase knowledge of human physical development; 4. refine the                 stratigraphic and geochronological framework for the Olduvai                    faunal and cultural sequences; 5. develop a strategy of                         paleoanthropological resource management to ensure Olduvai's                    continued contribution to science. To accomplish these goals a                  multidisciplinary group of scientists will conduct two seasons of               research at the site.                                                           This work is important because it builds on a splendid data base                ammassed over many years by the Leakey family and their                         collaborators. It will help to increase our understanding of                    human development and the factors which guided it. Because the                  research team includes Tanzanian members, the project will help                 to improve the scientific base in this country and strengthen                   ties between the U.S. and Tanzania.",
