 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most striking properties of the pigmented bacterium                  Serratia marcescens is the phenomenon of color instability.                     Different strains differ greatly both in color and in the                       frequency with which they produce color variants.  Within a                     strain, the variations occur at constant rates and are                          reversible.  The high degree of genetic instability is                          reminiscent of DNA rearrangements such as transpositions,                       deletions or inversions which are found to occur during various                 biological processes.                                                                                                                                           During an investigation of this phenomenon Dr. Harshey observed                 that variation of a 39 kilodalton protein in S. marcescens strain               274, is closely associated with color variation.  Using                         antibodies to this protein she identified it as being the                       bacterial flagellin.  Neither color nor flagellin are produced at               temperatures above 37 oC.  Thus, pigment synthesis and flagellin                synthesis appear to be co-regulated.  We propose to isolate and                 characterize the gene(s) for Serratia flagellin.",
