 "awd_abstract_narration": "A preponderance of evidence suggests that chemsensory                      differences underlie the behavioral isolating mechanisms which                  characterize related and evolving species in the Drosophila                     mulleri complex.  Behavioral observations have eliminated the                   possibility of a major role of other sensory modes and strains of               D. mojavensis exploit the expected differences in cuticular                     hydrocarbons which are known to function in courtship in other                  Drosophila species.                                                                  Our understanding of the reproductive isolation evolving                   between the different populations of D. mojavensis will not                     progress until a fresh approach is developed.  Dr. Markow                       proposes to investigate this problem at a new level by                          characterizing the cuticular lipids and evaluating the nature of                what all present evidence strongly suggests is their extensive                  involvement in the evolution of the mate recognition systems in                 these species.  Research activities will include a complete                     characterization of the cuticular lipids of D. mojavensis with                  respect to their ontogeny in adult males and females from two                   populations, and an assessment of the influence of particular                   lipid classes on sexual behavior.",
