 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator (PI) will study synchronous                     store-and-forward networks involving packetized messages of                     varying priority classes.  The priorities may be established by                 transmission needs, as in the case of integrated voice and data                 networks in which voice transmission needs higher priority to                   ensure reasonable quality.   Priorities may also be determined by               other disparate requirements and assigned according to other                    criteria such as length of message or distance from source to                   destination.  The priorities may also be established by                         transmission importance.                                                             The PI will also compare the effectiveness of flow control                 schemes which control congestion in these priority queueing                     networks.  To this end, she has developed a Markov model and                    analytical techniques to determine the average delay and buffer                 occupancy of a single-queue multi-priority system in steady-                    state.  The PI will extend this local analysis to treat priority                networks and various associated flow control schemes.  She will                 also develop a simulation package that allows the observation of                both the transient and statistical behavior of these networks.                  The results of this proposed research would be applicable to the                design of a wide class of networks, ranging from satellite packet               networks to networks of multiprocessors.",
