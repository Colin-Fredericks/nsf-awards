An             important objective of this research is to search for close-binary              nuclei of planetary nebulae and obtain some of the properties of those          discovered.  The results will be a determination of the fraction of             central stars that are close binaries, the importance of binary star            processes in the production of planetary nebulae, and the discovery of          star systems which will lead to the establishment of an evolutionary            sequence linking the wide binaries (periods 1-10 years) to the                  cataclysmic variables (periods less than several hours).  An important          aspect of this program will be the direct involvement of undergraduate          students in all phases of the research from implementation of one               instrument through observation and analysis of results.",
