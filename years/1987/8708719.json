 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project deals with the synthesis and characterization of Ti                 (III)-doped glasses via sol-gel processing techniques.  The Principal           Investigator proposes to develop a new tunable glass laser material             which utilized Ti (III) as the active ion.  The experimental work will          emphasize the development of the chemistry and physcial processing              requirements associated with the formulation of Ti (III)-doped glass            monoliths of the silicate type via sol-gel processing technique.  Both          pure silicates and alkaline earth silicate formulation will be                  conducted in a reducing atmosphere.  A laser scattering analysis method         will be employed to characterize the optical quality of the resulting           glass structures.  Subsequent spectroscopy characterization will                include analysis of the absorption and fluorescence spectra of the              formulated glass.                                                               Ti (III)-doped sapphire solid-state laser has an extremely braod tuning         range of 600 to 968 nm.  This material exhibits similar optical                 characeristics as pure sapphire, while affording the added advantage of         shaping capability.  Presently, no research work is known on glass              laser material with Ti (III) as the active ion.  A glass laser material         with a tuning range which includes the visible light spectra would              provide numerous applications in the communications technology.",
