 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much appears to be happening in science education throughout the world,         much of which is quite successful and very worth sharing.  This proposal        would support the participation of approximately twenty chemical                educators in the Ninth International Conference on Chemical Education,          to be held in Sao Paulo, Brazil, 26-31 July l987.  Elementary, middle,          high school, and college teachers will be represented in the delegation,        with the precollege teachers comprising 70% of the total.                                                                                                       In order to facilitate the development of international teacher support         networks at the conference, and the further dissemination of knowledge          gained in Brazil, the teachers selected will agree to undertake a               specific information-gathering activity at the conference.  Each teacher        will select an issue of concern to chemical educators in this country           and, through network activities in Sao Paulo, collect the information           needed to compare other countries' efforts to address this issue with           efforts in the United States.  On returning from the conference, they           will be expected to write a paper discussing relevant approaches to the         issue selected and submit this paper to the American Chemical Society           for review.  Seven of these papers will be selected for presentation            during a special symposium at the ACS Division of Chemical Education's          Tenth Biennial Education Conference to be held during July l988.",
