 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemical and physical properties of molecules are determined                not only by their elemental composition, but also by their shape                (stereochemistry).  These studies will provide further                          information on the role of shape in controlling chemical                        properties. This is particularly important in understanding how                 molecules interact in biological systems.                                                                                                                       The specific stereochemical studies of this project are in four                 areas:                                                                                                                                                          (A)  Conformational Analysis - The conformational behavior of                   1,2,3,4-N-methyltetrahydroquinolines and their salts will be                    studied as well as the relation of optical rotation to                          conformation and hydrogen bonding in cis-3-hydroxythiane                        sulfoxide and other compounds; (B) NMR Spectroscopy - NMR                       spectroscopic studies will deal with O-17 NMR, especially effects               of hydrogen bonding, application to mechanistic studies and                     spectra of sugar derivatives; (C) Asymmetric Synthesis - The                    studies in asymmetric synthesis will involve the previously                     investigated 1,3-oxathiane system and will also encompass                       methodological studies of chiral 1,3-oxazanes as molds for                      stereoselective syntheses.  Further, mechanistic studies of the                 importance of chelation in such studies involving Cram's cyclic                 rule will be undertaken by stop-flow methods; and (D) Carbanion                 Chemistry - The carbanion studies will involve carbanions derived               from 1,3-oxathiane and 1,3-dioxane and will encompass efforts to                investigate their rate of inversion by stop-flow nmr.",
