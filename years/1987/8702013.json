 "awd_abstract_narration": "Calmodulin (CaM) is a Ca2+dependent regulatory protein which                    activates a variety of enzymes and evidently serves an                          important role in cellular metabolic regulation.  A                             mechanistic model has been developed to explain how CaM                         activates enzymes and this model predicts the behavior of                       several enzymes reasonably well.  However one enzyme, NAD                       kinase from peas, differs significantly from other CaM-                         activated enzymes in several important ways and does not                        appear to fit the model.                                                                                                                                        The proposed experiments will determine the cause of this                       unique behavior by probing the thermodynamics of activation,                    the site of interaction with CaM, and the domain structure of                   NAD kinase.  The results of these studies will lead to a                        better understanding of the unique behavior of NAD kinase,                      which should, in turns, contribute to our knowledge of how                      CaM performs it roles in cellular metabolism.",
