 "awd_abstract_narration": "Constitutive Potassium Transport Systems in E. coli:                       Several constitutive potassium transport systems of the Gram-                   negative bacterium,-Escherichia coli, will be analyzed.  The                    analysis of the moderate affinity Trk system will include                       determination of the four genes implicated in that stystem but                  not yet sequenced.  The subcellular location of the gene products               and interactions among these proteins will be defined.  Residual                potassium transport activity in mutants lacking Trk will be the                 subject of genetic analysis.  Major systems of potassium efflux                 will be identified by mutational analysis.  After the systems are               identified, their protein components, kinetics and regulation                   will be deterimined.                                                                                                                                                 The results of this research should increase our                           understanding of the mechanisms and regulation of all ways that                 potassium homeostasis is maintained in E. coli.  It is not                      unreasonable to assume that the patterns, mechanisms and                        principles discovered in bacteria will be useful in understanding               similarities in other cells with walls such as plant cells.                     Moreover, because the high affinity Kdp transport system is                     homologous to transport ATPases of higher eucaryotes the results                should be instructive for the bioenergetics of mammalian systems.",
