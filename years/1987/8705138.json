The                 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer will be used for                   research on a broad range of topics by a user group from the                    departments of Chemistry, Physics, and Chemical Engineering.                    Examples of the specific projects where the instrumentation                     will be used are as follows.  The interactions which exist at                   metal/electrolyte and metal/polymer interfaces will be probed                   using the FTIR in the grazing angle specular reflectance mode.                  A second program will employ the instrument for examination of                  adsorbed species on catalyst surfaces.  Two additional projects                 will take advantage of the ability of this instrument to                        incorporate photoacoustic FTIR for identification and analysis                  of polymer/pigment crosslinking mechanisms and for the                          characterization of coal and coal liquefaction residues for                     purposes of reactivity correlation utilization.  The instrument                 will also find application in a research project where the                      nature of the structure of amorphous silicon-based                              semiconductor alloys is being investigated, as well as in a                     number of projects where only routine chemical analysis of                      complex mixtures and pure compounds is required.  The concept                   for utilization of the instrument is centered around a                          flexible, multi-user campus research resource rather than an                    instrument dedicated to any one single project or program.                                                                                                      Novelty/Innovation:  Each of the individual research programs                   described in the proposal has its own novelty and innovative                    features.  As examples of this, the study of polymer/pigment                    interactions with FTIR permits examination of these mechanisms",
