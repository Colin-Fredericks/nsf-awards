 "awd_abstract_narration": "When a mixture is fed to a packed bed of sorbent, the                           components in the mixture can be partitioned into separate and                  adjacent bands in the bed under certain \"favorable\" conditions.                 The most important favorable condition is the concave-type                      isotherm (i.e., Langmuirian).  Fortunately, the adsorption of                   almost all biocompounds on immobilized enzyme sorbents are                      Langmurian.  A \"displacer\" is needed after the injection of                     feed.  The displacer must adsorb more strongly than all                         components in the feed mixture and must be easily desorbed                      later.  Upon the injection of the displacer, the components                     are eluted sequentially from the bed.  This technique, called                   displacement chromatography, has been recently developed by                     Horvath and coworkers (including the P.I.) into small-scale                     commerical separations in pharmaceutical industry.  The P.I.                    proposes to extend the work to larger and high concentrations                   of peptides and proteins, and to refine the theoretical work to                 include axial dispersion and mass transfer resistances.",
