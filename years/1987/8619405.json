 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Ms. Varee Prasertsiriroj,                Scientist (on leave of absence for study), Department of Microbiology           and Immunology, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University,               Bangkok, Thailand, to pursue, for a period of 12 months, dissertation           research in microbiology and immunology, relevant to development of             Thailand, under the direction of Dr. Donald G. Dusanic, Professor,              Department of Life Sciences, Indiana State University.  The purpose of          this study is to identify and characterize important parasite antigens          circulating in the plasma of rats infected with Trypanosoma lewisi, a           protozoan parasite.  These circulating antigens may have a role in              immunosuppression or immunoprotection.  Attempts will be made to (1)            purify these antigens by affinity chromatography using monoclonal               antibodies., (2) define them physically and biochemically, and (3)              determine their roles in immunity.                                                                                                                              Parasitic protozoa are a major cause of the infectious diseases which           affect man and livestock.  They play an important role in limiting the          social and economic development of many countries, especially in                tropical regions.  The research will provide an opportunity to study            mechanisms of control of parasitic infections and, therefore, will              contribute to development of tropical countries such as Thailand.  Dr.          Dusanic is a highly respected scientist in the field of this proposal,          and he has produced an impressive number of well placed graduates, in           the United States and abroad, in the field of parasitology.  This               project is relevant to the objectives of the Science in Developing              Countries Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation              between U.S. scientists and engineers and their counterparts in                 developing countries through the exchange of scientific information,            ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of          mutual benefit.",
