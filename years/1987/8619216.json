 "awd_abstract_narration": "Foraminifera and radiolaria are unique among zooplankton because they           are essentially immotile, they reproduce slowly relative to most of             their prey and they produce fossils which dominate much of the world            ocean's sediments.  Thus, more than any other zooplankton group, these          organisms are coupled to a parcel of water and the abundance and                composition of their fauna should be indicative of the integrated               trophic history of that water.  Polycystine radiolaria are the more             diverse of the two groups and tend to be more important in high-                latitude sediments.  Evidence that the radiolarian fauna in the                 Norwegian Sea responds to changes in production suggests that                   radiolaria from these waters might be excellent indicators of                   biological processes at lower trophic levels.  The high-latitude                radiolarian fauna has never been studied in the plankton during or              after a bloom.  This proposal outlines a plan to do so by sampling              radiolaria quantitatively during several cruises along a latitudinal            gradient from the Arctic circle to Spitzbergen and analyzing the                radiolarian faunal composition using multivariate canonic analysis and          doing morphological studies of skeletons of the major species.  The             results of these analyses will be used to interpret the response of             radiolarian populations to the major bloom event in the Norwegian Sea.          This information can ultimately be used to interpret the trophic                history of a water mass on a month-to-season time scale and will also           provide important information for the interpretation of the ecological          significance of the fossil fauna.",
