 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an award for engineering research equipment, namely,            equipment to automate a flow calorimeter.                                                                                                                       PROJECT:  Intermolecular hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) represent a form of           molecular attraction intermediate in strength between the physical van          der Waal's forces and a true chemical bonding.  When they occur, H-bonds        have a dramatic effect on the fluid's thermophysical properties, and            thus a thorough study of this phenomenon is extremely important from            both a scientific and an engineering perspective.                                                                                                               The research being conducted at Colorado School of Mines is a systematic        study of bonding in an important class of materials; the five-membered          heterocyclic ring compounds composed of both aromatic (furan, thiophene,        pyrrole) and nonaromatic (tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydrothiophene, and             pyrollidine) species.  Both equilibrium association constants (K) and           bonding energies (WHO) are being determined by measuring the heat               effects that occur when a dilute solution of an associating species in          an inert solvent is taken to infinite dilution in a flow calorimeter.           Automation of the calorimeter facility will increase research                   productivity by at least 50 percent.                                                                                                                            PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE:  The experimental results of this and future            investigations of other more complex heterocyclic groups will                   substantially increase our understanding of H-bonding effects in                aromatic and nonaromatic compounds, as well as add to the data base             necessary for developing improved thermodynamic models for process              calculations.",
