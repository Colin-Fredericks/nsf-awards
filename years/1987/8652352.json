This project will provide a computer studies teacher program that meets         the guidelines for certification in Kansas.  It will educate teachers in        computer studies so that they can then conduct in-service sessions in           computer literacy for teachers in their districts. It will provide a            forum where teachers from various districts can share their materials           and ideas about computer learning and develop a model program of                computer studies in education, that has been tried and tested by                teachers in the field, to be shared with other State Education                  Departments.                                                                                                                                                    Participants in this program, which encourages interdisciplinary                connections, will receive graduate credit for their coursework.  Each           site where a participant teaches will be visited each year by Craig             Haugness, Computer Specialist for the Kansas State Department of                Education.  He will submit a formal evaluation of the entire project.           Saint Mary College is making plans to sustain the program at the end of         NSF funding.                                                                                                                                                    The PI, Sister Barbara Kushan is Director of Academic Computing at Saint        Mary College.  She was the project director of an NSF CAUSE project from        1980 to 1983 in which a computer center was established on the campus           and a computer science major developed.  Other staff members are Sister         Andrea Johnston, PhD, chairperson of the Mathematics Department,                Professor Victor Meyer, Sister Mary Erwin Baker and Sister Mary Denise          Sternitzke, Sister Kathy Atkins all of whom are experienced mathematics         and computer science faculty members.                                                                                                                           Saint Mary College is qualified in terms of staff, facilities and               commitment to develop a program to prepare computer teachers.  Cost             sharing by the College is 30% of the overall budget.",
