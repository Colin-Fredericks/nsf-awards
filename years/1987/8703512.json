 "awd_abstract_narration": "Predation and interspecific competition can interact to                         determine the distribution and abundance of species, but such                   interactions rarely have been studied experimentally in                         terrestrial ecosystems.  Dactylotum is an abundant grasshopper                  in the grasslands of southeastern Arizona.  It also is gaudily-                 colored, apparently distasteful, and immune from predation by                   birds.  Other common grasshoppers in the proposed study area                    comprise the major prey of breeding birds.  They also                           potentially compete with Dactylotum for food and habitat.                       Preliminary data indicate that birds can have a significant                     impact on grasshopper populations, and that Dactylotum                          populations can be manipulated effectively in the field.                        Replicated plots on a grassland preserve in southeastern                        Arizona will be used to exclude 1) birds, or 2) Dactylotum, or                  3) both, or 4) neither.  Grasshopper densities will be measured                 on the plots from July to October for one pre-treatment and                     three post-treatment years.  Results will test hypotheses about                 the independent and interactive effects of bird predation vs.                   interspecific competition upon the abundances of grasshoppers                   in this semidesert grassland.                                                                                                                                   Drs. Jane and Carl Bock will work jointly on these experiments.                 Their excellent research records assure a productive endeavor.",
