 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Jane Preuss and a colleague of Urban Regional            Research, Seattle, Washington, to collaborate with Salvador Farreras            and Francisco Suarez of the Center for Scientific Research and Higher           Education of Ensenada and Antonio Sanchez of the Naval Oceanographic            Research Station, Ensenada, Mexico, in an analysis of the impact of             the 1985 Mexican earthquake on coastal communities.  They will also             analyze the vulnerability to earthquake hazard of selected western              coastal Mexican communities and develop recommendations for reducing            vulnerability to future earthquakes and other coastal hazards, such             as storm surges and hurricanes.                                                                                                                                 The Mexican earthquake produced unexpected damage in some areas and             left other likely areas unscathed.  The study will attempt to get a             clearer understanding of the pattern of seismic hazard to coastal               communities by evaluating both ground motion and other geophysical              data and the structural engineering and urban design components of              the seismic and tsunami wave damage along the coast.  The                       geoscientific analyses of conditions related to the hazard will be              done by the Mexican team, which has expertise in geology and physical           oceanography.  The U.S. team, which has expertise in urban planning             and structural design for natural hazard mitigation, will be                    responsible for recommendations for microzonation/urban planning and            for the design aspects of reconstruction and long-term mitigation.              Both groups are well-qualified for their components of the                      cooperative project.  The results of this study will be useful to               planners in the U.S. and elsewhere where coastal communities may be             susceptible to such disasters.  The results will be of particular               value to the Mexican government in evaluating the feasibility of                targeting selected coastal communities for growth as a part of its              reconstruction and decentralization strategies.",
