Phase one was completed by the institution; this                 project is covering the second phase which involves procurement                 of an ultracentrifuge, electrophoresis equipment, photographic                  equipment, a uv/visible spectrophotometer, a CO2 incubator, and                 an ion-free reagent water system.  This equipment enables                       undergraduates to perform expanded laboratory experiments and                   individual projects in cell fractionation; protein, DNA and RNA                 separations; transfers of proteins and nucleic acids for testing                and analysis (Southern, Northern, and Western blots);                           quantitative determination of proteins and nucleic acids;                       autoradiography; DNA sequencing; restriction digests of nucleic                 acids; and cloning of restriction fragments.                                                                                                                    A new course in Molecular Genetics is being offered, while major                laboratory segments of Advanced Cell Biology and Developmental                  Biology are being expanded.  Subtantial laboratory exercises also               are being added to coursework in Microbiology, Genetics,                        Biochemistry, and Immunology.  Students are gaining vastly                      expanded experience with current techniques and equipment used in               Protein and Nucleic Acid Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics.",
