 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Objectives:  The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary                cooperative research project between Dr. Aaron Galonsky of Michigan             State University and Dr. Adam Kiss of Eotvos Lorand University is to            study the high-density, hot region formed when very energetic, heavy            nuclei collide.  Measurements will be made of the energy spectra of             neutrons and fragments resulting from collisions.  Comparisons of values        should reveal new information about the basic question of whether               statistical equilibrium exists in the hot region.                                                                                                               Relevance of Proposal to Program:  This project in nuclear physics              fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by             enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to             combine complementary talents, pool resources, and share research               facilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.                                                                                                   Merit:  The proposal ranks in the Excellent category.  Its technical            merit therefore warrants NSF support.  The U.S. and Hungarian                   researchers are well regarded and the rationale for international               cooperation, in terms of anticipated mutual scientific benefits, is             clearly articulated.  Significant research results are anticipated from         this cooperative project.                                                                                                                                       Interrelated Projects:  Primary research costs for the domestic portion         of this research project are received from the Physics Division of the          National Science Foundation under grant number PHY-8611210.                                                                                                     Funding:  The requested budget covers the incremental costs to the U.S.         of international cooperation associated with the research in accordance         with program guidelines.",
