This is in                  some ways the most difficult part of linguistics, because                       meaning is the relationship between what is said and what is                    talked about, and what is talked about can in principle be                      anything in the universe, true or false, real or unreal.  Most                  of whatever success there has been in work in linguistic                        semantics has come about primarily by virtue of setting strict                  limitations on the  classes of meanings to be studied.  Further                 progress depends, then, on progressive relaxation of these                      limitations, to incorporate broader ranges of linguistic                        expressions into a general semantic theory.                                                                                                                          The aim of the workshop proposed here is to accomplish                     such a broadening of the reach of semantics, to a class of                      phenomena which have been presenting increasing challenges to                   semantic analysis under currently available theoretical models.                 These phenomena are the generic, habitual, and mass terms.                      Generic expressions say something about classes of things, for                  example, \"Dogs are furry.\"  Habitual expressions describe some                  kind of activity which happens regularly, even though it may                    not be happening at the moment, for example, \"Max reads Time                    magazine.\"  Mass terms are those which refer to undifferenti-                   ated stuff which may be present in greater or lesser quantity,                  but can't be counted, like \"water\" or \"salt\".  There is reason                  to believe that all of these types of expressions are related                   semantically, and that a proper modification to semantic theory                 dealing with one type could in principle deal with the other                    types as well.  These expressions are of particular importance                  because they are the typical form of scientific statements, and                 our failure so far to be able to perform a satisfactory                         semantic analysis of them has made it impossible to deal with                   such statements in a computational environment.                                                                                                                      The participants in the workshop are linguists and                         logicians who have been trying to cope with the semantic                        problems related to this set of phenomena from their own                        respective perspectives for some time now.  While they have                     made some notable progress, each has encountered significant                    problems, which they believe may be amenable to attack from the                 perspective of one of the others.  The workshop will provide an                 extended period of intensive interaction to allow them to                       follow up these leads fully, and report their findings to the                   rest of the community interested in these problems.",
