In this study an experimental technique will be                       employed that will deposit transient molecules at very low                      temperatures in close proximity to other unstable species so that               novel types of reactivity can be discovered and studied.  This is               an important area of research because it will increase our                      understanding of how the various electronic properties of highly                strained and very reactive organic molecules influence their                    reactivity and physical  characteristics.  Professor Staley has                 judicially chosen his series of model compounds so that they are                small enough to be amenable to theoretical study employing high                 level quantum calculations.                                                                                                                                     Specifically, he will extend his newly developed gas phase vacuum               dehydrohalgenation synthetic techniques to the  preparation of                  highly unstable transient molecules at low temperature (-196C)                  and study their physical properties with a variety of                           spectroscopic techniques.  He will continue his interesting                     studies of molecules that display Mobius delocalization such as                 the cycloheptatrienyl anion.  His experimental studies will be                  augmented by advanced level ab initio molecular orbital                         calculations.",
