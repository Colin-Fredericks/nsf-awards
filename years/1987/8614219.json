 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is concerned with synthesizing a parallel schedule for a set of       equations in a nonprocedural specification.  Two forms of parallelism           will be exploited.  The first is forall parallelism, in which multiple          independent loop bodies may be run concurrently.  The second is task            level parallelism, in which multiple modules (perhaps including forall          loops) are active concurrently.                                                                                                                                 Previous research in program synthesis from non procedural specification        has been directed toward sequential, dataflow and distributed processing        environments.  This work focuses on an increasingly important target            machine class:  shared memory MIMD configurations, in which a program           consists of a task force rather than one monolithic single instruction          stream task.                                                                                                                                                    Other research efforts in generating parallel programs for MIMD machines        have dealt with parallelizing sequential FORTRAN programs.  In this work,       a very high level language for problem description (PS) is defined.  Use        of such a language enables domain experts (as opposed to programmers) to        produce parallel computer programs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The study of parallelism in programs has become an important challenge          for the affective use of multiple instruction stream computers.  This           effort will add to the understanding of the topic.",
