 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            established to provide support to strengthen the research environments          and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions that have               substantial minority student enrollments.  Eligible institutions must           also have graduate programs in science or programs in engineering.              Funding is provided for faculty research in fields of science and               engineering supported by the Foundation and for the acquisition of              research instrumentation.  North Carolina A&T State University will             use RIMI support to study how efficient material handling contributes           to the successful operation of an automated factory system.  Although           several researchers have addressed the issue of selecting patterns,             sizes and methods for stacking uniform cartons on pallets, most have            ignored the practical aspects of automated palletization, such as               robot motion economy and safety.                                                                                                                                This study will generalize the work of Puls and Tanchoco to deal with           non-uniform size cartons.  A prototype palletizing station will be              constructed using an IBM 7545 robot to demonstrate the applicability            of the proposed methodology.  The Foundation has supported this                 project because North Carolina A&T State has perhaps the only                   accredited industrial engineering program at a predominantly minority           institution.  Students in this program will have opportunities to               participate in meritorious applied and basic engineering research.",
