 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator plans to carry out a broad program of                basic research in computational astrophysics to study the                       dynamics and evolution of galaxies.  The program consists of a                  major project which has an underlying applied mathematical                      framework.  This framework consists of a group of very powerful                 numerical techniques called piecewise-parabolic methods (PPM)                   which permit rapid and accurate solution of partial differential                equations on supercomputers.  An essential part of the overall                  program is the continued development of these powerful techniques               driven by demanding applications on the world's largest and                     fastest computers.                                                                                                                                              The research area to which these methods will be applied is the                 dynamics and evolution of galaxies.  In this area, computer                     simulations offer the hope of dealing with the formidable                       difficulties presented by highly complex and nonlinear fluid                    flows.  Stellar disks of galaxies are treated as fluids in a                    four-dimensional phase space.  The goal of the work is to obtain                new insights into the physical phenomena involved.  Preliminary                 results demonstrate the promise of the proposed computational                   approach in realizing this goal.                                                                                                                                The new methods of calculating using supercomputers will let one                make realistic models of galaxies.  The eventual goal is to                     understand the physical processes taking place in galaxies.                     Dr. Woodward is a very capable scientist who has considerable                   expertise in using supercomputers.  He will work closely with                   postdoctoral associates and graduate and undergraduate students                 in carrying out the research.  New numerical codes and algorithms               will be developed.  It is important that new scientists be                      trained in supercomputer techniques.",
