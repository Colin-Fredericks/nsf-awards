 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in a variety of phenomenological and theoretical               topics in elementary particle physics will be carried out.  Two                 projects involving heavy quarkonium decays are planned.  First,                 motivated by the large QCD one-loop corrections to the decay into               a Higgs boson, it is planned to calculate the one-loop                          corrections due to Higgs bosons to this process in two-Higgs                    doublet models (as required, for example, in all supersymmetric                 theories).  Secondly, it is proposed that heavy quarkonium decays               into Z   and ZH final states be reexamined for all S- and                       P-states.  It is also planned that the study of W and Z pair-                   production in high-energy e e  collisions in the context of a                   strongly-interacting electroweak sector be udertaken.  Limits on                the masses and couplings of leptoquark bosons derivable from                    ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray neutrino interactions will be                       investigated as will the phenomenology of superstring-motivated                 models derived from E .  On the more theoretical side, building                 on previous studies (of this author and collaborators), continued               work on the effects of a finite-temperature heat bath on the                    stability of spacetime is planned.  Finally, two projects                       involving properties of theories with unbroken supersymmetry are                also proposed.  One is the investigation of sum rules in                        supersymmetric quantum mechanics and their relation to special                  function theory in mathematics.  The other will involve one-loop                calculations of various cross-sections to test for the existence                of amplitude zeros beyond tree level in supersymmetric theories.                        This work, by a very highly-regarded young theoretical                  physicist, will add to our understanding of the physics of                      certain elementary particles that, while so-far undiscovered, are               widely believed to exist, and are central to our picture of the                 basic forces of nature.",
