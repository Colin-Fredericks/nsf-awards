 "awd_abstract_narration": "Base-isolation of structures can provide an effective and economic              strategy to mitigate the effects of earthquakes.  The Resilient-Friction        Base Isolator (R-FBI) is composed of a set of flat rings which can slide        on each other with a rubber core (with or without a central steel rod).         The rubber core distributes the lateral base displacement and velocity          across the height of the isolator and carries no gravity loads.  The            interfacial friction force acts both as the structural fuse and as an           energy absorber.  This system combines the beneficial effect of friction        damping with that of the resiliency of rubber.                                                                                                                  The objective of this research is to verify the performance of the R-FBI        by means of shaker table tests.  The R-FBI will be incorporated into the        base of a 1/3-scaled 5-story steel frame on a shaker table.  Realistic          ground motions are simulated and the performance of the R-FBI system in         limiting the structural response will be evaluated.  The shaker table           tests are necessary to verify previous analytical modeling and to               evaluate unexpected problems that may exist in implementing this                isolation scheme in practice.  The successful completion of this                research will provide the structural engineer with a simple, cost               effective isolation system that can be used to save lives and protect           structures and equipment during medium to large intensity earthquakes.",
