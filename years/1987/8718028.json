 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project deals with a novel process of producing fiber reinforced            thermoplastic wire.  Such wires, in addition to achieving more                  flexibility in manufacture and repair, provide improved fatigue                 strength, impact resistance and resistance to chemical attack.  The             greatest barrier to the use of high strength organic fiber reinforced           plastic (FRP) wires in critical structural applications is high cost            and large uncertainties associated with the quality of the product.             Nearly 100% ultrasonic or other NDT is required to assure quality.              In contrast, metal wires are produced by the mile and accepted on the           basis of simple tests on a small sample.  The quality of the metal              wire is assured by closely controlling the chemistry and by utilizing           a very reproducible manufacturing process.  The PI proposes a similar           concept for producing fiber reinforced wires.  The following                    procedure is used.  Yarns of reinforced fibers and the matrix are               commingled in proper proportion to control the fiber/resin ratio.               The mixture is then heated close to the melting point of the matrix             and pulled through a hot die.  The wire is cooled at a rate                     appropriate to achieving the desired degree of crystallinity in the             matrix.  Wires produced by this method have many applications.  Chief           among them are mooring lines for deep ocean arrays of instruments.",
