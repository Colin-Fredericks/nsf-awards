 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are many existing medical imaging techniques, including                   x-ray computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),           ultrasonic imaging, radioisotope imaging, and thermographic imaging.            Each has its own advantages and are suitable for different applications.        Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) images electrical resistivity.  It        measures currents and voltages to determine the object's impedance              distribution.  Since different organs have different resistivity, this          technique then recognizes the differences and will produce an image.            EIT has several advantages, they include:  safe from ionizing radiation,        inexpensive instrumentation, and portability.                                                                                                                   A system has been developed for EIT, including a 16-electrode physical          phantom, a data acquisition a system interfaced with a PC,                      reconstruction software, and color display facilities.  This action             provides for renewed support to:  determine the sources of measurement          error from a physical phantom, develop an error-tolerant reconstruction         algorithm that can optimally reconstruct the image form measured error-         contaminated real data, determine the image spatial resolution that can         be practically achieved for typical impedance distribution of the human         body, expand the two-dimensional reconstruction method to a three-              dimensional method.                                                                                                                                             Both of the PI's are experiences researchers and the                            institutional support is adequate, I recommend support.",
