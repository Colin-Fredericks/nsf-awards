 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will initiate a Long-Term Ecological Research                project at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire.  The               overall goal of the research is a better understanding of the                   response of northern hardwood-conifer watersheds to large-scale                 disturbance, particularly with regard to (i) vegetation                         structure, composition and productivity; (ii) dynamics of dead                  organic matter; (iii) atmosphere-terrestrial-aquatic linkages;                  and (iv) heterotroph population dynamics.  The research will be                 carried out on sites with contrasting disturbance history using                 experimental, survey, and long-term monitoring studies.  It will                provide valuable information on long-term ecosystem responses to                disturbance, information needed by society to assess the effects                of management and policy on the integrity of forest ecosystems.                         Specifically, the research will examine (1) vegetation                  processes including neighborhood competition and gap-phase                      succession at different stages of development, and biomass and                  nutrient accumulation in the early stages of succession; (2)                    organic matter processing in streams and soils, decomposition of                bole wood, and the formation and disruption of organic debris                   dams; (3) biogeochemical processes including wet and dry                        deposition, stream outflow, hydrologic modeling and hillslope                   hydrology, and construction of internal ionic budgets; and (4)                  population dynamics of breeding birds, phytophagous insects and a               pathogenic fungus, and the nutritional ecology of whitetailed                   deer.                                                                                   The multi-investigator, multi-institutional research team               assembled for this project will bring to bear a truly formidable                array of expertise and accumulative record of past productivity.                The team combines the abilities of both older and younger                       scientists to great advantage.  Facilities at the Hubbard Brook                 site are excellent for the project and will be augmented by                     significant resources available at the cooperating institutions.                The USDA/Forest Service will continue to play a key role as                     steward for the site, collaborator in the science, and provider                 of large amounts of project support in kind.  This is genuinely a               multi-talented effort.                                                                  The Program recommends that the first year of funding be                awarded for this five-year continuing project.",
