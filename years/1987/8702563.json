 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past 10-15 years atmospheric chemistry has evolved from            a young research discipline devoted primarily to local problems of              urban pollution and air quality to a mature science concerned with              the hemispheric to global scale cycling of a wide variety of chemical           species.  To a large extent this change has resulted from an                    increasing realization that human activities can cause chemical                 disturbances to the natural troposphere on scales far beyond local              concerns.  Well-known examples include changes in the                           regional-to-global concentrations of certain nitrogen compounds, lead           and other heavy metals, artificial radionuclides, a number of                   synthetic organic substances, certain acid-forming species, carbon              dioxide and methane.  These chemical changes in the atmosphere can              often extend to the earth's soils, oceans, and biota far from the               original source region.  They can result in alterations in the                  earth's climate, changes in vital nutrient cycles, and impact                   significantly on the public health and quality of life on earth.                    The Atmosphere/Ocean Chemistry Experiment (AEROCE) will be a                coordinated multi-institutional atmospheric and marine chemistry                research project centered in the North Atlantic region.  The ultimate           goal of the AEROCE project will be the development of a predictive              capability for the continentally derived species observed in the                marine troposphere over the North Atlantic.  The selection of sites             and the measurement protocol in AEROCE has been developed jointly by            modelers and field experimentalists.                                                This AEROCE research element will be concerned with studying                trace elements in the atmosphere over the North Atlantic by measuring           in atmospheric samples from the AEROCE Network sites.  These data               will be used to develop a chemical climatology for the atmosphere               over the North Atlantic, i.e., a description of the mean                        concentrations of the trace elements and the temporal and areal                 variability of the means.  Particular emphasis will be placed on                assessing how physical, chemical, and biological processes in the               atmosphere and oceans affect the concentrations and fluxes of trace             elements.  The transport of dust and the scavenging of dust by rain             will be investigated to understand how the chemistry and air-sea                exchange of mineral dust is coupled to the geochemical cycling of               other substances.  Improved estimates of the distribution and flux of           atmospheric sea-salt will be made by considering combinations of                variables that affect sea-salt production.  Chemical tracers will be            used to delineate the concentrations of certain elements and the                biological productivity of the waters bordering the sampling sites.",
