He will micro-inject various                  substrates into the cells and monitor transient changes in the                  redox state by measuring fluorescence of pyridine nucleotides and               flavins.  The temporal and spatial metabolic modulation by                      specific inhibitors, hormones and drugs will be documented.  He                 will make use of novel types of substrates e.g. caged substrates.               These are substrates complexed with chemicals that keep the                     substrates inactive until the complex is cleaved by light.  This                should permit distinction between diffusion and active                          intracellular compartmentation.                                                                                                                                      In situ studies of intact cells are required if we are ever                to understand the organization of cell metabolism and activities                of multienzyme systems in living cells.  At present we must use                 the questionable technique of extrapolating from data obtained on               enzymes in dilute solution.  These studies should provide new                   insights into metabolic responses to growth, differentiation,                   environmental changes and cellular senescense.",
