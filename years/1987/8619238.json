 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a recommendation for renewal of support of research on the roles        of fungi and oligochaetes in the removal of pollutants from wastewater          as it passes through organic humus.  Prior work conducted under NSF             Grant No. CEE-8312184 characterized the fungi, oligochaetes and bacteria        found in a sphagnum peat onsite wastewater treatment system that has            been in successful operation since 1978.  These investigators found that        between 60 and 80 percent of the total respiratory activity within the          moss was attributable to fungi.  Isolates from this prior work will be          used to inoculate a new peat-based treatment system which will be               compared with a control to determine the effects of selective                   inoculation on the efficiency of the process and lagtime associated with        the placement of these systems into service.                                                                                                                    On-site wastewater systems continue to provide a solution to wastewater         management for a large fraction of the Nation's population.  Their              failure to operate acceptably after relatively short periods of                 satisfactory service is well-documented.  NSF supported the 1983                workshop at Colorado State University on soil absorption of wastewater          that identified research needed to improve the engineering design of            soil leaching systems.  This project has the potential of improving our         understanding of how passage through soil removes contaminants from             wastewater and thus lead to better design and operation of these                systems.                                                                                                                                                        The objectives of this project are consistent with those of the                 Environmental Engineering Program and the qualifications of the                 investigators are appropriate for the work to be done.                                                                                                          Award is recommended as a 24-month Continuing Grant, the initial                increment of which is in the amount of $69,411 for 12 months starting on        February 1, 1987.",
