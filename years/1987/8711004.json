 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research program will investigate the general electromagnetic          problems posed by beams scattered by stratified or periodic                     boundaries, with special attention to several peculiar effects that             have only recently been recognized, namely: unexpectedly large                  lateral, focal and angular beam shifts, as well as modifications of             the beam waist and distortions of its intensity profile.  These non-            specular phenomena are most pronounced when the incident fields couple          energy to waves guided by the scattering structure.  The interactions           between beams and guided waves will therefore be explored in detail,            an original approach being used to examine the dispersive properties            of the scattering configuration in terms of its characteristic                  (surface, leaky, etc.) modes.  Specific pertinent questions will then           be addressed, such as: the effect of the non-specular effects, and              procedures to enhance those effects.  The results are particularly              relevant to engineering areas involving the control and manipulation            of well confined beam fields, with potential applications in                    integrated optics, ultrasonics and microwave acoutics.",
