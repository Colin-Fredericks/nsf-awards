The workshop will                      examinesimilarities and differences among engineering personnel                 data in terms of taxonomies, data elements, and data gaps.  It                  will also identify areas where improvement is needed and provide                a number of options and recommendations for the planning of NSF's               Scientific and Technical Personnel Data System (STPDS) in the                   1990's.                                                                              The maintenance of the STPDS is a major responsibility of                  the Division of Science Resources Studies (SRS).  The system is                 used to collect, analyze, and disseminate information  on the                   science and engineering population in the United States.  The                   engineering work force accounts for over one half of this                       population.  The Directorate for Engineering, which is providing                one half the funding for the project, is responsible for                        supporting the engineering work force through funding engineering               education and research.  The workshop will identify areas where                 this funding may be most effectively targeted.",
