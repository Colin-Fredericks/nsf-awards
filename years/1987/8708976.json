 "awd_abstract_narration": "Characterization of the behavior of saturated rock asses to imposed             perturbations in effective stress is of fundamental importance in               understanding response in rock engineering and tectonophysics.  Of              particular interest are the changes in hydraulic conductivitry that may         be manifest under relatively limited shear displacement across rock             joints.  Where normal stresses are low, relative to the strength of             asperities comprising the joint wall, dilational opening will greatly           increase the void volume of the mass.  Since the potential for                  hydraulic discharge is increased proportionally to the cube of the              joint aperture change, extremely large conductivity enhancements may            occur for modest shear offsets.  The fundamental parameters controlling         this phenomenon are investigated by conducting laboratory and                   analytical appraisals of conductivity enhancement of sheared joints.            Analytical studies will allow the expected performance of idealized             joint profiles to be quantified prior to testing.  The suite of                 laboratory tests, conducted in large scale (12x12x12 inch blocks) and           under shear loading, will allow direct comparison with the analytical           results.",
