 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            established to provide support to strengthen the research environments          and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions or                      institutions that have substantial minority student populations.                Eligible institutions must also have graduate programs in science or            programs in engineering.  Funding is provided for faculty research in           fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and for           the acquisition of research instrumentation.  Kentucky State                    University will use RIMI support to test four specific hypotheses that          focus on the relationship between a state government operated                   management awareness training program and the professional development          of public managers.  The findings of this research should shed new              light on the conceptual and empirical factors that influence                    relationships between management training and professional development          of public managers in an organizational setting.                                                                                                                Evaluative research in the area of public administration continues to           emphasize the relevance of curriculum content, the relative merits of           different delivery styles, and the need for tangible linkage between            training and organizational effectiveness in the work setting.  The             principal investigator is a well-trained political scientist and                public administrator who has published widely in refereed journals.             The Foundation has supported this project because minorities will have          additional opportunities to participate in meritorious research on the          professional training of managers.",
