Computer simulations based on the model                   will be used to prepare plans for physical experiments to test                  the model and control system at pilot or full scale.                                                                                                            The strategies will have the goal of minimizing operational costs               while meeting requirements for the effluent wastewater and sludge               produced.  They will take into account interactions between the                 individual processes as well as those between the liquid and                    solids processing trains.  The dynamic nature of wastewater                     collection systems, receiving bodies of water, and sludge                       transport and disposal will be considered in development of the                 strategy to be used in approaching engineering design of                        treatment plants and in their operation to meet control                         objectives.",
