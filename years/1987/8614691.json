 "awd_abstract_narration": "The basic aim of this research is to investigate the nature and                 evolution of quasars or quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and active                 galactic nuclei.  The observations will be used to study the                    history and evolution of the Universe.  These types of                          investigations have been hampered up to now by the lack of                      sufficiently large QSO samples.  There is particularly a lack of                knowledge of the density and properties of QSOs with redshifts                  greater than 3.                                                                                                                                                 The aim of one project is to complete a QSO sample, which is                    already essentially complete, for redshifts between 1.8 and 3.3                 based on United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope (UKST) objective prism                plates.  A total of more than 90 QSOs have already been confirmed               in this region and there is spectra available of the QSOs.                      Studies will be carried out of samples selected from broad band                 color surveys to complete the survey for redshifts greater than                 1.8.  Observations will also be completed of identified radio                   sources from a Very Large Array (VLA) radio telescope survey in                 the same region.                                                                                                                                                High priority will be given to a survey for QSOs with redshifts                 greater than 3.3.  Objective prism plates in an area of about 140               square degrees of sky will be used.  In the central 30 square                   degrees of this region four QSOs have already been found with                   redshifts between 3.3 and 3.67.  Attempts will be made to observe               redshifts greater than 4.                                                                                                                                       Dr. Hazard is a well-known expert in the study of quasi-stellar                 objects.  He has not previously had a grant from the Foundation.                Dr. Hazard has been very instrumental in helping others find high               redshift quasars.  The results of the research will be very                     important to our knowledge of quasars.  In particular, since very               large redshifts imply very great distances, the light from the                  quasars was emitted billions of years ago.  If there is a maximum               redshift for quasars, the results of the research will provide a                clue to when the quasars were formed.",
