 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Public        Radio (NPR) will provide five years of operation of NPR's Science Unit          to provide science and technology news and information on NPR's MORNING         EDITION, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, and WEEKEND EDITION shows.                                                                                                      Prior NSF support has allowed NPR to create stable, sustained in-depth          science coverage on the national network of 335 local public radio              stations.  More than 9,000,000 people a month, or 2.5% of the U.S.              population each week, listen to NPR's news magazines. Science coverage          includes 400-500 science stories each year.                                                                                                                     NPR's News and Information Service is widely acclaimed; awards have             included the Alfred I. DuPont Columbia University Journalism Award, and         the Science Unit's staff's Westinghouse-AAAS Science Journalism Award           and the National Association of Science Writers' Science in Society             Award.                                                                                                                                                          With this five year award, NPR will consolidate the gains that have been        made, continuing to provide the coverage that has earned their                  reputation, while moving towards financial independence from NSF.  A            FY87  30 month award of $574,449 and, subject to the availability of            funds, following 12 month awards of $240,698 in FY89, $210,939 in FY90,         and $180,623 in FY91 are recommended.",
