 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will apply formal methods in logic, verification and              synthesis to digital design engineering.  The work centers on the use           of applicative notation for system description and functional algebras          for design derivation.  The general goal is to develop a comprehensive          methodology for constructing correct hardware implementations.                  Specific objectives are to establish a practicable algebraic framework          for digital design, to clarify its relationship to conventional design          methods, to explore its implications for design automation, and to              incorporate contemporary formalisms for hardware verification.  The             principal investigator will base this research on his previous                  exploration of functional programming languages in hardware modeling            and design-aids automation.  His methodology has been demonstrated in a         basic transformation system for deriving hardware implementations from          higher-level behavioral descriptions.  In the period of this research,          the system will be refined and oriented toward a programmable                   technology (e.g. PLA and gate arrays).  The emphasis will be on                 supporting engineering expertise in design derivation.  Of particular           interest are the problems of descriptive coherence and logical                  correctness in the presence of orthogonal design decompositions.                VLSI (very large scale integration) is a recent field that explores how         to design highly complex integrated circuits and related electronic             systems.  Research is needed because VLSI devices have become                   increasingly complex and the industry more competitive.  Development of         the field is important to the nation's competitive lead in electronics.         An important research question in this field is that of automatically           translating high-level VLSI circuit behavioral descriptions to correct          and efficient circuit implementations.  Solutions to this problem will          permit VLSI design engineers to concentrate on the behavioral and               functional aspects of the design without being encumbered with a mass           of low level detail.  This research addresses the need to apply formal          methods to VLSI design engineering in order to bring needed                     mathematical rigor into the discipline.  The formal methods will then           become a basis for automating the design process.  The principal                investigator has made important conceptual advances in this area and            will further develop them toward practice in his research.",
