 "awd_abstract_narration": "When the Atmosphere of the earth is disturbed and heated by                energetic particle impact it responds much like a pond when a                   stone is dropped in it.  Waves propagate from the source of the                 disturbance.  These waves, identified as gravity waves, have the                potential to impart energy and momentum to the atmosphere                       depending upon how they propagate.  Currently, there are two                    ideas on how these waves propagate:  the first is that the                      spectrum of waves are breaking and causing turbulence:  the                     second is that the waves are confined to a guide of sorts                       (ducted) and travel undisturbed.  The resolution of this issue is               of current concern in atmospheric sciences.                                          The research program here has as the objective the                         identification of the source regions and propagation direction of               the waves that travel through the ionosphere (Traveling                         Ionospheric Disturbances).  The tool that is used is an array of                ionosondes arranged along a line stretching 23 degrees from the                 auroral zone and including two sets of closely spaced ionosondes                used for triangulation.  Progress to date indicates support for                 the ducted mechanism.                                                                The PI is a highly regarded scientist who has made                         innovative contributions in the use of ionosondes as a research                 tool.  His past record qualifies him to continue this project.",
