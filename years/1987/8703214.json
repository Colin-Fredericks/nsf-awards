 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Stevens will carry out detailed experimental                  measurements of fluorescence in liquids.  These studies will                    require the acquisition and development of modern equipment to                  carry out the kinetic studies in a competitive manner.  From the                temperature dependence of measurable parameters, information  on                the nature of the various complexes that occur may be extracted                 from the experimental data.  This approach has the possibility of               distinguishing subtle, but possibly very commonly occurring,                    differences between bimolecular associates in liquids.  The                     results may lead to a reexamination of concepts such as encounter               complex, collision complex and exciplex.  These types of                        experiments begin to probe a long standing problem of the true                  rate of quenching, once an excited state has been quenched                      diffusionally.                                                                                                                                                          An important component of this experimental program is not              only the acquisition of state-of-the-art equipment for                          fluorescence measurements, but also the involvement of a very                   good undergraduate.  At least two undergraduates will be involved               in this work over the next two years and these students will have               experiences comparable to those other students supported in the                 \"Research Experiences for Undergraduates\" activity.",
