 "awd_abstract_narration": "The equipment purchased through this award is being used to improve the         laboratory components of two courses:  Advanced Cell Biology and                Recombinant DNA Technology.  The courses are designed to present the            fundamentals of experimental procedures and to  provide opportunities           for extensive practice with different pieces of equipment under the             supervision of experienced researchers.                                                                                                                         Among the competencies being developed are microscopy, spectro-                 photometry, electrophoresis of proteins and DNA, growth of bacteria, and        the isolation and manipulation of recombinant DNA.  Use of computer             programs to analyze molecular structures also is  being taught.  A phase        contrast microscope, two UV-VIS spectrophotometers, gel boxes and a             power supply for electrophoresis, an incubator/shaker and a sterile hood        for growing and handling bacteria, a computer and computer software --          all purchased with help from this grant -- are being used to illustrate         current techniques commonly encountered in Molecular Biology.  Students         completing the two courses are learning habits and skills that they can         use in graduate school or in an entry-level position in a research              laboratory.  Many graduates of the program will become science teachers         at the pre-collegiate level.",
