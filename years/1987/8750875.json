 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, Furman University has outfitted most of its               psychology laboratories with appropriate scientific equipment and as a          result, psychology students now receive thorough training in most areas         of scientific psychology.  They do not, however, have access to powerful        microcomputers for data capture and data analysis.  The chief objective         of this project is to equip a multi-purpose laboratory with                     sophisticated microcomputers so that the psychology department can              better prepare undergraduates for research.  Psychology students will           get an intensive introduction to microcomputers in the second course in         the major and will build upon this foundation in upper-level courses.                The computers will be used in three ways.  First, and most                 importantly, students in the course \"Experimental and Statistical               Methods\" will learn to use computers for collecting and analyzing data          from experiments they conduct in the course.  Second, advanced majors           will use the computers for independent research projects that cover a           variety of experimental contexts.  Finally, a large number of students          will utilize the proposed laboratory to conduct computerized exercises          (simulations, classic experimental protocols) that demonstrate phenomena        that are discussed in many of the upper-level courses and to analyze            data that are collected in these courses.                                            This project will permit the psychology department to complete its         goal of equipping the experimental laboratory courses with high quality         scientific instruments.  The psychology program will be greatly                 enhanced, particularly for majors and those students who wish to pursue         graduate work in research programs.",
