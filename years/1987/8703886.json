 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            established to provide support to strengthen the research environments          and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions or                      institutions that have substantial minority student populations.                Eligible institutions must also have graduate programs in science or            programs in engineering.  Funding is provided for faculty research in           fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and for           the acquisition of research instrumentation.  Southern University will          use RIMI support to study viscous laminar flows in helicoidal pipes.            The helicoidal pipe is the first basic extension of a curved pipe.              Researchers will investigate the temperature field in a helicoidal              pipe that is maintained under a uniform wall heat flux condition.               Data collected under these conditions may be used in designing more             efficient heat exchangers that require coil type heat exchange                  elements.                                                                                                                                                       The heat transfer problems will be addressed theoretically and                  experimentally.  The principal investigator is a prolific contributor           to refereed journals in the area of convective heat transfer for                laminar flows in multi-passage circular pipes.  The Foundation has              supported this project because the participation of minorities in               meritorious heat flow research will be enhanced.",
