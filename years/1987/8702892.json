 "awd_abstract_narration": "An analytical and experimental investigation will be performed to study         the impact damage in fiber-reinforced laminated composites and the              effects of their curvature and ply orientation on the damage.  The              analysis will be able to predict the extent and the types of damage in          flat and curved composite structures due to transient dynamic impact.           Stresses and strains in laminates will be calculated by a proposed              finite element method which is based on transient dynamic analysis with         the consideration of material and geometric nonlinearities.  Failure            will be predicted and damage progression will be simulated by the               proposed failure analysis.  The failure analysis will include a                 continuum mechanics approach for in-plane damage and a dynamic fracture         model for delamination growth and arrest.  A user friendly computer code        based on the analysis will be developed during the course of this               investigation.  The code could serve as a design tool to evaluate the           impact resistance of given composite structures and to select optimal           configurations of composite structures for a given application.                 Experimental tests of flat and curved composite structures will also be         performed to assess the validity of the model and the computer                  simulations.",
