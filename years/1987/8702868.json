 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of Kleinian groups is many faceted and in turn                  uses ideas from many other subjects. Haas' previous work has been               a good example of this. He has studied Diophantine problems and                 has successfully used ideas from Riemann surfaces in his work                   with Series on the Lagrange spectrum of the Hecke groups.                            In the current project Haas will continue to focus on                      Kleinian groups and the geometry of their associated Riemann                    surfaces and 3-manifolds. Diophantine problems will be                          investigated from a hyperbolic geometric point of view, the                     problem of elliptic elements in Kleinian groups will be pursued                 jointly with Abikoff and aspects of the geometry and topology of                geometrically infinite Kleinian groups will be studied.",
