 "awd_abstract_narration": "The role of learning in modifying behavior through experience is well           known for the females of many species of bees, wasps, and ants.  Recent         experimental investigations of a social species of bee have shown that          learning by males is important in the mating behavior of this species,          although the generality of these findings is unknown because of lack of         comparisons with related species.  Mr. Wcislo's doctoral-dissertation           research will use behavioral and chemical assays to investigate (1)             whether or not chemicals produced by females attract males in two other         species in the same family of bees, (2) the role of learning by males in        the biology of these species, (3) the details of unusually complex pre-         mating behavior in one of these species, and (4) the chemistry of               glandular secretions, nest-cell linings, and nest entrances of the other        species.                                                                                                                                                        Results from this doctoral-dissertation research project will contribute        to understanding the evolution of recognition mechanisms.",
