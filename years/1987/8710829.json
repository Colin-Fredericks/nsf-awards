 "awd_abstract_narration": "The present generation of concurrent or parallel computers are intended         to be (quasi) general-purpose computers.  Achieving this design goal has        resulted in a significant architectural tradeoff. The channels are too          slow to allow the use of state-of-the-art VLSI processing elements in           order to provide a large number of inexpensive communication channels           between the processing elements.  As a result, these computers have not         offered a sufficient advance in performance or cost-effectiveness over          conventional supercomputers to inspire widespread interest among                scientists and engineers with computation-intensive problems.  However,         by appropriately restricting the class of target applications, it is            possible to design concurrent computers which are at least two orders of        magnitude more powerful and cost-effective than those built thus far,           justifying the programming effort needed to use a concurrent computer.          This research is a study of the relationship between the structure of           computation-intensive problems on the one hand and concurrent computer          architectures on the other. It includes the development of techniques           for characterizing the grain-size dependence of the communication to            computation ratio of several computation-intensive problems, and will           use the results obtained to design architectures for concurrent                 computers which are suitable for these problems. The potential                  discoveries and advances expected from this research are methods for            characterizing the dependence on the decomposition grain size of the            communication to computation ratio of computationally intensive                 problems, and the design of architectures for concurrent computers which        are suitable for these problems.  The emphasis of this research is on           the identification of properties of computationally intensive problems          which can be exploited in the design of application-specific concurrent         computers.  The contribution of this work is to develop our                     understanding of how to characterize these problems so as to be able to         design a concurrent computer which will advance the state-of-the-art for        cost-to-performance-ratio in supercomputers.",
