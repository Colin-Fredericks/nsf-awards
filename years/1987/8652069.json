 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will develop a two-year (24 month) program for college              students who have completed either the sophomore or junior year with a          concentration in science.  An initial summer is designed to provide an          introduction to the foundations of education and schooling and will be          followed by a 6-7 week assignment in a camp or other non-school setting         for adolescents.  A capstone two-semester integrated science course will        be developed for the first year which includes concepts in astronomy,           biology, chemistry, geology, and physics.  The program will include a           pro-seminar providing a format for the study of middle school                   methodology, instructional materials, and curriculum.  It will also             include field placement.  Two special science materials courses, a              computer/technology course and continuous professional studies with             field components complete the program.  Students will be paired with            Mentor Teachers for the entire final year.                                                                                                                      The project is co-directed by a science educator and a research                 scientist.  It is supported by a staff of middle school teachers on             leave, faculty from the university's science departments, and a                 distinguished panel of advisors and consultants.",
