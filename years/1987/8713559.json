 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Bernstein and Horne propose to investigate neutron                         interferometry and diffraction.  These investigations include                   development of new sensitive probes of matter and study of                      fundamental quantum phenomena.  This project continues the ten                  year collaboration with Professor Shull at MIT, a collaboration                 that has played a central role in the development of neutron                    interferometry.                                                                 As a probe, neutrons in crystals are more sensitive to perturbing               influences than in free space.  Both the effective mass                         enhancement and that of a new resonance phenomenon will be                      exploited.  This new resonance occurs when in-crystal neutrons                  are subject to a homogeneous magnetic field of the proper                       magnitude.  They will study possible improvements in the                        effective mass enhancements, possible combinations of the two                   effects, their application to search for other neutron                          properties, e.g., the electric dipole moment, and the possibility               of using ferroelectric crystal diffraction for even greater                     sensitivity.  On the theoretical side, they also expect to                      investigate refinements in the application of the gravitational                 equivalence principle, the description of the Fizeau effect                     (phase shift in a moving medium) and an exact analogy to the one-               dimensional Dirac equation.  Experimental tests will be performed               at a facility being installed at Grenoble and, if possible, at                  the planned NBS cold neutron source.                                            This work on interferometry leads to fundamental quantum                        principles and effects.  Here they intend to pursue a newly                     discovered system that violates Bell's inequality but, like the                 original EPR experiment, does not involve spin.  They will also                 continue their coherence studies including the nature of neutron                wave-packets and investigations of exact spin rotation symmetry.",
