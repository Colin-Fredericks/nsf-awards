 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with mathematical methods in the                  studies of acoustic waves. Wave propagation is a means of moving                energy from one region to another.  When the wave amplitudes are                sufficiently small, as occurs in many problems, then the motion                 is  adequately described by a linearized theory of wave                         propagation.  Thus, the classical theories of wave propagation in               acoustics,optics, electromagnetics, elastic solids, etc.  are                   linearized theories.  When the geometry, material properties and                source structures are  simple it may then be possible to solve                  wave propagation problems explicitly.  However, for realistic                   situations and hence more complicated problems it is necessary to               employ  asymptotic, perturbation, numerical and other approximate               methods to solve wave  propagation problems.                                        The purposes of this research project are to develop and                    apply asymptotic, perturbation and numerical methods to wave                    propagation problems of scientific and engineering significance,                and to study specific physical problems that are basic to future                progress in  wave propagation.  Some of the present effort                      represents a continuation and elaboration on past work.                             Professor Reiss is a well known authority on wave propagation               and Professor Kriegsmann is his younger talented partner.  They                 constitute an excellent, very productive team. This research                    falls into the general area of asymptotic methods and                           perturbation theory in applied mathematics, which constitute an                 active and practical trend in applied mathematics research. Many                of the results obtained by these researchers have direct                        engineering applications in acoustics, radar, sonar and in the                  studies of electromagnetic wave propagation.",
