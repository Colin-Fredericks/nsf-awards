 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses several related topics in the design and use of          concurrent program languages.  First, the implementation of the latest          version of the SR distributed programming language is being polished so         it can be acquired and used by interested parties.  Second, various             extensions to the language and its implementation are being examined.           Specific topics include providing facilities to link new programs into          an executing SR program, providing efficient support for data                   abstraction, developing a stand-alone implementation, and implementing          a powerful macro-processor to facilitate experimentation with new               language mechanisms.  Third, aspects of fault-tolerant programming are          being investigated.  This work includes developing, implementing, and           experimenting with language mechanisms to handle the asynchronous               nature of processor failures; and devising analytical techniques for            determining the performance of fault-tolerant programs.  Fourth, work           is continuing on the MLP system for constructing distributed mixed-             language programs.  The focus here is on adding concurrency to the              system by including SR as one of the supported languages, developing            distributed applications using MLP, and extending the system to include         additional sequential languages.  Fifth, ways are being examined to             extend SR to provide support for parallel programming; specific topics          include providing global, shared operations and providing mechanisms            for group communication.  The final topic being explored is the                 development of paradigms for systematically solving distributed and             parallel programming problems.                                                                                                                                  It is expected that this research will lead to significant improvements         in our understanding of language support issues for building concurrent         systems.",
