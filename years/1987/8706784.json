 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most models of thermal structure within subduction complexes            predict the occurrences of small geothermal gradients and low heat flow.        Calculated and measured geothermal gradients in the vicinity of Nankai          Trough, however, do not support this paradigm.  Moreover, abnormally            high burial temperatures may have affected the accretionary margin of           southern Japan throughout Cenozoic time.  Uplifted portions of the              Nankai accretionary wedge are well exposed along several of the Japanese        Islands; the youngest of these accreted strata (Eocene-Miocene) are             assigned to the Upper Shimanto Group.                                                   This project will collect thermal-maturity data on samples from         the Shimanto accretionary prism, which is being studied by workers at           Cornell and Brown Universities.  Laboratory methods include vitrinite           reflectance and illite crystallinity.  Objectives include testing               tectonic models using thermal-maturity data and documentation of thermal        history within individual units of the complex.                                         The significance of the resulting data will extend well beyond          site-specific issues.  Data will provide a much-needed empirical check          on existing theoretical models of thermal structure.  More importantly,         the Nankai/Shimanto example appears to represent one end member within a        spectrum of thermal regimes.  Consequently, results will likely force an        expansion and refinement of the fundamental conceptual framework of             subduction complexes.",
