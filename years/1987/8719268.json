 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Jim Douglas, Jr., of Purdue University for two          research visits to Brazil and incidental expenses of his collaboration          with Dr. Paulo Paes Leme of the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro.          Their research involves the application of numerical methods to                 simulate the immiscible displacement of one fluid by another in a               naturally fractured porous medium.  Particular attention will be given          to the proper boundary conditions for the partial differential                  equations describing the rock matrix.  Their modelling approach should          improve the approximation of various aspects of fluid flow which have           been treated inadequately in current models, such as the interaction            between the fluids in the fractures and those in the porous rock.  The          numerical methods will be based on both theoretical and experimental            studies, and the algorithms will be formulated in such ways as to               facilitate processing on vector and parallel computers.  Both                   investigators have strong records in computational fluid dynamics;              their collaboration has been very productive and has applications in            oil reservoir simulation which could ultimately improve oil recovery.",
