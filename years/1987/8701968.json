No such material was known until                this program yielded the first, an optically active helical                     metallocene oligomer consisting of as many as 36 hydrocarbon                    rings and three metal atoms, under NSF grant DMR-8213794.                            Ideas are presented for constructing such materials in a                   number of different ways.  These include plans for capping                      conjugated helical hydrocarbons with groups that attract one                    another and allow electrons to pass between them.                               (Tetracyanoquino-dimethanes are the best known examples.)  Others               would terminate the helices with carbonyl groups and then bond                  them either by interactions with aromatic amines or with metal                  ions.  Still others elaborate the scheme used to prepare the                    first helical metallocene.  After oxidation or reduction,                       electrons should be able to delocalize throughout, allowing the                 materials to conduct electricity.  The spiralling motion of their               electrons should make the structures molecular solenoids,                       examples of which are unknown.  Their optical, magnetic, and                    conductive properties should be unique.",
