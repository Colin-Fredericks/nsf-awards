A number of such materials have the common feature that the                     partial degree of spatial coherence is important in understanding                                                                                               the physical behavior which will be studied.  It is intended to                 carry out a systematic study of the structure of the decagonal                  phase of metal alloys, in which there is apparently periodic                    order in one direction combined with some high degree of                        aperiodic order in perpendicular directions.  Proposed                          experiments on the growth of order in alloys will test recent                   theories based on scaling.  Experiments will be done to further                 characterize a new phase of solid oxygen.  Finally, the melting                 of monolayer films of rare gases adsorbed onto the face of MgO                  crystals, in hope of obtaining an experimental system which is                  better suited than graphite for comparison to recent theories                   will be studied.  All of these systems will be studied by high                  resolution x-ray diffraction, both at Stony Brook and at the                    National Synchrotron Light Source.",
