 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principle investigator is looking into the problems of distortion in        circuits that contain multiple p-i-n diodes.  These diodes are used             widely in cable television as well as in military systems.  This                research is being carried out in a predominantly undergraduate                  institution.                                                                                                                                                    Previous studies indicated the need for further investigation of                distortion in multiple p-i-n diode circuits.  The level of distortion in        these circuits is studied as a function of such diode parameters as i-          region thickness, carrier lifetime, and DC forward bias current, as well        as frequency, and attenuation level.  Theoretical results will be               verified by experimental measurements of multiple p-i-n diode circuits.                                                                                         Multi-pin diode circuits are heavily used in radio circuits.  The non-          linearities of these circuits create distortion when a radio frequency          signal is applied.  This project focuses on understanding these problems        of distortion.",
