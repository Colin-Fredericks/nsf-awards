 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current uncertainty in measurements made inside incinerators                    leads to overly conservative safety factors.  These in turn                     preclude economic performance and discourage the introduction of                innovative solutions.  This study will establish the accuracy                   levels necessary for future diagnostics devices, if they are to                 be useful in the determination of reasonable regulations and                    efficient incinerator design.                                                                                                                                   The impact of such a goal for the diagnostics community would                   serve as a focus for the design of better instruments,                          susceptible of accuracy and longevity in the very adverse                       environment of incinerators. The resulting knowledge would lead                 to improved, economically viable designs and to a better                        acceptance of these necessary pollution control devices by the                  surrounding communities.",
