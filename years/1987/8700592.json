 "awd_abstract_narration": "A previous study indicated that thin films of Ag-Si and Ag-                     CuInSe2 composites may be produced with unique optical and good                 electrical transport properties and they may be used to construct               optoelectronic devices with some very unusual properties.  Theoretical          studies of the Ag-0-Cs S-1 photocathode showed that a \"tailored\" Ag-0-Cs        system could produce a photoelectric quantum yield (PQY) of a few               percent at 1.5um, something not realized with presently existing                photoemitters.                                                                                                                                                  In particular, Ag-polycrystalline Si composites 1um thick have                  been made with selective absorption peaks at 2.4, 3.0, 3.8, 4.8, 7.2 and        l2um with extremely large absorption coefficients (10**3-10**4/cm-+)            relative to Si at these wavelengths, in good agreement with a recently          formulated dynamic effective medium approximation (DEMA) developed to           describe these systems.  These composites have measured Hall mobilities         of 425cm2/ (volt-sec) are n-type with resistivities varying between             10**6 to 10**-3 ohm-cm depending upon the volume fraction of Ag.  The           effort here will be to dope these composites with well-defined p- or n-         type conductivity to make them useful in constructing very thin                 optoelectronic devices.",
