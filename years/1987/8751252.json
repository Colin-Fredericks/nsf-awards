 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Teacher Enhancement project will increase the content background           and teaching skills of 48 precollege physics teachers in Virginia               through a three week summer workshop held at the University of Virginia         in each of the next two years.  A representative sample of the target           population was intimately involved in the development and design of the         workshop.  The workshop content will emphasize modern topics in physics         and the use of the computer as an instructional tool.                                                                                                           The workshop staff will provide academic year follow-up in the                  classrooms of the participating teachers and through one or more formal         group meetings during the academic year.  A resource book of inexpensive        physics demonstrations suitable for the high school classroom will be           another outcome of the workshop.  School districts of participating             teachers will assure funds to provide the materials and equipment               necessary for the teachers to implement the new topics in their physics         instruction.                                                                                                                                                    The excellent needs assessment, the commitment of the school districts,         the servicing of a distinct area of need, the relationship of the               project to other related initiatives in the state of Virginia, and the          extensive follow-up during the academic year by the staff of the project        support and substantiate the award action.",
