 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program offers an intensive five-week summer educational program in        Marine Sciences for upper elementary, junior high and high school               teachers.  The program is designed to provide teachers with a general           knowledge of Marine Sciences, ideas for field and lab work that they            could implement in their classrooms and, most importantly, a practical          experience of working and living at sea that would build confidence in          their understanding of the subject.                                                                                                                             The shore-based, three-week component will be held in Woods Hole and            will consist of an intensive 50-hour course of lectures, labs,                  workshops, and field trips in Marine Sciences.  This course will                emphasize the basic concepts in physics, chemistry, geology, and biology        that can be conveyed to students through studies of the oceans.  It will        be directed towards development of curricula to be implemented in the           classroom.  In addition, two short lecture series -one entitled                 \"Massachusetts and the Sea\" and the other on various topics in Nautical         Science - will be presented in order to enhance the subsequent                  experience that the teachers will have at sea.                                                                                                                  The final two weeks of the course will be spent on board a fully                equipped oceanographic research vessel, the R/V Westward, where the             practical hands-on experience of carrying out research projects and             participating in the operation of one of the few remaining \"tall ships\"         that practice marine research will build confidence in the scientific           knowledge the participants have gained, and will refresh and revitalize         their teaching.",
