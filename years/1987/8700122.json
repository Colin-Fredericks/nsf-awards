 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central question in ecology has been whether abundance and               production at a given trophic level are limited by resources or by              higher trophic levels (predation, grazing).  This project includes              research to answer that question for primary producers                          (periphyton) of a desert stream ecosystem during its recovery or                succession following flash flooding.  A first project is to                     provide background information on grazer population dynamics and                energetics which heretofore have not been studied in this system.               Project 2 will utilize field manipulations of both resource                     availability (nitrogen concentration) and grazer abundance to                   determine how limiting factors change over successional time.                   This will add to an increasing base of knowledge of how stream                  ecosystems respond to and recover from disturbance (flash                       flooding).  The third project will explore effects of grazing                   intensity on primary production using grazer density                            manipulations.  If grazing is found to stimulate primary                        production, hypotheses explaining the mechanism of stimulation                  will be tested experimentally.  If grazing is not stimulatory, an               attempt will be made to explain why nutrients released by grazers               are not recycled to stream periphyton.  This final project deals                with a controversial topic in ecology, the question of whether                  herbivory may actually prove beneficial to plants that are eaten.               Dr. Nancy B. Grimm's approach differs from others in that                       experimental field manipulations will be used to test hypotheses.               Arizona State University will serve as the host institution during              the two-year postdoctoral fellowship tenure.",
