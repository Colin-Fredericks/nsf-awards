 "awd_abstract_narration": "Silylene metal complexes, which are compounds in which a metal                  atom is attached by two pairs of electrons to a silicon atom,                   were not known prior to their recent synthesis in the Principal                 Investigator's laboratory. Since such complexes are believed to                 be involved as intermediates in a number of important                           metal-catalyzed reactions of silicon compounds, the results of                  this project are expected to provide a better understanding of                  these catalytic reactions, and also to lead to new reaction                     pathways to silicon-containing materials. For example, one goal                 of the project is to use metal silylene complexes to develop                    new routes to polysilanes, polymers which are expected to have                  useful properties as structural or electronic materials.                                                                                                        This research is directed toward the synthesis and study of                     silylene complexes of late, or low valent transition metals.                    General synthetic procedures will be developed for the                          synthesis of silylene complexes of Mn, Cr, Co, Re, Mo, Rh, and                  Pt, and a detailed examination of the chemical and physical                     properties of these substances will be undertaken. The silylene                 complexes will be characterized by x-ray crystallography, Si-29                 NMR spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and electrochemical                     measurements of redox potentials.",
