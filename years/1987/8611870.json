 "awd_abstract_narration": "Measurement of the normal displacement of a three-dimensional body              subjected to arbitrary loading or boundary displacements has been a             major problem for experimentalists for the past century.  Elaborate             optical methods including holography and speckle interferometry are only        applicable to the two dimensional problem where the specimen surface is         plane.  Recently, improvements in video cameras and computers (storage          capacity) have led to significant advances in image analysis which can          be effectively employed to record displacements.                                The approach is to record and store in pixel form the surface features          of the specimen in its deformed and undeformed state.  Intensity                interpolation methods are then employed to identify small subsets on the        specimen and to determine the displacement of these subsets.  The method        has been established for two-dimensional bodies undergoing plane                deformation.  The proposed program will extend these methods to three-          dimensional specimens by utilizing two video cameras and stereo imaging         procedures to obtain the images required for displacement                       determinations.  Advanced methods of image correlation methods will be          employed to achieve sub-pixel accuracy in the displacement measurements.",
