 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Geography Department at Macalester College will host its third              geography teachers' institute from July 6 to July 24, 1987.  The                institute will host 30-35 teachers of geography and social studies              (grades K-12) in an intensive three-week workshop.  Preference in               admission will be given to teams of teachers--one elementary and one            secondary--from the same district.  Participants will earn eight                semester-hour graduate-level credits.                                                                                                                           The teachers will receive instruction in a wide array of geographical           themes and concepts aimed at enhancing geography education in Minnesota.        Instruction will be provided by two Macalester geographers and augmented        by a staff of classroom master teachers and invited professional                geographers and applications specialists.  All teachers will produce six        modules of instruction designed for classroom use and including salient         aspects of the materials introduced in the institute.  In addition, they        will be required to give two in-service workshops in their home                 districts on the new materials during the 1987-88 school year.                                                                                                  The first week of the summer institute will emphasize local geography,          map and graphic skills, use of air photos, and computer application.            The second week will deal with the concept of the region.  In the third         week, attention is drawn to global patterns and processes.  Both concept        and skill development will be emphasized.                                                                                                                       A number of local field trips will be taken to introduce teachers to            ways of using local resources in their own areas and to teach effective         observational and questioning techniques.  In addition, a number of             visits to museums and libraries are scheduled.                                                                                                                  The teachers are required to attend four full-day follow-up sessions            scheduled for September, November, February and April of the following          academic year.  During these sessions, new materials is reviewed and the        teachers share information about their classroom experiences using the          modules developed as part of the institute.",
