 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to extend an ongoing research program            which seeks to understand the nature of problem solving in classical            genetics.  Previous research by the Principal Investigator has                  demonstrated numerous distinctions between successful and unsuccessful          problem solvers on a variety of moderately difficult genetics problems.         The proposed research will supplement and extend work with difficult            genetics problems.  It will also supplement and extend this data by             analyzing the video taped interviews of a broad range of subjects as            they attempt to solve \"real-world\" genetics problems such as those              requiring the analysis of pedigrees or of non-idealized experimental            data.  The problem representation study of Chi, Feltovich, and Glaser           (1981) will also be essentially replicated in an effort to obtain               preliminary data regarding planning.  During these studies and an               additional longitudinal study of four subjects, special emphasis will be        placed on identifying potential developmental patterns.  Based on these         findings, a computer program is to be generated which will model the            genetics problem-solving performance of subjects from a variety of              levels of expertise.                                                                                                                                            This project addresses the Research Program's goals for advancing the           understanding of the development of problem-solving abilities in a              specific subject matter domain (genetics/biology) in a manner that has          significant implications for developing more effective instruction.  The        Principal Investigator is a young researcher who is well-qualified to           conduct this research.  In carrying out the computer modelling phase of         the project, he will collaborate with Wyllis Bandler, a computer                scientist at Florida State University.",
