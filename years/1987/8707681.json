 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for an Engineering Initiation Award that               outlines an investigation into the use of the maximum likelihood (ML)           estimation procedure for determining the directions of signals impinging        on an array of sensors in a dispersive medium.  The particular                  application of interest deals with the tracking of a radar target in the        low-angle regime when a diffuse multipath component is present.  The use        of the ML estimator is targeted in light of its ability to contend with         a small number of array date snapshots and because of recent algorithmic        developments that significantly reduce the associated computational             burden.  The goal of this work is to define and develop an ML-based             estimation procedure suitable for continuous sources as well as for             point sources.  Present ML-based methods assume the sources of emission         to be point-like in nature and are only strictly applicable in a                specular multipath environment.  If successful, the resulting ML                algorithm will be generalized for use in more complex diffuse signal            source scenarios such as those encountered in tomography, radio                 astronomy, and sonar.",
