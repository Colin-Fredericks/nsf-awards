They will then conduct an analysis of the            relative importance of the several mechanisms suggested in existing             literature on poverty feminization to illustrate how determinants vary          between rural and urban areas and at different scales.  The goal of the         research is to clarify how conditions responsible for poverty                   feminization vary throughout the country, and thereby help explain the          substantial increase in female-headed families that occurred between            1970 and 1980. The geographic dimensions of poverty are important               theoretical and policy concerns.  The investigators are capable young           scholars whose work on the topic will help fill a serious gap in the            literature in social geography and will also provide valuable results           for policy and program formulation.",
