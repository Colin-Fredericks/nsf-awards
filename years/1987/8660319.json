 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problems of assessing the deterioration of musculoskeletal functions        in a human after disease or excessive loads, continues to be a social           problem of enormous magnitude.  Major advances in computerized axial            tomography (CAT) scanning during the past decade has provided an                effective means to spatially and quantitatively examine the internal            structure of parts of the body.  CAT scan images are interpreted to             provide information for improved diagonistic procedures and treatments.         Further advances in the CAT scan method appear possible by utilizing            image analysis methods to quantatively evaluate the CAT scan images.                                                                                            The research program deals with developing software for image analysis          to establish a quantitative method for evaluating bone structure,               density and geometry of the human musculoskeletal system.  Specifically         the project will focus on osteoporosis femur specimens with the                 objective of evaluating the extent and severity of the disease.                 Physical and mechanical property evaluation will also be performed to           correlate CT data with important mechanical properties.                                                                                                         PDA Engineering has an excellent background in R&D associated with both         industrial and medical CT scanner systems and have significant                  experience in biomedical applications.  The staff qualifications are            excellent as the research team has extensive experience in electronics,         NDE and bioengineering which are required for successful completion of          the program.                                                                                                                                                    A grant is recommended.",
