 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in multiple-valued logic have inspired research on the          use and design of these new logic devices.  The principal investigator          has a specific interest in multiple-valued programmable logic arrays            (PLA's), a standard building block of VLSI circuits.  He has developed a        PLA design in collaboration with a research group at the Twente                 University in Holland.  They have implemented test circuits in the              charge coupled device (CCD) technology, which is capable of extremely           small circuits.  The goal of the proposed research is to expand the             principal investigator's research to the area of developing computer-           aided design (CAD) tools for the design of multiple-valued logic PLA's          and to find improved PLA designs.  The research will devise minimization        techniques especially well-suited for CCD PLA's, as well as new CCD/CMOS        PLA's being considered.  The principal investigator will also                   participate in the new Center for Integrated Microelectronics Systems at        Northwestern.  VLSI (very large scale integration) is a recent field            that explores how to design highly complex integrated circuits and              related electronic systems. Research is needed because VLSI devices have        become increasingly complex and the industry more competitive.                  Development of the field is important to the nation's competitive lead          in electronics.  A research question that is becoming more important in         this field as optical and superconducting materials are introduced is           that of using multiple-valued logic (as opposed to the standard, binary         logic).  While there has been a significant amount of research on               multiple-valued logic, results have been primarily theoretical.  Now            that the foundations are understood, the need is for investigations into        tools for design of multiple-valued logic circuits.  This is the focus          of this proposal.  The principal investigator has made important                conceptual advances in this area and will further develop them toward           practice in his research. The budget does not request funds for travel;         the principal investigator has a separate grant.",
