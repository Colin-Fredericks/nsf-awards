 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to demonstrate the value                   of transition radiation in angiography.  Within this area of                    diagnostic radiology, the specific interest is centered on the                  development of a non-invasive method of coronary angiography                    based on the use of monoenergetic x-rays at energies close to                   the K-absorption edge of iodine.  In the past, both                             conventional and synchrotron sources have been used.                            Unfortunately, the conventional sources lack monochromatic x-                   ray beams of adequate intensity, while the cost of a                            synchrotron source is prohibitive.  The specific motivation for                                                                                                 the proposed studies is an urgent need to reduce both the risk                  and cost of coronary arteriography.  The proposed method                        involves the acquisition of radiographs at x-ray energies                       slightly above and below the k-edge in iodine at 33.16 keV and                  the subsequent digital subtract of these two images to achieve                  maximum contrast in the visualization of the intra-arterial                     iodine.  The high brightness and laser-like collimation of                      transition radiation make it an ideal source of x-rays for                      medical applications.  This source has received a relatively                    small amount of attention as a x-ray generator of high                          brightness.  Yet the radiation per electron is several orders                   of magnitude greater than synchrotron radiation, and, as                        demonstrated in Phase I of this program, a moderate electron                    beam of 100 to 500 MeV can be used, whereas a synchrotron                       source requires electron energies of 3 GeV or greater to obtain                 30 keV photons.                                                                      Transition radiation is a cost effective source of hard x-                 rays for non-invasive angiography for the detection of coronary                 disease; lithography for the production of integrated circuits;                 x-ray analysis of biological material; and high resolution                      medical x-ray of organs such as kidneys and heart.",
