The project's focus is on        preparing Hispanic women and other minority and non-traditional students        for careers in local Biotechnology-based industries.  Courses affected          include (in addition to Biochemistry) DNA Technology, Genetics and              Immunology.                                                                                                                                                     Existing equipment for spectrophotometry, ultracentrifugation and               isotope counting is being supplemented by essential additional                  electrophoretic and chromatographic equipment obtained through this             grant, making it possible to offer laboratory work in courses where             previously such opportunities were lacking.",
