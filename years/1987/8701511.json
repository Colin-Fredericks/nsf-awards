 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although there is considerable indirect evidence that                           depolarization of nerve cell terminals leads to the entry of                    Ca+2 and the consequent secretion of neurohormones and                          neurotransmitters, the details of how ionic currents control the                release of neuro-active substances from nerve terminals remain                  undetermined.  This study by Dr. Lemos presents two preparations                in which these questions can be directly addressed.  Much is                    already known about neurohormone release from both the rat neural               lobe and crab sinus gland, and the electrical activity of                       individual terminals has been well characterized.  The aim of                   this research is to analyze, at the level of membrane and                       molecular mechanisms, how depolarization of these nerve endings                 causes release of their peptide neurohormones.                                                                                                                  It is now possible to prepare isolated nerve endings from both                  the neural lobe and sinus gland, which respond to depolarization                by releasing peptide neurohormones via exocytosis.  When                        permeabilized with detergents, thus permitting the entry of                     specific probes into the nerve terminals, this preparation allows               insight into the cytoplasmic events leading to hormone release.                 These neurosecretosomes readily form seals with fire polished                   electrodes, making feasible the application of patch-clamp                      techniques to characterize the ionic currents from both the                     terminal membrane and intracellular organelles, such as                         neurosecretory granules.  Finally, membrane capacitance                         measurements can be utilized in these preparations to directly                  determine the relationship between ionic channel activity and                   secretion at the level of the nerve terminal.  These                            preparations, therefore, have all the properties necessary to                   analyze in detail the process of stimulus-secretion coupling.                   Elucidation of these mechanisms will represent a major advance in               our understanding of how neuronal activity is controlled.",
