 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will study sequential decision problems called               the bandit problems.  At each stage of a sequence of trials the                 experimenter has a choice of actions.  The outcomes of the                      choices have a certain amount of randomness.  The experimenter                  has two conflicting aims; to achieve immediate success and to                   acquire information useful for making future choices of actions.                The research will focus on experimental strategies that are good                even when there is little initial information concerning the                    merits of the various actions.                                                       This research will also study probabilistic combinatorics.                 It will consider counting the number of specific objects in some                collection when the objects are chosen at random on an                          equiprobable basis.  For example, a ramdom listing of n numbers                 may be chosen and the number of times a larger number immediately               precedes a smaller number may be studied.  Behavior of such                     probability distributions for large number of objects will be                   studied for a variety of combinatorial settings.",
