 "awd_abstract_narration": "A course in Molecular Genetics is being developed with a laboratory that        emphasizes gene cloning techniques.  This project is providing a high           speed refrigerated centrifuge for use in large-scale preparative                procedures (plasmids, competent cells, DNA fragments).  Other equipment         needed for this laboratory already has been acquired and currently is           being used by undergraduates to test suggested protocols for actual             class experiments in Molecular Genetics  -- experiments that are                designed to enable the undergraduates to understand and apply modern            methods for analyzing genetic systems at the molecular level.                                                                                                   The unique value of this project for small, undergraduate Biology               programs is that it uses readily available equipment, microbial strains,        reagents and procedures; provides exposure to nucleotide sequencing and         Southern blotting techniques without use of radioactive isotopes; and is        one that can be implemented safely in any physical facility which               conforms to the standard safety features found in most college                  Microbiology laboratories.  Available microcomputer software, some in           the public domain, is incorporated in laboratory applications used for          sizing restriction fragments of DNA and for nucleotide sequence                 analysis.",
