 "awd_abstract_narration": "This biology-based interdisciplinary project offers an                          opportunity each year to nearly 40 undergraduates, drawn from                   diverse subdisciplines of science and humanities, to engage in                  research in anaerobic bioconversion.  This research is of value                 in educating the liberal arts students, many of whom will become                decision makers at various levels in the private and public                     sectors, to a number of societal problems connected with the                    disposal of solid wastes.  Through field research and laboratory                experience, students investigate the physical and chemical                      composition of biomass (local municipal solid waste, agricultural               and animal wastes) and the biological and physical parameters of                the anaerobic process that converts the waste biomass into useful               chemicals and fuel.  Using modern laboratory equipment, science                 and nonscience students cooperate in generating data on anaerobic               digestion.                                                                                                                                                      The grant is providing a gas chromatograph, fermentors, photo-                  micrographic equipment, and a system for computerized data                      collection and analysis.  With these tools the students are                     studing such topics as the microbial colonization of the biomass                surface, the amount and composition of gases/chemicals produced,                reduction of total/volatile solids, and resource economics.  This               interdisciplinary approach to learning sensitizes science majors                to societal concerns, as well as influencing non-scientists to                  develop a regard for science and an appreciation of its potential               for helping solve many of the problems faced by the citizens of a               modern technological society.",
