 "awd_abstract_narration": "Controversy exists on the position of sea level along the NE margin of          the Laurentide Ice Sheet between 10 and 18 ka.  In addition, there are          minimal constraints on the location of the ice front prior to the               first mappable Late Pleistocene raised marine sediments date 10.7               ka.  This research involves a detailed study of Late Quaternary sea             level oscillations along the margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet in the          vicinity of Hudson Strait and Frobisher Bay, Arctic Canada.  Previous           field work suggested that significant oscillations of sea level                 occured over short intervals of time but these are difficult to                 resolve if one relies on dating shells in raised marine wediments.              Using the \"isolation\" method for reconstructing detailed relative sea           level curves, an approach which consists of coring a series of small            lakes above the marine limit down to present sea level, changes in              relative sea level and the paleoenvironments will be deduced from               changes in diatom floras.  Radiocarbon dating of small segments of              cores close to transitions will be carried out by accelerator dating            methods.  As lakes will be cored beyond the 10.7 ka ice margin a focus          of the research will be assessment of glacial/climate/sea level events          across the Younger Dryas chron (ca 11-10ka).  The subsequent period,            between 8 and 10ka, was one of rapid ice sheet retreat and collapse             and thus will serve as an analog for the hypothesized CO2 induced               retreat of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.",
