 "awd_abstract_narration": "This continuing renewal grant for three years is on percep-                     tion in both hearing and vision.  The ability of human listeners                to discriminate temporal changes in sounds is important in under-               standing speech and other complex auditory signals.  Humans often               can identify a particular sound (including speech sounds) by its                \"quality\" independent of its intensity.  Similarly, in vision,                  human observers usually show some degree of visual constancy,                   which is the invariance of certain aspects of object perception                 despite changes in viewing conditions.  Both the auditory and                   visual tasks are discrimination functions that can be studied by                testing how well subjects can detect a particular constant                      feature of the stimulus (particular sound profile or particular                 visual size) presented under a variety of conditions (intensities               or distances, for example).                                                                                                                                     To clarify the discrimination processes involved, a                             quantitative model will be developed for the recognition of                     constant features.  This model then will be tested by seeing how                well experimental data fit the predicted curves for perception                  thresholds.  The subjects will be tested using a discrimination                 procedure, rather than the more usual \"matching\" procedure.  The                major objective will be to measure the ability of listeners to                  discriminate temporal variation in sound, and compare the results               of these experiments with predictions of the model.  The                        secondary objective will be to develop a discrimination procedure               that would be useful in measuring visual constancy.                                                                                                             This work is important and novel because it may demonstrate                     significant parallels between certain aspects of auditory and                   visual perception.  The results of these studies could be useful                in comparing adult human perception with that of infants and of                 animals.",
