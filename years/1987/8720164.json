 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Emerging Engineering Technologies (EET) and other               Divisions in the Engineering Directorate of the National Science                Foundation (NSF) will sponsor a series of expert workshops.  NSF                has historically held such workshops to identify emerging                       engineering technology areas, discuss progress in currently                     funded technology areas, and for other similar purposes.  A                     number of these workshops will be specifically designed to elicit               the views of the scientific, engineering, and business                          communities to assist in the task of identifying emerging                       engineering technologies that may be candidates for new funding                 initiatives within the Engineering Directorate.  This award is to               provide administrative and logistic support for the tasks                       associated with the timely conduct of these workshops and related               activities.  Work to be performed under this award includes:  (1)               arrangements for and conduct of meetings and symposia, (2)                      preparation and editing of papers and reports, and (3) the                      creation and maintenance of mailing lists and other related data.",
