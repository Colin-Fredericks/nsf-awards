 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a sustained collaboration between the                 mathematics education research and professional teaching communities for        the purpose of interpreting and disseminating knowledge about effective         mathematics instruction in the elementary and middle school grades.  A          major goal of the project is to develop and communicate usable knowledge        to career teachers about how mathematics in elementary and middle school        is learned and how it may be taught more effectively.  A parallel goal          is the development of a form of communication between researches and            teachers that will support thoughtful and continuing use of research in         improving instructional practice.                                                                                                                               Two types of products will emerge from this project, specific written           materials and a model for the dissemination of research findings that           should effect teaching.   The written materials will include:  Synthesis        chapters, written by teams of mathematics educators and cognitive               researchers, that will summarize current research knowledge about               mathematics topics relevant to grades 3-8;  Research translations,              written by expert teachers, that will be used as resources for teachers         to learn elementary mathematics in a form tied directly to the school           curriculum and to problems and opportunities for teaching; Training             materials, developed by expert teachers, that will apply the research           findings to actual classroom practice, by providing material for                reflection, discussion, and teacher planning of instruction.                                                                                                    The model developed by the project will demonstrate a means of bringing         research findings to practicing educators via a professional development        network supported by a major teachers' union.  The channels of                  communication opened and developed by this project can be effectively           used to bring instructional research to the classroom, while at the same        time bringing the knowledge and experience of teaching professions to           the attention of mathematics researchers and educators.",
