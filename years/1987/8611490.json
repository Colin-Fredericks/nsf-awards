 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research develops asymptotic solutions to the equations governing          axisymmetric deformation of incompressible shells of revolution                 including:  1.  Large displacements, 2.  Materials non-linearity;3.             Transverse shear deformation; and 4. Polar orthotropy.  Boundary layer          behavior will be examined for the specific problems of clamped circular         plates, circular  cylinders, and spherical caps composed of materials           with rubber-like and biological tissues.  The asymptotic analysis will          be validated by developing direct numberical slutions of the governing          equations.                                                                      Large deformation of axisymmetric shells of revolution has attracted the        attention of the mechanics community in the past 5 years because of the         growing importance in the design of low-weight structures and the               potential applications in biomechanics.  In many applications, the shell        materials are orthotropic, incompressible and non-linear (i.e. heart,           arteries, reinforced rubber and composite materials).  The solution             involving shell displacements and stresses is difficult because of the          combined effects of materials non-linearity, anisotropy and transverse          shear deformation.  The constitutive relations to be developed in this          study are coupled to accommodate both bending and stretching which              occurs with large deformations and asymmetric lamination of reinforced          materials.",
