 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phase II of this SBIR research, will continue the                          development of two types of refraction micro-sensors, resulting                 in at least one calibrated prototype microsensor probe.  It                     will also improve the accuracy and dynamic range of the                         spectrograph detector, largely from off-the-shelf components.                   An optical fiber transmission link will be developed to allow                   remote use of the microsensor; this development will include                    optimizing the reeling and unreeling techniques and minimizing                  the transmission link induced signal distortion.  Finally, the                  work on the index of refraction to specific volume algorithm                    will continue with higher order terms in temperature and                        pressure included.  The goal is an equation of state for the                    specific volume good to 1x10-5 cm 3/g at the 95% confidence                     level.                                                                               The refraction microsensor and transmission link                           improvements from this research would have its most immediate                   commercial application in the chemical process control industry                 and HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography).  It would                    also have a long awaited application in oceanography, but with                  a longer development effort.  The precise measure of seawater                   density in the oceans is critical to many investigations.                       Traditional methods for deriving density rely on independent                    measurements of seawater temperature, pressure, and                             conductivity.  Differences in electronic sensor response rates                  and other drawbacks have become a limiting factor in making                     these determinations.  However, the optical properties such as                  the index of refraction of light in seawater (and other                         liquids) change as a function of density.  Recent advances in                   optical technology make it now possible to measure these                        changes and transmit data more effective than is presently                      possible using electric or electromechanical sensors.",
