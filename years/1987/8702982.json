 "awd_abstract_narration": "Operator algebras is a central discipline in Modern                       Analysis which has important historical and current applications.               It arose in the early decades of this century in connection with                establishing a mathematical framework for quantum mechanics.                    This pioneering work, associated with the names of von Neumann                  and Murray, and referred to as the noncommutative analog of                     probability theory and of measure theory, treated selfadjoint                   algebras of operators.  In recent years, again in connection with               applications in physics as well as in engineering and operator                  theory, mathematicians have turned their attention to the                       theory of non-selfadjoint operator algebras.  This study is in                  its infancy, and the structure theory of such algebras is                       being intensively investigated.                                                       Professor Pitts is a young mathematical analyst whose                     research career is off to a stunning start.  He recently                        completed his doctoral dissertation on the structure of                         certain types of non-selfadjoint operator algebras called                       nest algebras, studying them as subalgebras of von Neumann                      (selfadjoint) algebras.  In this work he obtained several new                   results on factorization problems and connections with K-                       theory of these algebras.  In the current proposal, Professor                   Pitts plans to continue his successful research activity by                     investigating difficult and long outstanding problems                           concerning similarity and connectedness questions in nest                       algebras.",
