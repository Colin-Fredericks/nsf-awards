 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus on the relation between vector                    bundles and the geometry of space curves.  In particular, it will               consider questions about the Hilbert scheme of smooth space                     curves and conjectures on the syzygies of the generic canonical                 curves.  Also work will be done on varieties with small dual                    varieties and their relations to questions about varieties of                   small codimension in projective space.                                               This research is in the area of algebraic geometry, which is               the study of the geometry of sets of simultaneous solutions of                  systems of polynomials in many variables.  This subject is one of               the most important and venerable in all of mathematics and has in               recent years been instrumental in fundamental advances in many                  areas of core mathematics as well as applied mathematics and                    computational mathematics.  This research, by an extremely                      successful and productive mathematician, will have a great impact               on the field.",
