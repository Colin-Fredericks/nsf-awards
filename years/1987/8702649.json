 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is aimed at investigating a perceptual model              for representing information in speech based on spectral shape                  factors of short-time speech spectra.  Spectral shape factors are               defined as the low-ordered components of a cosine basis vector                  expansion of speech spectra.  The primary objective of the                      proposed research is to determine whether spectral shape factors                are fundamental information-bearing parameters for speech, or                   whether they are merely a convenient method for encoding speech                 spectra.  For both vowels and stop consonants, a perceptual model               which is based on spectral shape factors will be directly                       contrasted with a perceptual model which is based primarily on                  the peaks in the spectrum.  In both cases experiments will be                   conducted to determine the extent to which coustic invariance in                the speech signal can be represented by spectral shape factors.                 This research will not only contribute to a fundamental                         understanding of the information-encoding process in speech, but                also has the potential for aiding automatic speech recognition                  research and work in the area of sensory substitution for the                   hearing impaired.",
