 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of the proposed research is to develop            the capability to model the trapping and radiative transport of                 auroral ultraviolet resonance line emissions measured by                        spacecraft and rockets.  Since auroral emissions vary strongly                  with horizontal position, this requires the development of a two-               dimensional radiative transfer code to model the transport of EUV               resonance line photons under distinctly non-plane-parallel                      conditions.  This radiative transfer program will utilize a                     matrix-method solution, with the two-dimensional problems by                    using Fourier transforms.  To provide input for the radiative                   transfer program, we also require auroral electron transport                    codes with variable energy grids to handel the high energy                      electrons found in auroras.  After the successful development and               testing of these programs, they will be applied to data from a                  variety of experiments (e.g., the Viking UV Imager, the STP78-1                 EUV spectrometer, and nightside auroral rocket data).  The                      results will provide valuable information about the energy and                  flux of the precipitating electrons, on both local and global                   scales.  In addition, the programs will be made general enough to               apply to auroras occurring in the atmospheres of other planets,                 such as Jupiter.                                                                        The principal investigator has a sound record of previous               research in the field of radiative transport, and the probability               of success of this endeavor is high.",
