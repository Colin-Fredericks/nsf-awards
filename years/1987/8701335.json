 "awd_abstract_narration": "In both vertebrates and invertebrates, endogenous clocks                        governing the expression of biological periodicity are localized                in the central nervous system.  One such clock in the fruitfly                  Drosophila has been the subject of extensive genetic and                        molecular studies.  These studies have resulted in the                          identification of several genes whose products determine the                    properties of biological clocks in Drosophila.  One of these                    genes, per, has been cloned and sequenced, making it possible to                elucidate the structure of a clock protein.  The presence of                    per-homologous transcripts in deletion-bearing mutants lacking                  the per locus suggests that a family of related clock genes                     exists in Drosophila.                                                                                                                                           Dr. Jackson has begun to test this hypothesis by using                          reduced-stringency hybridization conditions to isolate                          per-homologous clones from phage/Drosophila cDNA and genomic                    libraries.  In order to further characterize these putative                     biological rhythm genes, he proposes the following studies.                     (1) He will characterize the tissue and developmental expression                of per-homologous genes.  (2) The chromosomal location of these                 genes will be determined, and (3) genetic methods will be used to               assess their role in the development and maintenance of                         biological rhythms.  (4) The complete DNA sequence of one of                    these related genes will be derived in order to predict the                     primary structure of a per-homologous protein. Completion of                    these aims will provide information on the genetic                              basis of biological rhythms.",
