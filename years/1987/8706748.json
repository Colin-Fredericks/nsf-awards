 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the Skyrme model, baryons emerge as topological solitons             from a nonlinear theory of mesons.  The relation of conventional                nuclear physics to non-perturbative QCD in terms of this model is               expected to lead to a deeper understanding of the structure of                  the nucleon and nuclear interactions.  It is proposed to do exact               numerical calculations of the time evolution of skyrmion                        scattering processes in three dimensions.  The effective                        interaction potential and corresponding inertia will be deduced                 as a function of energy.  Internal excitations of skyrmions and                 pion emission from solitons are expected.  These calculations                   would allow the first study of skyrmion-skyrmion collisions with                finite impact parameters and arbitrary relative isospin                         rotations.  In addition, several interesting static calculations                are planned.  By imposing periodic boundary conditions, the                     density dependence and many-body effects for lattices of                        skyrmions (skyrmion matter) can be studied.                                             The proposed research project involves undergraduate                    students at Westmont College.  It will provide hands-on                         experience in research and motivate and prepare students for                    advanced degree studies in physics.",
