 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer aided design and simulation of a large class of                        separation processes involving many components (e.g.,                           distillation and absorption) is currently carried out under the                 assumption that the various components are always at exact                      thermodynamic equilibrium at every part of the equipment.  This                 is not always true, and frequently the separation is controlled                 by the rate of transfer of components from one fluid to another.                Yet, presently, models based on mass transfer are not available                 for use in design and simulation.  This proposal outlines a                     research program to develop and test such rate-dependent models.                If successful, the results will have a potential impact on a                    large number of multicomponent separation operations.  Further,                 the results of this study will be useful in evaluating the                      current status of design concepts based on rate-controlled                      separation processes and in determining whether currently                       available experimental data are sufficient to proceed with the                  development of design procedures such as the ones suggested in                  this proposal.",
