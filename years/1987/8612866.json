The               PI plans to study:                                                                                                                                                   (1)  Electrogenerative reduction of nitric oxide in                                  concentrated and dilute gas streams under a variety of                          conditions; also the reduction of 2-methyl-2-nitro-1                            propanol in an aqueous electrolyte.                                                                                                                        (2)  The oxidation of ethanol and related compounds both in                          the gas phase and dissolved in liquid electrolytes.                                                                                                        (3)  The use of electrochemical methods to study nitric                              oxide reduction in the presence of special adsorbates.                          Some aspects of kinetics in operating cells and                                 catalysis associated with the processes proposed here.                          The operation of electrogenerative cells of improved                            design together with the incorporation of experimental                          packed bed electrodes into electrogenerative systems.                                                                                                 Interest in electrogenerative nitric oxide reduction stems from                 two important possibilities.  One is that there appear to be a                  number of factors indicating that electrogenerative reduction of                nitric oxide could be developed to replace the present industrial               heterogeneous catalytic process in preparing hydroxylamine;                     another is that selective electrogenerative reduction or a                      related electrochemical process might be developed to become                    suitable for removal of NOx from the tail gas of nitric acid                    production or effluents from stationary power plants.  Since more               than 5,000,000 tons of NOx (mostly NO originally) are produced in               stationary power plants in the United States each year the                      possibilities for making chemicals through reduction of oxides of               nitrogen are impressive.  The nitrogen oxides originate from                    nitrogen compounds in the fuel feed or the reaction of nitrogen                 and oxygen at elevated temperatures to form NO.  Fuel pre-                      treatment to remove nitrogen compounds is common while controlled               burning minimizes nitric oxide formation in combustion and limits               the temperatures of combustion.  The development of an                          electrochemical means for removing NOx from effluents and                       recovering a significant portion of the nitrogenous material as                 useful chemicals could alter the view and procedures in power                   plant combustion.  One possibility for pollution abatement with                 respect to NOx then would be controlled removal of sulfur dioxide               at some stage without restricting NOx formation during combustion               at power plants, followed by effluent feed to a selective                       electrochemical cell where NOx could be reduced and removed.",
