 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award would allow Professor Frank J. Sciulli, Columbia University, and      other American scientists to collaborate with Dr. Guenter Wolf, Deutsches       Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, and Professor Erwin Hilger,             University of Bonn, Germany (FRG).  They will work with other scientists        at DESY to construct a 250-ton uranium-scintillator barrel calorimeter to       be incorporated as a major component of a detector (ZEUS) for scientific        research with an electron-proton collider (HERA).  HERA is under                construction in Hamburg and is scheduled to begin operation in 1990.                                                                                            To design and construct ZEUS, the U.S. group must visit DESY to work on         shared technical problems concerning components of HERA that are being          designed elsewhere.  Professor Sciulli's group is responsible for the           electronic readout system of the entire calorimeter system.  They will          require the use of specialized electronic components which must be              designed, made into prototypes, and tested.  His group will develop the         components in collaboration with private industry in the U.S.  The success      of this project could have important consequences for high energy physics       and electronics engineering.",
