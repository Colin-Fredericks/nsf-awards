 "awd_abstract_narration": "Significant advances have been made in the utilization of high data-rate        optical fiber communication systems.  Developments in processing                technology have led to the planar fabrication of various optical guided         wave and opto-electronic components.  Advances in material technology           combined with the convenience of parallel signal processing in optics           have sustained the interest in optical computing.                                                                                                               However, the fabrication of guided wave and opto-electronic devices is a        complex matter.  Variations in material growth and microfabrication             processes affect their optical and electronic properties which directly         affect the performance of the devices and systems.  While the material          \"constants\" can only be obtained from measurements, the design of the           integrated system must be done in such a fashion that system performance        can be predicted.  Computational models, eventually computer aided              design, are necessary.                                                                                                                                          Researchers at the University of California San Diego will investigate          the modeling of components in LiNbO3 materials.  Investigation will be          made of computational models for index profile, electro-optical index           change, and passive and active devices including the effects of                 microwave properties and system representation of the components.               Collaboration will be established with Crystal Technology and                   Westinghouse for experimental data on devices and computational                 techniques.                                                                                                                                                     The institutional support is adequate and the PI is well qualified to           carry out the research.",
