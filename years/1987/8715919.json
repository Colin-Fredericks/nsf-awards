 "awd_abstract_narration": "The removal of deleterious gas components is usually                       expensive and necessary to limit environmental impacts.  This is                especially true in the use of low quality fuel feedstocks.  Social              concern and Government regulations are causing industry to support              research addressing these problems.  An Industry/University                     Cooperative Research Center on Gas Cleaning is a possible approach              for industry to support this university research.  This planning                grant is studying the feasibility and viability of forming such a               Center.                                                                              This planning grant is studying the organizations, policies,               and operational alternatives for an Industry/University                         Cooperative Research Center for Gas Cleaning through a consortium               composed of New Jersey Institute of Technology, West Virginia                   University, Ohio State University, and the University of Illinois               at Urbana-Champaign.  A study of the research that industry would               consider supporting as part of a university research program is                 also being made.                                                                     The Principal Investigator and his colleagues are experts in               their fields and have the experience and industrial interfaces                  necessary to conduct this study.                                                     This planning grant has been coordinated with Dr. Tapan                    Mukherjee, CES                                                                       The Program Manager recommends that the New Jersey Institute               of Technology in collaboration with three other universities be                 awarded $132,000 for a one (1) year planning grant.",
