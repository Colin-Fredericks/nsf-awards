 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since Ramon Y Cajal first described the elaborate shapes of                     neurons in the mammalian brain, it has been of interest to                      understand how the dendritic and axonal branching patterns of                   cortical neurons develop.  One intriguing aspect of development                 is the relationship between axonal outgrowth and the formation of               dendritic structure.  In the past, very few studies of cortex                   were designed specifically to address this issue, primarily                     because available morphological techniques did not favor                        simultaneous examination of dendritic and axonal arbors.  The                   technique of intracellular dye injection has overcome this                      limitation, but as yet it has not been applied to questions of                  correlated dendritic and axonal development in cortex.                                                                                                          The objective of Dr. Claiborne's research is to correlate axon                  and dendritic development of cortical neurons using intracellular               dye injection and both light and electron microscopic analyses.                 The work focuses on two questions:  (1) Does synapse formation by               the axon precede dendritic outgrowth?  (2) Once dendritic growth                is initiated and the adult pattern of dendritic branching                       emerging, does further axonal development occur?  These questions               will be addressed using an in vitro brain slice preparation from                developing rat pups.  The results of her studies will yield                     important and useful information on the development relationships               between dendritic branching, axonal branching and synaptogenesis                in identified neurons.  Many of the issues to be evaluated are                  central to defining mechanisms of growth and differentiation of                 neurons in the central nervous system.",
