 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scope and quality of undergraduate research in experimental                 psychology is being expanded and upgraded.  The new equipment is                allowing laboratory experimentation in four areas: psychomotor                  performance; biofeedback; operant conditioning; and perception and              cognition.  As a liberal arts university for deaf students one focus of         laboratory experimentation and research in the undergraduate                    experimental psychology course is on the sensory, motor, cognitive and          physiological concomitants of deafness.  Under the plan students are            learning the basic principles of experimental design, data analysis, and        preparation of reports by conducting experiments which are both                 interesting and instructive, utilizing modern and advanced                      instrumentation.  Psychomotor equipment, biofeedback equipment, and             operant conditioning equipment have been added as well as a constant            illumination projection tachistoscope.  In addition to strengthening the        undergraduate course in experimental psychology, the equipment is               contributing to improvements in other experimentally-oriented courses,          such as perception, learning, motivation and independent study                  (supervised student research).",
