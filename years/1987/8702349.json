The program is designed to enable U.S. scientists and             engineers to conduct long-term research at research institutions in the         industrialized countries of Western Europe as well as Japan, Australia,         and New Zealand.  Exchange awards provide opportunities for the conduct of      joint research and the utilization of unique or complementary facilities,       expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                     Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to             his/her field of science, the prospective potential of the applicants for       professional growth, as well as criteria relevant to the furthering of          international cooperation in science and engineering.  The program is           particularly directed to scientists and engineers who are embarking on          their research careers.                                                                                                                                         In this research project molecular modelling and simulation techniques          will be used in conjunction with X-ray diffraction and NMR data to              determine macromolecular structures.  Work will concentrate on serine           proteases, a class of enzymes containing a serine residue at an active          site which serves to cleave the peptide bond.  These enzymes are a              research emphasis of the Max-Planck-Institute for Biochemistry.                                                                                                 The project is under the direction of Dr. Richard A. Engh, Department of        Chemistry, The University of Chicago, 5735 South Ellis Avenue, Chicago IL       60637, U.S.A., and Dr. Robert Huber, Max-Planck-Institut fur Biochemie,         8033, Martinsried by Munchen, Federal Republic of Germany.                                                                                                      This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,              international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents allowance,       if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat administrative        allowance of $250 or the U.S. home institution.",
