 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hamilton's major accomplishment, as part of his doctoral thesis,                was to show the consistency of the model of a type I supernova,                 exploding from an accreting white dwarf, with the observed x-rays               of the supernova remnant, caused by a shock moving into a plasma                consisting of heavy elements rather than hydrogen.  His planned                 studies include both supernovae and galaxy clustering, radiation                processes and hydrodynamics.                                                                                                                                    Hamilton is a promising young theoretician working on supernovae                and the clustering of galaxies.  Supernovae are the most                        energetic explosions of stars, thought to create the elements of                which the Earth is composed.  The blast wave from the explosion                 causes x-rays observed by satellites.   Hamilton produced the                   first detailed explanation of the x-rays from one major kind of                 supernova remnant, substantiating thereby the models for the                    supernova and for its production of the elements.  Hamilton is                  also interested in problems of cosmology, specifically the manner               in which galaxies are clumped in space.  He is an expert on both                radiation processes and hydrodynamics.",
