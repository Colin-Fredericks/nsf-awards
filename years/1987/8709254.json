 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project deals with extensions of both                         theoretical and applied aspects of latent class analysis, a                     statistical technique for subdividing sets of data on individuals               into groups whose properties are relevant to the subject of                     scientific inquiry. In survey research, for example, it is                      difficult to say how many U.S. citizens are in favor of, opposed                to, or indifferent toward some particular issue under                           investigation unless we ask different kinds of questions related                to that issue and then take account of the many possible ways                   that people actually respond to those questions. Latent class                   analysis is one statistical method for getting around this                      measurement problem. It allows the researcher to classify the                   population (as estimated by some sample) into groups which                      summarize all the ways individuals might respond to the various                 survey items.                                                                        Typical uses of the method include the measurement of                      abilities or aptitudes in the field of education research (to                   assist in the selection of test questions, for instance), and the               analysis of respondent data obtained in surveys of attitudes,                   expections, or preferences in public opinion polling or in the                  field of market research (to help asses the extent of change over               time, for instance). The goal of the present project is to extend               the applicability of latent class analysis by building general-                 purpose procedures that can be employed in areas of the social                  sciences.",
