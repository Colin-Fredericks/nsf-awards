 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ubiquitous presence of acoustic-gravity waves at all                levels of the atmosphere is well known.  These waves, after being               excited by various sources, can propagate throughout all levels                 of the atmosphere from the troposphere to the thermosphere and                  can propagate large horizontally distances on the global scale.                 As these waves carry momentum and energy, they may play and                     important role in determining the large-scale circulation in the                middle atmosphere and in coupling between the thermosphere and                  the lower atmosphere.                                                                   The World Acoustic Gravity Wave Study (WAGS) study involves             periodic campaigns, in which the PI and his associates                          participate.  They were involved in a workshop on WAGS in January               1987.  They will analyze data from the campaigns and perform                    theoretical investigations on the interaction of radar beams and                propagating waves.  Other theoretical research topics include the               interaction of gravity waves with atmospheric vortices, such as                 are found in cyclonic disturbances.                                                     The subject of gravity waves is receiving increased                     attention as a source of energy and momentum coupling between the               lower and upper atmospheres, and of mixing and turbulence                       throughout the atmosphere.  The PI and Co I are internationally                 recognised experts in the field.",
