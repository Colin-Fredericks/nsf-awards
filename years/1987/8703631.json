 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation will continue the study of models of                     biological and physical systems which are related by the fact                   that they can be formulated in terms of functional and partial                  differential equations with nonlocal terms. The main three areas                of this study are concerned with: a) the effect of age-structure                and other internal variables of a population on the dynamic                     behavior of epidemic models; d) the effect of the size, shape and               compartamental nature of a cell on the critical phenomena that                  control the cell cycle; c) the formation and stability of spatial               patterns in systems of coupled degenerate diffusion equations                   modeling physical, chemical as well as some population processes.               The project will employ both analytical and numerical simulations               that will be aimed at fitting the mathematical results to                       experimental data.                                                                  Each of the three problems requires the development of new                  mathematical techniques of analysis that can be applied to broad                classes of equations that occur in the analysis of certain                      biological and physical phenomena. One of problems of general                   interest that is related to this research is the process of                     vertical transmission of infectious diseases in populations.                    Mathematical modeling of this process may help to understand                    better the process of disease transmission.",
