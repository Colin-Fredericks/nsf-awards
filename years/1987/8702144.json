 "awd_abstract_narration": "Willhelm Stoll will continue his investigations of the value               distribution theory of meromorphic maps for fixed and moving                    targets and the geometry and analysis of parabolic spaces. In                   particular he will work on conjectures of Nevanlinna, Griffiths                 and Cartan as well as on the interpretation of the curvature                    stress formula, algebroid reduction and the Ricci function on                   parabolic manifolds.                                                                 Pit-Mann Wong will investigate the singularities of                        solutions to the complex homogeneous Monge-Ampere equation. In                  particular he will study the relationship between the singular                  set and totally real embedding. He will also study Nevanlinna                   theory from the point of view of complex affine geometry.                            The problems to be addressed by Stoll are all important  in                value distribution theory of several variables. The problem of                  moving targets involves the question of how often the image of                  the map agrees with the image of some given map of slower growth.               The Cartan conjecture involves allowing degeneracy of the map.                  The Griffiths conjecture is concerned with non-equidimensional                  value distribution theory. Together with Wong he will investigate               problems arising from the fact that complex Euclidean space can                 be characterized by the existence of an exhaustion function                     satisfying a homogeneous complex Monge-Ampere equation.",
