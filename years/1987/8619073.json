 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a result of increasing demand for chemicals, the industrialized world        faces the problem of release of these often toxic substances in the             environment.  There is therefore a need to assess the impacts of these          toxicants on the environment.  The major objective of this research             project is to develop an enzymatic toxicity testing method.  The                enzymatic activity of betagalactosidase in E. Coli will be used as the          toxicity testing mechanism.  Various toxicants including inorganic and          organic substances will be used for study.  The toxicity assay will be          further studied to better understand the effects of toxicants on enzyme         induction by a gratuitous inducer such as isopropylthiogalactoside              (IPTG).  The development of a miniaturized test and the use of                  immobilized E. Coli cells will also be considered.  Various means to:           sensitize E. Coli cells to environmental toxicants will be explored.                                                                                            The principal investigator is highly qualified to perform this research.        A two year continuing grant is recommended.  This award is for $90,198          for the first year.",
