 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three seismograph stations have been deployed in eastern Kazakhstan,            around the Soviet nuclear test site as part of a cooperative agreement          negotiated between the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the         Soviet Academy of Sciences.  Data from these stations represent a unique        seismological dataset and are crucial to the better understanding of            several seismological problems pertinent to any eventual monitoring             system for a test ban treaty.  Until now, these problems could be               addressed only by analysis of data collected outside this region or from        the Soviet literature.  Regional data prior to now has all been from            stations to the south in Iran, Afghanistan, and India.  Paths from this         area of the Soviet test site to each of these regions cross tectonically        active regions which can seriously bias the results.  This proposal             request funds for the preparation of the data for distribution to the           seismological community and for the examination of several seismological        problems.",
