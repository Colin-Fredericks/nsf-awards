 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is improving the quality of the laboratory part of a course         in Cellular Biology.  The laboratory experience is acquainting Biology          majors with such modern experimental and analytical techniques of Cell          Biology as microscopy, tissue culture, cytological, cytochemical, and           labeling methods, methods of cell fractionation (esp. centrifugation),          and methods of molecular analysis (esp. electrophoresis).  The equipment        for this project falls into three categories -- microscopy, centrifuga-         tion, and electrophoresis: phase-contrast compound microscopes for              observing living cells, phase-contrast inverted microscopes for                 observing tissue cultures, a fluorescence accessory to detect                   fluorescent stains and labeled antibodies and a video accessory to              facilitate group observations, a tabletop ultracentrifuge for cell              fractionation, a micro-centrifuge for molecular techniques, and                 electrophoresis systems for the analysis of proteins and nucleic acids.                                                                                         Instead of depending on demonstrations, all students now can be exposed         to a more realistic atmosphere of experimental science that encourages          originality and the cultivation of research and problem solving skills.         Such experience is particularly valuable for students who are planning          to enter graduate school, and those who are planning to become Biology          teachers.",
