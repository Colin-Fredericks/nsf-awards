 "awd_abstract_narration": "The collision dynamics of reactions of small free radicals will                 be investigated by molecular beam scattering and laser                          fluorescence detection techniques.  In reactions between two                    open-shell species, several potential energy surfaces arise in                  both the reactant and product channels.  Of particular interest                 will be the effect these multiple reaction paths have on the                    product internal state distribution, especially the                             partitioning among fine-structure states of open-shell                          products.  Special emphasis will be placed on the study of the                  prototypical O + NH reaction, for which two possible chemical                   pathways are available, namely the formation of OH + N and H +                  NO products.  In addition, further investigation of the effect                  of initial spin-orbit level on chemical reactivity will be                      carried out for reactions of metastable Ba and other metal                      atoms.                                                                                                                                                          This work provides important insights into the reaction                         dynamics of open shell systems.  Such reactions are essentially                 unexplored in the field of reaction dynamics because of                         experimental difficulties.  Such unstable radicals may occur in                 flames, electrical discharges, and atmospheric processes.                       Information to be obtained in Dr. Dagdigian's research program                  can have an impact on understanding such systems and in some                    cases controlling chemical reactions.",
