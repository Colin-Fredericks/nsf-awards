 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a study of the design and control of vapor recompression        distilation in order to develop computer models for the isopropanol -           water system.  The research project augments the research program of            Lehigh University's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for         Chemical Modelling and Control (CDR 86-43400).  The Center's Industry           Advisory Board has endorsed the project and will monitor the research.                                                                                          The Principal Investigator is qualified to do the project.  Travel funds        to study an operational unit in Chile are being provided by NSF's               International program.  He will use a student research assistant in             accordance with the Program Announcement for the  Supplemental Funding          for Support of Women, Minority and Handicapped Engineering Research             Assistants.                                                                                                                                                     I recommend Lafayette College be awarded a grant of $25,608 for one (1)         year for this project.",
