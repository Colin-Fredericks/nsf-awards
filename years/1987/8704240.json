 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will                investigate various mechanisms which can generate masses for the                quarks and leptons in the superstring framework.  Of special                    interest is the possibility that a see-saw mechanism can arise                  which would lead to ultralight Dirac or Majorana neutrino masses.               Conditions under which such a mechanism can appear will be                      studied.  In particular, discrete symmetries which allow or                     forbid certain entries in the mass matrices will be identified.                 An effort will be made to find a suitable compactification                      manifold with the appropriate discrete symmetries.  The general                 issue of quark and lepton families will be addressed, as well as                the possibility of mirror families.  Other unforeseen research                  may be done in response to the evolution of the field.                                  The work will be carried out by a highly-respected                      theoretical elementary particle physicist, and is important to                  the furthering of our understanding of the elementary particles                 and the basic forces.",
