 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Hanson has recently initiated a program to investigate inner                shell electron excitations of diatomic, triatomic, and  small                   polyatomic molecules specifically chosen to enable the properties               of different types of chemical bonds to be characterized.  This                 program is one of the few in the world that is systemically                     studying such properties.                                                                                                                                       Dr. Hanson will use tunable and monochromatic soft x-ray                        radiation obtained from the National Synchrotron Light Source VUV               Ring at Brookhaven National Laboratory to excited gas phase                     molecules selectively in the region of the K or L edge of the                   constituent atoms of the molecular systems.  Information about                  the primary excitation process and the subsequent series of                     events will be obtained by using the techniques of photoelectron                spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy,                 including coincidence measurements.  One of the prime objectives                of this research is establishing the correlation between Auger                  decay chananels and fragmentation channels.  The information                    gained in these experiments is expected to be of benefit to                     technology and a variety of disciplines.",
