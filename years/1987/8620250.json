 "awd_abstract_narration": "In joint work with Elgot and Wright, the PI used the notion of                  iteration theories in axiomatizing the control structure of flowchart           algorithms.  Iteration theories also appear to provide an                       axiomatization                                                                  for the functorial description of circular abstract data types as               described most recently by Smyth, Lehmann, Plotkin, Arbib & Manes,              and others.  The PI is now investigating the suitability of iteration           theories for the description of abstract data types.  It is being               determined whether the same equational axioms can be used to describe           both the control structure of programs and the structure of the data            types, operations and domains on which the programs operate.  Also              in progress is the development of algorithms for the solution of                problems concerning the equivalence of data type descriptions:  Given           two descriptions (as fixed points of certain endofunctors), do they             describe the \"same thing\"?  The question is analogous to the question:          Given two flowchart schemes, do they have the save behavior?                    Verification that the connection between iteration theories and                 data types is as the PI expects will show that these two questions are          identical.                                                                                                                                                      The proposed research is expected to lead to an improved understanding          of data types.  The PI has a fine record of related research                    accomplishments.",
