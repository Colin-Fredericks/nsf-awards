 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hormones secreted from the gonads have a major impact on the behavior of        mammals.  Most of the behavioral effects of gonadal hormones are thought        to be mediated by the central nervous system; however, very little is           known about the underlying mechanisms.  This project will use a                 functionally significant communicative behavior of the hamster as a             model system to study how gonadal hormones interact with the brain to           control behavior.  The communicative behavior to be studied, called             scent marking, was chosen as a model because one of the neurochemicals          (i.e. vasopressin) essential in the central nervous system control of           this behavior has been identified and appears to function within a              specific site of the brain (i.e. the medial preoptic-anterior                   hypothalamus).  After the effects of gonadal hormones on scent marking          behavior have been fully established, this project will investigate             whether gonadal hormones influence scent marking by acting on cells             which produce or respond to vasopressin within the medial                       preoptic-anterior hypothalamus.  These studies should provide new               information on how the nervous and endocrine systems interact to control        behavior.",
