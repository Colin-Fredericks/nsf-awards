The program has two                       aspects:  The Developmental Microchemical Facility, which is                    dedicated to the development of new techniques important to                     molecular biology, and the Applied Microchemical Facility, which                provides syntheses and sequence analyses for primarily Caltech                  researchers.  Plans for the Development Facility include:                       increasing sensitivity in protein sequencing to femtomole levels,               synthesis and folding of large polypeptide chains, new DNA                      synthesis methods, automation of Maxam.Gilbert sequencing, and                  improvement of the dedeoxy sequencer, new apparatus for                         separation of large DNA fragments, new methods for gene analysis,               and new computer methods (parallel processing) for sequence                     analysis and comparison.  The Applied facility, which until                     recently has been devoted primarily to synthesis of polypeptides                and polynucleotides, is being expanded to provide sequencing                    service as well, first with protein and later with DNA.  These                  funds will enable the Center to continue to be at the forefront                 of instrumentation and methodological development that is rapidly               exported to the biological community at large.",
