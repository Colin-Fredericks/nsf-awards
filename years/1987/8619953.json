 "awd_abstract_narration": "A planning activity will be initiated to determine the feasibility of           establishing a Process Modeling Center at MIT.  Its principal mission           will be to develop mathematical models describing materials processing          operations involving materials in the gaseous and molten state and              including phase transitions such as solidification and vapor deposition.        This work would have a close interface with solid state (i.e.,                  deformation processing) efforts but would not emphasize these aspects of        the materials processing field.  The principal industrial customers for         this work would include both the traditional commodity-type producers,          such as steel, aluminum, and copper; and new technologies, such as              ceramics composites and electronic materials.  As part of this planning,        co-ordination with Lehigh University (covering the areas of mathematical        modeling of shaping and deforming of solid materials) will be explored          to determine the possibility of establishing a joint center researching         mathematical modeling of materials during gaseous, liquid, and solid            phases.",
