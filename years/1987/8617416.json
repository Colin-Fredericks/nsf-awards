 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives and Relevance to Program Objectives:  This recommended award         would support a three-year cooperative research project between                 Professor Gregory R. Stewart, University of Florida, and Professor Frank        Steglich, Technische Hochschule, Darmstadt, Federal Republic of Germany.        They will try to characterize new heavy fermion systems and those that          are already known by using resistivity, magnetic susceptibility,                specific heat in fields to 25T, thermal expansion, and thermopower at           temperatures down to 0.050K.  This proposal deals with a topic of high          current interest in solid state physics, superconductivity in highly-           correlated-electron metals with an effective electron mass of                   200 me.  Professor Steglich has found that high-mass electrons (heavy           fermions) are the superconducting components of certain materials.  The         reason why some systems become superconducting below 1K, while others           become magnetic or do not order at all remains unexplained.  The                proposed cooperative research will address this issue, as well as other         questions concerning the cause of the heavy fermion ground state and            whether superconductivity will be observed in heavy fermion systems due         to standard superconductivity electron pairing.  The research will              benefit from the experience of the two researchers in working together          and from the equipment available in their two laboratories.  The project        thus contributes to an important objective of NSF's cooperative science         programs with Western Europe, which is to stimulate scientific progress         by bringing together scientists from the U.S. and Europe who have               similar research interests and who wish to engage in mutually beneficial        research cooperation.  Funds from this award would support necessary            transportation and partial subsistence expenses for the U.S. principal          investigator. Return visits by Professor Steglich are anticipated.                                                                                              Merit of Proposal:  The cooperating U.S. and foreign investigators are          respected for their previous research accomplishments, and there is a           very good prospect that this proposed research will lead to a                   significant contribution to scientific knowledge.  The proposed                 cooperation presents the U.S. investigator with the opportunity to work         with a leading foreign research group and to use highly specialized             facilities abroad that are complementary to his own.  The work plan is          sound and the budget is reasonable.  Research in this field is currently        being vigorously pursued in the U.S. and abroad.  The Deutsche                  Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) is providing German counterpart support for        the project and has approved the inclusion of this activity under the           Memorandum of Understanding between the NSF and the DFG.                                                                                                        Funding:  This award will not duplicate other funding.  The German              Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) will support the travel and one-month          of per diem for Professor Stewart during the first year of this award.",
