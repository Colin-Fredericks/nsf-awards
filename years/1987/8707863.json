 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of optical computing has seen a gradual evolution.                    Perhaps its most important applications thus far have been in                   evaluating various transformations or mappings from one set of                  numbers into another set which can ideally be related to the                    former with as much accuracy as desired.  Multiplying one set of                numbers by another set of numbers and adding the result is a                    simple example of such a transformation.                                                                                                                        Optics is advantageous because it can handle a large number of                  such calculations all in parallel.  The problem is that it                      involves the measurement of light intensity which cannot be done                with as much accuracy as one might wish.  This leads to the                     primary disadvantage of using optics.                                                                                                                           The present proposal deals with a means by which such optical                   calculations can be increased in accuracy.  The technique called                preconditioning would be important if it can be done generally.",
