 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the NSF's concern about low levels of science and        mathematics participation and achievement among minorities, the poor,           women, and students not college bound.  RAND will analyze data                  from the 1985 National Survey of Science and Mathematics Education a            survey previously supported by NSF at the Research Triangle Institute,          which covered a sample of 1200 elementary and secondary schools and 6000        mathematics and science teachers.  This present project will be designed        to improve understanding of: 1) how resources, teacher quality,                 curriculum, and instructional practices are distributed among various           student groups, and 2) whether this distribution may shape the                  opportunities to learn of groups that typically exhibit low                     participation and achievement levels.  Because distributional questions         will be addressed at both the school and classroom levels, the study            will provide clues as to whether learning opportunities of students in          various groups relate to: 1) the particular school a student happens to         attend; 2) how opportunities are provided to different students in the          same school; 3) combined school and classroom factors.  These analyses          will provide the first detailed national picture of the conditions under        which patterns of unequal outcomes have occurred and point to specific          targets for policies and programs addressed at remedying participation          and achievement discrepancies.",
