 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a comprehensive program for preparing middle          school mathematics teachers in an urban setting.  Instructional                 materials for nine courses (8 content and 1 method) specifically                designed for a middle school mathematics program will be developed.             These will be presented in an instructional mode that stresses active           exploration, concept development, visual reasoning, and the integrated          use of calculators and computers as the dominant computational tools.           The materials to be developed for each course include a Course Guide            with topical commentary, student assignments, reading lists, and a              bibliography and Class Activities.  The activities will be used in field        experiences and in student teaching.  The materials will be produced            with the desktop publishing facilities of Portland State's Math Learning        Center and will be suitable for widespread distribution or commercial           publication.  The materials will be evaluated carefully during                  development and implementation.                                                                                                                                 The project staff includes mathematics educators, research                      mathematicians, and classroom teachers.",
