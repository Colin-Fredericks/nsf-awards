 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an equipment grant under the activity Grants            For Scientific Computing Research Equipment For The Mathematical                Sciences program.  The project involves the purchase of special                 purpose equipment dedicated to the support of research in the                   mathematical sciences.  In general, this equipment is required                  jointly by several research projects and would be difficult to                  justify on one project alone.                                                           This research equipment support from the National Science               Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions of                       equipment from manufacturers and significant cost-sharing from                  the submitting institution.  This project provides a good example               of university, industrial, and government cooperation in the                    support of basic research in the mathematical sciences.                                 This equipment will be utilized to support the following                research: (1) MACSYMA, MACAULY, BMDP, and SPSSx will be used to                 study the relationship between numerical invariants of rational                 plane curves, (2) parameter spaces of complex dimensional                       families of invariant quadratic differentials will be examined                  graphically, (3) Julia sets of entire and meromorphic functions                 and stable sets of Kleinian groups will be examined, and (4) the                connection between measures and recurrence coefficients involving               orthogonal polynomials will be studied.                                                 The projects involve high speed multiple precision                      arithmetic, large memory requirements, and artificial                           intelligence.",
