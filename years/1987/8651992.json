 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use the new California Framework for Mathematics as a         model to merge the content and methodology needs into an inservice              package for 66 elementary teachers in the Santa Ann Unified School              District and the Diocese of Orange.                                                                                                                             The project has two goals: (1) Indentify and support ethnic minority            school children who have mathematics potential, (2) help teachers of K-6        improve their skills in mathematics content and mathematics teaching.           The project represents a university's partnership with a school district        and parochial diocese that have school populations that are over 75%            Hispanic, an ethnic group that is underrepresented in professions               requiring mathematics and scientific preparation.  There is evidence            that at the elementary school level, Latino children show promise of            success in these areas, but this is not fulfilled at the high school or         college level.  The project seeks to improve this discrepancy by                identifying children who show mathematical promise, involving parents           through a home-school linkage and training teachers to develop                  childrens' mathematical potential.                                                                                                                              This project addresses a major priority of the Division of Teacher              Preparation and Enhancement to extend opportunities in mathematics to           all students.  The instructional team of four have expertise in content         and experiences in teaching and bilingual-bicultural education to meet          these needs.",
