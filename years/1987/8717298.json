 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to establish a conduit which can               translate and consolidate research results into a usable design tool for        implementing the latest aseismic design methodologies for bridges into          practice.                                                                                                                                                       For bridge structures located in seismic-prone areas, modern ductility          or capacity design procedures require ultimate limit states under               earthquake loading be identified and properly considered.  To evaluate          the earthquake ductility demand, effect of nonlinear foundation                 response, and other nonlinear effects in the bridge superstructure              discontinuities, nonlinear transient analysis procedure are developed.          The post-elastic interaction of axial force and biaxial bending of              substructure columns are represented by a proper yield surface, e.g.            Bresler's interaction criteria.  Attention is also directed to recently         developed energy absorbing devices so that their performance can be             evaluated analytically to assist engineers in their decisions on new            designs or retrofitting strategies.                                                                                                                             This research fills a gap between the advancement in Earthquake                 Engineering and Computational Structural Dynamics and the practical             needs of bridge engineers and designers.  This is the second and final          phase of a continuing project.",
