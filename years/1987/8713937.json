 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this workshop on the foundations of                      Artificial Intelligence is to systematically explore the scope                  and limits of fundamental approaches to artificial intelligence.                In contrast to previous efforts, this workshop is structured to                 generate genuine discussion and interaction between paradigms.                  The workshop will have eight sessions in which a careful                        exposition of each approach will be presented by a founder of                   that approach, and will then be critiqued by a respected and                    influential commentator.  Each position paper contains two parts.               In the first part, the founder states what the basic thesis is,                 identifies the principles underpinning the method or approach and               describes the natural type of problems and tasks in which this                  approach succeeds.  In the second part, the speaker discusses the               scope and limits of the approach, identifying particular                        difficulties and providing a concrete problem that illustrates                  each.  The commentator then critiques the scope and limits of the               approach, where it succeeds and why, and where it fails and why.                        The NSF funds will be used to provide support for conducting            the workshop as well as widely disseminating the written                        materials presented at the workshop and videotapes of the                       presentation and ensuing discussions.",
