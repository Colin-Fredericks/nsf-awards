 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action provides continuing support for the U.S. Committee on               Tunneling Technology.  The major activities of this committee are               related to the technical issues involving the stability of subsurface           openings.  Previous activities of the committee have contributed to a           national focus on  geotechnical engineering research in the area of             earthquake lifeline engineering.                                                                                                                                During the next year the Committee will address several key issues in           subsurface tunneling, namely the hazards associated with surface                openings, and the effect of tunnels and underground openings on the             earthquake response of nearby building foundations.                                                                                                             The Committee's activities and reports will provide valuable guidance to        geotechnical engineering researchers and especially to researchers              involved in earthquake hazard mitigation in the area of siting and              geotechnical systems.",
