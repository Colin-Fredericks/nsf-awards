 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seventy two teachers, K-12, will participate in a workshop for ten days         during the 88 academic year reviewing scientific principles and                 participating in hands-on science activites using toys.  The teachers           will be divided in to into four groups for instructional purposes: K-3,         4-6, 7-9, and 10-12.  Each teacher will present workshops to other              teachers in their school district on teaching science through the use of        toys. These workshops will be presented on Fridays and Saturdays between        September l987 and April l988.  Teachers will be chosen from several            school districts in Southern Ohio.  They will design strategies to              incorporate these activites into their curriculum and increase the              participation of girls in science. The university staff and school              personnel will evaluate the effectiveness of this program in the class          rooms in l988.                                                                                                                                                  The participants will be provided with materials to use in their                classrooms and to conduct inservice activites.  School districts will           make commitments to continue this program for at least three years after        this program is completed and to provide the support for the local              inservice workshops.                                                                                                                                            The PI and staff are eminently qualified to carry out this program.             They engaged in a tremendous amout of pre-planning for this project.            The university's commitments to this program are unusally strong.",
