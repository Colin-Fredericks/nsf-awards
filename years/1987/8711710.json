 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective is to create a computer model of the electrical                   activity, both nervous control and neuromusculor interactions, of               the lower urinary tract, especially the bladder and the urethra.                The research begins by obtaining or building a physical model of                the bladder, urethra, and their neural innervations, perhaps two:               male and female.  The model is to have the ability to reproduce                 some electrical activity of the system, the neuromuscular                       interactions and the physical muscular activity.  It is planned                 to develop the model for a popular personal computer.  The model                is to be able to simulate the detrusor muscle's response to                     stimulation through a graphical depiction of it.  The program                   plans to take into account pharmacological considerations.  It is               also to be gender-specific.                                                                                                                                     This project is one supported under the Creativity Awards for                   Undergraduate Engineering Students.",
