 "awd_abstract_narration": "The tectonic evolution of orogenic systems developing at convergent             margins involves steady state and episodic processes.  Steady state             processes, such as subduction or arc magmatism have received                    considerable study, however it is becoming apparent that many orogenic          belts have a history involving relatively short, discrete periods of            deformation superimposed on the steady state processes.  This project           examines the effect of a collision of an active spreading center with a         convergent margin.  The Chile margin triple junction in southern Chile          is the best modern example available for study because of its relatively        well known, simple kinematic evolution.  The work involves study of a           3-4 Ma ophiolite exposed on land 15 km from the trench, silicic plutons         near the ophiolite and associated hot springs, and faults and uplifted          recent deposits. Results are expected to document a variety of features         related to the subduction of an active ridge that may be used in the            interpretation of ancient systems.",
