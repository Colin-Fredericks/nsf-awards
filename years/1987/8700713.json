 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will allow Dr. John P. O'Connell, University of Florida, and         one of his graduate students to collaborate with Drs. Rafiqul Gani and          Aage Fredenslund, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark.             They will use computer-aided design methods to develop and test models          of physical properties of chemical compounds.  Traditional methods have         used specific models dealing with specific chemicals and properties.            These methods are difficult and costly to use, and the models are not           easily generalizable.                                                                                                                                           The proposed research will try to alleviate some of the problems with           past research by developing techniques and program structures which             allow the use of specific models within the framework of generalized            design programs.  Dr. O'Connell has developed specific models for               properties in specific situations, and he is an expert on theories of           modern models.  The Danish group is well-known for its work on more             general design structures and for its large data bank of phase                  equilibria in vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid systems.  The U.S. and             Danish researchers have productively worked together and they have              exchanged a number of visits.  They will do much of the proposed work           by telephone, but occasional visits to each others' laboratories will           be necessary.",
