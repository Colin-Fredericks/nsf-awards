 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed experimentation will isolate and                              characterize the arabidopsis gene encoding NADPH-                               protochlorophyllide oxioreductase (PCR).  This appears to be                    a nuclear gene whose product is found in immature chloroplasts                  (etioplasts).  The level of gene product in the cell is                         light-regulated, as is that of a number of other gene                           products found in the chloroplast.  A novel feature of this                     gene is that the amount of product is decreased by exposure                     to light, whereas expression of most other light-regulated                      genes so far studied is augmented by light.  Timko will                         isolate the structural gene for PCR, then determine its                         sequence and the start sites for its transcription.  He will                    use plant DNA transformation techniques to define the                           regulatory elements of the gene, including the                                  photoresponsive element.  The element will be used to isolate                   and characterize the cellular factor(s) to which it responds.                        The regulation of plant gene expression by light has                       been a central problem in plant molecular biology.  The                         proposed work will examine the structure and regulation of a                    novel photoregulated gene; one whose expression appears to be                   inhibited by light.  The gene's product acts at an important                    step in the light-induced maturation of the chloroplast.                        Thus, the proposed work should lead to a valuable increase in                   our  understanding of the regulation of plant gene expression                   and of the morphogenesis of the chloroplast.",
