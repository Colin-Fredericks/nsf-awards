 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this work is to estimate the risk of                           transporting hazardous materials and to develop a comprehensive                 method by which to evaluate risks in routing this type of cargo.                The work will address some of the deficiencies encountered in                   previous attempts where estimation procedures were poorly                       defined, biases intrinsic to individual approaches were not                     considered, the problem of aggregating risk estimates from                      alternative procedures were given little attention, and the                     impacts of these inadequacies on optimal route assignment were                  not examined.  These concerns will be examined by using                         statistical inference, analytical models, Bayesian analysis,                    fault and event trees, extreme value theory, network                            optimization, and information theoretic models.                                                                                                                 Results from this research will contribute to design, plan,                     implement and operate an inter- and intra-state transportation                  system able to transport safely shipments of hazardous materials.",
