 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research project is to identify and                  isolate molecules that serve as blue-light photoreceptors in the                fungus Phycomyces.  Special attention will be given to                          phototropism mutants (genes madA to madH) including those (madB                 and madC) with defective photorecptor(s).  Recent                               spectrophotometric and biochemical analyses have revealed                       modifications in the photorecptor mutants, notably light-induced                absorbance changes (LIAC) with specific alterations in madC                     mutants.  LIAC will be measured in vivo and in vitro and will                   serve as a spectroscopic assay for the photoreceptor(s).                        Biochemical characterization and purification of the                            photoreceptor(s) will employ two-dimensionl gel electrophoresis                 and fast protein liquid chromatorgraphy (FPLC) in conjunction                   with spectroscopic and genetic assays.  Flavoproteins will                      receive special consideration as probable candidates for blue                   light photoreceptors.  Electrophoresis and chromatography will                  also be applied to proteins found to be altered in other                        behavioral mutants (madA, madB, and madE).  Additional mutants                  will be sought and incorporated in the project.                                                                                                                      Although blue-light responses are widespread among plants,                 funji, and other organisms, the photoreceptor molecules remain to               be identified.  Phycomyces offers special advantages, in view of                its unmatched sensitivity and the availability of behavioral                    mutants.  Identification of photoreceptors in Phycomyces will                   greatly promote the understanding of photosensory transduction in               connection with its various light responses (phototropism, light-               growth response, photocarotenogenesis, and photodifferentiation).               The results on Phycomyces should lead the way to identification                 of blue light photoreceptors in other organisms.",
