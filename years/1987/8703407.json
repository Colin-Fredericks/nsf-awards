 "awd_abstract_narration": "Palais will continue his work on differentiable                            transformation groups. The main focus of this work is to find                   interrelationships between these groups and other geometric                     concepts. In particular the concept of isoparametric submanifold                will be studied. These are submanifolds of Euclidean space with                 simple local invariants. Although the finite dimensional case has               been extensively worked on there is still much to do in the                     infinite dimensional setting of a Hilbert manifold.                                  Adler and van Moerbeke will work on algebraically completely               integrable systems. This work involves very difficult questions                 which are now seen to have close connections with problems in                   algebraic geometry. Shiota, an algebraic geometer, will also work               on strengthening and clarifying these connections. The topics                   under investigation will include linearizing completely                         integrable systems on complex algebraic tori, expressing                        solutions in terms of hyperelliptic integrals, the geometry of                  quadrics and quartics. Following his proof of the Novikov                       conjecture, Shiota obtained an analogous characterization theorem               for a certain class of Prym varieties. His current project is to                further develop these techniques to characterize appropriate                    classes of principally polarized Abelian varieties.",
