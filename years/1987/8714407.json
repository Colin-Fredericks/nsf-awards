 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is for experiments and analysis of fluidized beds.                 The topics to be studied are wakes and turning couples as                       fundamental mechanisms of fluidization; determination of the most               probable arrangements of fluidized particles in a bed;                          experimental and numerical studies of stable cross-stream arrays                of spheres confined to move in two dimensions; development of an                empirically based theory of the effective density of a fluidized                suspension and the decompositions of the force on a particle into               buoyancy plus drag; experimental verification of the nonlinear                  theory of kinematic waves with particular attention to smoothing                and shocking of rarefaction and compression waves as a function                 of the Richardson and Zaki exponent; and the analysis of                        transitions to aggregative fluidization (formation of bubbles)                  based on generalizations of recent work of Foscolo and Gibilaro,                together with experimental tests.  The experiments are to be                    based on the construction and instrumentation of several return                 flow fluidization columns.  The columns shall be constructed so                 that the gap size can be changed.  The smallest gap will confine                the motion of particles to two dimensions.  The instrumentation                 is to be based on the Kodak Spin Physics high speed video and                   motion analysis system.  This video is different than others in                 that it is based on digital imaging and there is a provision for                interfacing with a computer.  Hence, the data one might want for                the interpretation of images is actually available in a digitized               form suitiable for direct statistical analysis.",
