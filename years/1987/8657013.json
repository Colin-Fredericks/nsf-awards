Dr. Kelvin Droegemeier                   has been selected as one of the recipients of this award. Dr.                   Droegemeier is fast becoming one of the atmospheric sciences'                   leading experts using supercomputers in the solution of                         meteorological problems. Under this award he will utilize                       supercomputers in attacking a variety of meteorological                         problems including the development of a highly detailed                         storm-scale numerical model. He also will pursue innovative                     methods of using local work stations to interactively analyze                   the overwhelming amount of data that is produced by numerical                   meteorological models. Additionally, Dr. Droegemeier will use                   purchased hardware and software developed under this award in a                 unique class which is focussed on applying numerical methods to                 solve problems in fluid dynamics. Dr. Droegemeier's credentials                 and wealth of good ideas has helped him in obtaining over                       $90,000 in matching funds from private industry in support of                   this effort.",
