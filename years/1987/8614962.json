 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed research is to define the dynamic loads             generated by in-situ occupant movements.  The work will focus on the            coherence of motion (i.e., the group effect) associated with public             assembly occupancies.  The investigation will be conducted through three        goal-oriented tasks devoted to:  a) analytically modeling the group             effect by spatially and temporally extrapolating loads produced by              individuals; b) experimentally measuring the group effect on a                  prototypical floor system; and c) using the analytical models developed         to produce structural load criteria.  The work begun under a former             grant wherein periodic, transient, and random dynamic loads produced by         individuals were studied will be extended.  Data from an existing force         platform will be utilized for a limited population to mathematically            model group loads in both the time and frequency domains.  Approximate          design envelopes for both load amplitude and frequency will be produced         and test sample sizes will be determined for the third task.  The group         load models will be verified with a full-scale floor system constructed         from lightweight components.  Design guidelines will be formulated using        an improved road-measuring platform.  Anticipated results and suggested         design models will entail load-versus-frequency spectra for either              static or dynamic analyses of structures.  Because of the nature of the         problem, special attention will be given to developing channels of              communication for the continual exchange of information and ideas with          researchers, as well as those directly involved in design practice.             Special attention will also be given to the widest possible                     dissemination of the end results of the program on the local, national          and international levels.",
