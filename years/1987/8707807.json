 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tubular steel frames, which are extensively used in offshore                    applications, are usually analyzed by ignoring the flexibility of               joints.  Nevertheless, the flexibility of chord walls at brace                  connections may have profound effects on the behavior of tubular                structures; it influences displacements of the frame, distributions             of stresses, fatigue lives of joints, buckling capacities of                    compression members, and the dynamic response of the structure.  The            flexibility of joints must be considered in  the analysis.                                                                                                      This research will develop two analytical models.  One will be                  suitable for the global frame analysis, and the other, a local                  analysis.  The former will provide an efficient tool to compute                 nominal member forces and moments, similar to the conventional rigid            frame model, except that the new model will account for joint                   flexibilities.  The latter will consider a partial frame to                     facilitate a more detailed analysis; in addition to reflecting the              flexibility of a joint and the frame actions of the adjoining                   members, this model will enable the detailed description of the joint           geometry, including weld profiles, to predict the distribution of               stresses in tube walls.  These two models, when developed, will                 facilitate highly accurate analyses of tubular frames.                                                                                                          The two models will be utilized to investigate the influence of                 joint flexibilities in various tubular structures.  For this                    purpose, three types of jacket frames will be considered, and                   each frame will be analyzed for two different heights, 400 and                  800 feet high.  This study will provide insights and useful                     guidance to design engineers regarding the effects of joint                     flexibility for tubular frames frequently encountered in                        practice.",
