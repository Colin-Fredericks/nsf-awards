 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past few years, much has been learned about how small                    molecules like neuropeptides exert influence on the body and                    brain.  The objectives of this conference are to provide an in-                 depth review of the various aspects of bombesin-like peptide                    research and applications of such findings.                                                                                                                     Progress in the bombesin field has been accelerated by three                    decent developments.  First, was the demonstration of the potent                biological activity of bombesin to influence gut function and the               central regulation of homeostasis.  Secondly, the                               characterization of mammalian bombesin-like peptides, called                    gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) and the subsequent cloning of the               human GRP gene.  Thirdly, was the discovery that bombesin and                   mammalian related peptides acts as an important autocrine type                  growth factor in human small cell lung cancer.  These findings                  have lead to a proliferation of interest and multidisciplinary                  studies.                                                                                                                                                        Invited speakers will address issues related to the following                   topics:                                                                                                                                                         1)      Chemistry and molecular biology of bombesin-like peptides               including cloning and characterization of bombesin cDNA and the                 translational products of bombesin genes,                                                                                                                       2)      Tissue distribution and content of bombesin-like peptides,                                                                                              3)      Bombesin receptors, localization, characterization and                  progress in the development of competitive anatagonists,                                                                                                        4)      Cellular, peripheral and central nervous system actions of              the peptide.                                                                                                                                                    The meeting will provide for the first time a forum for                         neuroscientists, anatomists, pharacologists, gastroenterologists,               molecular biologists and oncologists to update current research                 activities on bombesin-like peptides and also to delineate the                  areas for further development and set up directions for coming                  years particularly the role of these peptides in normal and                     malignant tissue growth and regulation of gut function.  The book               to be published by the New York Academy of Sciences as a result                 of the meeting will be the first comprehensive monograph on the                 subject.",
