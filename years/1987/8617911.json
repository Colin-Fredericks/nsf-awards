 "awd_abstract_narration": "As lightwave technology further develops it is anticipated that                 microscopic phenomena will become more important in the                         development of new optical devices.  The inherent capacity for                  reducing the size of optical devices is considerable and this is                one area in which the potential has not yet begun to be realized,               although some initial effort is evident.                                                                                                                        As dimensions shrink the ability to design and manipulate                       relevant physical phenomena will become increasingly important.                 The tools by which this will be done will probably involve                      electron microscopes as well as x-rays, sychrotron radiation, and               other potential sources.  Tunneling microscopy appears to be one                important aspect of such a thrust.  Its ability to portray                      microscopic behavior particularly of surfaces, to portray                       electronic behavior, and to generally monitor crystalline                       structure offers one possibility.                                                                                                                               The combination of lightwave technology with the field of                       scanning electron microscopy in a study of nonlinear optical                    materials and in particular the small dimensional structures                    discussed in the proposal, are timely and can be expected to lead               to fruitful investigations and the development of techniques of                 future importance to future applications of optics.                                                                                                             A 3-year continuing award is recommended for the amounts shown:                                                                         1987 - $90,000                                                          1988 - $90,000                                                                  1989 - $90,000",
