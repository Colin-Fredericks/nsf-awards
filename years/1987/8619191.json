 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ocean sciences instrumentation development project will               be undertaken by Dr. Vernon Asper, a post-doctoral assistant                    professor at the Center for Marine Science at the University of                 Southern Mississippi.  The project's goal is to develop an                      integrated camera system to assess the flux, abundance, and                     sinking speed of marine snow aggregates in the open ocean.  The                 system will include dual cameras, customized electronics, CTD, a                transmissometer, and a specially designed settling chamber.  The                system is designed to improve upon an earlier prototype system.                 It will provide scientific information that cannot readily be                   obtained by existing methods.                                                        The project is in response to a long-term requirement of                   marine chemists and biological oceanographers to measure the                    abundance, distribution, and settling rates of microscopic                      particles in the ocean.  The information is needed to better                    understand their role in the marine ecosystem and in sedimentation              processes.  The extremely frail nature of these ubiquitous                      particles makes these measurements very difficult to obtain, and                an in-situ camera system is the most reliable way to obtain high                quality data.  The proposal includes plans to test and use the                  proposed instrumentation on funded research projects and to make                it available to other scientists.",
