 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fishes appear well oriented in their movements in the oceanic                   environment, but the mechanisms they use for orientation or navigation          are very poorly understood.  Dr. Klimley is investigating these                 mechanisms with the scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini).  Using         ultrasonic telemetry, he has identified two oriented behavioral                 responses, straight-line swimming and homing (i.e., repeated movements          away from and back to residence), at seamount El Bajo Espiritu Santo in         the Gulf of California.  He now is seeking to determine what                    environmental cues sharks use to carry out these behaviors by                   correlating an increase in the directionality of their swimming                 movements with the presence or absence (or strong gradient) of an               environmental feature.                                                                                                                                          Instantaneous swimming directions, depths, surrounding water                    temperatures, and light levels will be recorded continuously by a               computerized data-logging system.  Dr. Klimley will obtain the following        environmental measurements:  (1) vertical profiles of current directions        and speeds, water temperatures, and light levels periodically along the         shark's swimming path, (2) sea-surface temperatures from satellite              images, and (3) a flower-petal-shaped survey pattern of bottom                  topography, total magnetic fields, and local field differences from the         earth's average field.  He will determine whether or not the                    straightness or directionality of shark tracks or instantaneous swimming        movements are correlated with any of the above features.  The research          will focus, in particular, on magnetic-field features because                   preliminary results indicate possible utilization by hammerhead sharks.                                                                                         An important outcome of identifying those environmental features to             which fish orient is that mapping of the environment would then enable          prediction of those locations where fish densities are highest.  Such a         capability would increase the capture success of fisheries.",
