 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research literature contains few documented reports on the                  strategies and tactics used by teachers in one-to-one tutoring                  situations and the learning effects related to same.  This paucity of           information exist even as vast amounts of educational research is being         focused on effective classroom teaching.                                                                                                                        The goal of the research proposed here is to develop a cognitive skills-        model of one-to-one tutoring in algebra.  The Model will explicate              specific tutoring strategies and tactics at a more precise level of             detail than is currently available.  This problem will be approached            from an \"expert systems\" point of view where the target expert is a             master high school algebra tutor.  This teacher will be videotaped and          the tapes analyzed to determine the cognitive skills involved in the            teacher-student interaction.  The cognitive skills discovered will be           represented as formal knowledge structures, and then, as far as                 possible, implemented in the pedagogical module of an intelligent tutor         for algebra.                                                                                                                                                    The development plan involves the initial observation of the expert             teacher, viewing of the videotapes and both debriefing and followup             interviews with the expert teacher, model validation by both the expert         tutoring system with students in school settings.  Input from                   mathematicians, mathematics educators, and teacher educators will help          guide the development of the expert tutoring system.                                                                                                            The proposed research is challenging and has the potential of expanding         the frontiers of mathematics education.  It has been carefully designed         to move beyond routine \"symbol manipulation\" tutors.  The Principal             Investigator is highly respected and the list of associated staff and           consultants are the top scholars in their respective academic fields.           The reviewers were enthusiastic about the project and recommended               funding.  The project is planned for a period of twenty-four (24)               months.",
