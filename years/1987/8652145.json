 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past twenty years, the twenty-seven CHEM study films have            become classics among the chemistry films of the world.  They were              produced as an integral part of the Chemical Education Material Study           and continue to be widely used.  This is evidenced by the sale of more          than 27,000 prints and more than 82,000 rentals since they were released        in the early sixties.  They maintain scientific integrity and are               correlated to the texts currently in use.  No other series of chemistry         films has its subject matter authenticated by such outstanding chemists         as Glenn T. Seaborg:  Linus Pauling, Henry Eyring, Bryce Crawford,              George Pimentel and J. Arthur Campbell.                                                                                                                         The films were produced for the high school level.  The basics of               chemistry, since they were produced, are still valid.  They bring to the        classroom demonstrations and abstract concepts in animated pictorial            form which would be difficult for the teacher to present in any other           way.                                                                                                                                                            Unfortunately, teachers look at copyright dates and observe anachronisms        of instrumentation, hairstyling and method of presentation and are              deterred from using the films.                                                                                                                                  Relatively minor revisions can bring them up-to-date at a modest cost           compared with making new films.  Revisions will include the use of              modern instrumentation, discussions of current industrial uses for the          concept, and the employment of underrepresented groups in film                  presentations.  The useful life of these films can be significantly             extended for some time.  Since they can now be made available in low            cost video cassettes, teachers will be able to have CHEM Study video            materials available in every school.  Without revision, these valuable          teaching aids will be lost.  Funding is provided for making these               revisions.                                                                                                                                                      This project address the goal of the Instructional Materials Program to         support the development of improved instructional materials for our             precollege classrooms.                                                                                                                                          Both training and track record make the Project Director eminently              qualified to conduct the activities.",
