 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed experimentation addresses the structure and                   function of the synaptonemal complexes that form during meiosis                 in yeast.  The proteins present in the complex will be isolated                 and characterized.  Antibody directed against the proteins will                 be raised and then used to investigate the structure of the                     complexes using standard immunocytological techniques.  The genes               encoding the proteins will also be isolated.  In related                        experiments, Dr. Kleckner will isolate and characterize both the                rad50 gene and its product, and then determine the intracellular                location of the product.  Regulation of the rad50 gene,                         especially during meiosis will also be examined.                                     Meiotic cell division, or meiosis, is an event common to the               life cycles of virtually all eukaryotic organisms.  During                      meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair and recombine, then                        segregate to the daughter nuclei.  As yet, remarkably little is                 understood about the biochemical mechanism of eukaryotic                        recombination or its regulation.  Paired chromosomes with sites                 of contact, or synapses have been observed in the microscope.                   The occurrence of such synaptonemal complexes appears to                        correlate with recombination.  Some yeast mutants, in particular                those affected in the rad50 gene, display lowered frequencies of                recombination.  The proposed isolation and characterization of                  the rad50 gene, its product and the protein components of the                   synaptonemal complex will lay a solid foundation for                            understanding the molecular events of eukaryotic  recombination.",
