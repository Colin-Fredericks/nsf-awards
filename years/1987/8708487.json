 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to estimate the value of                         agricultural land in the Soviet Union and to integrate this price               information into the analysis of Soviet agricultural                            productivity.  While collectivization of agriculture has been                   widely studied, much less attention has been focused on the                     impact of national land-ownership on economic efficiency in the                 agricultural sector.  The Soviet Union, with widely different                   agricultural regions, has moved cautiously in recent years to                   re-establish, not private land ownership, but market-like prices                for land to rationalize land-use planning and, thereby, improve                 agricultural efficiency.                                                                                                                                        This project involves analyzing the new land-pricing schemes,                   incorporating them into regional cost and production functions,                 and using them to simulate an optimal cropping pattern.  This                   project has an immediate significance for U.S. agriculture.  In                 order to satisfy consumer demands, the Soviets have turned away                 from attempts at self sufficiency and have become dependent on                  the international agricultural market to meet their domestic                    needs.  The consequences for the U.S. grain market is just one                  example of how Soviet agricultural performance can have a major                 impact.  A better understanding of the Soviet potential for                     increased agricultural output because of a more efficient                       allocation of land and other inputs will improve our own long                   term agricultural forecasts and policies.",
