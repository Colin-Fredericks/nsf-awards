This will be accomplished               in the following stages by a task force of Forum members                        who represent the nation's major academic and corporate chief                   executives:                                                                                                                                                          1)   developing a consensus among leaders of business and                            higher education regarding educating and retooling the                          American work force which will be the framework for a                           major Forum report to be released on Labor Day 1988.                                                                                                       2)   developing recommendations in early 1989 for Federal,                           state and local leaders.                                                                                                                              This project will provide valuable information on not only                      elementary, secondary, and undergraduate education, but also on                 the training and retraining of the workforce--topics of grave                   concern to an increasingly technological society.  The cochairmen               of this project are extremely able and can solicit cooperation                  from government, industry, and academia.  The Forum has a track                 record of valuable contributions in related areas.",
