 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the proposal is to develop nondamaging automated                 techniques for transfer of tissue aliquots in the regeneration of               transplantable plants from callus cultures in liquid culture on the basis       of the state of differentiation, viability, endogenous vigor and genetic        stability.  He would test laboratory prototypes for efficacy in                 nondestructive separation of tissues on the basis of differences in the         properties of differentiated and nondifferentiated tissues and assess the       reliability of the systems thus derived.  He would also determine the           optical properties of the tissues to be transferred while suspended in a        transparent medium and devise optical or other systems capable of               reliably assessing tissue separation.                                               This proposal addresses an important constraint upon clonal plant           propagation.  It proposes methods which, if successful, would eliminate         the labor intensive stages in handling of plant tissue cultures for large       scale propagation.",
