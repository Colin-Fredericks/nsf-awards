 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns three areas of research that deal with                    particular kinds of rule based systems: (1) logic programming,                  (2) stratification and knowledge base management, and (3)                       Petri nets and vector addition systems.  In area (1) several                    problems are being investigated that deal with the analysis                     of fundamental algorithms of unification & generalization                       and semantic & recursion theoretic issues for Prolog and                        extensions such as Constraint Logic Programming.  In area                       (2), the PI is seeking applications of the notion of                            stratification to rule based systems whose semantics are                        those of propositional logic.  Intended Model Semantics,                        querying and related issues are also under study.  In area                      (3), the PI is making proof-theoretic analyses of algorithms                    for Petri nets and possible extensions.                                                                                                                         The problems proposed are important ones for which solutions                    are needed to make logic programming sound and more generally                   applicable.  Results that will have practical impact are                        anticipated.",
