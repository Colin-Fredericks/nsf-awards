 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal and its companion from the Carnegie Institution of                Washington represent a single, collaborative ocean sciences                     instrumentation development project to test and evaluate the                    usefulness of newly available instrumentation to studying the                   adaptive schooling behavior of individuals within schools or                    groups of pelagic organisms.  Original and rigorous mathematical                analysis of schooling behavior will be tested by using digital                  data output from modern 3-dimensional video-graphic systems and                 applying this data to 3-D mathematical models developed for x-ray               crystallographic studies.                                                                                                                                       Hamner, who is an accomplished behavioral biologist, and his                    associates at UCLA will purchase a 3-D videographic system with an              integrated data analysis and display capability.  The system's                  specialized cameras will be modified for underwater use.  Initial               video work will be done in a large aquarium but eventual use with               schooling organisms in the open ocean is planned.  Pruitt, who is               an skilled crystallographer at Carnegie will acquire a compatible               computer graphic workstation and modify existing software for 3-D               videography and automated image motion analysis for use with                    Hamner's data.  They will collaborate to develop mathematical                   models and computational protocols to analyze and study schooling               and behavioral patterns.                                                                                                                                        X-ray crystallography is the discipline that studies the                        geometrical relationships of atoms, ions, or molecules within                   crystals.  Their geometry may be static or dynamic, random or                   structured.  Statistical analyses have been developed to describe               these relationships.  Animals also congregate in non-random,                    dynamic structures such as fish schools.  X-ray crystallographic                technology and statistical analysis methods may be transferable to              biological sciences to better understand the dynamics and adaptive              strategies of schooling behavior in fish and other organisms.                   Should the transfer of technologies between these different fields              be successful, not only will there be a positive impact on                      ecological and behavioral studies, but other areas of ocean                     sciences that analyze distances in three-dimensional space.",
