 "awd_abstract_narration": "Invasion of host plants by the bean rust fungus, \u001a\u001a\u001aUromyces\u001a              \u001aappendiculatus\u001a, occurs through stomata and requires the                       development of infection structures, e.g. appressoria.                          Appressorium formation is a cell differentiation event that                     occurs in response to contact (thigmotropic) stimuli.  Cell                     differentiation begins with the onset of nuclear division.                      Evidence that at least fifteen species of protein are synthesized               when germlings are induced to differentiate, has led to the study               of the nature of the genes which are activated and the nature and               role of the proteins.  During the previous granting period four                 genes have been isolated that are specifically expressed by the                 time differentiation is complete.  Dr. Staples will now analyze                 the dr.genes in terms of detailed structures, the time in the                   differentiation process when they are first expressed, their                    homology with DNA from other fungi, and an identification of                    their gene products.  He will prepare antibodies specific for                   these protein gene products and use them to determine the                       location in the germling of the dr.proteins.  In addition                       attempts will be made to isolate differentiation related genes                  that are expressed earlier than 6 h in the differentiation                      process, i.e. before differentiation is complete.                                    The studies will significantly advance our knowledge of the                mechanisms involved in the fungal sensing responses that result                 in the accurate placement of the appressorium over the stomate                  during host colonization.",
