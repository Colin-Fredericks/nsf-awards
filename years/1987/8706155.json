 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to continue research in the tropics by one of                the, if not the world's, premier tropical ecologists, Professor                 Daniel Janzen.                                                                                                                                                  This is an expanding basic research program on animal-plant                     interactions in the tropical, dry forests of Santa Rosa National                Park in northwestern Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica, with the                  results being applied directly to the problem of dry forest                     ecological and biocultural restoration (as well as being                        published and popularized in traditional ways).  Observations and               field experiments will be conducted on:                                                                                                                         1.   Demography and seed predator specificity of Liomys salvini                         (spiny pocket mice).                                                    2.   Host-specificity (in the wild) of the 3100-plus species of                         caterpillers.                                                           3.      Host-specificity of the parasitoid wasps and flies supported                    by the wild Lepidoptera fauna.                                          4.      Species composition of the caterpillars brought to the                          nestlings of medium-sized birds.                                        5.      Differential food processing by caterpillars feeding on                         potentially toxic plants versus those feeding on plants rich                    in potential inhibitors.                                                6.      Seed production biology of the trees Hymenoea courbaril,                        cyclocarpum, Dioclea megacarpa and Ateleia herbert-smithii.             7.      Invasion of pastures, old fields, tree falls and landslides                     by dry forest trees.                                                    8.      Brief studies: wood increment rates and aging (by growth                        rings) of the tree H. courbaril and E. cyclorcarpum,                            migration of fruit- and flower-visiting moths in and out of                     Santa Rosa, dormancy of moth pupae and large tree seeds,                        detailed phenology of fruit drop by trees with seeds                            dispersed by ground-based large herbivores, use of seasonal                     changes as cues by insects, escape behavior of large                            caterpillars, impact of defoliation on fruit crop                               production, termination of caterpillar outbreaks, and                           caterpillar survivorship in the wild.                                                                                                                   At a time when tropical areas are being brutally deforested, this               research is of paramount importance.  It stimulated and continues               to stimulate generations of tropical ecologists and is of                       scientific and practical value in and of itself.  The Ecology                   Program of the NSF is pleased to support the research.",
