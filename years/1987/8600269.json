 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering scientists have long been interested in calculating the             dynamic loads acting in a solid of finite or infinite extent, with              heterogeneous properties.  This research program is a continuation of           this effort with specific application to the National Earthquake Hazard         Reduction Program.                                                                                                                                              In considering the propagation of seismic waves through the earth's             crust, and of the resultant ground shaking at a particular constructed          facility such as a dam or nuclear power plant, an attempt is made to            take account of the earth's inhomogeneity; this however usually leads to        severe analytical or computational difficulties.  This research program         will capitalize on a significant advance that the principal investigator        has made in this regard, and will extend it to account for the                  layered stratification of the earth.  The method is expected to be              computationally efficient and will be of use in a wide range of                 earthquake engineering problems, such as the dynamic analysis of                structural foundations and underground facilities.                                                                                                              The principal investigator is recognized for his expertise in, and              contribution to, this area of research.                                                                                                                         It is expected that the research will provide a significantly improved          capability to include the effect of the earth's inhomogeneity on                earthquake induced ground motion and the associated response of                 constructed facilities.",
