 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of Dr. Stephenson's proposed research is to characterize           the developmental role of the maternal effect gene swallow.  Maternal           effect genes are transcribed only during oogenesis: the products are            packaged into the egg and are necessary for embryonic development.  Dr.         Stephenson has cloned the swallow locus, and here proposes a detailed           analysis of this gene for the purpose of determining its biochemical and        molecular contribution to development.  He proposes: 1) Molecular               characterization of the swallow gene and its transcript, by sequencing,         and S1 nuclease analysis.  2) Analysis of the swallow protein, by               generation of antibodies to fusion proteins produced in bacteria and            subsequent immunological analysis.  These experiments will allow him to         characterize physically the swallow protein, and provide a description          of its temporal and spatial expression. 3) Determination of the effects         of overexpressing swallow protein in the oocyte, or expressing it at            inappropriate developmental periods.  These experiments will address the        question of a temporally-restricted requirement for expression of               swallow, and may provide important clues concerning its function.                   Dr. Stephenson's goals are to understand the nature and                     developmental effects of maternal contributions to embryogenesis.  He is        using the powerful genetic and molecular techniques available in                Drosophila to approach this problem.",
