 "awd_abstract_narration": "OBJECTIVE:  This proposal is for continued support of the NAS to the            Environmental Studies Board in its role as the U.S. adhering body (USNC)        to the Scientific Committee on Problems on the Environments (SCOPE).            The scientific objective of SCOPE are:  1) to advance the state of              knowledge concerning the influence of humans on their environment and           the effects of environmental changes on human health and welfare, with          emphasis on global or regional effects; and 2) to serve as a non-               governmental, interdisciplinary and international source of advice to           governments, international bodies, and other groups with respect to             environmental problems.                                                                                                                                         RELEVANCE OF THE PROJECT TO PROGRAM OBJECTIVES: The activities of SCOPE         are of considerable interest to the scientific and engineering                  communities in many countries, including the U.S.  They span a broad            range of disciplines including biological sciences, environmental               sciences, physical sciences, social sciences, earth-ocean-and-                  atmospheric sciences, and various engineering disciplines including             civil, chemical, and environmental.  Support of U.S. participation in           international scientific organizations such as SCOPE by U.S. scientists         and engineers promotes the NSF/SORP objective of strengthening the U.S.         science and engineering effort.                                                                                                                                 MERIT OF THE PROPOSAL:  The USNC/SCOPE, which is composed of highly             competent internationally recognized experts, has made considerable             progress during the last award period in involving other U.S. scientists        and engineers in their activities and informing the scientific and              engineering communities of SCOPE activities.  It should be noted that an        initiative for a SCOPE project by the U.S. National Committee on                Estuaries, Coastal Embayments and River Deltas was adopted by the SCOPE         General Assembly in September 1985.  This project will synthesize the           understanding of the effects of rising sea level and changes in sediment        loads on coastal areas around the World.  The USNC is presently                 developing another SCOPE initiative on toxic chemicals",
