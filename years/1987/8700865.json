 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this cooperative project between James Klocke and             Manuel Blandrin, NPI, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Chiu Shinfoon, South            China Agricultural College, Guangzhou, China are to isolate, identify           and bioassay natural products derived from three species of Chinese             plants known for their insecticidal properties and to test those                products against a number of economically significant pests such as             cabbageworm, citrus redmite, and tobacco budworm.  This cooperative             research supports the objective of the U.S.-China Program which is to           promote opportunities for cooperation in basic science between                  scientists of the U.S. and China on projects of mutual interest and             benefit to both countries.  In addition to defining currently unknown           structural properties of certain plant constituents, this research has          the potential of identifying naturally occuring plant derived                   insecticides of economic and ecological significance to both countries.                                                                                         This proposal is a carefully considered and well documented research            plan involving scientists with excellent credentials.  The Chinese              principal investigator, Dr. Chiu, has an excellent international                reputation in the entomological field of plant pesticides and the U.S.          scientists are well known for their work in phytochemical research.             This project is jointly sponsored by NSF and the Chinese State Education        Commission under the U.S.-China Protocol for Cooperation in Basic               Sciences signed in December 1980 and extended April 1986.  This is a new        two-year award.  Under the terms of the U.S.-China Agreement in Basic           Sciences, all costs incurred in the U.S. will be covered by NSF and all         costs in China will be covered by the Chinese government.",
