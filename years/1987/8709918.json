Instrumentation of the type needed to make NMR measurements            enhances the research environment of the department involved.                                                                                                   The Department of Chemistry at Furman University will purchase a                high-field NMR spectrometer with multinuclear broad band capabilities           with support from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program.  The            instrument is needed by members of the Chemistry Department for                 research in the following areas of chemistry:                                                                                                                        1) metal olefin bonding                                                         2) solid phase synthesis of glycopeptides                                       3) uncatalyzed hydromagnesiation of carbon multiple                                bonds                                                                        4) thermal and photochemical behavior of amino acid                                complexes of Cr(III) and Rh(III)                                                                                                                        This NMR spectrometer will be a significant addition to the                     Department's instrumentation capabilities, enhancing both current and           future research efforts.  The instrument's acquisition will also have a         dramatic impact on Furman's continuing efforts to attract the very best         students to careers in chemistry (over the past five years, 48% of the          Department's undergraduates have gone on to chemistry graduate school,          with 41 Furman students presently in Ph.D. programs).",
