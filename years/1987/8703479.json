 "awd_abstract_narration": "Synthetic fibers are used extensively in composite materials.  They have        been considered for reinforcement in cement.  However, the silicate             network glass reacts with cement, which is strongly alkaline (PH 12.5).         Consequently, more expensive glass fibers containing zirconia were              developed for improved chemical stabiliity of the fibers for this               application.                                                                    The PI proposes to use basalt fibers for cement reinforcement.  Basalt          is a naturally occurring relatively inexpensive material widely                 available in the drawing basalt fibers.  To improve the chemical                stability of basalt fibers, the PI proposes to form thin films of               silica-zirconia by sol-gel processing.  This is in contrast to the              alloying route other researchers have taken in the use of glass fibers.         Both the application and approach are novel. Industry has expressed             strong interest in this work as well as other applications of basalt            fibers.",
