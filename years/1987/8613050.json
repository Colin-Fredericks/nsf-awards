 "awd_abstract_narration": "The widespread uses of suspensions in industry such as paint products,          slurry fuels, and coal slurry transportation have for long provided             motivations for their study.  Recently, additional impetus for study of         suspensions has been generated since coal-water slurry (CWS) fuel was           recognized as the potentially most economical means for the usage of            coal, one of the nation's most abundant energy resources, to replace            oil in utility boilers.  The research is concerned with experimental            and theoretical studies of two related subjects, rheology and airblast          atomization, in concentrated suspensions of particles larger than               colloidal sizes.  The major research objective is to improve                    understanding of the structure and the underlying mechanisms of                 concentrated suspensions with application to CWS technology.  Research          emphasis will be placed on particle-particle and particle-fluid                 interactions as affected by particle surface property.",
