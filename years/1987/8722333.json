FCCSET has asked the National Research               Council (NCR), through its Computer Science and Technology Board                (CSTB) to:                                                                      (1)     comment on the utility of such a capability to the U.S.                 Research Community;                                                             (2)     review the technical feasibility of plan;                               (3)     review existing computer forecasts as they might affect the             network service as it become available.                                                 Gordon Bell, Director of Computer and Information Sience and            Engineering at the National Science Foundation, submitted a                     letter to the NCR dated July 31, 1987 on behalf of FCCSET to                    Formalize this request.                                                                 CSTB proposes to conduct a 5-month review of the FCCSET                 plan, culminating in a succinct report that summarized current                  knowledge about the three stated issues.//",
