 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major question Malecki will examine is the degree to which          the labor market for technical workers affects the locational                   decisions made by research and development firms.  He will first                study the location of R&D within corporations and then survey both              corporate staffs and R&D personnel to determine considerations                  included in the locational decision making of corporations and                  workers.  He will then identify the degree of correspondence between            the locational criteria of firms and workers.                                           The research links two issues in the study of high-technology           location: the labor market for professional and technical workers and           the location of corporate facilities for which such workers are                 critical.  The project will yield a better understanding of                     high-technology industry location process, and therefore of broader             questions of regional growth and decline, by linking the two                    perspectives.",
