 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sale price of drugs is strongly affected by the cost of                     purifying the product - i.e. separating the desired chemical from               the reaction medium in which it is produced.  This project is a                 study of a bioreactor that combines the production and separation               stages in one unit and thus could greatly decrease final costs to               consumers.  Some of this high cost is due to the increased                      complexity of new drugs, often very complicated molecules which                 may exist in more than one configuration (isomer).  Of these,                   often only one configuration has the desired properties and                     separating them from each other results in additional                           difficulties over and above those encountered when separating                   different compounds from each other.                                                                                                                            The configurations to be looked at are hollow-fiber modules where               the enzymes (the biocatalysts) are immobilized and product is                   continuously removed.  This has the advantage also that product                 concentration does not build up which normally inhibits enzyme                  activity.  The PIs plan to measure enzyme activity and                          stereoselectivity and to operate a prototype reactor in this                    Phase I work.  They are well qualified to do the research and the               facilities are adequate.  Funding is recommended.",
