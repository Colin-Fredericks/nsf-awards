The purpose                of this project is to study of the methodologies available for                  simulating the transport and environmental fate of contaminants                 in ground water.  The study will be conducted by a committee of                 approximately 10 experts.  The report is envisioned to be a                     constructive contribution to the literature, forming the                        blueprint for research and development of future models.  This is               a multi-agency project.  NSF participation is to generate new                   knowledge in the area of contaminated ground water modelling.",
