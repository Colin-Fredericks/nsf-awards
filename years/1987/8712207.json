 "awd_abstract_narration": "Political participation has long been a topic of interest to students           of political behavior.  While it is through citizen involvement in              government that political leaders are held accountable for their                behavior, few Americans are politically active.  Although participation         has been investigated widely, one aspect of participation, individuals'         beliefs about their role as American citizens, has been neglected.              This doctoral dissertation research has as its focus an investigation           of how individuals conceptualize their citizen roles.  The research             will also examine individuals' explanations of their own and others'            participatory behavior.  These explanations, along with the citizen             conceptualizations, are expected to provide key insights into how the           American political system functions.                                                                                                                            Two research methods will be employed to investigate the topic.                 First, Q-methodology, a sorting and prioritizing technique, will be             used to uncover the perspectives individuals have about the role                of citizens in a democracy.  Drawing on these findings, a survey                questionnaire will be developed and administered in the Minneapolis-St.         Paul, Minnesota, area.  It is expected that the combination of these            two methodologies will expand our understanding of citizen perceptions          of political participation.",
