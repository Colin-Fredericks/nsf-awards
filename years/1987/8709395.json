 "awd_abstract_narration": "Processing induced defects will pose an ever increasing problem         in VLSI-ULSI because processes involving ionizing radiation will become         more prevalent.                                                                         Unfortunately, scientists with an interest in defects in                insulators tend to be divided amongst those who use electrical                  characterization techniques, and those who use nonelectrical methods of         analysis such as EPR, ESR, and XPS.  The former group include                   physicists, and solid state electrical engineers, while the latter group        include material scientists and classical chemists.  The two groups very        rarely have a common forum for interchange of ideas and much valuable           information is lost to each of these groups because of this.  In                addition, there is another group, that concerned with RAD hard                  materials, who speak to neither of the                                          aforementioned groups.                                                                  The purpose of the presently proposed workshop entitled, \"The           First Workshop On Process-Related Electrically Active Defects in                Semiconductor-Insulator Systems\", is to bring together this mixture of          scientists with varying backgrounds, but related interests.",
