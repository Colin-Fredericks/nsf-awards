 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project provides current and relevant content        and methodology to 200 science and mathematics teachers in the 22 high          schools of Queens County, New York City over the next three years.  The         200 teachers involved directly will, in turn, serve as leaders in the           enhancement of their colleagues in subject matter and classroom                 instructional strategies and methods.  60 mathematics, 60 biology, 40           chemistry, 20 physics and 20 earth science teachers will be the direct          beneficiaries of the program during the time of the project. These              teachers will then work with the 550 remaining science and mathematics          teachers in the Queens County high schools.                                                                                                                     The project activities include 4-week summer institutes in 3 of the             subject areas each summer, 6 follow-up workshops during the academic            year, inservice activities at the high schools by the participating             teachers, and periodic visits, collaboration and consultations among the        project faculty, participating teachers, and their peers.  A Science            Resource Center will be developed at York College during the term of the        project and serve as a means of continuing the project activities once          NSF funding ceases.                                                                                                                                             A thorough needs assessment was completed prior to the submission of the        proposal.  The personnel involved included a representative sampling of         the client population who expressed a felt need for the content and             methodology update because of the new Regents science and mathematics           curricula which are to be implemented in the immmediate future.  Further        several teachers had not participated in such renewal activities for            several years.",
