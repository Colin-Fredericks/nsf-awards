 "awd_abstract_narration": "An extended study of vibrational and electronic transitions,                    relaxation and energy-transfer processes of simple and complex                  defects in alkali halides is planned. Isolated molecular defects,               excited with various ir laser or electronic excitation                          techniques, will be explored in the spectral and temporal domains               for ir vibrational fluorescence, existing in weak or strong                     competition to multi-phonon or multi-roton relaxation or                        intermolecular vibrational energy transfer processes.                           Association of molecular defects with F centers form pair-                      configurations, which under F-electron excitation can produce                   efficient electron-vibration (E-V) energy transfer into the                     molecular modes leading to multi-step vibrational emission.                     Under variation of host materials, molecules and optical                        techniques the kinetics and physical mechanism of the E-V                       transfer process will be studied and clarified.  The ability of                 these defect-pairs to produce vibrational superfluorescence and                 visible-light-pumped vibrational solid state lasers will be                     systematically explored and developed.  Besides these                           vibrationally emitting systems, strong electronic transitions of                new F-aggregate centers will be studied with the aim of                         developing color center lasers with improved-stability cw as well               as psec mode-locked operation over an extended near ir tuning                   range.  Single mode operation of these lasers will be used for                  high-resolution hole-burning experiments in various vibrational                 and electronic defects.  Their active work on order/disorder                    transitions of pure and mixed alkali-cyanides will be extended,                 particularly towards new optical questions and techniques.",
