 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although hydrophobic interactions are ubiquitous and                            fundamentally important in a variety of chemical and biological                 systems, vapor pressure results are unique in that they provide                 unambiguous thermodynamic information about the association of                  hydrocarbon moieties in dilute aqueous solution.  Dr. Christian                 will undertake extensive new solution studies, with the goal of                 obtaining highly-precise data for systems in which hydrophobic                  interactions are the predominant associative effects.                                                                                                           By making a major improvement in the automated vapor pressure                   apparatus, it is planned to expand considerably the range of                    systems that can be investigated.  Aqueous systems to be                        studied will include: binary solutions of individual                            hydrocarbons and fluorinated hydrocarbon molecules, ternary                     solutions containing volatile hydrocarbons and nonvolatile                      polar solutes (including surfactants), and very dilute                          solutions of aliphatic alcohols in water.  This latter type of                  study has already yielded extremely precise vapor pressure                      results for methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, and tert-butanol.                    Interaction parameters (Gibbs free energies, enthalpies, and                    entropies) for pairwise and higher-order interactions of                        alcohol molecules have been obtained with an accuracy that has                  never been attained previously.  The new automated system will                  make it possible to obtain excellent total and partial vapor                    pressure results for solutions of many compounds, including the                 aliphatic alcohols, that are less volatile than water.",
