 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal from Dr. Brewer, Chairman of the GOFS Steering            Committee, is to support a continuing effort in planning and                    developing GOFS.  A major ocean flux program has been identified                as a vital component of the NSF Global Geosciences Initiative                   and, specifically, of the NSF/OCE long range plan by the NSF's                  Advisory Committee on Ocean Sciences.  Similar programs now being               established in Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the United                   Kingdom will necessitate international planning and cooperation.                        The initial steps towards a Global Ocean Flux Study took                place in early 1984, being supported by the National Academy of                 Sciences.  A meeting of experts was held February 14-16 in                      Washington, DC to consider the feasibility of developing a                      program which would link the established large scale physical                   programs and understanding of the ocean to the emerging                         understanding of the chemical and biological fluxes which do much               to maintain the habitability of our planet.  Recommendations from               this NAS expert group led to a Global Ocean Flux Study (GOFS)                   Workshop, at the National Academy's Woods Hole Study Center, in                 September 1984.  The workshop proceedings (NAS 1985) have been                  published and widely distributed within the international ocean                 science community.                                                                      Following the GOFS Workshop, a small group (Drs. P. Brewer,             WHOI; K. Bruland, UCSC; P. Jumars, U.W.; and J. McCarthy,                       Harvard) met twice in Washington, DC to edit the workshop                       proceedings and to examine how best to proceed with the workshop                recommendations. This latter group has evolved into an Executive                Committee which has since worked hard to bring such a program                   closer to reality. These efforts include public presentations to                government agencies, the preparation of a proposal and the                      holding of numerous scientific meetings to further progress.  A                 steering committee charged with overall program guidance has also               been established.",
