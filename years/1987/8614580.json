 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for funds to support research on the investigation of a           mechanistic basis and to develop a model for the microflocculation              observed  with the application of ozone as a preoxidant in  water               treatment practice.  The research will address microflocculation due to         preozonation highly on colored, low alkalinity, low turbidity source            waters.  The influence of four mechanisms will be investigated. These           are (a) rearrangement of humic material particle size distributions             leading to more efficient coagulation and flocculation, (b)                     recombination of humic ozonization degradation products via hydrogen            bonding, (c) oxidation and separation of metals complexed with humic            material and their subsequent action as coagulants, and (d) combination         of dissolved bulk solution metals with complexed metals to act as               coagulants or even to precipitate.                                                                                                                              The principal investigator is highly qualified to perform the proposed          research.  A two year continuing grant is recommended.  This award is           for $76,100 for the first year.",
