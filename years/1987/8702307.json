 "awd_abstract_narration": "The denotational and fixpoint semantics of Prolog and several related           extensions of conventional Logic Programming are under investigation.           The work on Prolog is concerned with the behavior of negation and with          the consequences of the non-fair selection rule in Prolog.  The Logic           Programming extensions being investigated center around the idea of             broadening the underlying space of truth values.  The specific                  extensions being investigated are:  allowing undefined and overdefined          as well as true and false as truth values; allowing truth values in a           Pseudo-Boolean algebra 'evidence space'; allowing truth values in a             topological space, for the purpose of modelling partial or inconsistent         evidence; and allowing Kripke models incorporating multiple modalities,         for the purpose of modelling distributed logic programming.                     The use of languages developed from logic, Prolog in particular, is             expanding rapidly.  Research in progress here is significant in that it         provides a deeper understanding of the design and extension of these            languages and of the process of programming correctly and verifiably            with these languages.",
