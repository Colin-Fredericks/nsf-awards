 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for renewed support of the Materials Research                     Laboratory (MRL) under the direction of Theodore H. Geballe at                  Stanford University.  The MRL has three major objectives:  to                   support multidisciplinary efforts in materials research which                   reqire the participation of several investigators to make                       progress;  to fund an important set of central facilities which                 support a wide range of materials research on campus;  and to                   start outstanding new research efforts rapidly and intelligently                through the use of \"seed money\".  Of the 60 or so faculty members               currently active in the MRL, 37 participate in thrust area                      research or receive direct MRL project support.  There are 32                   graduate students and 4 postdoctoral research associates in the                 program, which maintains strong links with industrial and                       government research laboratories through cooperative research.                                                                                                  The planned research includes major thrust areas in                             optoelectronic and infrared materials, polymer structure and                    dynamics, structure and properties of thin films, and photon                    materials research using free electron laser and synchrotron                    sources to investigate electronic properties of surfaces and                    interfaces.                                                                                                                                                     A particular strength of the Stanford MRL is its ability to span                the range from basic science to engineering in the individual                   thrust areas as well as in the program as a whole.  The thrust                  research is strongly interactive, faculty are first-rate and the                quality of students and postdoctoral associates is very high.                   The MRL is well equipped and is addressing scientifically                       challenging and technologically significant research problems.                  Research on optoelectronic and infrared materials, polymers, and                electrical and magnetic properties of thin films is often at the                forefront; research proposed on photon materials science                        involving the free electron laser and synchrotron radiation                     studies of surface chemistry makes an exciting new initiative.                  Seed funding has been used effectively, and there are promising                 new interactions with industrial research groups.  Support for                  one year is provided to give MRL management the opportunity to                  reorganize the MRL thrust areas and continue to define the role                 of the MRL in the context of current long-range  planning for                   science and engineering at Stanford.",
