The           principal investigator plans to attend the upcoming Second                      International Conference on Chemical Engineering Education in                   Cambridge, England on April 14-16, 1987.  He has been invited by the            Institution of Chemical Engineers (on behalf of the European Federation         of the Chemical Engineering Working Party on Chemical Engineering               Education) to present a plenary lecture in the session on \"Initiatives          in Engineering Education.\"  His lecture is entitled \"Scaleup and                Safety--Linked Initiatives.\"  The PI has been active in research and            educational activities relative to this meeting.  On this trip, he is           also planning to visit the University College of University of London,          University of Cambridge, and Imperial College of University of London.          A report will be prepared by the PI of the major findings at the                Conference and University site visits.                                                                                                                          JUSTIFICATION                                                                                                                                                   Attendance at this Conference will be beneficial to the United States.          A record of recent initiatives in Engineering Education in Europe and           Asia will be made available by the PI; the information will                     subsequently be distributed to USA engineering schools.  Dr. Kabel was          invited to attend by the top management of the American Institute of            Chemical Engineering, as well as the European hosts.                                                                                                            RECOMMENDATION                                                                                                                                                  Support for airfare on a USA carrier is recommended at the level of             $860.00.",
