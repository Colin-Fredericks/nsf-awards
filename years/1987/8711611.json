 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the atmospheric boundary layer and the effect it              has on cloud growth is a fundamental meteorological problem that is             important to a broad range of atmospheric questions ranging from                venting of pollutants to the free atmosphere to the effect of cloud             cover on climate.  Observations (especially those from meteorological           satellites) have clearly shown that clouds can form in distinctive              and very organized patterns over expansive areas.                                   For several years Dr. Agee has investigated well-organized                  mesoscale convective cloud patterns which result from the                       thermally-driven convective boundary layer over both land and water.            The principal investigator will continue his work in this area using            previously collected observational data, numerical models and                   theoretical studies to establish criteria for determining the onset,            causative mechanisms and morphological characteristics of convection            and to continue development of an observational classification system           for thermal atmospheric convection.",
