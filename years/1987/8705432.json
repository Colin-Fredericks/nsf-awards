 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has two complementary components of study.  In one                 part, the focus will be on documenting changes in forest turnover               (i.e., tree recruitment, growth, and mortality) in the subalpine                conifer forest of New England.  The vegetation in 7 permanent                   stands of spruce-fir and 13 permanent stands of balsam-fir                      originally established 11-13 years ago will be resampled.                       Several of these stands are considered \"old-aged\" and in the                    final stages of scenescence' recruitment of new individuals is                  beginning.                                                                                                                                                      In the second part, broad-scale woody debris patterns and                       processes associated with forest turnover will be described.  In                particular, wood decay on 100 red spruce and balsam fir boles                   initially sampled 11-13 years ago will be measured.  Also                       measured will be the input of wood litter to the forest floor                   using maps of the forest floor containing permanently marked                    boles.  The input of woody debris is directly related to changes                occurring during stand development and is often episodic.  Rates                of wood decay, on the other hand, are probably similar from year-               to-year.  By having input and decay data for 11 of the 20 stands                of forest over a 11-13 year interval, the investigators will be                 able to landscape patterns.  Finally, data will be used to                      examine the within-stand organic matter dynamics and the concept                of net ecosystem production over a successional forest gradient.                                                                                                The investigators are an excellent team.  Facilities for the work               are quite good.  Excellent scientific productivity can be                       expected.",
