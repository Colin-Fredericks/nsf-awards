 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives and Relevance to Program Objectives:  This recommended award         would support costs for Professor James F. Lubker, and one of his               graduate students, both from the University of Vermont, to collaborate          with Professor Bjorn E. F. Lindblom, University of Stockholm, Sweden.           They will research questions on how the central nervous system controls         speech production.  They will try to specify the goals of the central           nervous system in speech and how the goals might be explained.  The             motor control of speech articulators represents a high-level and                uniquely human form of fine motor control.  Their studies will seek to          determine whether speech motoric goals are differentiated from other            non-reflexive motor goals, and to relate speech motor control to general        motor control theory.  The proposed research has important consequences         for understanding language theory and the development of language.              Professors Lubker and Lindblom have productively worked together for            several years.  Professor Lubker helped set up the laboratory he will           visit in Sweden.  Professor Lindblom has been a frequent visitor in Dr.         Lubker's Laboratory in Vermont.  The project thus contributes to an             important objective of NSF's cooperative science programs with Western          Europe, which is to stimulate scientific progress by bringing together          scientists from the U.S. and Europe who have similar research interests         and who wish to engage in mutually beneficial research cooperation.                                                                                             Merit of Proposal:  The cooperating U.S. and foreign investigators are          respected for their research accomplishments, and there is a very good          prospect that this proposed research will lead to a significant                 contribution to scientific knowledge.  The  cooperation presents the            U.S. Professor with an opportunity to work with one of the world's              leading research groups in the field and to use highly specialized              facilities abroad that are complementary to his own.  The work plan has         been carefully prepared, and the budget is reasonable.  Both research           groups will contribute to the project and will benefit significantly            from the cooperation.                                                                                                                                           Funding:  This award will not duplicate other funding.  The University          of Vermont and various organizations in Sweden have funded Professor            Lubker's research in Sweden in the recent past.",
