 "awd_abstract_narration": "Key to this project is a three-week summer workshop for 24 high school          chemistry teachers, selected from northeastern Ohio.  In this intensive         workshop, they will study chemical structure and bonding, energetic             aspects of chemistry, and biochemistry.  In addition, they will                 participate in a course component in science education.  Features of the        program include lectures, laboratory exercises, instructions in video-          taping science demonstrations, and exposure to computer applications.           The program will provide an introduction to the \"real world\" of applied         chemistry through laboratory and industrial tours and lectures by               industrial scientists.  Problem sets, computer software, and videotaped         materials will be tested by the teachers in their classrooms during the         following academic year, and the results of these piloting activities           will be shared in follow-up Saturday workshops.                                                                                                                 The 24 participants will be selected from those with less than five             years of chemistry teaching experience at the secondary level and/or            those unprepared for chemistry teaching.  Special consideration will be         given to applicants from the Cleveland school system, to members of             under-represented groups, and to teachers of students from under-               represented groups.  The teachers will receive stipends of $200 per week        and their living expenses at Notre Dame will be covered by the grant.           They will be eligible to receive academic credit in the form of                 continuing education units.",
