 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfields of interfacial and materials                     chemistry.  Four areas of technological and fundamental                         importance are addressed by this research.  One area is the                     preparation and characterization of organized arrays of redox-                  active molecules within molecular sieve structures that could,                  through vectored electron transfer processes, emulate the natural               photosynthetic system's ability to efficiently convert light to                 chemical energy.  A second area of research focusses on the                     development of inorganic analogs of Langmuir-Blodgett lipid films as            avenues to the synthesis of fundamentally interesting and                       technologically useful surface microstructures which could be                   useful as high resolution photoresists in microlithography and as the           basis of molecular photodiode devices. In a third area, the                     intercalation chemistry of transition metal sulfides and                        oxyhalides is being explored as a means to develop cathodes for                 use in high energy density batteries. The fourth area addressed                 by this research involves topochemical oxidation reactions of                   highly symmetric organic molecules in the solid state that could                lead to a general and effective synthetic route to metallic and                 semiconducting organic polymeric materials.                                                                                                                     This five year continuing grant to the University of Texas for                  the support of Professor Mallouk as a Presidential Young                        Investigator is designed to enable his rapid and effective                      initiation of this broad and innovative research program in                     materials chemistry.",
