 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a recommendation for an award to support research on developing         a practical and inexpensive sensor for radon gas.  Current approaches to        radon measurement provide little information on factors contributing to         concentration fluctuations over periods of time.  These factors include         seasonal variations, weather changes, utility usage and structural              changes to the enclosure being monitored.  The monitor, subject of this         project, will utilize commercially available microchips that will be            adapted for use as radon sensors by applying adsorbing coatings to de-          lidded devices.                                                                                                                                                 The proposal leading to this recommendation was submitted in accord with        NSF 86-19, Small Business Innovation Research.  This proposed work has          objectives consistent with those of the Program in Environmental                Engineering and the investigators have qualifications appropriate for           the work to be done.                                                                                                                                            Award is recommended in the amount of $40,000 for six months starting on        February 1, 1987.  This will be for Phase I as described in NSF 86-19.",
