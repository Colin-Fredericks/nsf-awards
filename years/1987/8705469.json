 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Cushing, with support from the National Science                       Foundation,  has been working over the past several years on                    extensive, philosophically oriented case studies of episodes in                 contemporary physics.  With this grant, he will use these case                  studies as part of his investigation of the construction, selection             and content of scientific theories.  The theory which he is                     developing will occupy a kind of middle ground between the overly               rational reconstructions of \"logicists\" and the overly anti-rational            reconstructions of some sociologists of knowledge.  His model will be           \"naturalized\" in that it is based upon a detailed examination of the            actual historical record of current, real scientific practice which             will provide the 'data' to which the methods of science are applied             in studying the scientific enterprise itself; \"socialized\" in that it           takes cognizance of 'external' social and individual factors in the             construction and justification of scientific theories; \"highly                  constrained\" in that it recognizes and examines in detail the not               uniquely determining 'internal' and often strongly compelling logic             of a theoretical framework once that framework has been even                    tentatively accepted for development and testing.  This work will be            an important and highly useful contribution to the ongoing discussion           of the philosophical problem of epistemic support for human knowledge           claims, most especially for such claims about science.",
