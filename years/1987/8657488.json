 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although  one of the major properties of the cell membrane is             to recognize and respond to various signals with which it comes in              contact, the cells of the immune system have the additional ability             to recognize substances which are foreign and potentially harmful.              Thus these cells bear receptors for interaction with foreign                    substances (antigens). Regulation of an immune response involves                different cells and hormone-like molecules and their interactions               also depend on specific recognition molecules or receptors on the               surface of these cells.  James Hildreth's research is directed at               understanding the structure and function of surface membrane                    molecules that serve in the recognition and regulation of specific              cellular interactions in immune functions.                                                                                                                      Dr. Hildreth is a young investigator who has been making significant            contributions in this area.  To pursue these studies he has been                awarded a  Presidential Young Investigator award.",
