 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives and Relevancy: This project supports participation by 15             U.S. scientists and engineers in an international symposium on                  tunneling for water resources and power projects, to be held in New             Delhi January 19-22, 1988.  The symposium will cover several topics,            including engineering classification of rock mass for tunnelling,               studies of hydraulic tunnels in hard rock, weathered and fractured              rock and swelling rocks, geometric and hydraulic design of tunnels,             evacuation, support and reinforcement, tunnel lining for stability,             monitoring and back analysis of tunnels, and case histories.  The               U.S.-India program supports participation by U.S. scientists and                engineers in major international meetings in areas of interest to the           two countries.  The project meets this criterion.                               Merit:  The topics of the conference are important to the U.S. where            new concepts of pumping and power generation result in changing                 stress distribution in tunnels and lining, creating a need for                  improved tunneling methods and designs of tunnels.  The topics are              also important to India where major water and hydroelectric projects            have been completed or are under construction including the single              largest  tunnel ever built.  The selection of the U.S. participants             will be done by the P.I., and by representatives of the U.S. National           Committee on Rock Mechanics.  The symposium is likely to increase               cooperation between U.S. and Indian scientists and engineers in this            field.
