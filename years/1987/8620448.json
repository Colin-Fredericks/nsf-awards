 "awd_abstract_narration": "The complex interactions among macromolecular species in                living cells provide a number of opportunities for evolutionary                 change to take place in each of the components involved in the                  interaction.  An important feature of such molecular coevolution                is that the interacting components in one evolutionary lineage                  can evolve along a pathway which differs from the same components               in another species.  This could lead to adaptively significant                  differences among species in the functional properties of the                   particular molecular system.                                                            An investigation of the functional divergence that has                  arisen among species in the system responsible for making the 18s               and 28s ribosomal RNAs in mammals is proposed.  It has been found               that the nuclear transcriptional machinery from one species is                  often not capable of interacting with the DNA regulatory                        sequences involved in controlling ribosomal RNA gene expression                 from other species.  The rate of evolutionary change in the                     transcription factors and the controlling elements of these genes               will be studied.  The analysis of this model system may be                      especially significant since it involves the analysis of                        evolutionary changes in elements affecting the control of gene                  expression.  Such changes have been proposed by many to be at the               basis of the characteristic differences in physiology, morphology               and biochemistry that have accumulated among species during                     evolution.",
