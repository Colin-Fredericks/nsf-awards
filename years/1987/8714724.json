 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS) is        sponsored by the Computer Society of the Institute of Electrical and            Electronics Engineers, IEEE.  For the last four years, the ICDCS has been       held in the United States.  This year the Seventh ICDCS will be held at         the International Congress Center in Berlin, West Germany, during               September 21-25, 1987.  Twenty American Scientist and Engineers will            participate in the Conference.  Their attendance will increase the level        of information exchange and cooperation with European, Australian,              African, and Asian researchers.  The Conference is a milestone for              examining the state of the art at the international level and outlining         the future technical developments in all aspects (theory, design, and           implementation) of distributed computing systems.  The Conference               Proceedings will be published by the Computer Society of the IEEE and           selected papers of exceptional merit and interest will be considered for        publication in the major IEEE journals.                                         This is a very important conference which should have the participation         of American Scientist and Engineers.  The subject areas are especially          relevant to scientific research supported by the Foundation.",
