 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new function for sphingosine and other long-chain bases                  has recently been discovered:  in addition to serving as the                    backbones of sphingolipids, they also serve as inhibitors of                    protein kinase C.  The goal of this project is to test the                      hypothesis that the cellular effects of long-chain bases depends                on the precise structural requirements of several steps in their                utilization, including:  (1) the solution behavior of the                       molecules, including their association with proteins in  the                    culture media; (2) the rate of cellular uptake and movement among               cellular membranes; (3) the extent and course of metabolism                     within the   cell; and (4) the interaction of the sphingosines                  with protein kinase C. To approach these issues, long-chain bases               analogues will be synthesized.  The structural specificity of                   protein kinase C inhibition  will be evaluated in vitro using                   purified kinase C in a mixed micelle assay.  The analogues will                 also be tested for their usefulness as inhibitors of the kinase                 in intact cells.  The physical, chemical, and metabolic                         properties most likely to influence the utilization of these                    long-chain bases by the cells will also be measured.  This work                 will provide valuable information about the basic biochemistry of               sphingosine.  In addition, it is hoped that the work will lead to               the availability of useful kinase C inhibitors for studying the                 role of kinase C in the life of the cell.",
