 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research addresses some issues which are                      fundamental to linguistic theory and which, despite repeated and                intensive efforts, have so far resisted resolution.  The basic                  issue is the formulation of a model of universal grammar which                  can account satisfactorily for the syntactic patterns found in                  languages in which the verb and its object phrases are adjacent,                such as English or Japanese, and also languages in which they are               separated by the subject, the VSO languages of the title of this                project.  The investigators will study in depth three different                 VSO languages, Chamorro, Berber, and modern Irish, and will                     continually compare and contrast their findings on the three                    languages, attempting to arrive at the strongest general claims                 that can be made.  The three languages are chosen because of                    their genetic and geographical diversity, and because each of the               three investigators has been engaged in long-term intensive study               of one of them.                                                                                                                                                      The three investigators all have leading international                     reputations as acute linguistic theoreticians with unusually keen               abilities at linguistic description as well as theory.  Each of                 them has been extremely productive of work of the highest caliber               over a long period of time.  Their collaboration on this project                offers the best promise one could hope for of a fundamental new                 advance in our understanding of the basic structure of language.",
