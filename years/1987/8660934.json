 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will investigate the use of Moire'                      interferometry in conjunction with optical Fourier transforms in a              machine vision system for application to inspection tasks.  The                 suitability of Fourier sampling in the interpretation of Moire' fringes         will be investigated and the robustness of the system using different           test objects under different conditions will be tested.  Current machine        vision systems are primarily based on video signal processing by digital        computer.  The amount of information that must be digitally processed           for each test object is large, thus processing is either slow or                requires expensive hardware.  The proposed method employs optical signal        processing in both the Moire' and Fourier portions of the system, thus          greatly reducing the digital processing requirements.  The proposed             techniques are inherently                                                       inexpensive and very fast, and should be robust in production                   situations.  The research plan in this Phase I includes: Generation of          well defined Moire' patterns and investigating these with the                   Moire'/Fourier system.  Testing the system on good and bad versions of          test objects, such as stamped metal part with dent or improper                  curvature, smooth metal part with scratches, turned metal part with             nicks or out-of-roundness, and injection molded part with extraneous            flashing.  Investigate the discrimination capability for moving objects         at typical production speeds.  Investigate position tolerance by moving         the test object in the field of view.  This research should determine           which applications are suited to Moire'/Fourier inspection and what kind        of inspection discrimination can be realized, and will provide direction        for further phases.  Follow-on phases are planned which include                 investigating a table top set up of optimum hardware configuration to           handle the largest range of inspection parameters, followed by                  commercial development of a system.                                                  This research should lead to an efficient machine vision system            which is expected to contribute to reducing manufacturing costs,                improving product quality and gaining competitive strength.",
