 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1986, the twenty-first General Assembly of the                          International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) established the               International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme: A Study of Global                  Change.  Over the next ten years, the IGBP is charged with                      describing and understanding the interactive physical, chemical,                and biological processes that regulate the total Earth system,                  the unique environment that it provides for life, the changes                   that are occuring in this system, and the manner in which they                  are influenced by human actions.  For a number of reasons, the                  IGBP presently includes very little social science research that                would aid in understanding human activities that affect the                     development of global models.  Consequently, several groups,                    including the ISSC, have taken steps to launch a social science                 research program to complement IGBP.  They have planned a major                 international symposium which will take place in Tokyo in 1988 to               develop a preliminary plan for an international social science                  research program that will complement the IGBP.                                      This small grant will underwrite a planning workshop so that               U.S. social scientists can meet to help shape the international                 social science research program that will complement the IGBP.                  The workshop participants will make recommendations to the                      steering group that will be responsible for organizing the Tokyo                symposium about the agenda, organization, and structuring of the                symposium.  Equally as important, they will make recommendations                about the development of a research program that U.S. social                    scientists would undertake as the U.S. national component of the                international program.  Social scientists from many disciplines                 and specialties within disciplines will participate in the                      workshop which will be held at the Institute for Social Research                of the University of Michigan in the Fall of l987.                                   The models and agendas that will be developed at this                      workshop will have great scientific value both for the aims of                  the IGBP and for important future directions of social science.                 By nature of the structure of the social sciences, theoretical                  and empirical work has not by and large focused on the                          interaction between human activities and natural changes in the                 world environment.  Similarly, the natural sciences have not come               to terms with the interplay of natural events and social,                       economic, cultural, political, and legal factors.  This workshop                will be an important first step toward the long-term goal of                    relating the study of human activities and how they change to                   global models of natural phenomena.",
