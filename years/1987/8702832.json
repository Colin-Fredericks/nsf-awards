 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ian Anderson will continue his investigations of the                       variational bicomplex. This is a topic which has rapidly moved                  into the forefront of research into the calculus of variations.                 Its applications range from conservation laws of partial                        differential equations to Riemannian structures and variational                 problems in differential geometry.                                                   The variational bicomplex is a bicomplex of differential                   forms which derives its name from the fact that one of its                      differentials may be identified with the Euler-Lagrange operator                from the calculus of variations. Anderson's work will focus                     principally on the calculation of the cohomology of the                         variational bicomplex. When applied to systems of differential                  equations the importance of this cohomology arises from the fact                that it is generated, in part, by the conservation laws of the                  equations. In this context Anderson will investigate the case of                over-determined systems of equations. Group actions on a fiber                  bundle also give rise to the problem of calculating equivariant                 cohomology. Here Anderson will carry out the computations in                    cases of interest to mathematical physics.",
