 "awd_abstract_narration": "Duke University and the University of North Carolina at                    Chapel Hill, in cooperation with faculty from North Carolina                    State University and the staff of the Microelectronics Center at                North Carolina, will initiate an Engineering Research Center for                Emerging Cardiovascular Technologies.  The Center will combine                  NSF and NIH support with funds from industry, private                           foundations, and the North Carolina Biotechnology Center.                            The Center will incorporate the lastest VLSI design                        concepts, biosensors, systems design and simulation to explore                  the design of a new generation of cardiac interventional and                    medical imaging systems.  This interdisciplinary center will                    bring together active university research programs of well-                     established engineering and biomedical researchers with                         industrial investigators.  The research will focus on Cardiac                   Interventional Systems.  Cardiovascular Imaging, Microelectronic                Systems and Biosensor Systems to create the fundamental knowledge               required to design advanced biomedical systems, devices, and                    instruments.                                                                         Performance and quality are key to the leadership of the                   U.S. in developing and marketing cardiac interventional and                     imaging systems.  The U.S. possesses and excellent base of basic                biomedical research, which the ERC will combine with the latest                 developments in high technology in order to create, build, and                  assess prototypes of new interventional and imaging systems which               will be competitive in world markets.                                                Integral to the ERC will be the active participation of                    industrial personnel through advisory boards, research affiliate                and visiting fellow programs, and a seminar series.  Students,                  faculty, and industrial personnel will collaborate in research,                 an optimum way to speed the flow of research to technology.                          The Education program will focus on the involvement of                     undergraduate and graduate students in multidisciplinary teams                  made up of faculty and industrial researchers from diverse                      technical backgrounds.  Industrial personnel will be active                     members of the faculty in designing educational programs and                    advising student research projects.                                                  The Duke ERC was approved by the National Science Board as                 one of the FY 1987 ERCs in March of 1987, provided that the ERC                 receive one-third support from the National Institutes of Health.               This action initiates the first year of the ERC through partial                 funding of NSF's commitment.  Completion of NSF's commitment will               await approval by the NIH of an award to support the ERC.                            The Division of Cross-Disciplinary research recommends the                 Duke ERC because it provides an excellent opportunity to combine                engineering and medical skills to advance a basic field of                      engineering.  The ERC's contribution will be critical for the                   development of a new generation of interventional imaging systems               which will directly enhance international competitiveness through               new products and indirectly reduce the costs of healthcare.",
