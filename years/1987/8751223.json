 "awd_abstract_narration": "Westminster College, New Wilmington, Pennsylvania, will conduct the             \"High School Psychology Teachers' Science Skills Equipping Project\" for         forty participants.  In each of two summers, a four-week long  module           will have as its focus research methods applied to cognitive and                physiological psychology relevant for the high school psychology                curriculum.  During three afternoon laboratories each week, participants        will act as students in demonstration experiments conducted by the              project faculty.  Demonstration experiments based on lectures and               readings will be designed by the participants, enabling them to approach        psychology as a science.  Microcomputers will be used to demonstrate            basic psychological processes and replicate classic and current                 experiments in psychology in the high school classroom. During the              academic year, the project staff will visit each of the participants            classes, conduct two half-day in-service sessions, and assist in                developing a newsletter and psychology fairs. Participants will return          to the campus for a weekend at the end of the academic year to share            their insights and integrate their experiences into the second summer           module for 20 different participants. An extensive and careful                  evaluation plan has been outlined.",
