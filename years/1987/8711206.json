 "awd_abstract_narration": "The photochemical reaction center is the site in the                            photosynthetic membrane where absorbed light energy is                          converted into chemical energy.  While recent biochemical                       evidence has supported the structural similarity between                        photosystem II and the bacterial reaction center, components                    in the photosystem I (PSI) reaction center complex remain                       more poorly defined.  It is only in the past several years                      that well-characterized higher plant PSI preparations which                     retain the structural and functional aspects of PSI in vivo                     have been available.                                                                                                                                            The PSI reaction center complex of oxygen-evolving organisms,                   which is the focal point of the current project, is less well                   characterized although it is known to be functionally                           different than the other complexes since it contains a low                      potential electron acceptor system.  Dr. Malkin will examine                    the nature of the polypeptide subunits in the isolated PSI                      complex and the association of specific electron transfer                       carriers with specific subunits.  The stoichiometry of the                      individual subunits within the complex and changes in the                       content of these subunits in response to environmental signal                   will also be defined.",
