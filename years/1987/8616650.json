 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biosynthesis of Bacterially Induced Sesquiterpenoid                     Phytoalexins in Cotton:  The project goal is elucidation of the                 biosynthetic pathway from farnesyl pyrophosphate to the                         phytoalexin 2,7-dihydroxycadalene in cotton.  Project                           objectives are:  1) identification of intermediate metabolites                  of the biosynthetic pathway, and 2) isolation and purification                  of the sesquiterpene cyclase involved.  A cotton line lacking                   the potentially interfering pigment glands will be used.                        Direct MS/MS analysis of powdered, inoculated tissue, as well                   as GC/MS/MS of tissue extracts will be used to search for                       resistance-associated sesquiterpenoids.  Putative intermediates                 will be purified for structure elucidation.  An assay will be                   developed for the sesquiterpene cyclase, based on conversion of                 isotopically labeled substrate to a cyclic intermediate.                        Purification of the enzyme will be undertaken.                                                                                                                  2,7-Dihydroxycadalene and three structurally related compounds                  are produced during expression of resistance to the bacterial                   pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. malvacearum and accumulate                  to inhibitory concentrations in fluorescent, necrotic leaf                      cells adjacent to the bacterial colonies.  They thus appear to                  play an important role in race-specific resistance of cotton to                 bacterial blight.  There is genetic evidence that this                          resistance response results from a recognition event determined                 by a host resistance gene and a corresponding bacterial                         avirulence gene.  Identification of the enzymes that are                        regulated will facilitate the study of how the recognition                      event regulates phytoalexin production.  The information gained                 should identify traits that have to be bred or engineered into                  cotton to make it more resistant to infection.",
