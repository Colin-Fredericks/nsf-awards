 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalytic surfaces for hydrocarbon cracking and dehydrogenation have            been known in the petroleum industry to become inactive after some use          because of carbon or \"coke\" coating.   The proposed research is                 directed toward using such coatings, preferably produced under                  conditions simulating the environment of such operating machinery as the        \"adiabatic\" diesel engine, as self-replenishing solid lubricants.               Continued wear of the carbon coatings would maintain catalytic activity         of the substrate.   The operating temperatures in the                           piston-ring/cylinder area of such a diesel engine and the preferred             temperature of catalytic coke generation by some transition metals              happen to coincide in the 500-600 C range.  Adsorption of combustion            chamber gases on these carbons would further reduce friction and wear.          The same transition metals, in alloys or in or on ceramics are also             close to hydrocarbons.  The suggested research program will use                 pin-on-disk testers on reproducibly prepared samples and determine the          friction and wear rates, rates of carbon formation and rates of carbon          oxidation to help guide the design and materials selection for high             temperature lubrication in an engine environment.",
