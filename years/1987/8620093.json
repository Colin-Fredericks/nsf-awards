 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a renewal of EAR8317722.  The project is concerned  with           tropical glaciers and their reponse to climatic forcing.  Drawing on            more than  a decade's work in various high mountain regions of the              tropics, research over the next few years will concentrate on the               glaciers of Mount Kenya, and to a lesser extent on the ice masses of            Peru's Cordillera Blanca.                                                            A major task to be accomplished by 1990 is the mapping of all of           Mount Kenya's glaciers at scale l:5,000.  In conjunction with a 1963            mapping this will document the glacier changes over the past quarter            century and serve as control for recent and future measurements of              terminus variations.  This task entails the establishement of control           points through ground surveys during 1987-89, and airborne                      photogrammetry in 1989-90.  The Lewis Glacier shall be re-mapped for            the March 1990 datum at scale 1:2,500.  The observations of                     preceipitation, net balance, and ice flow velocity on the Lewis                 Glacier will continue.  These form the basis for the quantitative               formulation of forcing-response relationships in terms of the mass and          heat budgets.  Also, the decade-long net balance record along with the          assessments of bedrock and surface topography and ice flow measurements         will serve as input for predictions of the spatial pattern of ice               thinning and slowdown of the ice flow.  Verification of these forecasts         represents a stringent test for an understanding of tropical                    climate-cryosphere relationships.",
