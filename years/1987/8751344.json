 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to improve mathematics and science instruction         in a rural Alabama school system by training the existing elementary and        middle school teachers.  It is a collaborative effort between the Macon         County School System and the faculty at the Tuskegee University; College        of Arts and Sciences and School of Education.                                                                                                                   Project activities include:  (1) workshops to improve the science and           mathematics knowledge of teachers; (2) the development and utilization          of demonstration classrooms for the classroom application of teacher            knowledge in science and mathematics; and (3) leadership development            through administrator workshops and the preparation of teacher                  consultants to ensure effective instructional change beyond the life of         the project.                                                                                                                                                    The central focus of the project is the development of a cadre of twenty        teacher consultants who will receive sufficient preparation to serve as         resources to their classroom peers.  This strategy involves a multi-            stage process of in-school training, university instruction, and teacher        consultation.                                                                                                                                                   In the first year, approximately 117 teachers and 7 administrators will         be trained by university personnel.  Of these, 20 teachers will be              selected for further training in second year training activities to             serve as lead teachers for training of teachers for additional school           districts during the third year of the project.  Expected training              outcomes are (1) increased teacher knowledge; (2) more effective                instructional delivery by teachers; (3) improved student performance;           and (4) demonstration classrooms as a teacher resource and for use in           the clinical experiences of university teacher trainees.",
