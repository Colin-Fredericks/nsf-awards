 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes a two day Workshop on Adhesion Science                  and Technology to be co-directed by Professor Gerald G. Fuller of               Stanford University and Dr. Kashmiri L. Mittal of IBM                           corporation.  It will be held on the 26th and 27th of February,                 1987 at Stanford University.  This workshop will serve as a forum               through which the range of technologies which are impacted by                   adhesion and coating properties can be appreciated.  The subject                matter will contain sufficient technical dept ot enable attendees               from academic research and NSF to assess the most critical                      outstanding issues in this field and the areas in which they                    could most likely particpate and support.  The speakers will                    primarily be chosen from industrial laboratories and will                       introduce specific applications of adhesion technologies as well                as discuss current theories and experimental methods.  The                      applications will include examples from microelectronics,                       including optoelectric circuits, mass storage media, composite                  materials, tribology protective coatings.  The presentations and                summaries of each discussion session will be published in                       workshop proceedings.                                                                                                                                           The workshop is supported by a number of NSF/ENG programs,                      including Thermodynamics and Transport Phenomena, Materials                     Engineering and Processing, Tribology, and Solid and Geo-                       mechanics.  Therefore, the final workshop program will reflect                  the interests of these programs.                                                                                                                                (Note:  The date of the workshop will probably be delayed until                 May or June, 1987).",
