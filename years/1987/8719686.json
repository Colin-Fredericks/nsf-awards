Encompassed in these tasks will be such                major activities as: maintaining and optimizing SRS' computer                   system particularly with respect to developing an extensive                     graphics system, implementing a desktop publishing system,                      enhancing the current technology, both hardware and software                    utilized by staff.                                                                   SRS is the principal means by which NSF fulfills its mandate               to \"...provide a central clearinghouse for the collection,                      interpretation, and analysis of data on the availability of, and                the current and projected need for, scientific and technical                    revenues in the United States, and to provide a source for                      information for policy formulation by other agencies of the                     Federal Government...\"  In carrying out its responsibilities, SRS               has increasingly made use of a variety of automated systems and                 it activities have become increasingly complex and highly                       computer intensive.",
