 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to understand the origin of a              closely-related complex of 21 species of fishes, in the genus                   Semionotus, in relation to the formation, expansion and                         subsequent evaporation of a large fossil lake (Lake P4) preserved               in the Newark Basin of eastern North America.  Specific                         objectives are to: (1) determine which species were unique to                   Lake P4 by mapping the occurrences of these species in 8 distinct               lake basins and through 33 million years of time, (2) analyze the               genealogical (phylogenetic) history of these species, and (3)                   test the hypothesis that those species which are unique to P4                   (and thus probably originated in that lake) will be more derived                and appear later in the historical record of the lake than those                species which have widespread distributions and presumably                      colonized Lake P4 during its early history.  This study will have               significant implications for our understanding of the fundamental               pattern of the origin of species and of the relation between                    environmental change and organic evolution.",
