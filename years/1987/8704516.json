 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the course of previous research on patterns of                       biogeography, extinction, and phyletic evolution for Western                    Atlantic Bivalvia during late Neogene time, I have made                         extensive collections of the early Pliocene fauna of a shell                    pit at Sarasota, Florida.  This fauna is spectacular for its                    richness (more than a thousand species of mollusks, about 180                   of them bivalves) and for its excellent state of preservation.                  In the course of my work, I have concluded that the vertical                    sequence of facies in the pit records the transgression of a                    barrier-island-lagoon complex, exemplifying Walther's Law.                      Transgressive sequences of this type are rare in the                            stratigraphic record because rapid relative rises of sea level                  usually destroy barrier island and lagoonal facies or cause                     them to jump inland.  I am developing a model to explain why                    the transgressive sequence has been preserved at Sarasota - a                   model that I believe has general significance .  This proposal                  is for funding to support more detailed study of the                            stratigraphic units in the Sarasota pit, more thorough                          collection of their faunas, and full development of the                         stratigraphic model.  Ultimately, I will also produce a                         taxonomic-biogeographic monograph on the total bivalve fauna,                   which represents the little-studied temporal equivalent of                      well-known faunas to the north (northern Florida to Virginia:                   the Jackson Bluff, Duplin and Yorktown faunas).  It is crucial                  that the field work in Sarasota be conducted now because the                    pit will soon be flooded.",
