 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Objectives and Relevance to Program Objectives:  The U.S.              investigators will work with William James McCabe from the Institute of         Nuclear Sciences located at Lower Hutt, New Zealand, over a period of           two years.  The project is aimed at the development and application of a        new method for the separation of isotopes.  The radio chemistry group at        New Zealand's Institute of Nuclear Sciences has developed a new process         for the chemical separation of uranium, thorium, and protoactinium from         geologic samples.  The  method, based on temperature-controlled ion             exchange techniques and rotating disc electrodeposition, provides               quantitative recoveries of these elements.  This project seeks to               improve the method by including simultaneous separation of polonium,            radium, lead, and other elements.  In addition to further enhancement of        this new technique, several applications to on-going research projects          at both institutions are planned.  These projects include a study of            radiochemical contamination of ground water in southwest Florida and            dating of Pleistocene terraces in New Zealand.  The combination of              techniques and of expertise of the U.S. and New Zealand scientists helps        fulfill the objective of the Program of promoting research of mutual            benefit to both countries.                                                                                                                                      Merit:  The use of the technique pioneered in New Zealand with the              further development by the U.S. investigators holds considerable                potential for continued benefits.  The introduction of this technology          into the U.S. will provide an opportunity to expand the available dating        techniques for small, low-yield samples common in ocean sciences.  The          project has been recommended by the Marine Geology and Geophysics               Program for funding with high priority, and will take place with the            concurrence of the New Zealand executive agent for the cooperative              program.                                                                                                                                                        Relation to Other Projects and Funding:  The research proposed here             represents the addition of an international collaborative effort to             research currently being supported domestically by the Marine Geology           Program (OCE 85-20724) and by the Florida Department of Environmental           Regulation.  There is no duplication of funding, as this award provides         only foreign travel, communication and support for the shipping of              samples.",
