 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fifty teachers will participate  (25 in the summer, l987, and 25 in the         summer l988) in a Master Teachers Workshop for 4 weeks.  The foci of            this workshop are on the process-structure of science and the                   developmental learning theory.  Each teacher will complete the study of         two of three curricula:  biology, physics, and/or chemistry.  Daily             seminars on science and learning-theory bases relating to these                 curricula will be an intergal part of the workshop. Three follow-up             sessions for the paricipants will be conducted during the academic year.                                                                                        Participants will be chosen from school districts in Kansas, Northern           Texas, Arkansas, Southern Missouri, Eastern Colorado, and New Mexico.           The primary goal of this project is to train a cadre of Master Teachers         who will provide inservice for teachers in their school district using          learning cycle-based curricula.                                                                                                                                 The participants will be provided with a complete set of curricula              materials with permission to reproduce the materials for other teachers         within their local school system. Each participant's school system will         be required to make significant commitments and provide adequate support        systems to enhance the summer participants' local staff development             activities.",
