 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because of their greater size and strength, adult males of many species         have the greatest potential to injure members of a society.  Societies          must control aggression within the group in order to continue to                function as cohesive units.  Means must exist to modify and channel the         aggression of maturing males.                                                                                                                                   Dr. Bernstein believes that adult males contribute significantly to the         socialization of adolescent males by punishing inappropriate aggressive         behavior.  Even when adult males play minor roles in the socialization          of infants and juveniles, their role as socializing agents during               adolescence may be essential to the control of male aggression, thus            permitting peaceful social interaction among individuals of disparate           sizes and abilities.                                                                                                                                            Dr. Bernstein's research conducted during 1985 to 1987 demonstrated that        adult male rhesus macaques are significantly more responsive to the             aggressive behavior of adolescent and adult males than to aggressive            behavior of females or younger males.  His results suggested that               selective interference by adult males modified the aggression of                adolescent males.  Adolescent males maturing in the absence of adult            males showed abnormal aggressive patterns, in that they continued to act        aggressively toward females, younger animals, and kin, as was typical           when they were juveniles.                                                                                                                                       During 1987, adolescent males (the \"subject males\") living in two               normally constituted social groups lacking adult males are beginning to         exceed the size of adult females.  Dr. Bernstein will determine if their        aggression toward these females and their young is greater than normal.         He will then try to modify the aggressive behavior of these males, first        by introducing normal subordinate adult males, who will display normal          behavior, and later by introducing normal dominant adult males, who will        display normal behavior and also be capable of interfering in the               aggression of the subject males.  Dr. Bernstein believes that the first         case will provide adult-male models, but that this will not be                  sufficient to alter the behavior of the subject males.  In the second           case, he believes that the dominant adult males will punish abnormal            patterns of aggression directed against females, and that this                  socializing experience will modify the participation of the subject             males in aggressive interactions with the group.",
