 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  supports research by Prof. Cynthia Burrows, which is aimed at                   characterizing the binding and catalytic properties of protonated               macrocyclic polyamines.  This work falls in the general area of \"host-          guest\" chemistry and constitutes a \"biomimetic\" approach to                     replication of enzyme binding and catalysis in man-made chemical                systems.                                                                                                                                                        Macrocyclic polyamines can participate in both cation and anion                 complexation phenomena.  Tetraamines of 18-membered ring size are               easily tetra-protonated in aqueous media, and their high positive               charge density accounts for their ability to form strong association            complexes with various organic and inorganic anions.  In this context,          the Burrows group will investigate optically active macrocyclic                 spermine analogs which possess functionalized side chains.  Phosphate           esters and carboxylates will be studied in various media in order to            define the parameters important for strong association.  Macrocycles            bearing a pendant imidazole group have been designed as potential               catalysts for phophate ester hydrolysis.  Tetraamines of 14-membered            ring size (cyclams) form stable complexes with transition metal                 cations, especially divalent cobalt, nickel, and copper ions.  Like             porphyrins, the cyclams stabilize high oxidation states of certain              metals.  Burrows has recently discovered the first nickel-catalyzed             olefin epoxidations in which cyclam is the key to accessibility of the          Nickel(III) oxidation state.  Optically active cyclams bearing pendant          ligating groups are under study in order to further modify the                  reactivity of the metal and to investigate the potential for                    asymmetric epoxidation of olefins.  These studies will enhance                  understanding of intermolecular interactions in molecular recognition           complexes and catalysis.",
