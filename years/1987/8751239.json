To accomplish this concerted effort, the project will:                                                                                                          *  Create regional and state advisory committees of distinguished STS           university leaders and state science and social studies supervisors,            whose charge will be to identify STS initiatives and needs, and to              facilitate access to existing resources and potential state inservice           leaders.                                                                                                                                                        *  Train a cadre of 450 leaders at the school district and intermediate         service unit level in a repertoire of teacher inservice models for STS          instruction and then to serve as a continuing source of information and         support to that group throughout the project.                                                                                                                   *  Develop the resource-sharing network in three ways:  arrange for             access to existing and new STS educational products and practices               through a print and a computer retrieval system; provide ongoing                professional support by the exchange of information through a computer          conferencing system; integrate ethics and values studies components into        the on-going activities of the network.",
