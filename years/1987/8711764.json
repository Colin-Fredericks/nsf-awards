 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will investigate the stress-strain (constitutive)         behavior of soils when subjected to earthquake loading, focusing on the         anisotropic response. Although a number of models have already been             proposed, verification of such models is difficult.                                                                                                             This project involves a combined analytical, computational, and                 experimental program to determine the constitutive behavior. The                analytical component focuses on a hierarchical model that the principal         investigator has been developing. The experimental phase of the project         will utilize a multiaxial cubical device which is capable of loading the        specimen along various loading paths. An ultrasonic method will be used         to measure the degree of anisotropy of the soil specimen. The cubical           device will be modified so that the degree of anisotropy can be measured        during loading, unloading, and reloading. An alternative to the                 ultrasonic method will also be considered, namely measurement of the            electrical properties of the specimen.                                                                                                                          The above tests will first be done statically, and when verified they           will then be extended to the case of dynamic loading. This will be done         with a number of soils so as to verify the technique for a wide variety         of geological materials.                                                                                                                                        Finally, the constitutive characterization will be utilized to                  solve typical boundary value problems involving nonlinear soil                  behavior. For example, the problem of dynamically loaded                        structure-foundation systems, or of a foundation pile embedded in               cohesionless soil will be considered. Then the computed response                of the structure-soil system will be compared qualitatively with                available closed-form solutions and laboratory or field data.                                                                                                   The principal investigator has an international reputation in the               formulation of the constitutive behavior of geological materials.               He has the expertise and the institutional facilities available                 to successfully complete the research proposed.",
