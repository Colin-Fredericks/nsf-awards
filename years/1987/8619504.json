Information will be obtained from households, businesses, and local             government officials. Particular attention will be devoted to gathering         data on remittances received from workers employed in the United States,        as such payments are a major source of the income in the region.                        The purpose of the research is to determine how migration to the        United States, in conjunction with other external sources of income (for        example, government investments), generate economic growth or decline in        small towns in the region, and by extension, in non-metropolitan areas          in third world nations generally.  There is considerable disagreement in        the social science literature over whether international migration              produces beneficial or adverse effects in the regions migrants leave.           Professor Jones's research will help resolve such disagreements.",
