 "awd_abstract_narration": "The roles played by disturbance and competition in providing            structure to ecological communities have been heatedly, debated.                Contrasting hypotheses of resource-based competition and the                    intermediate disturbance hypothesis provide a theoretical                       framework for empirical studies of a variety of ecological                      communities.  In particular, the littoral zone communities of                   oligotrophic lakes present ideal systems to experimentally                      address the mechanisms maintaining species coexistence.                                 The submersed aquatic plant community of oligotrophic lakes             is dominated by vegetatively propagating perennials.  Although                  widespread in nature, these plants figure in relatively few                     demographic studies.  As such, they represent an important group                whose ecology is poorly known.  By understanding community                      processes in less environmentally variable habitats such as                     oligotrophic lakes, predictive models can be generated for other                types of more complex and variable systems.                                             This project concentrates on the ecological processes                   controlling aquatic plant distributions in oligotrophic lakes in                the Pocono Mountains (Pennsylvania).  Observational and                         experimental data will be combined to test hypotheses on the role               of macrophyte communities, particularly with regard to fish                     netting.  The pilot work conducted through this project will                    enable the P.I. to construct a more compelling and developed                    proposal with which she can compete for federal research support.",
