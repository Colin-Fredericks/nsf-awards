 "awd_abstract_narration": "The San Diego Natural History Museum houses one of the                     oldest and most diverse collections of western North American                   amphibians and reptiles in the United States.  Dating from the                  late 1800's, the collection is recognized for its large and                     comprehensive series of rattlesnakes and sceloporine lizards,                   among other taxa from the far West, Baja California, and northern               Mexico.  Less well known but increasing rapidly in size and                     significance is the collection of reptile and amphibian                         skeletons.  The approximately 31,000 reprints and books in the                  Departmental and Klauber libraries are also regarded as an                      important resource by the scientific community.  Thus the San                   Diego Natural History Museum contains one of the most important                 regional herpetological collections in North America.                                During the past five years, the Department of Herpetology                  has undergone many positive changes in policy and productivity                  with the aim of modernizing the collections, stabilizing                        curatorial procedures and increasing the use and value of the                   facilities.  This project will continue that trajectory by                      implementing computer management of the collection catalogue.                   Funding will provide appropriate hardware, software, professional               consultation and a half-time data entry person.  These                          improvements are directly related to increasing the use of the                  collection and preserving its value to herpetology.",
