 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Drs. Susan U. Wallace and                Ulysses S. Jones, Department of Agronomy and Soils, Clemson                     University, to pursue with Dr. Henry P. Samonte, Institute of Plant             Breeding, University of the Philippines at Los Ba~os (UPLB), for a              period of 24 months, a program of research on the tolerance of                  selected maize genotypes to nutritional problems related to soil                acidity.  The maize genotypes will be selected from the field                   screening program at UPLB where they will be evaluated for growth,              yield, and nutritional status on three diverse acid soils of the                Philippines.  Nutritional factors related to plant adaptation will              be identified, and the differential ability of the maize genotypes              to modify root zone acidity will be determined.                                                                                                                 It has been estimated that nearly one half of the world's                       nonirrigated arable land area consists of acid soils.  In strongly              acid soils, plant growth may be limited by one or more of several               mineral stresses, including deficiencies of phosphorus, calcium, and            magnesium, and excesses of hydrogen ions, manganese, and aluminum.              One approach to overcoming acid soil infertility is chemical                    treatment with such antacids as lime and supplementation of                     minerals.  Another approach, more suitable in the less affluent                 countries, is to identify plant genotypes which adapt to soil                   acidity.  In this project, the collaborators will identify such                 maize genotypes as well as plant traits associated with adaptation              to one or more of these acid soils.  Germ plasm containing these                adaptive traits will be used by physiologists and geneticists for               further study.  The U.S. and Philippine collaborators are highly                respected scientists who have successfully collaborated in the                  past.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the Science in             Developing Countries Program which seeks to increase the level of               cooperation between U.S. scientists and engineers and their                     counterparts in developing countries through the exchange of                    scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through               collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.",
