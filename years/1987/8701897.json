 "awd_abstract_narration": "The formation of conidia (asexual spores) in the filamentous               ascomycete, Aspergillus nidulans, involves the production of                    differentiated structures composed of several different tissue                  types and results in the synthesis of a large number of new poly                (A)+ RNAs not observed in undifferentiated mycelia.  An important               feature of this organism is that conidiation is normally                        suppressed in submerged culture, but can be initiated by changing               the growth habitat to an air interface.  Induction (the transfer                of colonies from liquid to solid media), however, will permit the               initiation of conidiation only after the organism  has attained a               change of state termed developmental competence.  The proposed                  research is directed toward determining the molecular basis of                  developmental competence and toward understanding the mechanisms                involved in the initiation of a regulatory pathway.  Preinduction               mutants have been genetically characterized, but a molecular                    approach is required to determine how different preinduction                    functions interact, and to deduce how the expression of                         preinduction genes initiates the expression of the large number                 of post induction genes which are transcriptionally activated by                growth in the induced state.  The specific aims of this proposal                are (l) to clone the wild-type genes represented by the                         preinduction and early postinduction mutants, (2) to compare the                transcriptional activity of these genes with their time of                      expression as ascertained by temperature-shift analysis, and (3)                to identify gene interactions by determining if the transcription               of one gene is affected by the mutation of another gene.                                                                                                             Development, the transition of a totipotent undifferentiated               cell to a regulated collection of differentiated cells, is a                    complex process.  The use of a \"simple\" eukaryotic organism such                as Aspergillus as a model system for mechanisms utilized in the                 differentiation process can suggest approaches and mechanisms for               understanding the process in more complex organisms.  The results               to be obtained from this work should give greater insight into                  the as yet mysterious process of differentiation.",
