 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project provides continued development and           enhancement of 25 to 35 Biology teachers per year in western New York           through participation in two week summer workshops                              focusing on cell biology, chemistry, and comparative anatomy and                physiology.  New developments and techniques in the field are stressed          and teachers develop materials to incorporate this knowledge into the           high school biology curriculum.  In addition to the summer workshop.            monthly interactive sessions are held during the academic year with             teachers, college staff, and a scientist with expertise in a certain            relevant area.  Field site visits to appropriate scientific centers or          industries are also scheduled.  Two secondary teachers also participate         each summer in a one to one research experience with a college staff            member.                                                                                                                                                         The second major component of this proposal provides content and process        background in natural and physical science to 30 elementary teachers per        year in the same region.  Materials are also developed to assist them in        teaching science in their classrooms.  Selected teachers involved in the        high school workshops serve as teachers of the courses for elementary/          junior high school teachers and also serve as their mentors when both           groups return to their school districts.  The elementary/junior high            teachers also meet several times during the year and participate in             certain field experiences.                                                                                                                                      This proposal results from a successful honors workshop for biology             teachers developed and administered by the PI, Kisailus.  The current           project strengthens and extends the honors workshop, with the                   elementary/middle school teacher component.  The staff of the project           are qualified both in background and experience.  Leader secondary              teachers are used during the workshop and in the schools to support             those with less background and expertise in the middle and elementary           schools.  The college staff involves members of the biology, chemistry,         physics, education and English departments.",
