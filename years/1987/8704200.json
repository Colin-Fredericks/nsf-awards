 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Rolnick is a major contributor to the equations of                     motion method as the basis for a microscopic description of                     collective motion in groups of fermions.  He is particularly                    interested in the application of this technique to the study of                 odd-mass and even-mass nuclei near closed shells.  The                          equations of motion method has not lived up to its earlier                      promise because of problems related to backward going states                    and overcounting.  In collaboration with Professor Klein of the                 University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Rolnick plans to investigate                    these problems, so as to make the equations of motion method a                  more useful technique for studying many-fermion systems.                             Techniques for investigating the properties of many-                       particle systems are of great interest and importance.  A                       technique of considerable promise and application, particularly                 in nuclear physics, is the equations of motion method.  The                     planned research would resolve some of the difficulties                         limiting this approach, so that it will be more useful.  The                    research experience gained by Dr. Rolnick will also assist him                  in this teaching and advising at Deep Springs College.",
