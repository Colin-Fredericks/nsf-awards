 "awd_abstract_narration": "Methods for the chemical characterization of particles or liquid                droplets in the size range 1 um to 100 um with masses in the range 1 pg         to 1 ug (10-12 g to 10-6 g) will be developed based on the researcher's         picobalance facility (also called the electrodynamic balance or                 quadrupole levitator).  The picobalance uses superposed ac and dc               electrical fields to suspend stably a charged microparticle in a laser          beam or other source of electromagnetic radiation.  The forces holding          the particle stationary are large enough to permit a particle to be             maintained in the flow of a reactive gas, and as a result the balance           chamber can be used as a chemical reactor.  Spectroscopic methods will          be developed and applied to study chemical reactions involving                  microparticles.  The techniques to be explored are Raman spectroscopy,          fluorescence spectroscopy and \"optical resonance spectroscopy.\"  A dual         monochromator and associated optical equipment will be added to an              existing picobalance facility to upgrade it to measure Raman spectra            and fluorescence spectra.  Spectroscopic techniques will then be used           to characterize multicomponent droplets and to study photochemical              reactions in single droplets and rates of gas/liquid-droplet chemical           reactions.  Reactions of particular interest include                            photopolymerization reactions within a droplet and reactions which can          occur in the atmosphere.",
