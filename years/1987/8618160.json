The scientific                    topics to be presented and discussed include the following:                     development of textures during annealing, textures which result                 from phase transformations, anisotropy of physical and mechanical               properties, textures in ceramics, polymers, geological materials,               and thin films, theoretical and experimental methods to study                   textures in materials.                                                                                                                                                  The conference will provide a forum for the leading                     scientists in the world to present the results of their research,               and for these scientists to discuss the latest results worldwide.               The progress in the state.of.the.art in topics of the conference                will thereby be focused and advanced by this open exchange of                   ideas and results.  The topic for discussion have implications                  for processing of metals, advanced ceramics and electronic and                  magnetic materials.  These materials and their processing impact                virtually every technological in the U. S. economy in some                      measure.",
