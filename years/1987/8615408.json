 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objectives of the proposed research are to investigate the          behavior of strip footings located above continuous voids and to develop        an analytical method for foundation stability analysis.  It is planned          to study different loading conditions in combination with different void        shapes, sizes and locations.  These experiments will be conducted with          different types of soils.  Such as kaolinite clay, silty clay, and sandy        clay.  The behavior of the footings will also be analyzed by using a            finite element method, and the upper bound limit theorem of plasticity.         Based on these results, equations for computing bearing capacity of             strip footing will be developed.                                                                                                                                The PI is uniquely qualified to conduct this research which is a                combination of experimental and theoretical study.  The outcome of the          research will be of major importance to geotechnical engineering in             design of foundation where the ground has natural cavities.  An award is        recommended.",
