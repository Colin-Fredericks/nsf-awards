 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Summary:  This project is a theoretical and experimental               study of the physics involved in the use of granular porous                     coalescers to break emulsions.  The aims are:  (a) to obtain a                  fundamental understanding of how a porous coalescer functions,                  (b) to develop quantitative theoretical models for predicting the               performance of a coalescer in breaking and separating an emulsion               and (c) to suggest a novel coalescer design to achieve separation               with high efficiency.  The experimental work involves flow                      visualization of the behavior of droplets, \"blobs\", and filaments               in two-dimensional, photoetched, glass porous medium models with                micron-sized flow channels.  The theoretical study is based on                  population balance equations for describing the evolution of the                size of droplets and blobs along the coalescer.                                                                                                                 Novelty/Innovation:  The most novel aspect of the proposed                      research is the use of the photoetched, glass porous coalescer                  model, which allows a systematic study of the sole effect of                    surface charge, wettability and topology of the medium on                       separation efficiency.  It is expected that totally novel high-                 performance coalescers can be designed based on the results of                  this research.  For instance, a graded coalescer in which the                   size of pore chambers increases along the coalescer would allow                 uninterrupted growth of huge \"blobs\" while minimizing the                       pressure drop and thus pumping cost.  A coalescer coated with                   anionic or cationic polymers would provide a surface charge which               attracts an emulsion stabilized by a surfactant with the opposite               charge, resulting in high separation efficiency.                                                                                                                Technical Impact:  At present, it takes about 3 man-years of                    pilot-plant testing just to make sure that an existing coalescer                will perform up to the level specified in a warranty for a                      specific application.  In addition to significantly reducing the                need for pilot-plant testing, results of this research provide a                procedure for designing a coalescer to handle a given emulsion at               a much reduced cost.  Furthermore, this research is also expected               to have considerable impact in the general areas of multiphase                  flow in porous media (e.g. oil recovery) and of emulsion                        stability.",
