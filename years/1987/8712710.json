Many of the theoretical tools used to study the instabilities and               turbulent behavior in fusion research have direct application                   problems on the ionospheric scene and the large research effort                 in theoretical plasma physics has served to accelerate interest,                both theoretical and experimental, in ionospheric turbulence.                   This activity serves to improve our basic understanding of both                 plasma physics and ionospheric physics, and to provide a firm                   theoretical and observational base for solving applied problems                 dealing with radiocommunications, navigation and other technology               problems.                                                                            This research project involves theoretical procedures to                   explain certain plasma physics phenomena such as instabilities in               the ionosphere above 200km and in the high latitude auroral                     region.                                                                              The PI is very much involved in both the fusion and                        ionospheric research communities and as such is an important                    element in the interchange of ideas between the two groups.  This               has been beneficial to both in the past and is expected to                      continue.  The PI is an acknowledged leader in these fields and                 has had outstanding success in applying modern computational                    techniques to the solution of ionospheric problems.  He is held                 in high esteem by his colleagues and has helped produce well                    trained graduate students in these fields.",
