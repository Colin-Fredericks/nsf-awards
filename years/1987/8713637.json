 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program was                  established in FY 1987 to provide substantial resources to upgrade the          research capabilities of the strongest and most productive                      predominantly minority institutions.  This planning grant project lays          the foundation for a plan that will increase the institution's quality          of research and research-related training.  Specifically, support for           this project will permit the establishment of an MRCE advisory                  committee of scientists and engineers, local leaders, and industrial            representatives who will assist the institution in evaluating its               current and future potential for performing meritorious research                during the next five years.  Southern University will assess its                existing science and engineering base and the potential for the                 institution to become a Minority Research Center of Excellence.  In             addition, several dual degree programs with Louisiana State University          in Allied Health, Chemistry, and several programs in Engineering will           be reexamined.                                                                                                                                                  This institution has the facilities and personnel to develop a                  Minority Research Center of Excellence.  The Foundation has supported           this project because the proposed work can lead to the performance of           meritorious research and will increase the participation of minorities          in science and engineering.",
