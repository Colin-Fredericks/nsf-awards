 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is to construct and test a prototype of a                     modular intelligent input/output system which is to provide the                 interface between data acquisition systems for large and                        complex experiments using the CAMAC Parallel Branch Highway and                 the new generation Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAXBI                    bus.  The design which has been worked out will utilize a                       microprocessor-based controller, the NMOS T414, which                           preprocesses data prior to transmission to the VAXBI bus, thus                  freeing the central processor of the main computer for other                    tasks.  The subsystems speed and local intelligence will allow                  a greater proportion of data processing done in real time.                      With the real-time processing, the data acquisition system and                  the experiment can be timed to maximize the experimental                        effectiveness.                                                                         The proposed system is expected to have a significant                    impact on the ability to collect a large amount of data at                      extremely high rates, which is of importance in many areas of                   experimental physics, but in particular in high energy                          physics.",
