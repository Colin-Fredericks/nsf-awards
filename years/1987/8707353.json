 "awd_abstract_narration": "The role of organic matter in processes of ore deposition                  has been the subject of many recent meetings and symposia.  For                 most deposits it is still unknown whether organic matter plays an               active or passive part in determining the site and mechanism of                 precipitation of ore minerals.  The proposed research is designed               to determine the influence of organic matter on the geochemical                 evolution of the sediment-hosted gold deposit at Alligator Ridge                is the only large deposit of this type but Alligator Ridge is the               only large deposit where heating has not obliterated the original               organic record.  Preliminary analyses using \"Rock-Eval\" and                     aliphatic hydrocarbon extracts demonstrate that organic matter                  was not inert but was oxidized by mineralizing solutions.                       Numerous oxidation reactions are possible (to CO2, ether,                       carbonyl, or other groups), however, and preliminary thermo-                    dynamic calculations show that they occur over a wide range of                  oxidation-reduction conditions.  It is proposed to determine the                nature of oxidation and mineralizing reactions by (1) extract and               Infrared analyses of kerogen to identify oxidized compounds; and                (2) thermodynamic calculations to compare the redox state of                    organic matter to that of ore and alteration mineralization.                    Successful completion of the proposed research will lead to                     deeper insight into the influence of organic matter on the site                 and mechanism of gold deposition and may lead to more cost-                     effective schemes for discovering new deposits.",
