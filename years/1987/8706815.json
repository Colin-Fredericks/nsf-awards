 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solutions.  Access to modern NMR spectrometry is                   essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.                                                                                                   The Department of Chemistry at Montana State University will                    use an award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                  and the Biological Instrumentation Program and an award from                    NIH to help purchase a state-of-the-art NMR spectrometer.  The                  areas of chemistry and biology that will be enheanced by the                    acquisition of the instrument include:                                                                                                                             1) Structural studies of inorganic complexes                                    2) Structure determination of natural products                                  3) NMR studies of visual membranes, membrane transport and                         membrane structure                                                           4) Structure and kinetic analyses of novel organometallic                          complexes and their reactions                                                5) Structure analyses in support of mechanistic studies,                           synthetic methodology and total syntheses                                    6) Structural chemistry of novel phytotoxins                                                                                                                 In addition to serving the NMR needs of Montana State, the                      instrument will be used as a resource by chemists from Montana                  School of Mines and Technology, the University of Montana,                      Eastern Montana College, and Western Montana College.",
