 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Dr. S. George Walters and some of his                    colleagues at the Rutgers University-Industry Cooperative Research              Center for Ceramics to study the feasibility and design of a                    linkage between selected researchers in the Center and a group of               researchers and organizations in Sweden who, with the Americans,                are interested in pre-competitive research in ceramics.  Several                Swedish representatives from the potential member organizations                 will also study the conditions needed for the linkage, and three                joint meetings will be held in the U.S. and Sweden to integrate the             findings of the study.  The joint study group will document the                 interests, needs, and requirements of the potential participants                and will design an organization and operational plan for the                    international cooperation.                                                                                                                                      The proposed collaborative research network of U.S. and Swedish                 researchers has advantages for both countries.  The Rutgers Center              is strong in ceramics and fiber whisker research, including                     sol-gel.  The Swedish scientists are skilled in sintering, hot                  isostatic pressing, and slip casting.  The linkage will strengthen              research in both countries and will give the participants access to             new ideas, new technologies, and additional capable researchers                 more quickly than without this formal cooperative arrangement.",
