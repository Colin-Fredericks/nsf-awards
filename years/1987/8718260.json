The following four issues                will be addressed:  1) What are the barriers to commercialization?              2) How does the U.S. approach compare with others?  3) What can be              learned from case studies?  and 4) How successful have recent                   efforts been in improving U.S. performance?  From these issues and              the collective experience of its members, the Council will develop              guiding principles and policy recommendations for U.S. government,              business, and universities to draw upon in order to enhance U.S.                commercial rewards from new scientific discoveries.",
