 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for a group of                             mathematicians and computer scientists working on problems                      related to geometry.  The broad objectives (i) to develop and                   understanding of geometry and algorithms in geometry, and (ii) to               carry out work on the computation of geometric structures and on                the sythesis and analysis of images of these structures.  The                   role of the computer in this effort is both for explication as                  well as an experimental tool to advance the research.                                The novelty of this project derives from the use of a                      supercomputer in the generation and display of geometric                        constructs such as fractal sets, Dehn surgery space, Julia sets                 Mandelbrot sets and pleated surfaces.  A welding of the                         mathematical theories of Kleinian groups, Teichmuller theory,                   analytic dynamics, combinatorial group theory and 3-manifold                    theory lies at the foundation of this project.  In addition it                  will mark the first time that mathematical researchers located at               diverse universities and in several countries will be combining                 their talents on such a large project.  Large scale communication               links will be used extensively in this joint effort.                                 Currently available algorithms for the purposes envisioned                 here are insufficient.  In addition to the planned theoretical                  and graphical experimentation, work will be done in developing                  advanced algorithms addressing problems of combinatorial                        complexity and more general language design to establish portable               software and advance understanding of fundamental data                          structures.                                                                          After an initial set-up period, graduate students and                      postdoctoral associates will be incorporated into the project.                  The interdisciplinary research experience will provide a model                  for future large-scale initiatives in the mathematical sciences.",
