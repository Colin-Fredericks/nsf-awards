 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the growing importance of lasers and modern optics,                undergraduate institutions rarely provide coursework in these                   increasingly pivotal areas.  At a time when growing numbers of                  scientists are using lasers in research and when modern optics and              microelectronics are spawning new technologies whose impact may rival           that of the silicon microchip, undergraduates in this country remain            largely on the sidelines.                                                            Lawrence University is undertaking a pilot program designed to             determine the staffing and hardware requirements for meaningful                 instruction in lasers and modern optics in undergraduate institutions.          With support from the National Science Foundation and other sources, it         will develop courses at several levels, devise suitable laboratory              experiments, test various types of lasers and optical hardware, and             develop instructional materials.   Publications, visits, workshops, and         outreach programs will serve to inform other institutions of the details        of the findings.  The primary objective is to demonstrate to others that        undergraduate offerings in laser science and modern optics are feasible         and overdue.  Aspects of this program are expected to be emulated               elsewhere.                                                                           The present grant will assist in the acquisition of electronic             equipment for use in designing and operating the laser laboratories.",
