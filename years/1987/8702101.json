The program is designed to enable U.S.                  scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research              institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well          as Japan, Australia and New Zealand.  Exchange awards provide                   opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of          unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental                  conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                                                Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to             his/her field of science, the prospective potential of the applicants           for professional growth, as well as criteria relevant to the furthering         of international cooperation in science and engineering.  The program           is particularly directed to scientists and engineers who are embarking          on their research careers.                                                                                                                                      This research project involves a study of the initial correlation               lengths and subsequent development and growth of two phase morphology           within the spinodals of partially miscible polymer blends using small           angle neutron scattering.  The process will be investigated as a                function of the molecular weight of the polymers and the interactions           between them.  The result will be used to evaluate current theories of          phase separation.                                                                                                                                               The project is under the Direction of Professor Robert A. Weiss,                Chemical Engineering Department and Polymer Science Program, University         of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06268, U.S.A., and Professor R. W. H.                Sargent, Department of Chemical Engineering and Chemical Technology,            London SW7 2 BY, England.                                                                                                                                       This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,              international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents                  allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat            administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
