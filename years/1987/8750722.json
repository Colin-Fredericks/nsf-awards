 "awd_abstract_narration": "Valpariso University will purchase a 16-inch telescope made by DFM              Engineering, along with a photoelectric photometer, spectrograph, and           microcomputer for data acquisition and reduction.  A dome and pier are          presently available.  The telescope will be used by undergraduate               students for viewing and for research projects.  Particularly, they will        undertake a program of photoelectric photometry of short-period                 eclipsing binary stars.  The students would plan an observing program,          obtain measurements of the light variation of the two stars in their            orbital cycle, reduce the data to a standard form, and analyze the light        curve to obtain orbital and physical properties of the stars.  This             program would give the students excellent experience in all of the              phases of a research project.  The results could be presented in                scientific meetings and published.",
