 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past 10 years, Neuroscience has coalesced from Pharmacology,         Physiology and Biopsychology into a coherent discipline which occupies a        prominent position in Biology.  This project integrates neurobiological         experiments into current physiology courses through the purchase of             extracellular recording devices which can be used to add two modern,            sophisticated neurobiology experiments to the Mammalian Physiology              laboratory and to initiate the laboratory portion of a new Neurobiology         course.  Computer-interfaced data acquisition and analysis apparatus is         being used with the above units and in 11 of 13 existing experiments in         Mammalian Physiology, as well as in various experiments in Neurobiology,        Cell Physiology and Comparative Physiology.  The addition of these two          experimental setups and the experiments they make possible enable               students to become familiar with some of the modern, sophisticated              neurobiological and computer-oriented techniques used in research and           industrial laboratories where graduates may pursue advanced studies or          career employment.",
