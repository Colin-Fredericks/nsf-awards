 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Franklin Institute Science Museum, a major American Science Center          serving more than 700,000 individuals annually, proposes to create a            3,700 square foot permanent exhibition that will promote public interest        in and understanding of the concepts and principles of mathematics in           concrete, tangible form.  The exhibition will consist of five clusters          of hands-on devices, interactive computer programs, models, and text on         the themes of Geometry; Symmetry; Chance, Probability and Randomness;           Series, Sequences and Limits; and \"Modern Math\"--Fractals, Knots and            Braids and Topology.                                                                                                                                            Museum staff will utilize several mathematicians as advisors and design         participants and will develop adjunct educational materials for use by          teachers, students, and family members.  They will disseminate                  exhibition techniques and content by providing six collaborating museums        with selected copies of exhibit devices and hardware for their use in           developing temporary or permanent mathematics exhibits.  Staff of the           six museums will join advisors for a design conference during exhibition        planning, and will provide evaluation reports on their use of the               exhibit materials.                                                                                                                                              Knowledge of mathematics is not only necessary for everyday life; it is         central to public understanding of science and engineering, and a key to        continued participation in science and engineering, and a key to                continued participation in science education in high school and college.                                                                                        Increasing national interest improvement in the mathematical ability of         americans at all levels, pre-college and college, make this proposed            exhibition particularly timely.",
