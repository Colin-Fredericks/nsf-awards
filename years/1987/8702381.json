 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell-cell interactions and later developmental events during the                Chlamydomonas sexual cycle are known (or presumed) to be controlled by          alleles at the mt, or \"mating-type\" locus.  mt exemplifies a master             regulatory gene orchestrating the expression of groups of unlinked cell-        type-specific genes.  This proposal describes work designed to determine        which aspects of sexual development are under direct mt regulation, and         to define the circuitry of genetic pathways that underlies progression          of the sexual cycle.  Intensive searches for mutant phenotypes showing          mating-type-limited expression will be conducted.  Altered chloroplast          gene transmission (under mt control) will be used to identify mating-           type-limited (mtl) mutants.  Through the characterization of sexual             development in mutant strains (microscopy), analysis of chloroplast             inheritance (marker transmission genetics and DNA-specific flourescence         microscopy), measurement of linkage between mt1 gene loci, and                  definition of epistatic interactions between these genes in constructed         double mutant strains, the mt locus will be identified and distinguished        from the genes it regulates. Induction of second-site suppressor                mutations and characterization of the suppressed strains will be used to        further clarify the primary functions of the mtl loci.  Genetic analysis        of mating mutants will also be used to evaluate alternative models for          the mating-type \"switching\" typical of homothallic species.                     The proposed experiments will lay a genetic foundation for the eventual         understanding of the molecular basis of differentiation of the sexual           stage of the organism.  Chlamydmonas is a simple one-celled plant and an        understanding of the mechanisms involved in the simple differentiation          of mating types may give insight into the more complex mechanisms used          in differentiation in higher plants.",
