 "awd_abstract_narration": "This reseach is concerned with investigating the geometry of            the Infinitesimal Variation of Hodge structure (IVHS) for                       irregular surfaces of general type which is motivated by the                    Torelli type problems.                                                                  The specific objective of the research is to give a                     cohomology data on a surface which is sufficient to reconstruct a               surface itself.  By stating precisely what such a cohomology data               should be and relating it to the the usual IVHS, one can infer                  sufficient conditions for the generic Global Torelli Theorem for                certain irregular surfaces of general type, one of the main                     motivations of the research.                                                            The \"heart\" of the research is a new method of relating IVHS            to the geometry of a surface.  The essence of the method is to                  interpret part of the data of IVHS as a set of equations defining               the zero-locus of a holomorphic 1-form on a surface.                                    This method itself is an important part of the research:  it            not only enables one to resolve the specific objectives described               above, but also is an effective mechanism which ties together                   three important aspects of study of an algebraic surface:  IVHS                 of a surface; vector bundles of rank 2 on a surface; and                        effective 0-cycles on a surface.                                                        This research is in the general area of complex algebraic               geometry.  It uses algebraic and analytic tools to obtain                       information on geometric objects.  It is an extremely important                 branch of mathematics, and Reider shows potential to add                        significantly to knowledge in the field.",
