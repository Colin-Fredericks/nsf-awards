 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work will result in the characterization of the               bovine nuclear gene that specifies subunit IV of the                            mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COX IV).  Bachman's previous                  work led to the isolation of a cDNA corresponding to the COX IV                 mRNA.  This will be used in a straightforward way to isolate                    genomic clones.  She has evidence for at least two genes, one of                which appears to be a pseudogene.  Using these clones, it should                be possible to develop gene-specific probes which Bachman will                  then use to study a variety of aspects of the regulation of the                 gene(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The cytochrome oxidase (COX) of the mitochondrion is a large               complex of different proteins, three of which are encoded by the                mitochondrial DNA while the remainder are specified by the                      nuclear genome.  The number of such nuclear subunits varies: in                 yeast there are 5; in mammals, about 10.  Several interesting                   regulatory problems are presented by this enzyme.  These include                the mechanism that coordinates expression of the nuclear and                    mitochondrial genes, and the mechanism, possibly the same, that                 regulates expression in different tissues.  As yet, virtually                   nothing is known about the structure and regulation of these                    nuclear genes in mammals.  The work proposed by Dr. Bachman will                lead to the isolation and characterization of gene(s) for the                   largest of the mammalian nuclear subunits, COX IV, and should                   provide some insight into the mechanisms which regulate its                     expression.",
