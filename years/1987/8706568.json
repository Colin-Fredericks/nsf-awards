 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, an enormous number of neurotransmitter                    and neuromodulatory substances have been identified in both                     vertebrate and invertebrate substances.  These substances                       include a number of amines and an ever-increasing number of                     neuropeptides, the exact physiological roles of which are still                 unclear.  However, it appears in many cases that the peptides                   are modulatory in nature, provoking relatively long-term                        alterations of ongoing neuronal activity or inducing such                       activity in previously quiescent preparations.  Such                            modification and modulation of neuronal activity is common to                   all animals, and is essential to a wide variety of activities.                  Studies of the roles of neuropeptides in modulating neuronal                    activities will thus serve to clarify further not only the                      physiological roles of the many substances found in the nervous                 system but also the mechanisms by which neuronal modulation can                 occur.                                                                                                                                                               Perhaps the most amenable systems for the study of                         modulation at present are those systems in which a regularly                    patterned activity occurs.                                                                                                                                           One such system, in which the role of peptides in                          modulating neuronal activity can be addressed readily, is the                   stomatogastric nervous system of decapod crustaceans.                           Questions related to the peptidergic modulation of neuronal                     activity, particulary rhythmically patterned activity, have                     already been approached from several perspectives.                              Considerable effort has been devoted to identifying and                         localizing a variety of neuropeptides in the stomatogastric                     system.  In addition, the physiological effects of a number of                  neuropeptides on the stomatogastric system have been studied.                   Furthermore, at least one modulatory neuron has been                            identified, and its modulatory effects on the system have been                  studied.  What is lacking, however, is the synthesis of these                   three types of experiments, the positive identification of the                  transmitters used by individual modulatory neurons and the                      effects of these neurons when fired in a physiologically                        relevant manner.  The present study by Dr. Patsy Dickinson is                   designed to begin to fill this gap in our knowledge in two                      ways:  (1) by identifying and recording from neurons containing                 neuropeptides, and (2) by examining modulatory neurons for the                  presence of these neuropeptides.",
