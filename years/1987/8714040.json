 "awd_abstract_narration": "A coordinated, interdisciplinary program of experimental research               and analysis for the development of a smart, computer controlled                optical sensor for processor-controlled applications is proposed.               Spatially resolved measurements of temperature and gas                          composition in process streams are made, using multiple line-of-                sight infrared absorption measurements and tomographic inversion                schemes.  The research aims at progress in the area of suitable                 inversion methods, their adaptation to vector parallel                          processing, signal-to-noise improvement and system integration                  for adaptive control.                                                                                                                                           Such an on-line adaptive control would allow for the practical                  automatic optimization of powerplant operation in conformity with               maximum allowed pollutant levels.  Since the regulatory                         constraints on this optimization are independent of the choice of               fuel or combustor, the algorithm will be able to search for an                  optimum figure of merit, regardless of the grade of coal                        delivered to the plant.  In other words, the process is not                     prededicated to a certain type of combustion; it is truly                       adaptive.  The expected savings in coal consumption would have                  large economic proportions.",
