 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research uses field and laboratory studies to evaluate                the following hypotheses concerning the evolution and maintenance               of satellite behavior in an anuran population: (1) calling and                  satellite behavior are alternatives that yield equal fitnesses;                 (2) an inability to acquire suitable calling sites forces                       adoption of satellite behavior; (3) individuals who are less                    preferred as callers are often more successful as satellites; (4)               satellite behavior is a tactic adopted when energy reserves are                 too low to support sustained calling; and (5) satellite behavior                is a size or age specific tactic adopted to conserve energy for                 higher growth rates.  These hypotheses are not mutually                         exclusive, and research will focus on how a complex suite of                    environmental, social, and physiological variable interact.                     The proposed research will contribute significantly to our                      understanding of intraspecific behavioral variation.  Alternative               behaviors have recently received a great deal of theoretical                    interest, yet few studies have gathered the data requisite for a                thorough understanding of the theory.  The proposed research will               allow a rigorous and simultaneous evaluation of the major                       hypotheses in this field.",
