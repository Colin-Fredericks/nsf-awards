Sempowski and Saunders will analyze and publish the large                  collection of Seneca Indian material held by the Rochester Museum               of Science Center. In total this consists of ca. one million                    artifacts and 800 skeletal samples from nearly 50 Seneca sites                  which represent an unbroken sequence of villages occupied from                  1550 to 1820  A.D.  Most of the material was derived from the                   excavation of over 3000 burials and is supported by maps, field                 notes and other written and photographic evidence.  While Charles               Wray, the primary excavator, worked out a chronology based on                   these materials that has been widely used, the basic data                       have never been published.                                                                                                                                      Drs. Sempowski and Saunders will re-analyze the artifactual                     material using a revised typology.  They will also study the                    skeletal materials, aging and sexing individual skeletons and                   noting signs of pathology. They will examine the associated                     mortuary materials as well and the results of all these analyses                will be published.  In their own analyses they plan to                          investigate the dimensions of social and cultural change which                  took place over this span of time. These include: demographic                   trends and their possible relation to disease, famine and                       absorption of outsiders: biological relationships within the                    Seneca population; interrelationships with other native                         groups; and the impact of European goods and the fur trade                      economy on Seneca culture, technology and internal status                       hierarchies.                                                                                                                                                    This research is important for several reasons. First, it will                  show how both indirect and direct European presence affected a                  native American group and how this population responded to the                  stresses thus imposed.  Second, it will make a large and                        anthropologically significant body of data available to the                     research community.",
