 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapidly advancing technologies in the fields of                                 mechanical systems dynamics, structural mechanics, design                       sensitivity analysis, optimization, computer architectures,                     computer science, numerical analysis and computer graphics need to              be integrated into an overall mechanical system simulation and                  design optimization program that can be used by industry.  As a                 result of NSF Planning Grant CDR 87-00749, the University of Iowa               has shown that an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center               for Simulation and Design Optimization of Mechanical Systems is                 both feasible and viable.                                                           This five-year continuing grant is funding along with industry              the initiation of an Industry/University Cooperative Research                   Center for Simulation and Design Optimization of Mechanical                     Systems at the University of Iowa.  This Center's research program              is addressing:  Dynamic System Simulation, Design Optimization,                 Advanced Software System Integration and Graphics Communication                 and Control of the Design Process.                                                  Over two dozens companies have become members of the Center                 providing support of approximately $1M.                                             The Co-Principal Investigators and his colleagues are                       nationally recognized experts in their fields and have the                      knowledge, resources and support necessary to operate this Center.                  Drs. dePennington (DMC) and Marsh (MSM) are providing partial               support.                                                                            The Program Manager recommends the University of Iowa be                    awarded $75,000 for the first year of a five year continuing                    grant.  The five-year continuing grant is to be cost shared this                first year with $50,000 (CDR), $20,000 (DMC) and $5,000 (MSM).                       The U.S. Army, TACOM, is providing $50,000 to co-fund this                 Center with NSF.  An additional $147,000 supplemental funding to                augment the Center's research program is being provided by for                  other Government laboratories.  Another $5,000 is for                           \"Supplemental Funding of Women, Minority, and Handicapped                       Engineering Research Assistant.\"                                                     Follow on funding during the last four years will be in                    accordance with the following renewal criteria.  Near the end of                each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or the Head of The                Division of Cross-Disciplinary Research will review the progress                of the Center on a number of renewal criteria, including the                    following: (1) extent to which university/industry interaction and              collaboration is developing; (2) extent to which the support base               for the center is expanding; (3) extent to which a robust research              program is developing.  If review is satisfactory, the Program                  Manager will recommend support of the next period of this                       continuing grant.",
