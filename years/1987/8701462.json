 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a recommendation for support of research on the                         mechanisms by which polysaccharides produced during microbial                   growth bind copper to sediments in a flowing stream of water.                   Results of this research may be applicable to understanding how                 other metals in trace concentrations are removed from water                     polluted by their presence.  Results are also expected to define                more clearly the role of bacteria and their associated                          exopolymers in sediment processes, particularly those involving                 the retention and mobilization of metals.                                                                                                                       This is a renewal of work initiated under NSF 8521693 results of                which have led to the isolation of reactive polymers from                       sediments in a natural stream and selection of the most efficient               process for identification of the uronic acid content of the                    microbial exopolymers found in river sediments as a step toward                 their complete characterization.  Elucidation of the metal-                     binding characteristics of microbial polymers in natural aquatic                systems may eventually lead to their application in the recovery                of metals from abandoned mineral processing wastes and industrial               process wastewaters.                                                                                                                                            This project has objectives consistent with those of the                        Environmental Engineering Program with special relevance to the                 element dealing with diffusion, dispersion and pollutant                        interactions under the influence of physical, chemical and                      biological processes in the environment.  The proposal leading to               this recommendation is also consistent with objectives outlined                 in NSF 83-59, \"Research in Undergraduate Institutions\".                         The investigator's qualifications are appropriate for the work to               be done.                                                                                                                                                        Award is recommended as a Standard Grant in the amount of                       $230,244 for 24 months starting on July 1, 1987.",
