The                 immediate goals are to:                                                                                                                                         o  assist experienced teachers develop mastery of BASIC and                        LOGO for mathematics instruction under the exploration,                         problem solving and demonstration models;                                    o  provide two teachers from each school with a classroom                          micro computer, modem and printer donated by AT&T;                           o  create a computer educational network between the                               middle/junior high schools and Weber State College;                          o  establish logistics for participating teachers to become                        lead teachers of in-service computer workshops for their                        colleagues.                                                                                                                                                  During an academic year and intensive six week summer program, Weber            State College in Utah will provide computer labs and teach courses/labs         for 23 teams of two teachers (from the same school) located in three            school districts. Eight academic credits will be awarded for course work        on the use of computers in middle/junior high school mathematics                classes, and the development of workshops to be taught by the                   participating teachers.  While taking these courses the participants            will use the computers in their classes. There will also be a hot line,         computer network and classroom clinics.",
