 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collections of thunderstorm cells which organize themselves into           stable patterns for periods of several hours or more are termed                 Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS).  MCSs typically affect                      multi-state areas and bring beneficial rain as well as most                     springtime severe weather (e.g. tornadoes, flash floods, hail).  A              major focus of the meteorological community is to improve our                   understanding of MCSs.                                                                                                                                               The Principal Investigator will use conventional and Doppler               radar data, upper air soundings and surface measurements to                     investigate the alterations an MCS undergoes as it changes between              different structural configurations.  A second goal is to study the             relationship between the structure of an MCS and its precipitation              characteristics.  Finally, the P.I. will complete a study of tropical           convective systems, including their similarities and differences with           midlatitude systems.  Case studies for this research will come from             the NSF sponsored Preliminary Regional Experiment for STORM-Central             (STORM stands for STormscale Operational and Research Meteorology)              and the Global Atmospheric Research Program's Atlantic Tropical                 Experiment and Winter Monsoon Experiment.",
