 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor James C. Weisshaar is supported by a grant from The Physical          Chemistry Program to study the structures and dynamics of polyatomic            gas phase ions and radicals.  The aim of this research project is a             better understanding of how the electronic structures of transition             metal species affects their reactivity.  This area of research has              important implications in the development of new chemical catalysts.                                                                                            Weisshaar will study the gas phase chemistry of transition metal ions           and neutrals containing Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, etc., and their                  reactions with small organic molecules in a fast flow reactor.  The             transition metal ions will be prepared in selected electronic states            using tunable dye laser ionization.  This research extends the use of           powerful gas phase chemical physics tools including dye lasers,                 molecular beams, and time-of-flight techniques into the regime of               molecular systems of considerable complexity and genuine chemical               interest.",
