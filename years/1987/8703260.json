 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Geoghegan's areas of interest are topology and                related group theory.  He will investigate problems in geometric                and homological group theory for which topological methods,                     coming from shape theory, fixed point theory and infinite-                      dimensional topology, are appropriate.  More specifically he will               investigate various questions involving finiteness properties and               cohomological properties of groups which can be interpreted as                  questions about \"ends\" of covering spaces.  He will continue his                collaboration with Professor K.S. Brown of Cornell University on                infinite-dimensional finitely presented discrete groups.  On his                own he will continue his investigation of the topological meaning               of a well known conjecture of H. Bass about the Hattori-Stallings               trace of an idempotent matrix with group ring entries.  Groups                  are ubiquitous in mathematics and the natural sciences as                       codifiers of symmetry, and one can never have too many approaches               to discovering their properties.",
