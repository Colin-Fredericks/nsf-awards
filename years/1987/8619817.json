 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design, manipulation and control of physical objects                        involves complex computational models that are tightly                          coupled.  To create and use such models requires an                             environment that hides intricate details, that harnesses                        complexities, and that is supported by powerful computers                       and graphics.  This Institutional Infrastructure project                        at Purdue University is planned to develop tools that                           integrate design and inspection of computational models                         of physical objects with simulation and analysis of their                       behavior and interaction.  These tools will create and                          manipulate the geometric shapes, simulate the physical                          processes, help control the power of multicomputers,                            and provide a natural, uncluttered environment for the                          users.  The award will aid in providing the facilities,                         support staff, maintenance and related costs for                                developing and experimenting with the large, complex                            interactive systems.  The project is based on ongoing                           work at Purdue and will utilize new workstations, a                             tightly-coupled multiprocessor, sophisticated graphics                          systems and access to a supercomputer system.  This                             project will allow for substantial expansion of the                             current work in geometric modeling and mathematical                             software, will strengthen other areas and will, as well,                        allow for expansion of the graduate program in computer                         science.",
