 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is funded as an Engineering Initiation Award (EIA).           The presence of hydrogen in lithium niobate crystals has been found to          make Ti-diffused waveguides less susceptible to photorefractive optical         damage.  This project is aimed at understanding how the hydrogen                additions lower damage.  The work will proceed in five stages:  (1)             Annealing at high temperature in a controlled gas environment will be           used for equilibration (oxygen, lithium, and water activities will be           controlled simultaneously); (2) FTIR, Raman, and optical spectroscopies         will be used to analyze the equilibrated crystals; (3) the bulk                 photorefractive effect will be measured by writing holographic                  diffraction gratings; (4) planar waveguides will be made by in-diffusion        of titanium; and (5) optical damage in the waveguides will be measured.         The results of each of these steps will be correlated to understand what        hydrogen defects are present and what their effects are.  A better              understanding of hydrogen in lithium niobate will allow fabrication of          waveguides with longer life and higher power transmission capabilities.                This proposal describes work which will further characterize the         photorefractive effect in lithium niobate.  The understanding obtained          in the proposed study should allow the fabrication of improved optical          devices.  The major thrusts of this study will be to identify hydrogen          related defects which are likely to be present in lithium niobate, and          to assess their positive or negative effects on the photorefractive             effect. The identifications will be made by studying crystals which have        been equilibrated in carefully controlled environments.",
