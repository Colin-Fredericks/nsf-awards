 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polyamines are small charged molecules found in all living                 cells and required for cell growth and proliferation.  The                      specific functions carried out by polyamines in the cell are                    poorly understood, but their properties strongly suggest that                   they interact with nucleic acids.  This proposal is to carry out                a systematic study of the interaction between polyamines and                    chromosome components, including DNA, nucleosome core particles,                nucleosomes, oligonucleosomes, and \"long\" chromatin.  It is known               that the interaction between polyamines and nucleosomes or                      nucleosome core particles is considerably more complicated than a               purely electrostatic interaction and that polyamines can cause a                conformational change in nucleosome core particles.  Future                     studies will extend the work with thermal denaturation and                      circular dichroism, to larger chromatin components, and will                    introduce two new methods for studying the interaction at all                   levels, namely \"footprinting\" with hydroxyl radicals, and                       photoaffinity labeling.  The study is particularly focused on the               effect of polyamine acetylation because preliminary work has                    confirmed the possibility that this process may be important in                 the dymanics of changing chromatin structure, possibly                          coordinated with histone acetylation.  The use of photoaffinity                 labeling to probe the distribution of polyamines in vivo will                   also be investigated.                                                                While the function of polyamines in the cell is currently                  unknown, their ubiquitous distribution suggests some fundamental                role in maintaining gene structure or function.  The results of                 this study on polyamine interactions should aid materially in                   developing a testable model for their role in cell metabolism.",
