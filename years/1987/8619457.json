 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolution of the Earth's early crust will be investigated through           studies on the Isua and Malene supracrustal rocks from West Greenland.          X-ray fluorescence and instrumental neutron activation analyses for             major and trace elements will be integrated with results from isotopic          studies in order to:  (a) characterize the diversity of crustal                 components in clastic metasedimentary rocks; (b) identify the nature            of ancient crustal components of the Isua rocks by carrying out                 multivariate mixing calculations on metasediment chemical                       compositions; (c) evaluate the origin of Malene gneisses as possible            products of hydrothermal alteration of ancient oceanic rust by heated           sea-water; and (d) determine whether metasedimentary  granulite show            element depletions, as found in many granitic gneisses metamorphosed            to the granulite facies.  Mineral compositions will be determined by            electron microprobe analysis and relevant geothermometers and                   geobarometers will be used to refine the metamorphic history of this            region.  Field work will be carried out in order to evaluate the                relationship of Malene Supracrustal rocks to granitic gneisses and              characterize their stratigraphic and lithologic variations.                                                                                                     The Principal Investigator is a leading authority on early Earth                geochemistry and petrology, and has a great deal of field experience            in Greenland.  The facilities required for this investigation are               adequate at Washington University.",
