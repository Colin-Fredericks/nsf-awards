Patterns discerned                  from restriction enzyme and electrophoretic data can be used to                 estimate the historical pattern of relationship between distinct                physiographic regions, based on the analysis of concordance                     between patterns of common ancestry in organisms and the inferred               history of physical changes that variously allow dispersal or                   that erect barriers between regions.                                                 A number of biological attributes suggest that mice in the                 genus Onychomys provide an excellent opportunity to reconstruct a               model of late Tertiary and Quaternary (i.e., the past 3-4 million               years or so) biogeographic flux among deserts and grasslands in                 North America.  Additionally, this study will provide a synthesis               of data (molecular, morphological, and behavioral) that will                    serve to initiate investigations into patterns of variation                     across a range of levels of biological organization, from                       phenotype to nucleotide sequence.",
