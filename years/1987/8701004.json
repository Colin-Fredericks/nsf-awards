The program is designed to enable            U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research         institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well          as Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.  Exchange awards provide           opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of          unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental                  conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                                                Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to             his/her field of science, the prospective potential of the applicants           for professional growth, as well as criteria relevant to the furthering         of international cooperation in science and engineering.  The program           is particularly directed to scientists and engineers who are embarking          on their research careers.                                                                                                                                      This research project suggests that heavy olefins may be stabilized by          using low oxidation state transition metal complexes as substituents on         the 4A metal and bulky, electron attracting groups as substituents on           the carbon.  Methods of product characterization are addressed.  Future         experiments designed to probe the synthetic utility of such heavy               olefins are also discussed.                                                                                                                                     The project is under the direction of Dr. Michael J. McGeary,                   Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,           NC  27514, U.S.A., and Professor Michael F. Lappert, The School of              Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, The University of Sussex, Falmer              Brighton BN1 9QJ, England.                                                                                                                                      This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,              international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents                  allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat            administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
