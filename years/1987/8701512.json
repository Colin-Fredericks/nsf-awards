 "awd_abstract_narration": "Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building construction         in the U.S. and the world.  Reinforced masonry construction use is              increasing in moderate to higher seismic zones because of its apparent          features of economy, fire safety, architectural flexibility and ease of         construction.  The present state of masonry structural analysis and             design and materials and construction technologies does not enable an           accurate prediction of building behavior under lateral loads such as            seismic loads.  In the U.S., masonry buildings are designed and built           with methods, codes, and standards that rely upon a mixture of working          stress methods, empirical rules, and questionable methods for                   determining allowable stress values.  Masonry is also a complex building        material because of the large number of design and construction                 variables which influence the final product configuration and its               response under seismic loads.  In order to describe the seismic response        of masonry buildings it is necessary to develop the fundamental                 knowledge base to determine basic design methodologies consistent with          safety and economic requirements.                                                                                                                               This research project will investigate and provide basic data for               verification of analytical models that describe the out-of-plane                response of masonry walls.  It is focused on reinforced clay masonry            walls.  The experimental portion of this program will consist of quasi-         static, cyclic testing of reinforced clay masonry walls subjected to            out-of-plane loadings.  The data produced will include force-                   displacement load paths and hysteretic loops, as well as strain data in         the masonry and reinforcement.  The analytical portion will utilize the         mathematical models developed by others in the TCCMAR program.  The             final research results will then be used to establish rational limit            state design methodologies to resist seismic loadings.                                                                                                          The principal investigator is highly qualified to conduct this research         project and the institution provides excellent facilities.  An award is         recommended for this twelve-month research project.  This research              project is part of the U.S.-Japan Coordinated Program for Masonry               Building Research and the Technical Coordinating Committee for Masonry          Research (TCCMAR) Program.",
