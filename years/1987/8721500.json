 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is designed to provide more information                      about the sources of employment growth for natural scientists                   and engineers during 1976-1982.  It will provide estimates of                   employment growth in approximately 200 Standard Industrial                      Categories for the detailed categories of natural science and                   engineering occupations used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics                  (BLS) during that period.  For technical reasons, it is not                     possible to go back further than 1976 or forward beyond 1983.                   Employment changes in each occupational category in each                        industry will be attributed to industry growth or to                            technological change.  This latter category is broadly defined                  to include two components:  changes in production methods and                   changes in labor inputs induced by changes in salary rates                      across occupations, including other professional occupations.                        This project is highly relevant to PRA's program objective                 of providing useful information about the production and                        employment of scientists and engineers to the director and                      other senior NSF officials.  The 1973-1982 period is of                         particular interest because data compiled by the Division of                    Science Resources Studies indicate that the employment of                       natural scientists and engineers (NS&E's) in NS&E occupations                   rose at the rate of 6% per annum, while total employment in the                 U.S. rose at the much lower rate of 2% per annum.                                    The chief merit of this proposal is its contribution to                    knowledge about the supply-demand balance for natural                           scientists and engineers.***",
