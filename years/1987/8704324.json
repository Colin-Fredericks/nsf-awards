 "awd_abstract_narration": "Positronium is the positron-electron bound state.  The                  structure of positronium is governed almost completely by QED;                  strong and weak corrections are small compared to electrodynamic                effects.  Positromium is also accessible to high precision                      experiments.  Thus positronium is an ideal laboratory for                       studying QED and the bound state formalism in quantum field                     theory.                                                                                 The main quantities of physical interest in positronium are             energy levels and decay rates.  Several energy level splittings                 of n=1 and n=2 states have been measured with uncertainties on                  the order of a few MHz.  Present theoretical evaluations of these               splittings agree with experiment, with terms of order m(alpha)6 =               18.7 MHz still uncalculated.  The n=1 spin-singlet and spin                     triplet decay rates have also been measured.  The spin-triplet                  rate is several standard deviations away from the present                       theoretical value.                                                                      There is an evident need to extend the theoretical                      calculations of energy levels and decay rates in positronium by                 another power of alpha.  It is proposed to calculate some of                    these corrections and to make progress on the calculation of                    others.  In particular it is planned to complete the calculation                of n=1 and n=2 positronium energy levels through order m(alpha)6.               Comparison of experiment and theory at this level will provide a                detailed test of the bound state formalism and of QED.",
