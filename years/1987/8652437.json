 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation (WWNFF) will conduct a        four week summer institute for fifty high school physics teachers each          year (1987-88) on the Princeton University campus.  During the academic         year, each teacher who participates in the institute will conduct               regional workshops for other physics teachers over the nation.  The             WWNFF staff will provide support for teachers conducting regional               workshops.                                                                                                                                                      The goals of this proposal are to engage teachers in the development of         Curriculum materials in cooperation with university faculty, develop            leadership skills, and to design teaching strageties which will                 concentrate on developing students' ability to make use of knowledge            within the discipline and in related disciplines.                                                                                                               During the academic year, the WWNFF will provide support for local and          regional workshops conducted by the summer institute participants.              Funds for these activities will be awarded on a competitive basis.  The         institute staff will assist teachers in the development of regional             projects to ensure that they are designed to be conductive for use in           teachers' classrooms.                                                                                                                                           Also, the WWNFF staff will coordinate request for mini-institutes to be         conducted by the institute participants for precollege mathematics and          science teachers at regional, state, and national meetings.  The                foundation will monitor, coordinate, and disseminate the activities of          this year's participants; and those who were trained in previous                institutes.  These activities will be accomplished by staff visits, a           monthly newsletter, and correspondence between the director and                 participants.",
