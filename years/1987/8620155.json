 "awd_abstract_narration": "Known late Hemphillian (Early Pliocene) terrestrial                     vertebrate sites are rare in Mexico, and apparently, unequivocal                early Hemphillian fossils (Late Miocene) have not yet been                      reported from anywhere in the country (fossils of these ages                    are extremely rare in all Central America).  Outside the area                   of the presently proposed study only three localities of late                   Hemphillian age have been reported:  Tehuichila in the state of                 Hidalgo; La Goleta in the state of Michoacan (which probably                    contains more Blancan than Hemphillian age fossils); and                        Yepomera in the northern state of Chihuahua.  The first two                     sites have not been well documented stratigraphically, although                 the third, and most productive site, has.  It is, however, only                 about 150 miles south of the U.S.-Mexican border.  Inside the                   presently proposed study area, which lies within the east-                      central part of the state of Guanajuato in central Mexico, are                  two reported Hemphillian vertebrate sites.  One, El Ocote, has                  been discussed in several reports; the other, Coecillo, has not                 been well collected or studied.  A third, Rinconada, is newly                   discovered.  The last site contains very abundant, well                         preserved fossils which appear to represent early as well as                    late Hemphillian forms.                                                                 Knowledge of early Hemphillian vertebrates from Central                 America would be important for several reasons.  These include                  a better understanding of the earliest times of dispersals in                   the Late Cenozoic between North and South America, determination                whether dispersals were episodic rather than continual,                         comparison of relatively poorly known Hemphillian faunas in                     Central America with well known ones in the United States, and                  valuable information concerning the origin and diversification                  of a number of mammalian genera and species which appeared                      suddenly in the United States' Great Plains area that probably                  evolved on the Mexican Plateau.  These genera and species                       include such important groups as horses and cricetid rodents.                   Additionally, data gathered during the proposed research would                  provide valuable information on changing climatic and ecologic                  conditions during an important time interval.                                           The major objective of this proposed research is to                     carefully collect fossils and data in a stratigraphic context                   at the Rinconada and Coecillo sites.  Screen washing for                        fossils would be part of the operation.  Fossils would then be                  prepared and studied in order to obtain knowledge relevant to                   the items stated above.",
