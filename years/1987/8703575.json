The study is designed to provide additional information on the          origin of the New York drumlin field, and thereby on glacial mechanics,         by testing alternative hypotheses of drumlin field formation.  This             project is innovative in that the investigators will focus their                analysis on processes thought to occur within advancing ice sheets, on          surface conditions under ice sheets, and on combinations of glacial             mechanics and surface conditions.",
