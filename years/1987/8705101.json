 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this study are to use genetic and                             physiological analyses to investigate the roles of periplasmic                  and membrane proteins encoded by the mer operon of Tn21 in                      mercury transport.  We have previously shown by analysis of                     deletion and frameshift mutations that the merP-encoded                         periplasmic protein and the merT-encoded membrane protein are                   required both for mercury resistance and for mercury-inducible                  mercury uptake.  We will use both oligonucleotide-directed,                     site-specific mutagenesis and localized in vitro hydroxylamine                  mutagenesis to identify specific amino acid residues that are                   involved in mercury binding and mercury resistance.  Molecular                  topology of membrane proteins will be investigated by making                    fusions with alkaline phosphatase, which is active only if                      secreted into the periplasm.  Basic physiological                               characterization of the mercury transport system will include                   investigation of:  sensitivity to osmotic shock, dependence on                  various host function, requirement for sulfhydryl reagents, and                 sensitivity to inhibitors and uncoulers of energy metabolism.",
