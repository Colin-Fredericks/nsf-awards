 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves study of multichannel marine seismic                      profiles to resolve the structural and tectonic history of the                  southern Lesser Antilles arc and adjacent parts of the                          continental margin of South America.  Objectives of the study are               the identification of terrane boundaries based on lateral                       discordance and change in seismic character (amplitude,                         coherency, continuity) and velocity of reflectors, and the                      identification of structures and determination of their timing in               layered sequences based on correlation with wells.  The ultimate                goal is to interpret existing, newly obtained data, leading to an               improved understanding of:  (1) arc-continent interaction                       processes leading to the accretionary growth of continents, and                 (2) the structural and tectonic history of the eastern reach of                 the Caribbean-South American boundary zone.  Two principal                      models have been proposed for the nature of the plate boundary:                 (A) a margin-parallel, east-striking strike-slip boundary with                  large, distributed, right-lateral (easterly) displacement of the                southern Lesser Antilles, and (B) an oblique collision zone with                small easterly displacement of the southern Lesser Antilles.  A                 broad zone of deformation, perhaps hundereds of kilometers wide,                is postulated by both of the plate boundary models.  Because such               a deformation zone is largely submerged, marine seismic profiles                offer the only means besides seismicity and potential field data                to study its structure in the offshore.  The study may permit                   discrimination between the two aforementioned models or lead to                 the development of a new alternative model.",
