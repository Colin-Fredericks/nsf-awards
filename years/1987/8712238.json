 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has two related parts.  The first studies the                      economics of compatibility standards, especially those that                     are set by relatively \"cooperative\" committee processes,                        rather than the market processes typically analyzed in the                      economics literature.  Many standards are set by committee:                     telecommunications offers especially many examples.  The                        second part studies the economics of competition over time in                   markets in which buyers become locked in to the sellers from                    whom they buy.  The analysis includes both the case of no                       long-term contracts, in which a buyers only protection from                     ex-post exploitation is the sellers desire to sell to new                       buyers; and the case of long-term contracts, in which it is                     possible to specify in advance some or all of the features of                   the relationship.                                                               The research is significant for the understanding it will                       give about the standard setting process.  The research adds                     significant elements of realism by making the framework for                     analysis a combination of committee and market outcomes.",
