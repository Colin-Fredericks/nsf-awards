One research thrust focusses on developing a knowledge-based                    consultant                                                                      system to aid in the design of digital VLSI circuits.  This                     research                                                                        involves extending current methods for developing rule-baszed                   expert                                                                          systems, by applying them to design tasks, and by integrating                   rule-                                                                           based methods with algorithmic methods for dealing with different               aspects of the design task.  The second research area, machine                  learning, has focussed on developing the LEX system which learns                problem-solving heuristics by generating and solving practice                   problems.                                                                       This research has led to development of a domain-independent                    technique                                                                       (goal-directed learning) for generalizing from examples.                        Research on                                                                     machine learning over the coming year will include an attempt to                apply                                                                           these techniques to the task of learning rules for VLSI design.",
