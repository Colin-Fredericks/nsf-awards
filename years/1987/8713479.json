 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective and Relevancy: This action supports collaborative research            between Dr. Richard J. Roberts of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long         Island, NY and Dr. Sheikh Riazuddin of the Center of Advanced Molecular         Biology at the University of Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan. The research             will involve production of a wide variety of new restriction enzymes            with new specificities for use in genetic engineering. Attention will           be paid to methods that allow the discovery of enzymes with recognition         sequences longer than 6 nucleotides, since such enzymes which cleave            DNA infrequently are of great value for mapping large genomes such as           human genomes.  The U.S.-Pakistan program supports cooperative research         involving scientists from the two countries where capabilities                  complement each other.  This project meets that criterion well.                                                                                                 Merit: The two scientists are among the most highly regarded in the             field of molecular biology in their respective countries.  They have            collaborated on scientific research in the past with results published          as joint articles in international journals.  This project is likely to         produce publishable results which would benefit others working in the           field.                                                                                                                                                          Funding: The project is being funded under two grants;                            University of Punjab, grant INT-8713479:                                                        FY87: SFC$22,925 (Pakistani Currency)                           Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, grant INT-8713519:                                               FY87: U.S.$20,925 plus SFC$5,000                                                FY88: U.S.$22,181",
