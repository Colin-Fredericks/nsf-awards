 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the project is to develop a computer-managed laboratory          for physiological and experimental psychology.  One such system,                developed in the psychology department, permits the precise programming         of experimental events, the collection of data, and the analysis and            display of results.  It has been used to measure reaction times, GSR,           EMG, heart rate, temperature and EEG.  Because of increasing demands for        time with this system, the psychology department plans to construct             three more, one with enhanced capabilities for state-of-the-art student         research.  This enhanced model will be interfaced with a three-field            projection tachistoscope and four biopotential preamplifiers for                elaborate control of visual events and rapid tracking of evoked EEG             activity across the cortex (among other uses).  The tachistoscope and           amplifiers can be divided to provide for simpler but simultaneous data          collection using all the computers.  This would be ideal for lab                exercises in physiological and experimental psychology.  The versatility        and precision of this lab system should provide varied possibilities for        directed student research, laboratory work in the methodology course,           and classroom demonstrations in introductory psychology.",
