 "awd_abstract_narration": "Late Cretaceous marine deposits of the U.S. Western                     interior afford unparalleled opportunity for study of thoracican                cirripeds, which are far better represented than suggested by                   the published record.  Remains of these organisms have received                 scant attention, partly because of minute specimen size and                     partly because disarticulated skeletal elements bear close                      resemblance to fragments of associated ostreid bivalves.  In                    the study area cirriped remains occur in rocks of wide                          lithologic variety from many stratigraphic horizons, and are                    preserved abundantly in the articulated state.  At key                          localities well.studied stratigraphic sections will be searched                 systematically for cirriped specimens, which will be the basis                  for taxonomic, biostratigraphic, and paleoecologic analysis.                    Common occurrence and local great abundance of fully articulated                thoracican cirripeds in targeted formations is unique among                     Upper Cretaceous stratigraphic sections of the world.  Taxonomic                and biostratigraphic evaluation of such materials will aid                      immensely in expanding scientific knowledge of Late Cretaceous                  cirriped evolution, which is at present very poorly understood.                 Analysis of preservation, abundance, orientation, substrates,                   associated fossils, and accompanying sedimentary structures                     will enable us to evaluate the role of thoracican cirripeds in                  marine communities of the Western Interior Sea.",
