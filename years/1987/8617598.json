 "awd_abstract_narration": "In cross-fostering, the offspring of one genetic stock are reared by            foster parents of a different genetic stock to study the interaction of         genetic and environmental factors in the development of behavior.  From         1966 to 1981, Drs. Beatrix and Allen Gardner recorded the behavioral            development of five chimpanzees that were being reared under human              cross-fostering conditions.  In earlier studies, the human foster-              families spoke English to the infant chimpanzees, none of which learned         more than four words.  What is unique about the Gardners' laboratory was        the use of American Sign Language combined with continuous treatment of         the chimpanzees as children are treated.  Under these conditions, the           chimpanzees Washoe, Moja, Pili, Tatu, and Dar learned to use the signs          of ASL in ways that resemble the early development of human children,           and reached levels far beyond those expected on the basis of earlier            linguistic theory.  Their behavioral development was recorded with a            diary record, systematic samples, controlled experiments, and motion-           picture film and video records.                                                                                                                                 The Gardners' present objective is to transcribe, index, and annotate           the first two years of the diary record of each of these five                   chimpanzees. The record of development that results will be the basis           for comparisons among the four individual chimpanzees that were cross-          fostered from birth (Moja, Pili, Tatu, and Dar), between these                  chimpanzees and one that was introduced into the cross-fostering                environment when she was one year old (Washoe), and between the cross-          fostered chimpanzees and chimpanzees reared in the wild and in                  laboratory cages.                                                                                                                                               Preliminary work on diary transcriptions shows that the planned analyses        are feasible.  First, orderly sequences of development can be described,        since there are consistencies among the cross-fostered chimpanzees in           the order of appearance of behaviors of a given type, such as rolling           over, crawling, sitting alone, and standing unsupported on two feet.            Second, there are individual differences in rate of development; the            most precocious chimpanzee in posture and locomotion was also the most          precocious in manipulative skills and in communication.  And third, many        items of behavior described for young children can be found in the              records of the cross-fostered chimpanzees:  perceptual-motor behaviors,         such as visually directed reaching; attachment behaviors, such as using         the caretaker as a base for exploring; and communicative behaviors, such        as pointing and negative headshakes, as well as the first 50 ASL signs.                                                                                         This research concerns the effects of environmental enrichment on infant        chimpanzees.  The special rearing conditions enable the Gardners to             study, in addition to the development of two-way communication with             signs, such aspects of behavioral development as locomotion,                    observational learning, manipulative skills, and social play.  Since            intellectual, social, and linguistic development are intimately related,        such studies widen and enrich the analysis of the developmental process.        The processes that underlie precocity, retardation, and the ultimate            level of development are of concern to psychologists, biologists, and           anthropologists.",
