 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for Prof. Banerjee under the Foundation's           Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) program.  His research concerns           the problems of wave propagation in nonlinear and dispersive media and          their numerical simulation on computers.  He is also interested in              acousto-optics and optical information processing, including the optical        interconnection problem.                                                                                                                                        The PYI Awards program provides research support to the Nation's most           outstanding and promising young science and engineering faculty.  The           awards are intended to improve the capability of U. S. academic                 institutions to respond to the demand for highly qualified science and          engineering personnel for academic and industrial research and                  engineering.  This PYI has made significant contributions to his field          of engineering and has potential to become a leader in academic research        and education.                                                                  The diary note describes the rigorous selection procedure.  A basic             grant award in the amount $25000 is highly recommended.",
