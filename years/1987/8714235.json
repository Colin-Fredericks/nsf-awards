 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Biological Facilities Center proposal requests funds to                    establish a Microscopy and Imaging Center to meet the research                  needs of investigators in the Life Sciences.  The present                       Electron Microscopy Laboratory will be incorporated into the                    Center, and it will be expanded by adding a high.resolution                     electron microscope and a research quality light microscope.                    Both will have TV cameras connected directly to an image                        processing computer.  The instrumentation will be designed to                   facilitate a number of new and important techniques including the               examination of frozen.hydrated specimens, very low contrast                     specimens, dose.sensitive specimens, \"thick\" sections, and low                  intensity fluorescent specimens.  The on.line computer will offer               image processing software for both light and electron                           microscopical applications.  Other computer operations will                     include 2D gel analysis and 3D molecular modeling.  The                         instruments will benefit six primary users and eighteen secondary               users, representing the Departments of Botany, Biochemistry,                    Microbiology, Veterinary and Animal Sciences, and Zoology, as                   well as two of the neighboring private colleges, Amherst and                    Mount Holyoke.  Collaboration across disciplines are already in                 progress.  A major goal of the Microscopy Center will be to                     foster further collaborative efforts by acting as a focus for the               exchange of ideas and information.  The Center will collect and                 disseminate information on methods through workshops and written                manuals.  The Center staff will keep abreast of developments in                 computer image processing and make them available to users.                     Training courses for beginners, workshops in specialized fields,                and informational seminars by users and visitors will be                        provided.",
