 "awd_abstract_narration": "As is evident from the effects of adding alcohol to aqueous                     solutions of nucleic acids or globular proteins, structures                     of large molecules depend on solvation forces.  A changing                      solvation is also one of the factors that determines the free                   energy changes associated with reactions occurring in water.                    If a correction could be made for differences in free energy                    of solvation between reactants and products one would be left                   with the free energy change for conversion of reactants and                     products in the absence of solvent.  This intrinsic                             equilibrium constant would be interesting from a theoretical                    standpoint and useful in considering changes in the positions                   of chemical equilibria that could occur if reactants were                       removed from water into the vapor phase or into a nonpolar                      environment.  It is also clear that solvent water plays a                       role in the function of biological receptor molecules, most                     spectacularly in the catalytic action of enzymes.                                                                                                               Dr. Wolfenden plans to complete a survey of the solvation by                    water of functional groups that are common to many compounds                    occurring in intermediary metabolic processes and to assess                     the role of solvent water in determining the positions of                       equilibria of oxidation-reduction reactions.  The results                       will be used to analyze the influence of solvation on the                       structures of biopolymers, the affinities of receptors for                      ligands and the positions of equilibrium of metabolic                           processes.",
