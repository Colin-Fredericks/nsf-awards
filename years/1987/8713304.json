 "awd_abstract_narration": "This MRI Planning Grant for one year is to clarify the origin                   of an electrical potential waveform that occurs very early in                   response to an auditory stimulus.  In a whole range of                          vertebrates, there is a characteristic set of electrical                        potentials that characterize the response of the auditory                       system to a sound.  A waveform is present just before the wave                  representing the volley in the auditory nerve, and this early                   wave may reflect the activity at the nerve terminals where they                 receive input from the receptor cells.  The junction between a                  receptor cell and a nerve terminal is a synapse, and this                       early wave may represent an excitatory post-synaptic potential                  (EPSP), which would be the signal that excites the nerve.                                                                                                       This planning grant will support collaboration and training for                 the PI in a laboratory where significant expertise is available                 in this area of auditory physiology.  A brief comparative study                 will be done to try to clarify the nature of this early                         waveform in three different species.  Pharmacological blockage                  studies should reveal information about the origins of the EPSP                 in the peripheral auditory system.                                                                                                                              The study is important to provide a basis for a future project                  to clarify the nature and function of the similar waveform                      found in humans.  The comparative studies here will allow access                to peripheral processes not available for study in humans.",
