 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives and Relevance to Program Objectives:  This recommended award         requests support for travel, per diem, publication, and other minor             expenses for seven Americans to participate in a seminar on wood                technology in Finland.  Professors Carl A. Eckelman, Antti J. Koivo, and        Frederick T. Sparrow of Purdue University have organized the seminar            with Professor Heikki N. Koivo, of Tampere Technical University,                Finland.  The purpose of the seminar is to bring together American and          Finnish researchers on log positioning, defect detection in boards, and         computer aided design and automation in furniture manufacturing.  Wood          processing for furniture manufacture has attracted much research in             Finland and the topic is receiving more attention in the United States.         The seminar will focus on the application of modern technologies, such          as automation, robotics, and the use of computers in furniture                  production.  The seminar speakers will review the latest methods and            issues pertinent to these topics, and the participants will seek                solutions to the problems that are defined.  The seminar, on August 3-7,        1987, will include prepared presentations, visits to modern Finnish             saw-mills and furniture manufacturing plants, and problem-solving               discussions.  Beside the NSF-funded participants, about 5-10 other              Americans from the U.S. furniture manufacturing industry will be invited        to attend.  A similar number of Finnish participants are expected to be         at the seminar.  The conclusions of the seminar will be summarized and          distributed to the scientific community.  The project contributes to an         important objective of NSF's cooperative science programs with Western          Europe, which is to stimulate scientific progress by bringing together          scientists and engineers from the U.S. and Europe who have similar              research interests and who wish to engage in mutually beneficial                research cooperation.                                                                                                                                           Merit of Proposal:  The prospect is good that this proposed seminar will        lead to a significant contribution to engineering knowledge.  The U.S.          participants are respected, productive scientists and engineers.  Their         foreign colleagues in the project are also widely recognized for their          expertise in the topics of the seminar.  The work plan is sound and the         budget is reasonable.  The cooperating scientists and engineers have            complementary expertise and the project is expected to benefit greatly          from their combined efforts.                                                                                                                                    Funding:  This award will not duplicate other funding.  The Academy of          Finland has endorsed the seminar and is providing space for the meetings        and is sponsoring the Finnish participants.  The funding for this award         will come from NSF's Manufacturing Systems Program in the Division of           Science Base Development in Design, Manufacturing, and Computer                 Integrated Engineering.                                                                                                                                         The Division of International Programs will administer the award.",
