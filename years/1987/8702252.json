 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general goal of this research is to understand the                     cellular processes involved in  the activation of B-lymphocytes.                These studies use as a model the murine pre-B like cell line                    70Z/3 which, when stimulated with either Interleukin 1 or gamma                 Interferon, differentiates from surface IgM negative to surface                 IgM positive.  The appearance of IgM on the cell surface                        requires new synthesis of the kappa light chain.  This proposal                 outlines early stages of a program designed to trace the sequence               of events from binding of the activating lymphokines to                         expression of the kappa light chain gene.  It focuses on the                    possible role of changes in cellular ionic content and in                       membrane permeability to ions as mediators of lymphokine action.                Immediate plans include studies of the effects of gamma                         Interferon on intracellular sodium, pH, chloride, calcium, and                  magnesium, on membrane transport of these ions, and on membrane                 potential.  Changes in these parameters have been implicated in                 the mechanisms of action of hormones and growth factors in other                cell types, and results obtained in the 70Z/3 cells will be                     interpreted in the light of available information obtained from                 other systems.                                                                       Although much is being learned about the overall effects of                lymphokines as immunoregulatory hormones very little is yet                     known about the detailed cellular mechanisms of their action.                   This study will examine the role of ions in the cascade of                      intracellular events involved in lymphokine-mediated B                          lymphocyte differentiation.  It should provide important                        information about the mechanism of action of lymphokines and                    enhance our overall understanding of the regulation of the immune               response.",
