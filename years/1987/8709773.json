 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award allows the investigator to do a three month pilot study in           Kenya.  The primary goal is to test a theory of fertility, namely               Caldwell's (1982) wealth flows theory.  This theory posits that people          plan their family size in response to their appreciation of their               economic and social responsibilities, which change with their level of          income and access to superior education and training.  The higher their         income, the better their training/education, the more their                     responsibilities towards family focus upon the nuclear rather than the          extended family, and the less they need to rely upon numerous offspring         to look after them in their old age.  The research hypothesizes that            wealth flows theory will explain the demographic situation among the            Maragoli of Viyalo Sublocation, Western Province, Kenya better than an          alternative model known as the \"economic value of children\" perspective.        The researcher will collect time allocation data and demographic                information to test these hypotheses. The area has been studied by a            Kenyan collaborator since 1975, so this research will build on a                longitudinal data base for this community.                                                                                                                      This research is valuable because improved understanding of the causes          of lowered population growth in the developing world is of critical             importance. This pilot project will yield valuable information towards          that goal.",
