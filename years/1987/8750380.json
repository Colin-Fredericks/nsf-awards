Among          the major new instruments acquired through this award are vertical and          horizontal slab gel and transfer electrophoretic apparati (with their           respective power supplies), a scanning densitometer, transilluminator           and  photodocumentation equipment.  Their purchase is making it possible        for the undergraduate women in these classes to gain experience with            techniques that are central to modern Biology, Biochemistry and                 Molecular Biology, and for the College to continue to provide                   instruction and research experience at a high experimental level.",
