 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses problems in the design and implementation of             interactive program development environments for modern programming             languages.  These environments are specially designed to aid both               novice and experienced programmers in the creation of correct and               reliable programs.  Particular topics to be studied include:                                                                                                    (1) Automatic generation of programming language interpreters from              formal specifications.  Automatic generation of interpreters speeds             their creation and makes them more reliable.  In interactive                    environments, interpreters allow program testing to be intermixed with          program creation and editing.                                                                                                                                   (2) Properties of a program, including variable and type declarations,          can often be inferred from the body of a program.  Such inferencing can         eliminate the tedium of inserting, by hand, redundant information.              Inferencing can also be used to explore the effects of program changes          before they are made.  The automatic selection of alternative library           routines can also be supported.                                                                                                                                 (3) Traditional programming language design techniques are very slow            and error prone.  This project will extend interactive programming              support tools to the realm of language design, supporting interactive           programming language design and evaluation.",
