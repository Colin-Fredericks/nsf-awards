 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for support of research under the Foundation's            Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) Awards program.                                Dr. Youcef-Toumi's research is directed toward the dynamics and            control of high-speed direct-drive manipulators for manufacturing               applications.  The direct-drive manipulator is a robotic arm where              high torque motors are direct coupled to the joint axes of the arm.             The elimination of gearing between the motors and their                         corresponding loads results in an arm that has no backlash, low                 friction and high mechanical stiffness.  All of these                           characteristics are desirable for fast, accurate and versatile                  torque controlled manipulators.  His early research succeeded in                developing a direct-drive arm using high torque brushless motors.               The maximum speed and acceleration achieved were 10 m/sec and 5G                respectively, which are an order of magnitude faster than existing              robots.  Research issues to be addressed under this grant include               the development of control techniques for high performance servoing,            analysis of the arm dynamics, and high speed high-accuracy                      trajectory control using nonlinear feedback/feedforward                         compensations.  Additional research issues to be addressed include              modeling and control systems design, hardware implementation, and               software development for torque/force control applications.                          The objectives of the PYI program are to provide support to the            Nation's most outstanding and promising young science and                       engineering faculty.  The awards are intended to improve the                    capability of U.S. academic institutions to respond to the demand               for highly qualified scientists and engineers for academic and                  industrial research and teaching.  In accordance with those                     objectives, a Presidential Young Investigator Award for Dr. Youcef-             Toumi is recommended.                                                                This is a five-year continuing award.  Annual funding will be              at the base level of $25,000 with a supplement of up to $37,500 to              match industrial support obtained.",
