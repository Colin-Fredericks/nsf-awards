 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 4-H organization of Virginia is developing a Marine and Aquatic             Education Program with a strong field study component for youngsters            ages five through nine.  They plan to reach these young people  through         local and community 4-H clubs and in summer camps.  One part of the             program is aimed at the handicapped and development of strategies to            meet their special needs.  Other components of the program include              volunteer training of high school students and adult leaders and a              series of publications with emphasis on \"hands-on\" activities.  There is        a strong national dissemination plan and, through a national survey, the        Virginia 4-H have determined that 27 state 4-H organizations are                interested in adapting program.                                                                                                                                 The 4-H organization is the largest youth organization in the United            States with a membership of 4.3 million young people.  They have a              strong network, both urban and rural, with minorities representing 22%          of the membership, 53% are female and 63% are under 11 years of age.            The Virginia 4-H mirrors the national picture but with a slightly more          rural membership.                                                                                                                                               This project provides an opportunity to strengthen science                      learning outside of the formal education system by supporting a                 test project in marine education.  Over the next three years the                project will be tested with 38,500 youngsters and 500 adults.                   The program will then be expanded to all 115,467 Virginia members               as well as a strong outreach effort to the national membership.                                                                                                 This project is directed at two important goals for the Informal                Science Education Program:  strengthening out-of-school science                 programs for young people and the handicapped.  The marine                      science area is one of high interest and significance both                      locally and nationally.  The staff are experienced and committed                and the program is cost effective at a little over $3.00 per                    person.",
