 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed investigations will critically analyze the                  binding characteristics of several membrane proteins that complex               with single or ouble stranded cloned DNA inserts, derived from                  the B. subtilis origin of replication.  One 65kD protein that                   binds strongly to two adjacent origin inserts, but not to                       flanking origin regions or non-origin DNA inserts will be                       examined in detail.  The protein will be purified, its membrane                 form confirmed, and a determination will be made of specific                    sequences involved in the protein-DNA binding.  The relationship                of this protein to various dna initiation genes will be assessed                by in vitro complementation analysis using DNA/membrane                         subcomplexes extracted from mutants conditionally defective in                  such dna genes.  The dnaB gene will be of particular interest to                study because it has already been shown to encode a membrane                    protein with affinity for replication origin DNA sites.                         Functional analyses will be done with antibodies against the 65kD               protein, to measure their ability to block replication.                                Although the function of membrane associated DNA binding                 proteins in the process of replication is presently uncertain,                  their importance in the process is established.  The                            results of the novel and rigorous experiments described in this                 proposal are certain to provide important new information on the                sequence of events that occur during chromosome replication.",
