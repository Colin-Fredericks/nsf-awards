 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research of this Presidential Young Investigator is devoted            to advancing the theories of effective information display and                  applying these theories to new areas.  The first area to be studied             is user interfaces for expert systems.  Presently, maintaining the              rules of an expert system as its database is modified and updated is            a difficult and highly resource intensive activity.  With new                   techniques, the user interface could be improved and maintenance                time decreased.                                                                      An ultimate goal of this research is to develop techniques to              translate the rules of expert systems into a higher-level language              that is more compatible with the way that people think.  Prior                  research indicates that humans do not normally manipulate rules when            solving a problem.  Instead, humans seem to have well-practiced                 abilities in the manipulation of spatial information.  These                    manipulations can often be summarized in terms of simple rules.                 Thus, the rules are a byproduct of the information processing                   instead of a direct method of mental manipulation.  So, an expert               system interface which is compatible with human information                     processing might translate the rules into spatial entities to be                manipulated directly by the user.",
