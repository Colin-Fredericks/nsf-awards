 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conventional probability theory has, since the 17th century, been               enormously successful in characterizing chance, uncertainty, and                indeterminate phenomena.  Its success has been so great that there              has been little interest in developing alternatives to the                      conventional position.  Professor Fine has, however, argued                     persuasively that there are considerable advantages to an alternative           approach which he has been investigating under previous NSF support.            The conventional approach, for example, has not worked for a number             of specific cases such as natural language studies, studies of                  individual and group beliefs, and gross measurement errors.  This new           approach which he calls the frequentist theory of lower probability             refers to a probability-like but superadditive set function.  Under             this grant, Professor Fine and his students will continue research on           the structure and the objective frequentist interpretation of lower             probability.                                                                                                                                                    Structural issues include the generation of families of lower                   probabilities that have potential for modeling objective and                    subjective nondeterministic phenomena and a definition of expectation           applicable to the whole class of lower probabilities.  This                     definition of expectation has great potential for development of                ideas of conditioning.                                                                                                                                          Previous interpretations of lower probability have been of the                  subjective epistemic varieties.  Professor Fine's development of an             objective interpretation of a frequentist variety promises to have              significant application to the important but little understood case             of flicker/semiconductor/l/f noise in semiconductors and in quartz              crystal oscillators.",
