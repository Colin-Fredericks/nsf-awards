 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development and practical application of microbial                     pesticides for the control of bacterial and fungal pests has                    been severely limited by the variable efficacy observed in                      field trials.  This project will improve our understanding of                   the molecular basis for an observed biological control                          phenomenon, from both a genetic and ecological perspective.                     The key genetic elements in the biosynthetic pathway of an                      antifungal (Afu) compound, produced by a rhizosphere                            Pseudomonas, have been identified.  The Afu compound is                         potentially a valuable biocontrol agent for pathogens of                        cotton.  Fusion of the regulatory operons involved in the                       synthesis of this antibiotic to strong promoters may create                     root colonizing bacteria that produce the compound in far                       larger amounts than occurs naturally.  Efficacy may also be                     improved by determining the environmental conditions which                      optimize expresion of Afu genes.  The influence of pH, soil                     temperature, moisture, C-N source, cotton cultivar, and                         selective nutrients on antibiotic biosynthesis will be                          ascertained.  These and related efforts in this research will                   make possible the selection and design of biological pesticides                 for possible use in crop management after appropriate testing                   to assure environmental safety.                                                      The investigators have the expertise to assure completion                  of the laboratory aspects of this project.  Facilities at                       Advanced Genetic Sciences, Berkeley, California, are excellent.                 This project does not include field trials; these must await                    approval through regulatory channels.  The Ecology Program                      recommends funding of this Phase II project which stems from a                  Phase I funded via the 1985 SBIR solicitation.",
