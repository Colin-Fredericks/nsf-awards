 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to interpret, adapt and extend        the concepts and techniques associated with certain local and nonlocal          bifurcations so that they become valuable tools for system design,              stability and feedback control mechanisms.  In particular, it will focus        on theoretical issues, applicability to several engineering systems, and        computer-assisted graphics and computations.  Recent results on local           bifurcations, chaos and Arnold diffusion will be employed and further           developed.                                                                              Local bifurcations, chaos and Arnold diffusion constitute an            undesirable form of instability which has to be systematically addressed        in current engineering design and control methodologies.  In particular,        they are not desirable in power systems, Josephson junctions or adaptive        and feedback control systems.  The results of this work could be used as        proper design criteria for wide class of engineering systems.",
