 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Freed plans to continue and expand a program of research                    involving studies of dynamical molecular processes of spin                      probes and free radicals in fluids, on surfaces, and related                    systems.  A variety of experimental ESR relaxation techniques                   are to be employed, and the necessary theoretical frameworks                    for understanding these experiemnts are also to be developed                    and extended.  Specific projects include the following:  (1)                    the further application of new field-swept two-dimensional                      electron-spin-echo techniques in the study of molecular                         dynamics; (2) the further development of new Fourier Transform                  techniques for two-dimensional-ESR studies; (3) studies of                      rotational molecular dynamics in normal and viscous liquids by                  ESR; (4) studies of molecular dynamics on surfaces;  (5) the                    application of high-field far-infrared ESR techniques in the                    study of molecular dynamics.                                                                                                                                    The close coupling between theory and experiment represents an                  important characteristic of Dr. Freed's research.  The                          development of new techniques is expected to open new areas of                  investigation in his field.  His investigations will lead to                    more understanding of the physics of liquids and of molecular                   motions on surfaces.",
