 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical fluxes from the ocean's surface into the deep                  sea vary over the ocean in response to the supply of nutri-                     ents, the availability of light and the dispersion of                           newly-produced material by local turbulence and sinking.                        This study will lead to the construction of global scale                        models, which will integrate biological and chemical com-                       ponents into multi-dimensional ocean circulation models.                        Already developed are a series of component models describing                   the upper ocean ecology, water column transformations, and                      sediment diagenesis, which can be used in circulation models                    of variable complexity.  Two key aspects of upper ocean                         biology that cause chemical fluxes in the ocean to diverge                      from the simplest flux concentrations will be emphasized.                       The first is the presence of unutilized nutrients in high                       latitude surface water.  A hypothetical upper ocean ecosystem                   model based on size-classes of phytoplankton will be used to                    account for the notable differences in nutrient utilization                     observed between oceans.  The second aspect is the production                   of refactory dissolved organic compounds by marine organisms.                   Results from earlier three-dimensional model studies show                       that the regeneration of nutrients from sinking particles                       takes place too high in the water column to account for                         observed distributions of nutrients and fluxes in the ocean.                    Advective and diffusive fluxes of refractory dissolved                          organic compounds appear to be the missing ingredients                          needed to account for the removal of organic carbon  and                        nutrients from the upper ocean to the deep sea.                                         Models such as these, when verified by field data from                  other investigators, will permit understanding and prediction                   of global fluxes of elements such as carbon and nitrogen.",
