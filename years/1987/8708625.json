 "awd_abstract_narration": "Compounds of the metals copper, silver, gold, nickel, palladium                 and platinum are very important catalysts and are becoming                      increasingly important as solids with desirable magnetic or                     electrical properties. This research project, the focus of                      which is the synthesis and characterization of new compounds of                 these metals, is expected to result in new catalysts and                        interesting new solid materials, such as one-dimensional                        conductors. The research may also provide a better                              understanding of the metal-sulfur clusters in enzymes and of                    the way in which gold binds to biological tissues.                                                                                                              The influence of transition metal ions and ligand bonding on                    the structure and reactivity of coordination compounds broadly                  describes this work.  In particular, the focus will be on                       transition metal compounds primarily of the nickel and copper                   triad elements which contain sulfur and ylide ligands.                          Specific studies of importance relate to M-M, C-S, S-S and M-S                  bond formation and rupture, and the properties of the                           transition-metal organometallic species produced.  Structural                   studies using X-ray crystallography form an important part of                   this work. Of special interest in this proposal is the                          development of new understanding concerning the role of a                       second metal center in influencing the oxidative-addition,                      reductive-elimination reaction chemistries at metal centers                     with 8, 9 or 10 d-electrons.  The addition of small molecules                   across the M-M bond also is to be explored.  The new                            heterotrimetallic species containing a linear Au.....Pt.....Au                  arrangement will receive special study due to its oxidation                     properties and linear stacked arrangement in the solid state.",
