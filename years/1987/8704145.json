 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            established to provide support to strengthen the research environments          and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions or                      institutions that have substantial minority student populations.                Eligible institutions must also have graduate programs in science or            programs in engineering.  Funding is provided for faculty research in           fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and for           the acquisition of research instrumentation.  Virginia State                    University will use RIMI support to establish a laser physics research          facility.  The facility will focus on the study of laser-induced                damage mechanisms at semiconductor surfaces and will investigate                defects and deep levels in semiconductors using wavelength modulation           absorption spectroscopy.  In addition, non-equilibriam damage effects           occurring in crystals (metals and semiconductors) in the microsecond            time range which are struck by powerful pulsed laser beams will be              studied using polarized positive muons from the Brookhaven National             Laboratory Alternating Gradient Synchrotron.                                                                                                                    Results from this project should expand the existing knowledge base of          laser-induced damage in semiconductors by the conduct of research on            gallium arsenide and silicon at subthreshold frequencies.  The                  investigators have done research at several national laboratories               (Fermi, Lawrence Livermore) and private sector laboratories (IBM,               General Electric).  The Foundation has supported this project because           minorities will have greater opportunities to participate in                    meritorious laser research.",
