 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to design and evaluate a cost-effective          model program for improving science instruction in all 125 elementary           classrooms of the Cotati-Rohnert Park Unified School District.  Project         MAST will adapt existing effective elementary teaching materials and            methods to meet the curricular objectives established by the school             district in its program to implement a comprehensive and articulated            elementary science program.  This two-year project will devote its first        year training teachers to adapt effective teaching techniques and               materials to the specific objectives identified by the school district          and to produce instructional kits, which will include both physical             teaching materials and teacher instruction and background information.                                                                                          This design and production effort will be carried out by a team of              school district teachers and university specialists in elementary               science education.  Special emphasis will be placed on including many           district teachers in field trials and evaluation of teaching materials          in order to encourage teachers to commit to the project.                                                                                                        The second year of Project MAST will be devoted to inservice training of        all 125 district elementary teachers.  District science mentor teachers         will be responsible for providing four days of training for each teacher        in the use of the instructional kits and for providing support as               required.  The evaluation of the project will include a longitudinal            analysis of the actual classroom use of the instructional units and             analysis of anecdotal evidence concerning the reactions of teachers to          the project.",
