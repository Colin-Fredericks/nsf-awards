 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chromosomes of plant and animal cells are composed of                  DNA, the genetic material, and an equal mass of protein.  These                 chromosomes participate in two major functions:  they are                       replicated precisely preceding cell division, and they serve as                 the template for information (in the form of RNA and ultimately                 protein) used by the cell for metabolism and growth.  One of the                current areas of intense research interest in Cell Biology                      concerns the role and importance of DNA-protein structure in the                processes of replication and information transfer.  This proposal               combines techniques from biochemistry, immunology, electron                     microscopy, and molecular genetics to study chromosome structure                and function.  The experimental system being used in the proposed               research is unique, and particulary well suited for the problems                being studied.  The ciliated protozoan, Euplotes, contains two                  types of nuclei:  the micronucleus, which acts as a storehouse of               germline genetic information, but is metabolically inactive, and                the macronucleus, which contains the active genes of the cell.                  The macronuclear chromosomes are unusual in that they have                      somehow been digested to yield short, linear, gene-sized DNA                    fragments.  This property is of significant importance for an                   analysis of gene expression.  These chromosomes also contain a                  dynamic structure called the replication band that becomes                      especially useful for studying their duplication.",
