 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the area of instrument development.  A two-                  pronged effort in development of a new generation quadruple                     sector mass spectrometer with extraordinary sensitivity and the                 capability for collision iduced dissociation will be conducted in               parallel with a project involving Fourier transform mass                        spectrometry (FTMS).  In the former case the efforts of the                     Midwest Center for Mass Spectrometry will be continued with the                 additional focus of the design, construction, evaluation, and                   application of the new instrument to important problems in                      chemistry and biology.  Research will be conducted on three                     important fronts including: fast atom bombardment and secondary                 ion mass spectrometry for structural elucidation of biomolecules,               collaborative research on difficult problems in the life                        sciences, and chemical studies that require high sensity and/or                 better mass resolution in the observation of collision products.                In addition, ultratrace analysis and ion chemistry studies will                 be continued.  The program in FTMS will focus on model                          development, tool development, and instrumentation development                  directed toward solving significant chemical problems.                          Continuing research will include laser-based methods for FTMS and               further investigation of tandem mass spectrometry approaches by                 FTMS.  Thus, two centrally important areas in mass spectrometry                 will be encompassed in this project.",
