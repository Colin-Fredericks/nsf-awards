 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insightful characterizations of the power of various machine self-              reference principles, both in the context of universal programming              systems and clocked systems, are sought with an eye to determining what         use is self-knowledge (for programs).  It is expected that machine              self-knowledge is useful for machine self-modification (learning).              Characterizations or strong sufficient conditions are sought especially         for those self-reference principles which are algebraically well-               behaved.  Conditions are sought for validity of the principle that, if          there is no self-referential counterexample to a proposition, the               proposition is true.  A rigorous mathematical solution is sought to the         problem of why machine self-reference proofs lay bare an underlying,            simplest reason for the theorems they prove.                                                                                                                                                                                                    In the context of machine learning theory the P.I. is studying the              effects of imposing complexity and succinctness constraints on final            programs and grammars learned, the power of (formal) language learning          machines if they converge on a small, uniformly, bounded, finite number         of grammars, and the relationship of these and other matters to                 separability by sets enumerable by effective procedures which, in               effect, change their \"minds\" finitely often.  The tradeoffs between             complexity of subrecursive text and speed of the inference progress are         being investigated.                                                                                                                                             In relatively small community applying recursion theory in computer             science the P.I. is regarded as a leading figure.",
