 "awd_abstract_narration": "Boron hydride compounds with cage-like structures are of considerable           interest to inorganic chemists because of the unusual chemical bonds            which hold them together.  These cage compounds and derivatives                 thereof prepared by the addition of metals or carbon also show promise          as precursors for the preparation of a wide variety of new materials,           such as thin films and ceramics.  Unfortunately, these compounds have           been extremely expensive due to the lack of efficient methods of                preparation.  A major goal of this project is to use metal catalysts            in more efficient syntheses of these important compounds.                                                                                                       The major focus of this project is the development of new, high yield           synthetic routes for the construction of important polyhedral boron             compounds.  Owing to their unique chemical and physical properties,             these types of compounds have been of great academic and industrial             interest; however, further research in the area has been seriously              inhibited by the lack of general synthetic procedures.  In this                 laboratory the approach to this problem has emphasized the development          of transition metal catalysts, similar to those which are now widely            employed in organic and organometallic chemistry, to activate                   polyhedral boron compounds for reaction.  Previous work from this               laboratory demonstrated that these catalysts can be used to promote a           variety of transformations involving boron hydrides and carboranes,             including:  borane-acetylene additions, borane-olefin coupling,                 dehydroalkyne insertions, dehydrocondensations and cage-growth                  reactions.  Future work will continue investigations of the scope and           mechanisms of these reactions, along with explorations of new types of          catalytic reactions.",
