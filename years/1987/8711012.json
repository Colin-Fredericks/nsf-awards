 "awd_abstract_narration": "The troposphere is presently receiving increasing quantities of             waste products from our continually growing technological society.              The rapid movement of these substances over great distances causes              chemical disturbances to the natural troposphere, not only in urban             areas but on the hemispheric and global scales as well.  Current                issues such as the causes and effects of acidic precipitation,                  possible climate modification as a result of increasing                         concentrations of radiatively active trace gases, and concern that              important nutrient components of the global tropospheric nitrogen and           sulfur cycles are being altered highlight the concern about global              changes to our tropospheric environment.                                            The Commission on Atmospheric Chemistry and Global Pollution                (CACGP) of the International Association of Meteorology and                     Atmospheric Physics (IAMAP) is convinced that a thorough                        understanding of atmospheric chemistry on a wide range of spatial and           temporal scales is essential if impacts of human activities on the              atmospheric environment are to be anticipated and harmful effects               mitigated.  The CACGP especially calls attention to the global                  aspects of this problem, which are estimated to impact all nations of           the world.  The current issues outlined above highlight the concern             about global scales changes to the atmospheric environment.  The                CACGP has therefore strongly urged increased international research             efforts devoted to global atmospheric chemistry.  As part of its                objectives to foster international communication in global                      atmospheric chemistry and to act as a forum for the development of              cooperative international research efforts in this area, CACGP has              sponsored international meetings since 1967.  The CACGP's Sixth                 International Symposium on Atmospheric Chemistry is to be held at               Peterborough, Ontario, Canada the week of August 24-29.  These                  international CACGP symposia are held every four years and have been            generally recognized as the best and most comprehensive international           meetings on atmospheric geochemistry.  This award will provide                  partial travel support for up to 40 U.S. scientists to attend this              symposium.  To select recipients of travel support CACGP will set up            a two-person committee to evaluate the applications received.                   Support of younger scientists will be emphasized.  Only U.S.                    scientists will be eligible.  Decisions will be based on the                    relevance of the individual abstracts to the primary themes and                 objectives of the meetings.",
