 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Jeffrey J. Morrell,                  Department of Forest Products, Oregon State University, to pursue               with Ms. Magdalena Y. Giron, Science Research Specialist, Forest                Products Research and Development Institute, Republic of the                    Philippines, for a period of 24 months, a program of research to                determine the feasibility of using wood fumigants to prolong the                service life of Philippine wood species.  These collaborators will              evaluate the ability of fumigants to migrate through and eliminate              decay fungi in Philippine wood species under controlled laboratory              conditions, determine the effectiveness of fumigants for controlling            fungal and insect infestations of wood products in service, and                 evaluate the ability of fumigants to prevent marine borer attack of             Philippine wood species.                                                                                                                                        Wood, as a material, has several advantages over steel, concrete,               and plastic, among which are its high strength per unit weight,                 ability to withstand heavy loads without complete failure, pleasing             appearance, and low energy requirement for finishing.                           Unfortunately, wood is susceptible to deterioration by a variety of             biological agents such as fungi, insects, and marine borers when                used in adverse environments.  Annual losses in the United States on            the order of $2 billion have been estimated.  Although an estimate              of annual losses in the Philippines is not available, deterioration             of wood in tropical areas generally proceeds at a faster rate than              in temperate regions.  Fumigant treatment would lead to prolonged               wood service life, decreased pressure to cut additional trees, and              increased safety in wooden structures where decay would otherwise               continue to weaken the wood.  Ms. Giron is presently engaged in                 research in the field of the proposal in Dr. Morrell's laboratory               where she is expected to complete requirements for the Ph. D. degree            by December 1987.  They have two publications in press on fumigant              application to control decay in Philippine woods.  This project is              relevant to the objectives of the Science in Developing Countries               Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between                U.S. scientists and engineers and their counterparts in developing              countries through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,                skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of                 mutual benefit.",
