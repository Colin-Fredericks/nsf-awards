 "awd_abstract_narration": "In rapid granular flows, particles interact vigorously with their               neighbors through highly dissipative collisions.  At present, there are         no theories that adequately describe these flows.  This study will              extend methods from the kinetic theory of nonuniform gases to obtain a          complete continuum theory for granular flows of identical, highly               inelastic, smooth spheres.  The theory will consist of balance                  equations that govern the variations of the relevant mean fields and            constitutive relations that measure the rates at which these means are          transferred throughout the flow.  The statistical averaging required to         derive the constitutive theory will be based upon a generalization of           the Maxwellian velocity distribution that applies to systems of highly          inelastic particles.  When it is applied to homogeneous shear flows,            for example, the theory's results will be in excellent agreement with           the corresponding computer simulations.  Methods of statistical                 averaging will be employed to derive boundary conditions for flows of           identical spheres that interact, through highly inelastic collisions,           with bumpy surfaces.  These conditions will complement the general flow         theory by ensuring that the fluxes of the flow properties relevant to           highly inelastic systems are balanced at these boundaries.",
