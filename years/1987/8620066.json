 "awd_abstract_narration": "The synthesis of complex molecules will be facilitated by the further           development of a computer program named SYNGEN which will be supported          by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program.  This will aid the         chemist in the design of new efficient routes to the increasingly               complex molecules required by the advances in medicine, biology and             agriculture.                                                                                                                                                    The first version of a computer program (SYNGEN) embodies logic for             synthesis design, yielding only shortest, construction-only sequences           from real starting materials, without resorting to yield prediction or          a database library.  This initial version is successful within its              narrow constraints and establishes the validity of the approach.  The           program will be refined and amplified into a fully practical tool for           organic chemists to use to generate viable synthesis pathways.  To this         end, the program will be exported for trial use to assess its                   shortcomings.  It is also intended to incorporate some refunctional-            izations both by a forward-synthesis program and by a more abstract             functionality description in the retrosynthetic direction, to allow new         dissection modes for tight polycyclics, to prune output via                     incompatible functionality recognition, to amplify hetero-atom and              heterocyclic chemistry, to connect a reference library of reactions,            and to explore stereochemistry, fragmentations and rearrangements.              Beyond the main synthesis program, tools will be developed for the              areas of substructure search, reaction cataloguing, and isomer genera-          tion.",
