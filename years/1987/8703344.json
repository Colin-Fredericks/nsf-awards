The program is designed to enable            U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research         institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well          as Japan, Australia and New Zealand.  Exchange awards provide                   opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of          unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental                  conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                                                Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to             his/her field of science, the prospective potential of the applicants           for professional growth, as well as criteria relevant to the furthering         of international cooperation in science and engineering.  The program           is particularly directed to scientists and engineers who are embarking          on their research careers.                                                                                                                                      This research project addresses applications of stochastic processes to         problems in differential geometry.  The first area of discussion is the         use of Brownian motion to prove vanishing theorems for harmonic forms           on complete manifolds, as in earlier work of K. D. Elworthy and the             proposer.  The second area is the use of Brownian motion techniques to          prove index theorems on noncompact manifolds.                                                                                                                   The project is under the direction of Dr. Steven Rosenberg, Department          of Mathematics, Boston University, Boston, MA  02215, U.S.A., and               Professor K. D. Elworthy, Mathematics Institute, University of Warwick,         Coventry CV4 7AL, United Kingdom.                                                                                                                               This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,              international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents                  allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat            administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
