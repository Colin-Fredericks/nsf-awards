 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fertility is declining in some groups in the southern Indian               state of Kerala.  Reasons for this decline are unknown.  The                    student will test hypotheses that the differences in fertility                  are due to kinship type, family type, the status of women,                      education and employment, and the amount of social control by                   women in specific groups.  Specifically she will determine if                   materlineal castes are those experiencing decline rather than                   patrilineal castes and religious groups.  This study will tell us               much about the social aspect of fertility.                                           This research project has important ramificaitions for                     population control in India and may help explain the differential               decline in southern versus northern India.  There has been a                    noted difference in the sucess of population planning programs in               different parts of India and this study will help us understand                 whether this is due to variations in kinship and family systems.                The results will help guide India's efforts to develop socially                 acceptable population policies.",
