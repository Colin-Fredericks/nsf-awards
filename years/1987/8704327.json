 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of seven U.S.                         mathematicians in a conference sponsored by the Colombian                       Mathematics Society (SCM) to be held in late July, 1987 at the                  National University of Colombia, Bogota.  The two purposes of the               conference will be to (1) identify topics and priorities for                    cooperative research in differential equations between the U.S.                 and Colombian participants, and (2) discuss the curriculum for the              proposed doctoral program in mathematics at the University.                                                                                                     Dr. William R. Derrick, University of Montana, and several other                United States mathematicians participated in the organization of                the conference with Dr. Jaime C. Lesmes, President of SCM and                   several other Colombians.  Dr. Derrick and the United States                    participants have a successful history of research collaboration                with Latin American mathematicians.  The conference will consist                of three parts:  (1) a plenary session to discuss the current                   state and future course of graduate studies in mathematics in                   Colombia, (2) invited addresses on topics of mathematical                       research, and (3) research workshops on mathematical analysis.                  The conference enables the United States mathematicians to develop              research questions and contacts with domestic and foreign                       colleagues, and it provides the Colombians with expert advice in                developing their first doctoral program in mathematics.  The                    research papers from the conference will be published in the                    \"Boletin de Matematicas\", an international journal published by                 the SCM.",
