 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. William E. Holben and James M. Tiedje of Michigan                  State University propose taking a molecular approach to                         understanding gene ecology and exchange under an applied                        selection pressure -xenobiotic chemicals in the environment.                            Past research in microbial ecology has provided virtually               no information on genetic changes of microbial populations in                   soil.  This omission is particularly apparent, not that the                     issue of release of genetically engineered microorganisms has                   raised questions for which little data exists to underpin                       interpretations of risk.  To study such change, an effective                    and ecologically sensible selection that can be followed at the                 DNA level is needed.                                                                    The investigators have chosen the biodegradtion of a new                energy resource -- herbicides -- as the system of study.  They                  proposed to test the hypothesis that the native and soil                        microbial population is not genetically optimized for use of a                  new energy resource when first introduced, but that after                       repeated exposure, genetic changes will be selected that                        enhance the ability of populations to use these chemicals.  By                  using gene-specific probes, DNA restriction analysis,                           hybridization and related molecular methods, they can                           distinguish among the five most likely genetic responses:  (i)                  regulatory changes resulting in altered gene expression; (ii) a                 mutation which results in a new metabolic activity; (iii)                       rearrangement or amplification of genetic information; (iv)                     transfer of genetic information to similar organisms; (v)                       transfer of genetic information to dissimilatory organisms.                     While there is little doubt that these types of genetic changes                 that occur in the laboratory, there is little information on                    which are to prevalent changes that occur in nature, at what                    frequency and under what conditions. To provide this                            information, they propose to study these changes using                          chemostats, soil microcosms, field studies and a retrospective                  analysis of populations after 20 years of agrochemical                          treatment.  This continuum of approaches should allow them to                   extrapolate information on mechanism and frequency between                      laboratory and field.  Information on the latter is entirely                    lacking.                                                                                This is extremely timely and much needed research by                    several groups in the scientific community (e.g., regulatory                    agencies) as well as by an industry struggling to make \"safe\"                   new organisms and their products by genetic manipulation.                               The investigators and their organization are world                      renowened for their expertise in this field.",
