 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are:  (1) to determine the sites                 for propylene adsorption and activation on cuprous oxide (Cu20)                 surfaces, (2) to determine the degree of charge transfer between                the catalyst and the adsorbed intermediate, (3) to determine if                 the promotion effect of methyl bromide is due to a chemical                     effect or a \"macroscopic\" electrical effect associated with Fermi               level pinning on this semiconducting catalyst surface, and (4) to               study the reaction kinetics under realistic (one atmosphere)                    reaction conditions to test the usefulness of a metal-oxide                     single crystal as a model catalyst.  The work will combine                      ultrahigh-vacuum surface science techniques with high pressure                  reaction measurements.  Low energy electron diffraction (LEED),                 x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ion scattering                       spectroscopy (ISS) will be used to determine the site for                       propylene activation.  Four-point probe conductivity measurements               will be used to determine the partial charge on the reaction                    intermediates and to study the behavior of the catalyst Fermi                   level in the presence of methyl bromide.  A combined high                       pressure reaction cell/UHV surface analysis system will be used                 to characterize the reaction kinetics of the system and to                      perform post-reaction analysis on the surface.  The work is aimed               at resolving questions about the nature of the reaction mechanism               and intermediates.                                                                                                                                              Besides being an important industrial reaction in its own right,                this system may serve as a model for other allylic oxidations of                olefins.",
