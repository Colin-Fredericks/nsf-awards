 "awd_abstract_narration": "Moth sex pheromone communication systems are an important factor in             effecting species reproductive specificity in the field, and they have          been utilized in pest management programs to monitor and suppress               certain pest species.  Research in the present proposal will                    investigate different biochemical routes that are used by female moths          to produce the unique chemical blends of pheromones used by each                species.  A comparison of biosynthetic routes used by primitive species         found in New Zealand to those used by species in North America will be          carried out to obtain information on the evolution of these enzyme              systems.                                                                                                                                                        Key enzymes, particularly a unique desaturase, used in these                    biochemical pathways will be characterized and compared among species.          Concurrent with these characterizations will be a study of the mRNA's           that encode for those unique enzymes.  The long-term goal of this               effort will be to identify the genes and the regulation of the                  expression of the genes involved in the production of the sex pheromone         compounds.  At some later date, the techniques may be available to              insert these genes in agricultural crops as a means for developing              novel insect control programs.",
