 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new facility will be established at Northwestern with very low                temperature and high resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)                capability to serve a group of four primary researchers.  This                  includes quantum liquids experiments principally on superfluid                  Helium three (3He) and on highly polarized liquid 3He.  Experi-                 ments on very low temperature properties of a family of highly                  one-dimensional materials will be carried out.  These will                      involve magnetic and NMR experiments on copper and nickel                       thalocyonines and their alloys. Experiments are planned to                      investigate anisotropic polymeric electrical conductors.  The                   electronic conduction mechanisms and the degree of molecular                    anistropy in mixtures of phthalocyanine compounds and Kevlar will               be investigated by NMR methods at low temperatures.  Development                of 3He NMR methods for quantitative non-destructive evaluation of               pore structures is planned.  These methods, will be applied to                  problems involving charaterization of the densification process                 for ultra-rapid sintering of ceramics; diffusion measurements                   and characterization of widely dispersed pore spaces in                         sandstones, and studies of model porous materials.                                                                                                              This facility will significantly enhance the research of the                    principal investigator and his collaborators who are highly                     regarded by their peers.",
