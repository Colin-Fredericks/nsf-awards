 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research addresses the development of capacitive              proximity sensor arrays that can detect geometric features of interest          such as edges of surfaces, locations of holes, spatial angles of                workpieces relative to an end-effector, and distance between end-               effectors and workpiece, while avoiding the extensive computing                 requirements and other problems typically associated with machine vision        systems.                                                                             The project will also explore the use of this technique in a fully         automated surface-quality transducer system which will allow the                quantitative determination and characterization of surface profiles and         defects on technical surfaces, independent of the optical and magnetic          properties of the surface.  The transducer will be capable of                   quantitatively determining local and average surface roughness as well          as depth and size of surface flaws.                                                  The sensor consists of a thin short lead embedded in a hard ceramic        substrate, and is therefore rugged and can, due to its small size, be           configured to almost any desired shape in order to examine hard-to-reach        surfaces.",
