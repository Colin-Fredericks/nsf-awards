 "awd_abstract_narration": "On August 21, 1986 Lake Nyos in Cameroon erupted a cloud of             carbon dioxide gas which killed over 1,700 people.  Immediately                 thereafter scientific teams from several countries including the U.S.           visited the scene to assist the Cameroon government in determining the          scientific causes for this disaster.  At that time, the American team           took baseline measurements of Lake Nyos and some other lakes in the             area, collected samples and learned as much as they could about the             general geology.  At present, however, it is not clear whether the              carbon dioxide resided in the lake for some time or simply passed               through on its way from a volcanic source; the mechanism of eruption is         not yet clear.  In order to fully understand these issues, measurements         over time are necessary and this award will allow members of the                American team to take additional measurements in the Spring of 1987.            John Lockwood, the co-leader of the American team will spend an                 additional two weeks in the field following a meeting called by the             Cameroon government in March, to which his way will be paid.  George            Kling and William Evans will go to Cameroon a month later to do follow-         up measurements on Lake Nyos and several similar volcanic lakes.",
