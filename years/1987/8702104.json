 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stadler proposes to study the rate at which reccessive                     lethal mutations arise in neurospora.  Neurospora is an ideal                   organism for this type of investigation since it is coencytic                   (i.e., multinucleate).  Previous studies that used a variety of                 other organisms have suffered from the appearance of rare                       variants that outgrow other members of the culture and thus make                it difficult to establish true growth and mutation rates.  The                  presence of the lethal mutations can be detected by screening the               offspring of uninucleate asexual spores (conidia).  The use of                  appropriately marked laboratory stains will facilitate the                      somewhat tedious process of screening.  He will also examine                    mutations that give rise to drug resistance, which can be                       detected by selective techniques.  For the latter, wild isolates                of the fungus can be used.  Stadler hopes that some of these drug               resistance mutations will result from insertion of a transposable               element, and has devised an appropriate scheme to recover the                   element if observed.                                                                 There are a variety of known causes for heritable                          alterations (mutations) in the genomes of all organisms.  These                 include errors committed during the replication of normal DNA, as               well as damage resulting from exposure to chemicals (natural and                man-made) and radiation.  In the last few years, a great deal has               been learned about the effects of exposure to relatively high                   levels of chemicals and radiation.  However, the extrapolation of               this data to form conclusions about the effects of exposure to                  the low levels likely to be encountered under natural conditions                has been a subject of considerable controversy.  The proposed                   work, by providing information about rates of spontaneous                       mutation will help to remedy this situation, and may help to                    evaluate the relative importance of the natural causes of                       mutation mentioned above.",
