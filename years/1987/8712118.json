 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemistry of aromatic compounds represents one of the oldest                areas of organic chemistry.  Dr. Hart's recent work has revealed                a new facet of this field, the ability to design aromatic                       compounds that will form solid state complexes with special                     classes of compounds.  This project is in the Organic and                       Macromolecular Chemistry Program.                                                                                                                               Two separate research areas will be investigated.  Each is a                    continuation and extension of research currently supported by NSF               CHE-8319578.                                                                                                                                                    The first area involves new synthetic uses of diarynes or their                 equivalents.  A new, efficient method for constructing linear                   acenes (compounds with an odd or even number of linearly fused                  six-membered rings) and their oxygenated analogs will be                        developed.  The method relies on cycloadditions to novel reactive               intermediates, bis-isobenzofurans or their equivalents.  Trapping               of the intermediates, which represent new 14pi or 18pi electron                 aromatic systems, will be attempted.  Diaryne equivalents will                  also be used to construct novel iptycenes, a class of compounds                 with rigid, three-dimensional carbon frameworks containing                      hydrophobic intramolecular cavities capable of binding small                    molecules.                                                                                                                                                      The second area involves new host designs for crystalline                       molecular complexes.  Based on a design that features a fairly                  long, rigid molecular axis with rigid spacer groups at each end,                N,N'-ditritylurea (DTU) was developed as an exceptionally                       effective host.  X-ray structures of many DTU and DTU-related                   complexes will be determined, to define the geometric                           requirements of such hosts.  Emphasis will be placed on                         developing chiral hosts, and on the separation of various                       structural and stereoisomers.",
