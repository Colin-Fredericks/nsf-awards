 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program was                  established in FY 1987 to provide substantial resources to upgrade the          research capabilities of the strongest and most productive                      predominantly minority institutions.  This planning grant project lays          the foundation for a plan that will increase the institution's quality          of research and research-related training.  Specifically, support for           this project will permit the establishment of an MRCE advisory                  committee of scientists and engineers, local leaders, and industrial            representatives who will assist the institution in evaluating its               current and future potential for performing meritorious research                during the next five years.  The University of Maryland - Eastern               Shore will evaluate its marine science area with the goal of                    establishing a minority-based program in this field.                                                                                                            This institution has the facilities and personnel to initate plans to           study the feasibility of becoming a Minority Research Center of                 Excellence in the marine sciences.  The Foundation has supported this           project since minorities are grossly underrepresented in the marine             sciences and this planning project can help overcome this problem.",
