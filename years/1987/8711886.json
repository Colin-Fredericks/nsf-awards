 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemically-reacting systems tend to organize themselves in              space and time, unless the usual agents of mass and energy                      transfer among volume elements (e.g. diffusion, convection,                     radiation) are suppressed.  An instance simple enough to be                     fruitfully tractable in both theory and experiment has come to                  light in an aqueous isothermal reaction system internally coupled               by molecular diffusion alone.  Mathematical analysis, computer                  simulation, and chemical experiments have revealed the existence                of mm-scale \"organizing centers\" in such excitable reaction                     systems.  Dr. Winfree plans to study the anatomy and behavior of                such organizing centers experimentally and by computer                          simulation.                                                                             Such systems are of interest not only to physical chemists,             engineers, and mathematicians, but also to biophysicists studying               the activity patterns in neuromuscular tissue, i.e.                             fibrillations, cardiac rhythms and arrhythmias, and epileptic                   seizures.  For example, recent experimental tests of Dr.                        Winfree's proposition that the newly discovered three-dimensional               waves in reaction-diffusion media should also be observed in                    heart muscle, where the equations are practically the same even                 though the underlying physics is quite different, indicate that                 the proposition is sound.  These results are of immediate                       practical interest to cardiologists.",
