 "awd_abstract_narration": "A NASA Spacelab flight instrument is available for ground               based observations for a period of a year owing to the delays in                flight schedules caused by the Challenger accident.  It is                      proposed to operate this highly sophisticated set of                            spectrographs with intensified CCD detectors at McDonald                        Observatory until June 1988, to obtain spectra of upper                         atmosphere emissions in twilight.  The spectra would be used in                 the inversion of a thermospheric photochemistry model in an                     attempt to deduce changes in the composition and temperature of                 the thermosphere on a day to day basis, in conformity with a                    CEDAR project.                                                                          The thermospheric composition and temperature change in                 response to auroral zone energy inputs which propagate over the                 globe, and to changing solar ultraviolet fluxes on a seasonal and               solar cycle basis. Currently the composition changes can only be                determined by in-situ spacecraft observations. The PI has both                  the observational and the theoretical background to make full use               of the data once obtained, and to provide input to the aeronomy                 community. They will then be able to design the optimum observing               program and instrumental configuration for CEDAR to determine                   atmospheric composition changes in coordinated multistation                     campaigns.",
