 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives and Relevance to Program Objectives:  This recommended award         would support a three-year cooperative research project in mathematics          between Professor Gerd Faltings, Department of Mathematics, Princeton           University, and Professor Gisbert Wuestholz, University of Wuppertal,           Federal Republic of Germany.  The mathematicians are collaborating in           the area of arithmetic algebraic geometry, a subject particularly               concerned with the number of solutions of algebraic equations in several        variables when the solutions are restricted to a finite field.  Topics          of joint research are: (1)questions of effectivity for diophantine              problems (classical diophantine equations are polynomial equations for          which the unknowns are to be rational numbers), (2)the                          Shafarevich-conjecture for algebraic surfaces, (3)variations of                 Hodge-structures and periods, and (4)integer points on abelian                  varieties.  These are topics of extreme interest and profundity in              mathematics.  Professor Faltings has made important contributions to the        field of arithmetic algebraic geometry and is internationally acclaimed         for his accomplishments.  Professor Wuestholz is a world expert in the          techniques necessary to obtain effective results in this area of                mathematics.  The collaboration of these two investigators is expected          to be an extremely productive one.  The project thus contributes to an          important objective of NSF's cooperative science programs with Western          Europe, which is to stimulate scientific progress by bringing together          scientists from the U.S. and Europe who have similar research interests         and who wish to engage in mutually beneficial research cooperation.             Funds from this award would support necessary transportation and partial        subsistence expenses for the U.S. principal investigator.                                                                                                       Merit of Proposal:  There is an excellent prospect that this proposed           research will lead to a significant contribution to scientific                  knowledge.  The U.S. principal investigator is a highly respected,              productive mathematician.  The foreign researcher with whom he will             cooperate in the project is also an internationally known expert in this        field.  Previous collaboration between Professors Faltings and Wuestholz        has been productive, and the likelihood of additional mutual benefit            from a continuation of the joint effort is high.                                                                                                                Funding:  This award will not duplicate other funding.  The principal           investigator receives project support from NSF's Division of                    Mathematical Sciences, Grant No. DMS-8502316.  This recommended INT             award would fund the addition of an important international dimension to        that research project.",
