 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economic theory, whether we like it or not, affects the way                     individuals, businesses, local and state governments, and nations               behave.  Improvement in economic knowledge will help to ameliorate              human welfare and help to control and reliably predict the economic             consequences of economic, political and social changes.  Given the              increasing importance of economics, it becomes increasingly necessary           as well that we should more closely examine the philosophical                   foundations of economics, that is, such issues as testability,                  progress, unrealistic assumptions, ideal models and the nature of               rationality.  In 1976, Dr. Rosenberg published what has been called a           \"watershed\" study of these issues.  In the ensuing 10 years, Dr.                Rosenberg has immersed himself in these issues and has in fact led              the criticism of several of the views originally defended in that               study.  Under this grant, Dr. Rosenberg will further study the                  ballooning literature in the philosophical foundations of economics             and developments in economic theory itself in order to synthesize his           own work and to assess and incorporate the important contributions of           others to this subject.  The resulting study on the nature of                   economic theory will examine alternate approaches to the philosophy             of economics, especially the rhetorical approach, examine what the              nature of progress is in economics, the function of economic theory,            the meaning and uses of the explanatory variables \"expectation\" and             \"preference,\" economic theory as applied mathematics, neoclassical              \"dissidents\" and their assumptions, and adaptationalism in economics.           These studies promise to be most provocative and of great interest to           economics and philosophy of science alike.",
