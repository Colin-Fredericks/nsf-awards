 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Summary:  The objective of this project is to                          determine the fundamental mechanisms governing the transport of                 binary and ternary mixtures of oleic and linoleic acids and                     their methyl esters into supercritical carbon dioxide using a                   specially designed wetted wall column.  Phase equilibria of the                 biomaterials will be measured using previously developed                        apparatuses designed for this purpose.  The gas and liquid film                 mass transfer coefficients will be calculated as a function of                  temperature and pressure.  The applicability of existing                        correlations for mass transfer to conditions above the critical                 point of the pure solvent will be tested.  An attempt will be                   made to generalize the theory of mass transfer of large bio-                    molecules into supercritical solvents and in expanded liquid                    mixtures.                                                                                                                                                       Innovation/Novelty:  The proposed work will be the first                        rigorous attempt to measure supercritical fluid-fluid mass                      transfer parameters under carefully defined conditions.   In wetted             wall columns, no bubbles form or coalesce, no froth forms and mass              transfer area can be controlled.  Moreover, models simulating the               behavior of wetted wall columns are currently at a high stage of                sophistication, thereby giving a sound theoretical framework to                 correlate the data.  Although the use of wetted wall columns at low             pressure in gas absorption/stripping and liquid-liquid extraction is            widespread and its utility in obtaining fundamental data is widely              recognized, this would be the first effort to construct a workable              wetted wall column for use with supercritical solvents at pressures             up to 350 atmospheres.                                                                                                                                          Technical and Practical Significance:  In addition to the                       inherent value of the phase equilibrium data for characterizing                 the behavior of biomaterials in supercritical solvents, the                     proposed research will yield high quality data for mass transfer                coefficients through known interfacial mass transfer area.  The                 functionality of mass transfer coefficients with pressure and                   temperature can then be profitably used on a theoretical as                     well as practical level as a guide in determining mass transfer                 rates and optimal operating conditions for supercritical fluids                 in packed, tray and bubble columns.",
