 "awd_abstract_narration": "The government sector in the United States has grown significantly              in the last fifty years, with much of the growth coming in the area             of social welfare programs.  In 1960, the government accounted for              30% of the goods and services produced in the U.S., while in 1932, it           accounted for only 21%.  This growth has been explained by theories             based on the power of pressure groups, coalitions and bureaucracies.            But these theories account more for the forces promoting rapid growth           than the timing of that growth.                                                                                                                                 The contribution of this project comes from studying the way in which           growth of government can be restrained by powerful sectors of the               economy that resist modernization.  More specifically, the project              shows how welfare programs were delayed in the South in the 1930s by            Southern agricultural planters in order to keep labor costs low and             how this resistance to federal welfare programs declined after World            War II due to the mechanization of agriculture.                                                                                                                 Planters provided their agricultural workers with a wide array of               paternalistic benefits in lieu of some monetary compensation.  These            benefits were used to elicit from workers both loyalty and a measure            of deference which kept the costs of agricultural labor low and                 maintained the South's existing socio-economic system.  Federal                 welfare programs made tying workers to specific plantations more                expensive.  With mechanization, planters no longer needed to tie workers        to their plantation because of the dramatic reduction in labor demand.",
