 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will extend concepts and theory on three trophic                  level interactions.  The central theme is that the dynamics of                  modular plant parts, the shoots, defines plant architecture, and                in a predictable way, the dynamics of herbivores and their                      enemies in space and time.  Plant architecture of the arroyo                    willow, Salix lasiolepis, defines resources for the herbivore,                  shoot-galling sawfly Euura lasiolepis, because the metamere, or                 internode, is the resource utilized, and those on the longest                   shoots have the highest probability of attack by sawflies.  In                  turn, metamere quality defines gall characters that influence                   access to the herbivore by the third trophic level.  Thus,                      studying the population dynamics of plant modules is basic to                   understanding the dynamics of this herbivore, and its interaction               with enemies.                                                                           This research addresses four major questions:  1. how willow            clones grow and display resources through space and time; 2. how                sawflies respond to these displays; 3. how sawflies influence                   displays of resources; and 4. How resources influence the                       herbivore-enemy interaction.  These questions are approached by                 describing conditions in wild clones and using field experiments                with potted clones to understand better the mechanistic dynamics                of the system.  Plant/animal interactions is a major area of                    ecological research which provides the information base for                     biological control strategies in agriculture.",
