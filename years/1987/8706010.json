 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is being awarded under the Materials Chemistry                    Initiative; the research program is at the interface between                    chemistry and materials science.  New types of organic/inorganic                materials will be developed by embedding organic or                             organometallic molecules in an inorganic matrix.  This program                  has two fundamental goals, one of which is materials science                    oriented, the other of which is chemically oriented.  The first                 goal involves characterization of the gel and gel-glass.  The                   technical objective here is to use various organic and                          organometallic molecules to characterize certain aspects of the                 sol-gel process and to determine the conditions which the matrix                imposes on the embedded molecules.  Spectroscopic studies on the                topics of site polarity, pressure effects and site symmetry are                 likely to provide significant information regarding the chemical                and structural changes which occur during sol-gel processing.                   The second goal is to study the fundamental photochemistry and                  spectroscopy of the molecules in the sol-gel glass matrix.  These               investigations will be the first of their kind.  In most cases                  the selected molecules are those which cannot be studied easily,                if at all, in standard organic glasses.                                                                                                                         The results of the research are expected to be significant both                 scientifically and technologically.  There will be investigations               of several photochemical issues which are of fundamental                        importance and the understanding of the sol-gel materials and                   their processing will be improved.  There are also plans to                     explore the possibility of creating new materials with                          interesting properties in the areas of photochromism, optical                   switching, ferroelectricity and optical read/write phenomena.",
