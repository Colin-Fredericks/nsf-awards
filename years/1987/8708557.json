 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paleozoic metamorphism and deformation in the southern and central New          England Appalachians was complex and polyphaze, and attempts to separate        and accurately date tectonic episodes has been difficult.  Recent               determinations of diffision rates of cations in several common minerals         allow a mineral dating method to resolve between protracted slow cooling        and discrete later tectonic events in this structurally complex region.         The study will obtain Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic data on coexisting               minerals in high grade metaigneous gneisses and amphibolites in order to        determine the time of last recrystallization or initiation of cooling           following high temperature metamorphism.  Detailed analyses employing           internal and external comparisons and mass balance considerations will          permit stringent evaluation of the technique, which is quite general and        potentially applicable to many other orogenic terranes.  The results of         this study will allow features of middle Paleozoic and late Paleozoic           orgination to be separated, yielding a clearer understanding of major           culminating events in the tectonic development of the northern                  Appalachians and a improved information base for the constructure of            thermal models.",
