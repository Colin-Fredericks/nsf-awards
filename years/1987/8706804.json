 "awd_abstract_narration": "Saline brines in South Texas are now known to exhibit wide                 ranges in salinity, ionic and isotopic composition.  Some                       formation waters are hypothesized to form in shale-rich sections                as water is released by the transformation of smectite to illite,               and acetic acid is generated from kerogen.  Very saline brines are              clearly derived from underlying formations.  In one growth fault                zone it its hypothesized that elevated geothermal gradients are                 due to a vertical flux of brine from deeper in the basin.  Some                 brines bear evidence of interaction with basement rocks which                   underly the Mesozoic-Cenozoic sequence.                                              This project seeks to test these various hypotheses by                     carefully and systematically characterizing the major element,                  and isotopic composition of brines from producing oil and gas                   fields in a 14-county wide area.  Spatial variability and                       relation to structure are critical variables interpreting the                   ultimate origin of the formation waters, and their role in                      effecting diagenesis.  Brine sampling has proceeded beyond the                  \"reconnaissance\" stage in this area (Morton and Land, 1987), and                now should be restricted to manageably small areas known to                     exhibit significant problems which can be addressed by future                   \"saturation\" sampling.  This project will have significant bearing              in our understanding of ore genesis, burial diagenesis, fluid                   behavior, petroleum generation and sedimentary geochemistry in a                region close to DOSECC deep-drilling operations.",
