 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main aim of the project is to conduct computational investigations          of intelligent tutoring tools, in coordination with empirical studies           both in the field and laboratory.                                                                                                                               The main computational goals are to expand the pedagogical expertise            of an algebra tutor, and to investigate tutoring tools that can help            students learn new kinds of algebra skills in novel learning                    situations.  In developing the current algebra tutor, we discovered             that little research precisely describes teaching tactics and                   strategies.  Our pedagogical enhancements to the algebra tutor attempt          to formalize such knowledge, and to provide a computational framework           for testing representations of pedagogical policies.                                                                                                            In addition to developing pedagogical enhancements, several algebra             tools or environments will be constructed.  Each tool will be designed          to help students learn skills that are not taught in the traditional            algebra curriculum, including higher-level problem solving skills, and          skills in problem finding and formulation.  The tools will also allow           students to learn using regimes other than traditional drill-and-               practice. They provide a situated problem solving environment that              embeds mathematical reasoning in a meaningful context.                                                                                                          Empirical studies will be conducted in both field and lab settings.             Continuing field-based research in the local high school will carry             out relatively formal studies of facets of the tutor and the algebra            tools, while the lab studies will test software at a much more                  formative stage.",
