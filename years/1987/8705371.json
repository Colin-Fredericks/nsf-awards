 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Daniel Engstrom and Herbert Wright of the University of            Minnesota propose a study of lake ecology following the glacial                 recession of 10,000 years ago in Glacier Bay, Alaska.                                    This investigation will explore the earliest stages of lake            development in relation to primary succession in vegetation and                 soils along a 120-year deglaciation chronosequence.  Emphasis                   will be placed on changes in water chemistry, primary production                and phytoplankton composition, and the influence of catchment                   geology and hydrology in regulating material flow from watershed                to lake.  The problem of early lake ontogeny will be attacked                   with two complementary research strategies.  (1) Limnological                   conditions will be compared among lakes of known age and in                     different stages of primary catchment succession, and (2)                       sediment cores from these same trends in pH, alkalinity, and                    algal composition at individual sites.  Several hypotheses                      concerning early postglacial land/water interactions will be                    tested, including (a) the progressive leaching of catchment soils               makes lakes more acidic over time, (b) hydrologic and geologic                  differences among sites act to control the rates and direction of               limnological change, (c) increased nutrient flux associated with                early soil formation result in an initial increase in lake                      productivity, and (4) peat growth and regional paludification                   impede internal soil drainage and cause the dystrophication of                  surface waters.                                                                         This work has high interests for students of paleolimnology             in particular and paleoecology and ecology in general.  It gains                in significance when placed in context of current interests and                 concerns about global climatic change and its influence on                      ecosystems and man-made systems.  How lakes develop and stabilize               is also of interest to those studying how contemporary lakes are                disturbed by and recover from acidification.                                            The investigators and their institution are world renowed               for their work in this area.",
