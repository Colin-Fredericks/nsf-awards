 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Porifera is a cooperative education venture in which the museum         scientists and educators will train and assist teachers in integrating a        newly developed aquatic biology research program into the life science          curriculum of twenty junior high schools in the Thames River watershed.                                                                                         Teachers will be involved in activities designed to upgrade their               research skills and content knowledge.  Their students will become              involved in in-depth investigative experiences, an innovative networking        of computer communications, museum displays, and the opportunity for            supervised independent student research.  Focusing on the freshwater and        estuarine ecosystems of eastern Connecticut, Project Porifera is                designed to involve regional teachers and students in field studies and         scientific surveys on selected bodies of water within the l,500 sq. mi.         Thames River Basin.                                                                                                                                             A staff composed of a computer specialist, an aquatic biologist and a           curriculum specialist will offer twenty teachers courses, field                 experiences, and classroom training to prepare them to implement this           new approach in their classrooms and in the field.",
