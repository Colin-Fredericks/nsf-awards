 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will improve an advanced undergraduate teaching and                research laboratory in Acoustics at Smith College.  The Physics                 Department will acquire the capability to use holographic interferometry        to identify, demonstrate, and analyze the vibrational modes of various          objects, starting with musical instruments.  For this project Smith will        purchase a vibration isolated optical table and base, vibration exciter,        accelerometer, digital shutter, variable attenuator/beam splitter, and          spatial filter.                                                                                                                                                 The Acoustics course requires a semester-long experimental project from         physics majors taking the course, and shorter projects may be elected by        non-majors.  In addition, the Acoustics laboratory is used by seniors           doing Honors and Special Studies projects.  Having the capability to use        holographic interferometry in the identification of vibrational modes           will provide several additional laboratory experiments for the Acoustics        course as well as giving majors another technique for use in their              experimental projects.",
