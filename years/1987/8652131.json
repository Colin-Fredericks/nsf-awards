 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) will design, develop,           and evaluate a K-6 science/health program that will incorporate proven          implementation strategies.  The areas of discipline concentration will          be equally divided among the life, health, earth, and physical sciences.                                                                                        The program will complement goals of science knowledge and processes            with emphases on personal/social goals, problem solving, decision               making, and technology.                                                                                                                                         Project staff will use the appropriate results of research in the               cognitive sciences to revise and develop materials.  The results of             research on implementation strategies will be applied when developing           materials for teachers and administrators, and in designing activities          that promote use of the new program.  Implementation efforts are central        to this project.                                                                                                                                                Project outcomes will include: 28 activity-based student modules for a          complete K-6 science/health program; teachers' guides and computer              software for program management; implementation guides; and                     supplementary activities integrating science with reading, language             arts, and mathematics.                                                                                                                                          Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company is collaborating with BSCS in the               development and implementation of this science/health program.  The             publishers will invest in excess of $2.9M during the 4-year development         phase, and will continue teacher development activities in subsequent           years.  Private foundations as well as the Colorado Springs School              District are also contributing to development and testing activities.                                                                                           This proposal is a solid and high quality response to the Solicitation,         Programs for Elementary School Science Instruction, issued by the               Instructional Materials Development Program.  The project director and          staff are well qualified by training and experience to conduct the              activities.  The track record of BSCS speaks well for the success of the        project.",
