 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project would assist the Vassar College psychology department in           modernizing and expanding its laboratory facilities in human perception         and cognition.  There is a strong need for this enhancement due to              curricular expansion and student interest in this growing subarea of            psychology, particularly given recent changes in major requirements.            Students in psychology, biopsychology, and cognitive science will               benefit from the use of computerized stimulus presentation and data             collection, graphics, voice synthesis, eye movement tracking, and data          loggers through intermediate and laboratory courses in perception and           cognition and student independent work in these areas.  Available               facilities and expertise will allow for optimal use of this equipment to        illustrate central methodological techniques in the current study of            human perception and cognition through exercises and demonstrations as          well as more independent student research.  The scientific education of         a significant number of undergraduates, particularly women, will be             enhanced in the context of a high quality liberal arts institution which        has the resources and commitment to support this initiative.",
