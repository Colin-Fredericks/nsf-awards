 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two new devices are being developed at the University of New Hampshire          to measure the in-place lateral stresses and strength of soils, as well         as the stiffness degradation of the soil under full cyclic stress               reversal, simulating earthquake loading.                                                                                                                        Validation of these techniques requires that the results obtained using         these devices be compared with the results from other field tests of            soils.  This will be achieved with the purchase of a vane borer and a           flat dilatometer.                                                                                                                                               The Mexico City earthquake of 1985 has emphasized once again the need to        be able to characterize the in situ behavior of clays subjected to              earthquake loading.  However, no generally-accepted method exists for           measuring such behavior in the field over the range of strains induced          by a destructive earthquake.  The self-boring pressuremeter and the             cyclic pressuremeter being developed at the University of New Hampshire         show great promise of being able to meet this need:  the validation of          these devices will be greatly assisted with the purchase of a vane borer        and a flat dilatometer.",
