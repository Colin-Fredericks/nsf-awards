 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives and Relevance to Program Objectives:  This recommended award         would support a three-year cooperative research project in nuclear              physics between Professors Jochen H. Heisenberg and F. William Hersman,         Department of Physics, The University of New Hampshire; and Dr. H.P.            Blok, Free University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and Dr.P.K.A. de Witt        Huberts and others at the Dutch National Institute for Nuclear and High         Energy Physics (NIKHEF), also in Amsterdam.  The researchers will carry         out a program of nuclear structure studies using intermediate energy            electrons to probe details of nucleon orbital occupation near the               nuclear Fermi surface.  Two experimental programs are proposed which are        directed at understanding how the individual nucleons in the compound           system of the nucleus arrange themselves with respect to their                  neighbors.  Proton knockout from oxygen will determine which orbital            shapes are preferred by the nucleons and with what probability, while           the measurement of charges and currents looks at the rearrangement of           all other protons when one proton is moved from one orbit to another.                                                                                           The Nuclear Physics Group at The University of New Hampshire carries out        an active program of electromagnetic nuclear structure experiments at           the MIT-Bates Linear Accelerator.  The Group plans to extend its program        by increasing its interaction with Dutch scientists also active in this         field.  This will allow them to make use of high resolution                     spectrometers which are at present unique to the NIKHEF facility.  The          work to be carried out in cooperation with Dr. Blok, de Witt Huberts,           and colleagues at NIKHEF is a related and natural complement to the             current investigations of the American researchers.  The project thus           contributes to an important objective of NSF's cooperative science              programs with Western Europe, which is to stimulate scientific progress         by bringing together scientists from the U.S. and Europe who have               similar research interests and who wish to engage in mutually beneficial        research cooperation.  Funds from this award would support necessary            transportation and subsistence expenses for the U.S. principal                  investigators.                                                                                                                                                  Merit of Proposal:  The prospect of a significant contribution to               scientific knowledge from this proposed research is very good.  The U.S.        principal investigators are respected, productive scientists.  The              foreign researchers with whom they will cooperate in the project are            also widely recognized for their expertise in this field.  Previous             collaboration between the two research groups has been productive, and          the likelihood of additional mutual benefit from a continuation of the          joint effort is high.  The work plan is sound and the budget is                 reasonable.                                                                                                                                                     Funding:  This award will not duplicate other funding.  The principal           investigators receive support for the domestic aspects of this research         from the U.S. Department of Energy.",
