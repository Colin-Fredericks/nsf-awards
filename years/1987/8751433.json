The program format involves book reviews through                        narration and illustration with an overall program theme set by a               lead book.  With support from NSF they have produced and aired                  five half hour programs devoted to science books and science                    topics as part of the READING RAINBOW series.  The present                      proposal will add an additional eight programs that focus on                    scientific themes over the next four seasons of the program,                    demonstrating to children how science is integrated into all                    aspects of their lives and encouraging them to read science                     books.                                                                                                                                                          The series utilizes a thorough system of book and program topic                 review before material is selected for each program.  Scientists,               educators, librarians, teachers, parents, and children evaluate                 candidate books for interest, appropriateness, readability, and                 suitability for television treatment.  READING RAINBOW programs                 are evaluated for effectiveness after they are produced to                      provide feedback for future programs.                                                                                                                           The resulting programs are having a substantial effect on home,                 school, and library.  Booksellers are reporting dramatic                        increases in sales of reviewed books; librarians greatly                        increased requests for and use of materials.  Recent READING                    RAINBOW book reviews have led to new covers and new marketing                   programs for books, and teachers are using materials during the                 school year following summer broadcast.  Publishers, seeing an                  increased market for books for young children, are encouraging                  new work by authors and illustrators.                                                                                                                           A $750,000 award over three years is recommended: $250,000 for                  FY 87, and additional amounts of $250,000 in FY 88 and $250,000                 in FY 89.",
