 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for Prof. Lee under the Foundation's                Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) program.  His research concerns           VLSI architecture for real-time digital signal processing.  He has              developed a programming language called Synchronous Data Flow which has         the potential of relieving the burden of manual, painstaking hardware           design.  He is pursuing this concept under this grant.                                                                                                          The PYI Awards program provides research support to the Nation's most           outstanding and promising young science and engineering faculty.  The           awards are intended to improve the capability of U. S. academic                 institutions to respond to the demand for highly qualified science and          engineering personnel for academic and industrial research and                  engineering.  This PYI has made significant contributions to his field          of engineering and has potential to become a leader in academic research        and education. The diary note describes the rigorous selection                  procedure.  As Prof. Lee has obtained industrial matching funds in the          amount of $30000, a grant award of $55000 is highly recommended.",
