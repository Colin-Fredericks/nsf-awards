 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Rubin has just published a book, \"Computer Aids for VLSI Design\",           which will be the basis for a course of instruction with the express            purpose of preparing university faculty members to teach a course in            VLSI design and tools.  The setting for the course will be Stanford             University, where the students can visit a forefront VLSI research              center, the Center for Integrated Systems.  Dr. Rubin is exceptionally          well qualified to teach the course because of his accomplishments in            both research and teaching of CAD topics.                                       VLSI (very large scale integration) is a recent field that explores how         to design highly complex integrated circuits and related electronic             systems.  The need for this field of study is clear from trends in              current technology.  Development of the field is important to the               nation's competitive lead in electronics.  There are instructional              materials at the level of detailed circuit design; but until now, there         have been no instructional materials dealing with the scope and use of          computer-aided design (CAD) tools necessary for VLSI design                     development.  A new textbook which fills this gap in VLSI education has         been written by the principal investigator and recently published.              This book, \"Computer Aids for VLSI Design\", presents a broad view of            the tools necessary for modern VLSI design systems.  The instruction            proposed by the principal investigator will educate a core of                   instructors who can return to their institutions with an in-depth               knowledge of VLSI design tools and prepare courses on their use.",
