 "awd_abstract_narration": "A class of binary stars, W Serpentis, will be observed and                      analyzed with a simple model.  The stars are in a brief, rapid                  phase of mass transfer involving formation of accretion disks and               gas clouds enveloping both stars.  Observations will be made on a               total of three telescopes in Florida and Texas and involve two                  faculty and at least two undergraduate students both at Florida                 Institute of Technology and at Stephen F. Austin State University               in Texas.                                                                                                                                                       Stars age as they use up their nuclear fuels.  The manner in                    which they age has influenced cosmic evolution and the                          ingredients that went into making our Solar System.  Binary stars               age by exchanging mass.  Observations will be made of one                       particular group of binary stars with particularly active mass                  transfer.  The program is a collaborative effort of two                         institutions, faculty, and students eligible for the Research in                Undergraduate Institutions Program.  Sufficiently frequent                      observations are assured because the observing sites, located in                Florida and Texas, have different weather patterns.",
