 "awd_abstract_narration": "The supply of engineering students over the next two                            decades is important to the nation's economy, national                          security, and quality of life.  A workshop on the future                        supply of undergraduates in engineering is undertaken by the                    Engineering Deans Council of the American Society for                           Engineering Education.  The issues addressed are:                               demographic changes; inadequate precollege preparation; and                     minorities and women in undergraduate engineering education.                    A major objective of the workshop is to identify barriers to                    increasing the number of students.  A further objective is                      to improve methodologies for recruiting able students to                        engineering programs.  Another objective is to improve                          retention rates of incoming students.  The workshop is to                       report, recommend and specify actions to be taken by all                        undergraduate engineering programs.",
