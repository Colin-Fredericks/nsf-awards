 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Yongom live in the lowland rainforest of Papua New                     Guinea.  This study will attempt to understand the significance                 of ritual knowledge and beliefs in this little-known society.                   Specifically the student will look at divination ceremonies and                 see how individuals resolve illness by applying social pressure                 to persons suspected of sorcery and how knowledge is transmitted                through initiation ceremonies.  The student will focus on the way               in which religious knowledge helps to organize Yongom daily life.                    This study will help us understand how ritual knowledge is                 organized, taught, and used in a society.  It will enable us to                 understand the role of beliefs and ritual in everyday situations                as well as ritual contexts.  Religious knowledge is used in all                 societies in everyday situations:  this research will provide new               information on how a belief system is integrated with practical                 and strategic knowledge and provides a framework for events faced               everyday.",
