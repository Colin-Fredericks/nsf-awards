 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Improving the Science Education of Prospective Alaska Native Teachers\",        is part of a cross-cultural, field-based teacher preparation program for        native Alaskan students.  The project will develop, test, and                   disseminate two laboratory science courses, one in chemistry and one in         physics that are especially appropriate for Native Alaskan students who         are prospective elementary school teachers.  For the most part, the             courses will be offered at field sites and will incorporate appropriate         and locally relevant laboratory / practical activities.  A team of              university science faculty, educational consultants, rural science              teachers, native students and others will develop and produce science           course prototypes that accomodate and incorporate the students' culture         and environment.  The third year of the project includes final                  development of course materials, evaluation, and dissemination.                                                                                                 Despite many attempts to improve the success in science of Native               Alaskan children, a vicious cycle of low interest and low achievement           continues.  This reality results in failure not only at elementary and          secondary levels of schooling but also at the university level as well.         Thus, the number of Native Alaskan students selecting science oriented          majors or careers is miniscule, and prospective Native teachers have            very poor science preparation perpetuating the problem.  This project           will respond to the problem by preparing Native Alaskan elementary              school teachers who have been successful in science and who will serve          as scientifically literate role models for their students and                   communities.",
