 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Dr. Ambrose and his colleagues to conduct one                season of archaeological excavation at the site of Twilight Cave,               located in the Naivasha Basin of Kenya's Rift Valley. Previous                  work at the site has revealed a long and well stratified sequence               which extends from the Pleistocene (Ice Age) into recent times.                 Continued work at the site should provide evidence for: the                     antiquity of the Late Stone Age mesolithic tradition in East                    Africa and the subsistence base of these hunter.gatherers; the                  cultural and adaptive changes which accompanied the end of the                  Pleistocene; the age of the introduction of pottery and domestic                animals. With this information it should be possible to determine               the nature of subsistence and settlement patterns through time.                 These goals with be accomplished through excavation and                         collection of faunal, cultural and other biological remains.                    Stable carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotope analyses of organic                  and inorganic fractions of bones and sediments should  provide                  insight into environmental change over time.                                                                                                                    The question of how hunters and gatherers adapted to long term                  environmental fluxuation is of interest to anthropologists.                     Consideration of this requires a detailed and long term cultural                sequence as well as good paleoenvironmental data. Sites which                   provide such information . as Twilight Cave does . are rare and                 therefore valuable.                                                                                                                                             This research is important for the insights it will yield about                 how humans adapt at a simple level of technology. It is also                    important because of the scientific ties it will help build with                Kenya. Dr. Ambrose has worked closely with Kenyan scientists,                   helped to train them, and included them in his research. Because                of the important scientific materials which Kenya contains, it is               valuable to strengthen this bilateral relationship.",
