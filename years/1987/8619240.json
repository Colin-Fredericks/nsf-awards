 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with determining individual                          differences in feeding behavior in ring-tailed lemurs, Lemura                   catta.  The researcher will compare feeding behavior and resource               utilization in two groups of free-ranging lemurs in Madagascar.                 Specifically, the researcher will investigate the time spent in                 feeding, food consumption, and use of feeding sites by male and                 female  adults.  She will identify the effects of reproductive                  state, activity level, gender, age and social ranking on feeding                behavior and diet.  Even though ring-tailed lemurs are the best                 studied prosimians in captivity, wild Lemur catta have never been               the subject of an in-depth study of this kind.  It is expected                  that in addition to providing data on individual feeding                        behavior, the study will provide much-needed behavioral                         comparisons to other primates and humans.                                                                                                                       The research is timely and important.  Information on feeding                   behavior is Lemurs, especially those living in the wild is sadly                lacking.  Prior studies have concentrated on differences in                     feeding behavior between different species or members of                        different groups of the same species, but very few have looked at               variation in understanding the relationship between habitat,                    social structure, and the individual.  In addition, the dwindling               habitat of primates and the increase in hunting means that                      research of this type must be conducted soon in order to enhance                the survival of species.",
