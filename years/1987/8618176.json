 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Taylor-Aris dispersion technique has been successfully employed in          the Rochester laboratory to determine binary tracer diffusion                   coefficients in supercritical dense fluids that are liquid under                ambient conditions.  For fluids that are gaseous under ambient                  conditions, dispersion peak tailing arising from solute adsorption ont          tube walls and from inappropriate pulse injection methods has been              found to adversely affect the accuracy of the diffusivity measurement.          To redress these problems, tube surface deactivation and pulse                  injection under conditions identical to those prevailing in the                 dispersion tube are proposed.  The modified technique will be used to           gather diffusion coefficients of benzene, naphthlene, phenanthrene and          1,2-benzanthracene in near-critical and supercritical dense carbon              dioxide, nitrous oxide, chlorotrifluoromethane and ethane.  The results         should permit a rough-hard-sphere theory of molecular diffusion to be           tested in the supercritical dense region.  Diffusion data in the near-          critical region should place theories of dynamic critical phenomena in          a broader perspective as the gas-liquid critical state is approached.",
