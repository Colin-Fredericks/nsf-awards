 "awd_abstract_narration": "This purpose of this research is to investigate the determinants                of sex segregation by occupation.  Although it has long been                    established that the distribution of jobs held by men and women                 varies greatly, there has been wide disagreement over the causes.               Explanations for occupational segregation include sex discrimination,           different comparative advantages based on gender for particular types           of work, and different job preferences of men and women.  This study is         important because it will provide useful insights into the functioning          of the labor market, at a time when there is considerable debate about          the need for and the appropriateness of government intervention, in             order to produce a more uniform distribution of men and women across            occupations.                                                                                                                                                    To help distinguish among the competing hypotheses that might explain           occupational segregation, a data set will be assembled containing               occupational characteristics from various sources including the                 Dictionary of Occupational Titles, the Quality of Employment Surveys,           the 1970 and 1980 censuses, and the Current Population Surveys.  These          characteristics will be used to investigate how jobs held predominantly         by women differ from those typically held by men.  In addition, the             question of why only some occupations that were dominated by one sex in         1970 have shown substantial movement toward a more even division                between men and women will be investigated.",
