 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goals of this research are to understand the B                 cell machinery that directs immunoglobulin (Ig) to its                          destination, either as a plasma membrane protein or as a                        secretory product.  Previous results indicate that two stages in                the transport of newly synthesized membrane and secreted Ig are                 sensitive to the protonophore, CCCP.  The first stage seems to be               entry of Ig into the Golgi complex and the second stage                         corresponds to transport between the trans-Golgi and the cell                   surface.  The first CCCP-sensitive stage is indistinguishable                   biochemically from the stage of Ig processing in which several                  non-secreting myeloma mutants are arrested.  The two current                    goals of this project are:  1) to clarify the mechanism of action               of CCCP on intracellular Ig transport.  Effects of CCCP on ion                  fluxes through the plasma membrane, on the pH of organelles                     involved in protein traffic, and on cellular ATP levels will be                 measured and compared with its effects on the turnover of non-                  secreted Ig.  2) to determine the intracellular sites where non-                secreted Ig is arrested in several mutant cell lines.  Available                biochemical data suggest that Ig in all these mutants fails to                  reach the mid-Golgi compartment, but biochemical approaches                     cannot provide further resolution.  Immunocytochemistry at the EM               level, using immuno-gold staining on ultrathin frozen sections,                 will be used to localize the sites of accumulation of Ig in the                 mutants and in CCCP blocked cells.                                                   The results of this research should increase our                           understanding of the regulation of the intracellular pathway of                 newly synthesized antibody molecules.  These experiments will                   also provide new information concerning the mechanism of action                 of the chemical agent, CCCP, which has been widely used as a tool               in studies of cellular metabolism and secretion.",
