 "awd_abstract_narration": "Waste minimization is a significant means to further increase the               profit, efficiency and competitiveness of industry.  It is a                    strong challenge to develop those techniques which will have                    significant positive value to industrial productivity and to                    admit that other waste minimization goals are best achieved with                classical pollution treatment approaches.  On the horizon (even                 today) it is clear that further waste minimization is possible                  only when quantum jumps in the approaches to manufacturing are                  taken.  Thus sustained, focused research efforts are clearly                    needed today to achieve these major improvements.  It is                        therefore proposed to conduct an intense, directed Research Needs               Workshop to discuss and develop an assessment of a central topic                - \"What are there basic or innovative applied research needs                    (including examples)  in the field of industrial waste                          minimization?\"  The proposed Research Needs Workshop would be                   composed mostly of individuals from industry as the primary group               to speculate and critically evaluate the nature of waste                        minimization research for manufacturing processes.  Following the               meeting, an Executive Summary and a report will be prepared for                 use of individuals and organizations with interest in research                  commitments to waste minimization for industry.",
