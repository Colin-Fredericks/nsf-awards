 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lesley Sibner will continue her investigations of analytic                 problems in gauge field theory. This will involve the study of                  the Yang-Mills-Higgs model. Physically the Higgs model describes                the interaction of elementary particles and the field equations                 explain the phenomena of superconductivity in vortices and the                  behavior of magnetic monopoles. Sibner's research is mainly                     directed towards studying the possible singular sets in solutions               of these field equations.                                                            It is known that low energy usually implies regularity in                  the solution of the field equations. In fact the singular                       examples of Uhlenbeck have large energy. Part of the current                    project will be aimed at showing that these are the only examples               with point singularities. In the context of more complex singular               sets recent developments lead naturally to the notions of                       capacity and Hausdorff dimension. Investigations in this                        direction will follow on from Sibner's conditions for removing                  singular sets.",
