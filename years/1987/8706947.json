 "awd_abstract_narration": "A collaborative research effort between the University of               Washington and University of New Mexico is initiated with this 1-               year research award. The research will combine two ongoing                      studies on the same site and provide a unique opportunity to                    develop research leading to an extensive analysis above- and                    belowground for a forest ecosystem.  The current studies are                    hypotheses concerning the effects of manipulating resource                      availability (water and/or nitrogen) on several aspects of carbon               allocation between primary production and secondary metabolites                 for above- and belowground tissues.  The preliminary research in                this 1-year proposal will allow the design of experiments to test               how manipulating resource availability should cause shifts in:                  above- and belowground biomass, turnover of fine roots, seasonal                patterns of fine root production nutrient resorption from                       senescing tissues, quality and quantity of secondary metabolites                in foliage and roots, and mycorrhizal biomass and turnover.                     These changes should affect ecosystem processes of herbivory,                   decomposition, and net ecosystems production.                                           The collaborating investigators have excellent individual               records and are known to perform well in a collaborative context.               Facilities are excellent as is the field research site.",
