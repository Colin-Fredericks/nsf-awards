 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research utilizes interferometer/polariscope equipment to obtain           accurate results of the concentration and stress profiles (as a                 function of position and time) for penetrant transport in glassy                polymers.  The experimental studies will be carried out with divinyl            benzene-crosslinked polystyrene samples exposed to cyclohexane at               various temperatures.  The effects of characteristic sample length,             degree of crosslinking and transport temperature on the concentration           and stress profiles will be investigated by the novel interferometric           technique.  These results will be used to verify a new mathematical             model for liquid transport in glassy polymers.  This model incorporates         a generalized constitutive equation for the polymer in the diffusion            equation.  The final transport equation can be solved for a variety of          boundary conditions.  In its final form, it can be cast in terms of a           characteristic diffusion and an average relaxation time.  From the              experimental results, one will be able to identify the conditions under         which polymer relaxation becomes the controlling factor of the overall          transport mechanism.",
