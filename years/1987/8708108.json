 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this study is to elaborate upon recent theories                of efficiency wages.  The conditions under which workers shirk are              examined and the alternative social and organizational models for               motivating labor effort are analyzed.  The principal thesis is that             social and organizational regimes are more significant than wage                compensation schemes as incentives to promote work effort.  Alternative         models are developed in four areas--organizational and managerial,              paternalism, kinship, and legitimacy.  The nature of labor supervision          and various efficiency compensation regimes are also examined.  The             research takes an inductive, in contrast to a deductive, approach to            theory, where the models are supported by data from business histories,         management case studies, industrial relations research, anthropological         studies of family and kinship, and industrial sociology, as well as             original field research.  The significance of this project is that it           identifies conditions under which alternatives to simple wage                   differentials can be used to motivate workers to work more effectively          and, thus, to be more productive in the work place.                                                                                                             The principal investigator's previous work has been very influential            over a broad spectrum both of labor economics and macroeconomics.  This         project builds on some of his previous work, and there is every reason          to believe that this study will be successfully undertaken.",
