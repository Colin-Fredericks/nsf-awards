 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two campaigns to measure transient tracers in the Atlantic              Ocean (TTO/NAS and TTO/Equatorial) were funded by NSF during the                period from 1980 to 1985.  A complete data base for modelling                   this ocean basin would include a South Atlantic Study to:                               1.Determine CO2 transports and their influence on world                 climate,                                                                        2.Constrain models of major ocean currents in this area,                        and                                                                             3.Confirm an observed 5-fold increase in the addition                           rate of new carbon to the thermocline.                                                  Eight components of such a study (SAVE) will be performed by            investigators from LDGO, Princeton, University of Washington,                   WHOI, and SIO.  The track record of these scientists is well                    established by successful completion of previous studies in the                 Equatorial and North Atlantic.  They will provide physical and                  chemical expertise which will be directed toward a cooperative                  effort to reach the goals of the geochemical study.                                     This component integrates historical physical oceanographic             data (GEOSECS, IGY, Discovery, and Meteor) with physical and                    chemical data from SAVE to evaluate ventilation mechanisms in the               South Atlantic.  Specifically, tracers will be used to complete                 the physical model of interbasin exchange, thermocline                          ventilation, water mass formation, and water mass spreading. The                historical intercomparisons could have considerable relevance to                the earth's climatic cycles.  Variability of water masses less                  voluminous than deep water masses known to cause large decadal-                 scale changes in Co2 levels will be assesed.",
