 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large testing facility is being completed at the University of                Houston to test full-sized reinforced concrete panels under in-plane            loadings.  It consists of thirty-seven 100-ton hydraulic jacks embedded         in a large steel reaction frame.  The jacks are controlled by a                 sophisticated hydraulic system to produce in-plane normal and shear             stresses in a panel.  Extensive tests of reinforced concrete panels will        be conducted to generate material laws which are required in the                development of the softened truss model theory.                                 The equipment will upgrade the facility to have the capability to apply         out-of-plane loadings, including bending moments, torsional moments and         out-of-plane shear stresses.  These out-of-plane loadings will be               supplied by seventeen additional 60-ton jacks.  Since both in-plane and         out-of-plane stresses occur in an element of a shell structure, the             upgraded facility is known as a shell element tester.",
