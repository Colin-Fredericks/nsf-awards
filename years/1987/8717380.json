The award provides support for research by Dr. Hilkka                 Kenttamaa, Purdue University, which is aimed at characterizing                  the chemical and physical properties of molecular fragments in                  the gas phase.  Quadrupole mass spectrometry will be employed                   to measure reactivity of both charged (cationic) and neutral                    (radical) fragments of organic molecules.  Understanding the                    reactivity of molecular fragments in the gas phase is important                 both for understanding chemical events which occur in the upper                 atmosphere, and for understanding the influence of solvation                    upon the many chemical reactions which occur in solution.                                                                                                       Two different types of quadrupole mass spectrometers will be                    employed:  an ion trap equipped with pulsed valves, and a                       triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer.  The various                        capabilities of the two techniques will be utilized in studies                  on three different areas. (i)  Mechanisms and potential energy                  surfaces of acid-catalyzed reactions of epoxides in the absence                 of solvents will be studied.  In addition, experiments are                      planned which will yield thermochemical data for neutral                        epoxides, protonated epoxides and their isomeric forms.  (ii)                   Relative stabilities and intrinsic chemical reactivity of                       coordinately unsaturated borocations are a topic of interest.                   The experiments employed will allow heats of formation to be                    determined for borenium ions and various other boron-containing                 species, including derivatives of neutral metaboric and                         metaboronic acids.  (iii)  Studies on bimolecular gas-phase                     chemistry of ionized ylides and ionized zwitterions will                        provide information concerning the thermochemistry and                          reactivity of these interesting ions as well as their neutral                   gas-phase radical and diradical analogs.",
