 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"heterogenization\" refers to the representation of the solution to          a heterogeneous problem of elastostatics in terms of the solution to            the corresponding homogeneous problem.  Solutions of homogeneous                problems are already known in many cases, while solutions of problems           for bodies composed of two (or more) different materials are generally          difficult to obtain.  The approach to be followed in this study is              based on the method of images due to Kelvin, never exploited in                 elastostatics, and should lead to algebraic formulas linking quantities         of interest in the homogeneous problem to the corresponding quantities          of the heterogeneous problem.  The formulas should remain the same for          any type of loading produced by any type of singularities, such as              concentrated forces, moments, and dislocations.  Both two-dimensional           (plane and antiplane deformation) and three-dimensional states of               stress should be tractable by this method.",
