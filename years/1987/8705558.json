 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethnicity is an important source of identity and community and as such          needs to be understood in terms of the issues of legal pluralism in             our own society.  Ms. Evans-Pritchard's study applies the theoretical,          methodological, and empirical insights that have been gained in this            arena as well as the perspectives and concerns of folkloric research to         a study of how the American legal system goes about maintaining what it         considers to be ethnic traditions--the way arguments and definitions            are formed and the way that the matter of ethnic values and traditions          are made justifiable in a multi-ethnic society.  Through her doctoral           dissertation research under the direction of Drs. Jones and Georges,            she plans to examine the conceptualizations of tradition that emerge            from the judicial process and the relationship such conceptualizations          have to ethnographic reality.  Specifically, Ms. Evans-Pritchard                focuses on the \"Portal Case,\" a highly controversial lawsuit in which           an Anglo craftsman challenged the Indian-only policy of Santa Fe's              traditional Indian market.  She compares the Portal Case with five              recent court cases in various parts of the country which have involved          similar issues of tradition and ethnic or cultural boundaries in order          to operationalize the process by which the formal legal apparatus is            currently handling the informal social force of tradition.  A key               element of her work is to establish the ethnographic context of three           related New Mexico cases, including the Portal Case, involving Native           American arts and crafts in order to illuminate the relationship                between the codified conceptualizations of tradition expressed in the           court proceedings and the imbedded views of tradition held by the               affected Native American craftsmen.  Through systematic, comparative            analysis of diverse sources of data, this project holds substantial             promise of advancing our understanding of how courts and litigants              construct boundaries around cultural or ethnic groups.",
