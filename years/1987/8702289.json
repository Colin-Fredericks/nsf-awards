 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project involves an international collaboration between           Professors J. Natowitz and R. Schmitt of Texas A&M University (TAMU),           and Professors M.E. Brendan and A. Menchacha Rocha of the Physics               Institute of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM).  The           collaborators intend to study properties of nuclei having very high             excitation energies within temperatures approaching the average binding         energy per nucleon.  To the research they will bring to bear the latest         experimental facilities such as:  i) a new K500 superconducting                 cyclotron located at TAMU that will greatly increase the energy and             mass of particles useful for nuclear experiments; ii) an advanced               neutron ball multiplicity detector, which acts as a very powerful               filter in studying both nuclear reaction mechanisms and the properties          of highly excited nuclei; and iii) discrete phostron detectors, to be           designed and constructed by the UNAM group, which will greatly enhance          the utility of the neutron ball detector.                                                                                                                       The investigators will focus on important aspects of intermediate               energy heavy ion collision using sophisticated techniques and                   equipment.  The U.S. investigators have made valuable contributions to          the present understanding of reaction and particle emission mechanisms,         and the Mexican investigators also possess expertise in experimental            heavy ion science at low and intermediate energies.  The degree of              interaction between the two experienced groups of researchers increases         the likelihood that the project will be one of mutual benefit, thus             fulfilling a prime objective of the U.S.-Mexico Program.  Given the             researchers past records, the potential for significant advance is very         high.",
