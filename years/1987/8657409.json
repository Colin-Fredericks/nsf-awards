 "awd_abstract_narration": "The control of bacterial metabolism will be studied at very low                 growth rates under conditions in which product formation may be                 uncoupled from cellular growth.  Experiments are designed to                    provide data for the development of structured metabolic models                 capable of quantitatively predicting microbial growth based on a                cell's genetic organization.  Fed-batch or cell-recycle reactor                 systems will be developed to allow accurate measurements of                     microbial metabolism at controlled rates of nutrient supply.                    Measurements of cell viability, macromolecular synthesis, and                   energy consumption will be performed to determine the extent and                stability of metabolic uncoupling.  Growth rate control of the                  expression of regulated enzyme networks (regulons) will be                      measured using radioisotope labelling, two-dimensional gel                      electrophoresis and enzymatic gene fusions.  Initial studies will               look at the particular case of phosphate limitation in two model                systems:  E. COLI in which the behavior can be analyzed in terms                of the genetics of the PHO regulon; and B. SUBTILIS in which the                regulation of protein secretion, antibiotic synthesis, and                      sporulation initiation can be investigated.",
