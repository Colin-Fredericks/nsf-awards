 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology cares                           for important anthropological collections.  One of these is                     theMecklenburg collection of Iron Age materials (ca. 750 BC.AD                  20). This collection consists of 18,900 objects, as well as human               and horse skeletal remains from 894 grave lots.  This materials                 is from several sites in Austria and Yugoslavia.  The collection                is enhanced by good documentation and provenience information.                  It represents the largest collection of Central European Iron                   Age artifacts in the United States.                                                     Unfortunately, the collection is presently inaccessible                 to researchers because it has never been properly catalogued                    and entered into the museum's catalogue system.  Also the objects               are deteriorating and cannot be safely handled.                                         With this grant, the staff of the Peabody Museum will begin             to upgrade the collection and make them accessible to                           researchers.  The collections will be catalogued by individual                  object and the information integrated into the museum's                         computerized database system.  A conservation needs survey will                 be undertaken by a highly trained conservator who will recommend                treatment for the most unstable objects.  This will allow                       researchers to then use this significant collection and                         increase our knowledge of early European societies and processes                of social complexity.",
