 "awd_abstract_narration": "The existence of chaos in quantum systems is a question of                      fundamental importance as well as of practical relevance.  So far                                                                                               experiments on quantum chaos have been conducted by the study of                                                                                                microwave ionization of highly excited hydrogen atoms.  They                    allowed access only to the regime where the chaotic behavior                    looks classical.  It is proposed here to study microwave                        liberation of electrons bound to the liquid helium surface.  This                                                                                               experiment permits the exploration of regions in parameter space                                                                                                where deviations from classical chaos are expected to take place.                                                                                                                                                                               Another project that will be carried out is the study of the                    magnetically induced Wigner transition in a 2-D electron system.                                                                                                An electron solid is expected to melt when, for sufficiently high                                                                                               densities, the zero point motion becomes larger than the Coulomb                                                                                                interaction.  This type of transition has not yet been observed                 since in existing 2-D electron systems where the densities are                  either too high (in heterojunctions) or too low (electrons on                   Helium).  In a joint project with F.I.B. Williams and E. Mendez                 it is proposed to induce the Wigner transition in the 2-D                       electron liquid in a GaAl/GeAlAs heterojunction by means of a                   strong magnetic field.  It will be detected by measuring the                    shear modulus of the electron layer.",
