 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the problem of multiple-access               communications through non-Gaussian channels via spread-spectrum                modulation.  It is motivated in large part by the fact that                     modern urban radio networks must operate in complex and variable                noise environments that are often dominated by impulsive, non-                  Gaussian man-made and natural noise sources.  Non-Gaussian                      disturbances are now known to be present in many situations, and                they can greatly reduce the performance of conventional digital                 communication systems.                                                               The overall purpose of this research is to develop new                     design methods suitable for multiuser systems operating in such                 non-Gaussian channels.  The study can be divided into two                       principal tasks to be considered.  There are the development of                 time and phase synchronizers; and the design of \"optimum\"                       nonlinear, coherent, spread-spectrum receivers in non-Gaussian                  noise.  In many applications, in the presence of non-Gaussian                   noise sources, the impulsive and transient characterisitics of                  noise suggest that a nonlinearity in the receiver structure can                 significantly reduce the effective noise power by reducing the                  large voltage deviation caused by noise impulses.  Thus it is                   proposed to design and analyze the performance of optimum                       memoryless nonlinearities for synchronization and correlation                   reception.  Possibilities of introducing memory in the structure                of receivers will also be explored.  It is anticipated that the                 results of this study will find widespread application in urban                 and military mobile radio networking and low frequency                          communications.",
