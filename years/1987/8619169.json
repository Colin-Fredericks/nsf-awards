 "awd_abstract_narration": "Four topics are being studied under the heading of modular algorithms           for multidimensional signal processing.  The first topic is an                  investigation of the subclass of rational transfer functions which can          be represented in cascade lattice form.  Second, a multichannel                 approach is made to the characterization of all orthogonal lattice              configurations for two-dimensional (2-D) signals.  A study of maximum           entropy (ME) methods in relation to model constraints constitutes the           third topic of study.  This work is based on the investigators recent           results regarding the optimality of recursive autoregressive models in          terms minimizing a certain information theoretic distance from the ME           solution.  Finally, layer-pealing algorithms will be investigated for           2-D scattering arrays.                                                          This research concerns the extension of the lattice modeling approach           to multidimensional signal processing.  This lattice approach has been          very influential in the case of one-dimensional signals such as audio           because of its advantages for VLSI and also for adaptive processing.            The researchers are working on the difficult problems of trying to              extend these advantages to the two-dimensional case for application to          video and computer vision.",
