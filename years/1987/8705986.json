 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Upper Cretaceous Two Medicine Formation of northwestern             Montana has promise of yielding the most comprehensive data                     ever documented concerning the evolution of Upper Cretaceous                    dinosaur faunas and their respective ecosystems.  Preliminary                   collection of dinosaur specimens from various stratigraphic                     positions throughout the 650 meter thick (12 million years)                     unit has produced primitive, opportunistic species (ancestral                   to known lineages) from basal sediments; conservative species                   from \"upland\" sediments; and transitional (Judithian to                         Edmontonian) species from uppermost sediments.  In each case a                  regressional or transgressional phase of interior seaway                        fluctuation can be correlated with a particular fauna.  The                     objective of this proposal is to collect additional specimens                   and data from previously known and new, uncollected sites for                   use in subjecting previous hypotheses, concerning physical,                     causal effects of speciation, to rigorous tests.  Additionally,                 the Two Medicine sites offer considerable promise of yielding a                 substantial amount of new data pertaining to ancestral and                      descendant Upper Cretaceous dinosaur species.  Determination of                 transitional variables is made possible, owing to the fact that                 abundant, well preserved specimens of numerous ontogenetic                      stages are available.  The proposed time frame for the project                  is three years.",
