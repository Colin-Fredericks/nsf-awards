 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            established to provide support to strengthen the research environments          and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions or                      institutions that have substantial minority student enrollments.                Eligibility institutions must also have graduate programs in science            or programs in engineering.  Funding is provided for faculty research           in fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and            for the acquisition of research instrumentation.  Wayne State                   University will use RIMI support to characterize all details of                 certain chemical dynamics through the use of laser techniques.                  Researchers will examine the relative kinetic energy, internal energy,          impact parameter, and relative electron orbital orientations of                 several bimolecular chemical reactions.                                                                                                                         This project will meet the research needs of an urban university that           is making a special effort to involve more minorities in first rate             research.  The principal investigator, who is a minority, is an expert          in infrared excitations and has done research at the University of              Cambridge (England).  The Foundation has supported this project                 because it will provide support to increase opportunities for                   minorities to perform meritorious research on dye laser systems.",
