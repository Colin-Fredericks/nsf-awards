First, organic synthesis at high pressure (15 kbar, 1.5               GPa) will be studied to develop reaction processes which can be                 run under mild temperature conditions with hindered substrates.                 New studies will be undertaken to evaluate the effect of                        pressures up to 1,000 kbar under varying temperature and time                   conditions.  New varieties of compounds will be prepared which                  will be of structural and/or biological importance.  Second, the                total synthesis of alicyclic natural products will be pursued.                  Particular attention will be given to biologically active                       materials with interesting structures, such compounds as large                  ring cembranoids from insects and the ophiobolin sesterterpenes                 from pathogenic fungus.                                                                                                                                         This project is directed towards the development of new synthetic               methods, which will permit the preparation of new materials of                  biological and theoretical interest.",
