 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests resources to help support the Fourth                     International conference on Numerical Methods in Fracture Mechanics.            The objective of the conference is to consolidate the recent advances in        development and application of numerical methods in fracture mechanics.         This conference is an excellent forum for exchanging information between        the computational community and the leading fracture mechanics                  researchers and practitioners.  The conference will address theoretical         bases and the practical techniques involved in computational fracture           mechanics.  Seven major session topics are planned, each initiated with         an invited lecture by a distinguished researcher.  The papers will be           published in the proceedings that will be provided to the participants          at the conference.                                                                                                                                              A very rich return on the requested resources is quite certain. An award        is recommended.",
