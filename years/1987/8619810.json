 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a one-year cooperative research project between         Professor Vladimir Hlavacek, Chemical Engineering Department, State             University of New York at Buffalo, and Prof. Dr. Ir. K. R. Westerterp,          Twente University of Technology, Enschede, The Netherlands.  The                engineers will cooperate in an experimental and theoretical examination         of the role of high-pressure technology in the processing of advanced           ceramic materials.  They will carry out research on a high-temperature,         high-pressure, self-propagating synthesis process that will                     simultaneously provide for the synthesis and sintering of ceramic               powders without the use of additives.  The process utilizes the                 liberation of heat by a strongly exothermic reaction under high                 pressure, and takes place quickly.  A similar approach is being                 investigated to achieve bonding between different ceramic materials and         between ceramics and metals in such a way that the resulting bonded             materials have high strength and good thermal shock resistance.  The            processes will be simulated on a supercomputer for typical values of the        governing parameters.  Such simulations should provide insights into            conditions within the various samples under investigation, and guide the        selection of materials and optimum experimental conditions.                                                                                                     Advanced ceramic materials possess specialized properties that make them        potentially useful in high-performance applications ranging from heat-          and wear-resistant parts to electronic and optical devices.  For some           applications their superior performance may lead to reduced costs, and          they may substitute for a variety of scarce materials.  The procedures          under study here are expected to be less expensive than current                 technologies in this area.  By combining Professor Hlavacek's expertise         in the synthesis of ceramic materials with Professor Westerterp's               experience and resources in high-pressure reaction engineering, the             engineers expect to enhance their research progress in this field               significantly, and to prepare the new materials in larger quantities            than is currently possible in Professor Hlavacek's laboratory in                Buffalo.  Funds from this award would support necessary transportation          and subsistence expenses for the U.S. principal investigator.  The              government of The Netherlands, through the Twente University of                 Technology, is also providing support for the project.",
