 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although isolated glacial erosion models have been                         developed, there has been no serious attempt to combine such                    work with models of glacier flow to provide quantitative                        insight into larger scale problems of glacial land-form                         evolution.  Moreover, these analyses offer little guidance for                  a precise treatment of debris production by glacial erosion,                    and yet debris at the base of glaciers has recently emerged as                  a central unknown in modern considerations of glacier dynamics.                 A quantitative model of glacial erosion will be developed based                 on a fundamental analysis of the physics of glacial abrasion                    and plucking (quarrying), and field observations at the base of                 Grinnell Glacier, Montana.  Initial theoretical work suggests a                 physically based relationship between sliding velocity, basal                   effective pressure and rate of quarrying.   Further theoretical                 work on quarrying, in combination with improvements on Hallet's                 (1981) abrasion model will provide an overall glacial erosion                   modelling.  This erosion model will be coupled with finite                      element  programs for glacier flow, and used to simulate the                    development of glacial land-forms such as U-shaped valleys,                     model spatial patterns of debris production, and tracking debris                transport in glaciers and ice sheets.",
