 "awd_abstract_narration": "This experiment will measure the Newtonian gravitational constant, G,           on scale lengths of 100 m to 1500 m, to an accuracy of 1 part in 1000           or better.  The intent of the experiment is to search for possible              scale length variations in G that have been hypothesized in an effort           to produce a unified field theory in modern physics.  If a scale                length variation exists it will verify the existence of a fifth force           of nature (about which there has been much recent publicity) and will           have a significant effect on many branches of modern physics including          general relativity, unified field theory, astrophysics, and cosmology.          The proposed experiment consists of measuring the difference in                 gravity between the top and bottom of the greenland continental ice             sheet through a borehole at Dye 3 using a LaCoste & Romberg borehole            gravity meter.  By measuring the acceleration of gravity, the depth             interval of the experiment, and the density of the ice, G can be                calculated.  Others have found anomalous variations in gravity with             depth in mines that could be explained by allowing G to be greater              than the laboratory value by almost 1%.  Uncertainty in the density of          rock near mines makes this result inconclusive,  Because the density            of ice is much better known, the experiment proposed here will be much          more accurate than any previous geophysical measurement of G.                   This investigation is also being supported by:  The NSF Division of             Physics, the Air Force Geophysics Laboratory, Amoco Production Co.,             and the Los Alamos National Laboratory.",
