 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ricefishes constitute a group of fresh and brackish water               fishes that range from the Indian subcontinent throughout coastal               Southeast Asia into China, Japan, and across the Indo-Malayan                   archipelago into Sulawesi (Celebes) and the Philippines.  There                 are approximately 20 species of ricefishes classified in four                   genera.  Despite the broad use of ricefishes in experimental                    biology, including the fields of genetics and embryology, and                   their intriguing distribution pattern that spans many traditional               biogeographic boundaries in the Indo-Australian region, little is               known about the comparative anatomy and evolutionary                            relationships among the species.                                                        This research project will focus on the goal of                         reconstructing the evolutionary history of ricefishes using                     comparative anatomical and developmental data.  Freshwater fishes               will be collected in Sulawesi (pending final permission to                      collect) and Madang Province, Papua New Guinea so that we have a                better understanding of fish fauna of these geologically complex                islands.  A hypothesis of the distributional history of                         ricefishes and their close relatives will be used as a basis for                understanding the complex evolution and distribution of the Indo-               Australian biota.",
