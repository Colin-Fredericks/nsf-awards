 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work seeks to develop a quantitative understanding of the                  variables that influence the activity and selectivity of the                    reactions of hydrocarbons over supported metals.  The work is                   relevant both to the catalytic production of hydrocarbons                       (including synfuels) and to the activation of hydrocarbons and                  their  conversion into more complex products for use as                         industrial feedstocks, fuels, or other end uses.  Simple                        hydrocarbons are studied over supported metals having different                 physical morphologies in the presence and absence of coadsorbed                 species.  The adsorbed hydrocarbon species are characterized                    using transmission infrared spectroscopy and the rates of                       transformation into more stable surface species are monitored                   using in situ infrared techniques.  Attempts are made to measure                the rates of carbon-hydrogen and of carbon-carbon bond scission                 and to quantify the effects of particle size and morphology on                  the concentration and inherent reactivity of adsorbed hydrocarbon               fragments.  The study emphasizes the behavior of two-carbon                     hydrocarbons (ethane, ethylene, and acetylene) on crystallites of               nickel or platinum supported on alumina or silica.",
