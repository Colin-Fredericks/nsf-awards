 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Tertiary gabbroic dikes of the Kangerdlugssuaq region,              East Greenland, offer for study the products of a natural                       laboratory experiment on the chemical and physical processes                    that occur when mafic magmas incorporate blocks of wall rocks.                  A combination of superb glaciated alpine outcrops, structural                   relief of 1 km, and good background studies of field relations                  and igneous petrology (including the classic work of Wager,                     Deer, and others on the Skaergaard Intrusion) make this an                      ideal study area.  It should be possible to make a definitive                   test of the competiting hypotheses of wholesale vs. selective                   chemical contamination.  The mechanisms of chemical interaction                 and mechanics of mixing hybrid magmas may be determined by                      direct observation of the abundant, remarkably clean outcrops.                          It is proposed to use a multi-disciplinary array of                     methods including field, geochemical, isotopic, and experimental                techniques to test the hypothesis that gabbros were selectively                 contaminated by remobilized sialic basement and hydrothermally                  altered basalt wall rocks.  The geochemical data will be used                   to evaluate existing models of assimilation - fractional                        crystallization and to refine such models, if necessary.  The                   results should materially aid understanding the physics and                     chemistry of crustal contamination, a process essential to the                  accurate interpretation of geochemical characteristics of                       continental volcanic rocks and consequent deductions regarding                  the nature of subcontinental mantle.",
