 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current practice in earthquake engineering is to model earthquake-              induced strong ground motions as accelerations occurring at single              locations; or at most to use simple physical wave propagation models            employing simple waveforms.                                                                                                                                     This research program will develop a description of the spatial                 variation of earthquake ground motions that models observed motions,            using data from strong-motion seismograph arrays.  In addition, the             effects of these spatial variations in ground motion on the response of         structures will be studied.  The investigation will utilize digital             signal processing techniques, simulation of correlated multiple                 excitations, random vibration analysis, and deterministic dynamic               analysis.                                                                                                                                                       The research has direct application to the design of structures on large        foundations, such as dams and containment structures for nuclear power          plants; to spatially extended structures with multiple supports such as         occurs in long-span bridges and surface pipelines; and to long buried           structures, including electric power, telecommunication, oil, gas, water        and sewage lifelines.                                                                                                                                           The principal investigator is highly qualified and has the institutional        facilities available to undertake the proposed research program.",
