The Bureau of the Census proposes to interview the                industry officials who complete the annual questionnaires so that               the companies' data can be reported more completely and                         consistently.  In addition, information acquired in this project                will allow NSF to evaluate the current survey instrument and                    improve it and its instructions.  As a result, survey responses                 from all companies should be more complete and consistent in                    future years.                                                                        The survey, a vital element in NSF's efforts to measure                    scientific and technological activities in industry, collects                   data on dollar volume of research and development, sources of                   financing, employment of R&D scientists and engineers, and other                economic characteristics of industrial performance.  The survey                 data provide policy makers with a broad range of statistical                    information for industrial research and development spending and                employment.  Therefore, the Foundation desires to maintain,                     through this response evaluation, the high quality of the data                  collected and tabulated in the survey.",
