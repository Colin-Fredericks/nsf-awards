 "awd_abstract_narration": "A modern, high technology-oriented physiology laboratory to support the         physiology and cell biology courses is being equipped through this              award.  These courses constitute an integral part of the Biology program        and are fundamental to the students' understanding of life processes.           Explanations of biological phenomena are increasingly sought at the             biochemical level, and are arrived at by employing sophisticated,               instrument-oriented techniques such as radioactive labeling of cellular         components, spectro-photometric analyses of enzyme activities and               metabolic concentrations, and chromatographic procedures for  separating        complex mixtures into their individual components.  A UV/VIS                    spectrophotometer, a high pressure liquid chromatographic system, and a         computer link-up that provides instrument control and data analysis are         being added.  At least three courses are benefitting directly.  In              addition, a new instrumentation course is being developed.                                                                                                      In the field of modern molecularly-oriented biology, skill in the use of        these techniques and supportive instruments is second only in importance        to the students' understanding of the biological concepts for which they        are employed.",
