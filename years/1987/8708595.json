 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organometallic compounds are frequently used as catalysts for the               conversion of one organic compound into another.  Unfortunately,                such conversions often result in mixtures of isomers, i.e.,                     molecules comprised of the same atoms, but differing in their                   three-dimensional structures.  This project involves the                        synthesis of highly unsymmetrical organometallic compounds                      designed to function as more specific catalysts to control the                  three-dimensional structures of reaction products.  The three-                  dimensional structures of organic molecules are especially                      important in biological reactions, and these organometallic                     compounds are often used in the laboratory synthesis of natural                 products.                                                                                                                                                       Research will be undertaken to develop new methods using metal                  complexes for asymmetric and regioselective syntheses and to                    elucidate the mechanisms of stereoselective reactions which are                 synthetically useful.  The potential utility of higher oxidation                state organometallic complexes for these applications will be                   explored.  X-ray crystallography has become a routine tool for                  structural characterization in solids.  However, many                           organometallic compounds rearrange or exist as mixtures of                      conformational isomers in solution.  It has been shown in this                  laboratory that the stability of these conformers plays a major                 role in the distribution of product stereochemistry.  Reactive                  intermediates and catalytic species often exist in lower                        concentrations and cannot be isolated as solids.  A new method                  will be developed to elucidate detailed structural information in               solution.  This will involve the design and synthesis of ligands                containing paramagnetic metal ions which bind to organometallics.               The isotropic shifts and the effects of field alignment produced                by these paramagnetic ligands will allow detailed delineation                   (angles and distances) of intermediates and catalytic species in                solution.",
