 "awd_abstract_narration": "Charged-coupled devices (CCDs) are being increasingly used as sensitive         imaging devices on small optical telescopes.  The high quantum                  efficiency and low noise of these array devices permit their use as             faint object detectors, so that a small telescope equipped with a CCD           camera is operationally equivalent to the largest astronomical                  telescopes of a decade ago.  Colgate University will acquire a high             sensitivity cryogenically cooled CCD array imaging system for use with          its campus 16-inch telescope to train students in techniques of high            accuracy spatial and intensity measurement.  Use of the CCD camera              system will enable students to work with recent technology such as              electronic array detectors, cryogenics, electronics, microcomputers,            computer interfacing, computer programming, image analysis, as well as          fundamental astronomical research.  There are a wide range of                   astronomical projects which can be conducted by undergraduate students          with this instrumentation:  imaging of extended or faint objects such as        galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters to study their structure and               composition; search for the study of transient events such as supernova         in distant galaxies, flaring in cataclysmic variable stars and dwarf            novae, and motions and changes in appearance of comets and asteroids;           monitoring of the optical continuum spectrum and time variability in            stars, quasars, and active galaxies.  With a device capable of sensing          faint astronomical objects, students will become involved in research,          using recently developed electronic instrumentation, which is                   representative of projects being conducted by professional scientists.",
