 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research proposed here will investigate the                         quantitativegenetic basis of brain and body size variation in                   randombredlaboratory mice.  The magnitudes and correlations of                  two kinds ofgenetic differences will be examined: those caused by               anindividual's own genes, and those caused by its mother's                      genes,through the prenatal and postnatal environments that she                  providesfor her offspring.  These will be assessed by examining                 therelationship between observed and theoretical similarities                   amongrelatives.  Knowledge of these components could help                       resolvedifferences between current models of evolution of brain                 and bodysize, and maternal genetic variance may play a key role                 in life.history evolution.  Also, measurements of these and other               traitsfor many mammals will be used to determine evolutionary                   patternsat different taxonomic levels, and relate these to                      differences inprenatal, postnatal and other components of growth                that might beinfluenced by direct and maternal genetic effects.                 Geneticevolutionary mechanisms that can produce these patterns                  will bemodeled.                                                                         The results will provide new information about the                      relativeimportance of maternal genetic differences to growth of                 offspringbrain and body sizes.  Also, the research addresses                    thefundamental biological relationship between genetic                          differences(maternal and offspring), individual growth, and                     evolutionarychange.  Other areas that depend upon knowledge of                  genetic andenvironmental influences on growth, such as animal                   improvement,might also benefit from the basic research proposed                 here.",
