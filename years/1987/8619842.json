 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Jeffrey B. Nugent, University of Southern California, leads           a collaborative research project on New Institutional Economics (NIE)           and Economic Development in Tunisia involving scholars at the                   University of Southern California and the University of Tunis,                  Tunisia.  His main collaborator is Professor Mustapha K. Nabli, who             heads the project's counterpart group at the Economics Department,              University of Tunis.  NIE analyzes the effect of institutions on                economic behavior and explains why institutions change over time,               whereas traditional economic theory overlooks institutions.                     Considering the influence of institutions in economic analysis leads            to different conclusions compared to other forms of analysis and NIE            has changed interpretations of findings in macroeconomics, labor                economics, health insurance, military procurement, and other economic           topics.  NIE is especially useful in situations where institutional             change is likely to be an important factor in drawing economic                  conclusions, such as in developing countries.  Despite its potential,           NIE has not been greatly used to describe the economics of developing           countries.  This is the topic of interest for Dr. Nugent's and Dr.              Nabli's group, and they have done several studies in Tunisia.  The              country offers good case material for NIE analysis, because of its              changing institutional structures.  The two research groups have                exchanged graduate students and research visits for several years.                                                                                              The support from this award will allow the researchers to come                  together to synthesize the results of their past work and to plan               their next steps.  The award will fund visits of the American                   researchers to a meeting in Tunis with their Tunisian counterparts and          return visits by Tunisians to the University of Southern California.            Drs. Nugent and Nabli plan to publish a volume summarizing their work           and to prepare articles on specific topics.  The proposed cooperation           allows the U.S. investigators to use data sources abroad that are not           easily available to them in the U.S.",
