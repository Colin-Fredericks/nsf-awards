 "awd_abstract_narration": "A triaxial loading frame with a freezer attachment, high-speed                  microcomputer, and electromechanical transducers will be procured to            provide necessary support for several research projects in the                  geotechnical area.  The acquisition of this equipment will bear                 directly on research on stress-strain behavior of fine-grained granular         materials, frozen geomaterials, and new liner materials for isolation           of hazardous waste.  The microcomputer will be integrated with other            equipment such as the triaxial device, a newly developed multiaxial             device, direct shear apparatus, and permeability apparatus.  This               microcomputer is designed for a multiuser environment, and provides the         necessary speed for a multiple-experiment environment.  The triaxial            equipment with freezer chamber will be used in studying fracture                mechanics of frozen geomaterials.  The freezer chamber is detachable so         the equipment can be used for other projects as well.  The equipment            will be used primarily in four ongoing research projects dealing with           stress-strain behavior of mine tailings materials, fracture mechanics           of frozen geomaterials, strength and deformability of new liner                 materials, and stabilized grouts.",
