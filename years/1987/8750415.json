The associated course is aimed at EE seniors and is                comprised of a set of experiments which broadly exhibit the use of              digital processing within EE systems.  Eight similarly equipped student         stations plus a central station for one-of-a-kind equipment form the            ensemble to be purchased under this grant.  Each station includes a unit        for capturing, processing, and creating electrical waveforms.  These            units are basically general purpose micro-computers augmented with data         acquisition and control modules.  Additional instrumentation to create          and observe signals, to produce output action, and to record results is         proposed also and includes signal generators, transducers, oscilloscopes        and other items of general purpose test equipment.  The laboratory              course is new and self-contained and complements several undergraduate          EE courses for which no supporting physical senses.  Together they              demonstrate:  the basic effects of quantization in time and in                  amplitude; serve action with an imbedded digital processor; random              process phenomena; digital filtering; and signals encountered in                telephony robotics, biomedical instrumentation, et cetera.",
