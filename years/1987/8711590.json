 "awd_abstract_narration": "The polyamines, such as putrescine, spermidine, and                       spermine play an essential role in cell growth and proliferation,               however their precise function in cell metabolism is unknown.  In               cells, the polyamines are closely associated with nucleic acids                 and have been shown to stabilize DNA and chromatin structure.                   This property is similar to that of histones, the basic protein                 found bound to DNA in the nuclei of all higher organisms.  Both                 the histones and polyamines can undergo enzymatic acetylation in                the cell nucleus and can also be deacetylated.  These acetylation               and deacetylation reactions are thought to regulate the binding                 of these molecules to DNA. The primary goal of the proposed                     research is to develop new, selective inhibitors for polyamine                  and histone acetylation and deacetylation, and utilize them to                  elucidate the function of these reactions.  The target for these                inhibitors will include the nuclear acetyltransferases for                      histones and polyamines, the nuclear deacetylases for the                       histones and the cytoplasmic deacetylase for the polyamines.                    Specific compounds will be designed and synthesized for each of                 these enzymes and tested for inhibitory activity in test tube                   assays.  As specific and effective inhibitors are found, they                   will be tested in living cells for their effect on modulating the               level of acetylated histone and polyamine.                                             These new inhibitors will serve as research tools to                     advance our understanding of the function of histones and                       polyamines in normal cell processes.  The significance of                       acetylation and deacetylation on DNA structure and function will                also be enhanced.  Of ultimate interest and significance is the                 role of acetlyation-deacetylation on the specific regulation of                 gene expression.",
