 "awd_abstract_narration": "The geological evolution of the Indian Ocean is the most                poorly understood of all the major ocean basins.  In part this                  has resulted form diversity of approaches and objectives of the                 major research cruises in the Indian Ocean.  Both United States                 and foreign scientists have concentrated on specific tectonic or                sedimentary problems, but no major cruises have concentrated on                 an integrated understanding of its geologic history.  This has                  resulted in a wide distributed and non-uniform data base.  A                    second problem has been the logistical complexity of supporting                 U.S. and foreign cruises in the Indian Ocean, resulting in an                   overall data base in any country that is insufficient to                        adequately address the total history of the ocean basin.                                The objective of the present recommended award is to compile            topographic, magnetic and satellite derived gravity field from                  the Indian Ocean.  U.S. scientists will work closely with French                and Australian researchers to ensure that the data base includes                results from the most recent cruises.  These compilations will be               used to define (1) the early opening history of the Indian Ocean;               (2) the separation of Australia and Antarctica; and (3) the                     closing of the seaway between Indonesia and Australia. Paleodepth               charts will aid in determining the sedimentary history of the                   basins in the Indian Ocean.  The overall compilation will be                    important in integrating existing data with the results of                      drilling planned by the Ocean Drilling Program.                                         This is a coordinated study involving scientists from U.S.              and foreign institutions.  Dr. John Sclater of the University of                Texas has responsibility for overall coordination of the project.               He will be working with Drs. Robert Fisher (Scripps Institution)                and Dr. Steven Cande (Lamont-Doherty).  Drs. Roland Sclich                      (France), Michael Coffin (Australia) and Hugh Bergh (South                      Africa) will provide foreign data.  The principal investigators                 are highly qualified and funding is strongly recommended at the                 following levels:                                                                              FY87 & 88           FY89 & 90                                    Texas          69,785                   73,731                                  Scripps        59,547                   77,665                                  Lamont         75,654              73,141",
