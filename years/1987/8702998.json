 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research encompasses investigations into three problem             areas in the field of stochastic control theory.  In each of the areas,         specific problems are identified for study with the expectation that            theoretical insights and a better understanding of the issues will              evolve from the research.  The three problem areas are:  (i) stochastic         adaptive control: Bayesian adaptive control problems for diffusions are         formulated as partially observed stochastic control problems.  (ii)             control of flexible manufacturing systems:  These problems are                  formulated as control problems with jump markov disturbances.  (iii)            doubly stochastic control problems: Models with stochastic parameters           will be treated as partially observed stochastic control problems and           their solutions will be characterized. In all of the three problem areas        results about specific prototype examples will be stressed with the             objective of obtaining generic solution techniques.                                     This research considers several problems in the general area of         stochastic control theory.  These problems arise in many important              engineering problems such as adaptive control and control of                    manufacturing systems.  By formulating the problems as partially                observed stochastic control problems it is expected that this research          will lead to new methods of characterizing the solution to these                important engineering problems.",
