 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increasing application of lasers in free-space and guided wave              communication as well as remote sensing has created a need for means to         detect laser signals effectively with the desired signal-to-noise ratio         in the presence of strong ambient light.  In the research, a                    fundamentally different approach to discriminating laser signals from           ambient background is devised by taking into account the degree of              coherence of the incident laser signal besides its well-defined                 wavelengths and linewidths.  In this concept, a special coherence               holographic reflecting filter will be fabricated that can discriminate          between light signals of different coherence.  The novel Coherence              Discriminating Reflection (CDR) filters from this research also                 represent a new class of holographic elements fabricated using                  photorefractive crystals (lithium niobate).  In addition to enabling            more effective laser detection, the concept in this research can also           lead to a new scheme of multichannel signal multiplexing and                    transmission, namely Coherence Length Multiplexing (CLM).",
