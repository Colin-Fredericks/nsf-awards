The principal investigators are Professor Thomas Post of the University         of Minnesota and Professor Merlyn Behr of Northern Illinois University.         The PIs will administer two types of written examinations and one oral          interview to teachers from the Minneapolis, Minnesota and DeKalb,               Illinois areas.  The examination topics will include concepts of number         and arithmetical operations, rational numbers, proportional reasoning,          geometry, probability and statistics, pre-algebra, problem solving and          technology.                                                                                                                                                     The PIs will develop and select those learning activities for the               teachers' institute which focus on higher order thinking skills and             understanding processes related to mathematical teaching.  The summer           institutes will run during the summer of 1988.  The academic year               follow-ups include several on-site visits and mini-conferences.",
