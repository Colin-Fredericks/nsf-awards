 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laser vaporization studies have demonstrated the stability              of a family of even-numbered carbon clusters ranging in size from               about 38 to 150 atoms.  It has been suggested that C60, the most                prominent member of this family, has a hollow structure similar                 in shape and structure to a soccerball.  MNDO calculations have                 confirmed the vibrational stability of this structure and have                  shown it to be energetically stable relative to silmilarly sized                graphite chips and other competing structures.  Additional MNDO                 calculations have indicated stability for spheroidal C40, C50,                  and C70 clusters.  This project involves a systematic search for                stable spheroidal structures for the remaining even-numbered                    carbon clusters.  The MNDO caculations will be preceded by graph                theoretical analysis to see which ring combinations are                         topologically possible, and by Huckel calculations to see which                 are likely to have closed shell electronic structures.                                  Hollow carbon clusters of the type described above may play             a role in the formation of soot and the transportation of other                 molecules in interstellar space, and may lead to novel                          lubricants.  A fundamental understanding of these structures is                 needed and is addressed by this project.  Moreover, the project                 will also benefit the infrastructure of U.S. science by providing               exposure of talented undergraduates to advanced computing                       techniques and equipment.",
