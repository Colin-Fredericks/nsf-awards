 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed study uses the available ligule-specific                      mutants to ask how polarized cell divisions are regulated. The                  goal of the study is to test the hypothesis that the                            cytoskeleton plays a structural role in the transmission of the                 genetic information that directs cell division.  The                            hypothesis will be tested characterizing the cytoskeletal                       changes of normal and ligule-specific mutants using                             immunocytochemistry of intact and sectioned leaf tissue.                        Micromanipulation of leaf primordia will test for the time of                   determination of the ligule, and inhibitor experiments will test                for the role of specific cytoskeletal components.  The time of                  DNA synthesis, as determined by autoradiography, will place the                 cytoskeletal changes within the context of the cell cycle.  Since               ligule division is precise and predictable, a comparative study                 with mutant plants will provide a means to isolate specific                     control points during division.  These results will clarify the                 process by which the cytoskeleton participates in the                           establishment of cell polarity during division.                                      In order to completely understand the mechanistic events                   which result in an ordered program in the developing                            organism, it is necessary to use the techniques of genetics, cell               biology, biochemistry, etc.  Too often, however, the                            several binds of expertise are not available to a single                        laboratory and the combined approach is not used.  This                         project brings together genetics and cell biology to ask a                      significant developmental question.  If the cytoskeleton is                     implicated as a conduit of genetic information in the cell by                   this study, the impact will be felt in all aspects of                           biology, not just the area of plant biology.",
