 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal provides a research experience for ten                       undergraduates for an eight week program during the summer.  The                subject matter for this program is applied statistics.  The                     students will participate directly in various projects in the                   community.  They will participate in gathering, entering,                       preparing and analyzing the data.  There will be extensive use of               the computer.  In other words the student will get the full                     benefit of being in the role of a practicing consulting field                   statistician.  There also will be a background set of lectures                  presented to the students.                                                           The following is a list of the projects the students may be                participating in:                                                                      Parasite counts in grazing animals.                                             Inventory sampling procedure.                                                   Pheromone study in shuckworms.                                                  Physical fitness study.                                                         Single cell protein additives.                                                The student should benefit greatly from this \"hands on\"                    experience.  This proposal is being funded througn the Research                 Experiences for Undergraduate program (REU) and represents a good               example of the goals of the program.",
