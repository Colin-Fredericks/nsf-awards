 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ions can be state selected by either photoelectron photoion             coincidence, or by multiphoton ionization.  Both methods will be                used in order to investigate the dependence of the reaction cross               section on the ion internal energy.  By measuring the product ion               translational energy, it is also possible to determine the                      internal energy of the reaction products.  Such state-to-state                  cross sections will be measured for a variety of reactions                      between diatomics, as well as the charge transfer reactions of                  certain triatomic ions with a variety of neutral reaction                       partners.  In addition, the collision induced dissociation cross                sections for particular reactions will be measured with a variety               of collision partners.  The results of these investigations will                provide sufficient information to allow the formulation of models               for the various types of reactions.  The coincidence studies will               be carried out at the synchrotron facility of the University of                 Paris, while the laser based experiments will be carried out in                 Chapel Hill.",
