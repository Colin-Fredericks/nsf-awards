 "awd_abstract_narration": "A two-week institute in parallel computing is proposed.  The            objective is to give approximately 25 graduate and post-doctoral                researchers a fundamental understanding of parallel computing.                  We will present a series of lectures on topics including parallel               architectures for scientific computation, software tools to aid                 in implementing parallel algorithms, use of graphics                            representations in the construction of parallel programs, and                   vectorization.  Participants will then experiment with test                     problems and with a specific application that they have brought                 with them to the institute.  Ample time will be provided on the                 four multiprocessors in Argonne's Advanced Computing Research                   Facility.  Some class time will also be spent reviewing UNIX and                discussing the communications facilities available for local and                remote access to these machines.                                                        The proposed institute will provide an excellent opportunity            for university researchers to acquire knowledge and experience in               the area of parallel computing.  We are hopeful that after the                  institute is over, researchers will continue to use the machines                in the Advanced Computing Research Facility to conduct                          experiments in parallel computing.  Thus the institute will have                the long-term benefit of increasing our understanding of the                    applications for which specific computer architectures are best                 suited.                                                                         ----------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                        This proposl is submitted for support for a two-week,                   twenty-five student institute (workshop) on parallel programming                and computing.  The institute will emphasize software tools,                    parallel algorithms and vectorization as applied to nuThe                       institute is a very important step in bringing parallelism to                   computational science.",
