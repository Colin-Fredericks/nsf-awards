 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides funds for a three week summer workshop for 20             teachers of physics and physical science, grades 7-12, during the month         of July, 1987.  The workshop entitled Experimental Foundations of Waves         and Vibrations will enable the participating teachers, through  the             reenactment of historical experiments in the areas of optics and                acoustics, to study and understand the role of experimentation in               creating scientific knowledge.  The teachers will have the opportunity          to build and assemble the equipment essential for several of the                historical critical experiments in the field.  They will be urged to            take ideas and resources back to their middle and high school classrooms        to enrich their instruction of precollege students and to provide               inservice education for their peers.                                                                                                                            The workshop will be held at the Bakken: Museum and Library of                  Electricity in Life.  The unique facilities of this institution will be         available to the participants.  The staff for the workshop will be drawn        from the Bakken and university scientists.  University of Minnesota             credit will be given to the participants who successfully complete the          workshop.                                                                                                                                                       This project is worthy of funding for the following reasons: it utilizes        an innovative and creative approach to the enhancement of teacher               knowledge in the physical sciences;  the teachers will enrich their             understanding of the historical development of an area of science as            well as increasing their conceptual understanding of the area; the              project is a collaborative effort among a museum, university, private           sector businesses and school districts; and a resource book of physics          experiments will be distributed to physics teachers throughout the state        of Minnesota.",
