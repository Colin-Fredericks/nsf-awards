 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is a Career Advancement Award under the Research                     Opportunities for Women Program. The award will be used to gain                 mastery of biochemical techniques necessary for protein                         manipulation in a project concerned with the mechanisms of                      biological electron transfer. Electron transfer is one of the                   most fundamental biological processes. It is an integral part                   of many metabolic pathways and plays a vital role in the                        utilization of oxygen by biological systems.                                                                                                                    The focus of the research project is electron transfer between                  cytochromes, a family of metalloproteins which undergo electron                 transfer during the utilization of oxygen. The study will focus                 on the three factors which are expected to be the primary                       determinants of cytochrome electron transfer: electrostatics,                   the distance between the two hemes, and protein motion.                         Electron self-exchange rate constants will be measured for:                     a) cytochromes from various species, b) cytochromes with                        derivatized residues, c) cytochromes in which the native heme                   has been replaced with a synthetic heme, d) cytochromes in                      which there is a break in the polypeptide chain, and                            e) cytochromes synthesized via site-directed mutagenesis.                       Self-exchange rate constants will be measured by NMR                            spectroscopy.",
