 "awd_abstract_narration": "During much of the earth's history the climate was warm and                relatively uniform.  The change to the present glacial and                      interglacial periods did not proceed uniformly.  These were                     marked by discrete and sudden coolings which are linked with                    changes in oceanic circulation.  There was a prominent change                   about 38 million years ago, followed by subsequent coolings 14                  million years ago, 6 million years ago, and 3 million years ago.                These intervals are separated by times of much higher stability                 although fluctuations have been defined.                                             Since the last proposal was submitted three years ago, a                   number of high quality hydraulic piston cored sedimentary                       sequences of late Oligocene through Neogene age from the Pacific                have become available for detailed analysis, some of these sites                were drilled during DSDP-IPOD Legs 90 and 89; they form a                       latitudinal transect of unprecedented quality extending from the                equator to the subantarctic in the South Pacific.  These sediment               sections are of great paleoceanographic value.                                       This project wants to further extend paleoceanographic                     studies of middle and late Cenozoic sedimentary sequences in                    middle and low latitudes and to correlate with events found                     elsewhere; the major objectives are:  to continue time-series                   analysis of paleoceanographic history; to examine events during                 the terminal Miocene, the middle and late Pliocene; to define the               main quantitative changes as they are preserved in                              planktonic/benthonic foraminifera.",
