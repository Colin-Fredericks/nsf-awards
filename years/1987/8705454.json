 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research deals with the problems of designing and building                 practical, custom VLSI-based computers for lattice calculations.  These         computational problems are characterized by being iterative, defined on         a regular lattice of points, uniform in space and time, local, and              relatively simple.  Examples include numerical solution of differential         equations, iterative image processing, and cellular automata.  The              recently invented lattice gas automata, which are microscopic models for        fluid dynamics, are a testbed for the work.                                                                                                                     The machines envisaged--lattice engines--would typically consist of many        instances of a custom chip and a general-purpose host machine for               support.  In many practical situations, the performance of such machines        is limited, not by the speed and size of the actual processing elements,        but by the communication bandwidth on- and off-chip, and by the memory          capacity of the chip.                                                                                                                                           The specific research consists of three phases to be conducted                  concurrently:  (1) performance analysis of existing architectures, (2)          extension of current theory to give bounds on achievable throughput rate        as a function of chip I/O bandwidth and memory capacity for the                 particular lattices of interest, and (3) construction and testing of            prototype machines.                                                             Examples of computational problems amenable to lattice calculations             include the numerical solution of differential equations, iterative             image processing, and cellular automata.  These are all very important          problems.  The focus of this project on the problems of designing and           building practical custom VLSI-based computers aimed specifically at            this class of calculations offers the potential of much faster problem          solutions than on general-purpose computers.",
