 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims to develop a unified framework for                   integrating surveys so as to guide the design of a multi-purpose                survey program.  Algorithms will be developed for optimal                       integration based on more than one objective function and for                   sequential integration of surveys.  The investigators will                      attempt to use the one-to-one correspondence between general                    sampling schemes and unit-by-unit sequential sampling to reduce                 the size of the underlying transportation problem, thereby                      expediting the solution of the integration problem and, in                      certain cases, providing solutions in simple closed form.                               This research addresses the problem of integrating surveys.             The problem of designing a cost-effective sampling program for                  two or more surveys which maximize the overlap between the old                  and the new samples is known to be of considerable practical                    interest in the design of large-scale periodic and multi-purpose                surveys.  Although this problem has been studied for several                    decades, no unified theory for it has yet been developed.  The                  object of this project is to develop a unified framework within                 which to evaluate the integration of surveys.  New algorithms and               computer software will be developed for optimal integration of                  surveys under general sampling schemes.  Optimality properties of               these and other existing methods will be evaluated.",
