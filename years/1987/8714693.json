 "awd_abstract_narration": "An interdisciplinary conference on inverse design methodology                   will be held at the Pennsylvania State University, October 26                   through 28, l987.  Inverse design is the process by which the                   desired boundary parameters are prescribed with certain                         constraints and the boundary shapes are to be determined.  For                  example, if the surface temperature distribution is given one                   then wishes to find the shape of the surface for a given total                  heat flux or given bounds on the acoustic power output from an                  oscillating body of fixed volume find the shape of the body that                will result in the most uniform radiation pattern.                                                                                                              The goal of this interdisciplinary conference is to review the                  global state of the art and to provide for a unique forum for the               exchange of ideas between the various disciplines.   The                        Conference shall be comprised of six invited lectures and a                     number of refereed contributed technical papers. In addition to                 the National Science Foundation the Office of Naval Research is                 also providing partial support for this Conference.",
