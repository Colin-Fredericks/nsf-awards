 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robust adaptive control is one of the most promising and most           active research areas in systems and control theory.  During the last           two years major causes of nonrobust behavior have been discovered and           means to counteract instability mechanisms have been recommended.  A            sharp stability-instability boundary can now be determined using a              signal dependent criterion.  To extend the validity of this linearized          result, the concept of a slow integral manifold is proposed.  This              concept will be used as a nonlinear geometric-asymptotic tool in the            research.  The goal of this research is to employ a priori information          about the plant and signals in order to reduce the complexity of the            adaptive controller and thus improve its robustness.  This is to be             achieved by removing matchability and positive realness assumptions             and allowing problem specific reduced parameterizations.  A pseudo-             gradient approach will be developed to guarantee local convergence.             The practically guaranteed region of convergence will then be                   maximized by nonlinear geometric -asymptotic methods, including an              analysis of in-manifold and off-manifold bounds.  A preliminary                 pseudo-gradient scheme is described as a possible starting point for            more general designs.",
