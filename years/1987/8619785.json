 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives and Relevance to Program Objectives:  This recommended award         would support collaborative research between Professor Charles A.               Angell, Purdue University, and Professor L.M. Torell, Chalmers                  University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.  They will continue their         work on the elucidation of time-dependent processes in potentially              important solid state electrochemical device media.  Specifically, they         plan to (a) make direct comparisons of experimental and computer                simulation results of glass transitions on picosecond time scales, (b)          test predictions from their former work about separate and                      distinguishable relaxations due to total structure and mobile cation            substructure in certain ionic liquid systems, and (c) produce the first         complete non-cryogenic picosecond relaxation process observed in a              glassy solid.  Additionally, they will compare short-time mechanical and        electrical relaxation processes in salt + polymeric solvent systems, and        they will try to extend their work to certain liquid and glassy oxide           systems, such as P2O5, using light-scattering methods, and to certain           geochemical glasses for which high temperature glassy state                     compressibility data are needed.  Professors Angell and Torell have             successfully worked together in the past.  Their two laboratories               emphasize opposite ends of the relaxation time spectrum, so their               research is strengthened by the different expertise and equipment of            each setting.  Their joint work has permitted research on single                relaxation processes over a large range of times.  The project thus             contributes to an important objective of NSF's cooperative science              programs with Western Europe, which is to stimulate scientific progress         by bringing together scientists from the U.S. and Europe who have               similar research interests and who wish to engage in mutually beneficial        research cooperation.  Funds from this award would support partial              transportation and subsistence expenses for the U.S. principal                  investigator and members of his research group, as well as other minor          costs directly related to the collaboration.                                                                                                                    Merit of Proposal:  The cooperating U.S. and foreign investigators are          respected for their previous research accomplishments, and there is a           very good prospect that this proposed research will lead to a                   significant contribution to scientific knowledge.  The proposed                 cooperation presents the U.S. investigators with the opportunity to work        with a leading foreign research group and to use highly specialized             facilities abroad that are complementary to their own.  The work plan is        sound and the budget is reasonable.  Previous collaboration between             Professors Angell and Torell has been productive, and the likelihood of         additional mutual benefit from a continuation of the joint effort is            high.                                                                                                                                                           Funding:  This award will not duplicate other funding.  The principal           investigator receives project support from NSF's Division of Materials          Research, Solid State Chemistry Program, Grant No. DMR-8304887. This            recommended INT award would fund the addition of an important                   international dimension to that research project.  The principal                investigator receives other support for the domestic aspects of his             research from the Department of Energy.",
