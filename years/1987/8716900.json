 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continuous aseptic processing and packaging is the most                         revolutionary development food processing has seen in the last                  fifty years.  This technology is rapidly replacing other standard               practices which have been commonplace.  European companies appear               to be incorporating aseptic processing more rapidly then in the                 United States.  U.S. companies now recognize the need for research              to maintain competitiveness.  As a result of an NSF planning grant              (CDR 86-13062) an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center               for Aseptic Processing and Packaging Studies appears to be                      feasible and viable.                                                                 This five-year continuing grant is funding the initiation of               an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Aseptic                  Processing and Packaging Studies at North Carolina State                        University in collaboration with researchers from Virginia                      Polytechnic Institute and State University.  The initial research               program will address Surface Characteristics and Interactions;                  Product Properties; and Non-traditional Processing.                                  Nine companies are expected to be members of the Center                    providing about 75% of the approximately $400,000 per year initial              research budget.                                                                     The Principal Investigator and his colleagues are nationally               recognized experts in their disciplines and have the experience                 and industrial contacts necessary to operate this Center.                            The Center has been coordinated with Drs. Duane Bruley (CBT)               and Frederick Heineken (EET).                                                        The Program Manager recommends that the North Carolina State               University be awarded a five-year continuing grant to be funded as              follows:  $75,000 for the first three years, $50,000 for fourth                 year and $25,000 for fifth year.                                                     An additional $5,000 is recommended for the \"Supplemental                  Funding for Support of Women, Minority, and Handicapped                         Engineering Research Assistants\" Program during the first year.                      Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager                  and/or the Head of The Division of Cross-Disciplinary Research                  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal                   criteria, including the following: (1) extent to which                          university/industry interaction and collaboration is developing;                (2) extent to which the support base for the center is expanding;               (3) extent to which a robust research program is developing.  If                review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support              of the next period of this continuing grant.",
