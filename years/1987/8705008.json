 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research equipment is provided for the configuration of a multiple              spark-gap camera having framing rates of about one million frames per           second.  Its purchase will complement an existing blast-induced                 liquefaction laboratory and field site, where small-scale, blast-               loading field tests in saturated soils are currently performed.                 Research conducted with the multiple spark-gap camera will permit               laboratory tests to be conducted to study the elasto-dynamic behavior           of unsaturated and saturated photoelastic models of soils.  The soil            particles are modeled as a series of round and randomly shaped discs of         different sizes.  This type of modeling provides basic information              about wave velocities, contact stresses (normal and tangential) and             contact duration between particles.  This is all necessary information          for a rigorous analysis of the complex dynamic wave-soil interaction            where nonlinear stress-strain behavior is the norm, providing the               potential for adaptation to experimental modeling of saturated soils.           The multiple spark-gap camera is also expected to show the usefulness           of a new concept, that of the subsurface wave gide, to isolate                  structures form surface vibrations.  This is a concept which may                provide an alternative to the use of trenches and other surface wave            guides, which for the most part are impractical in real world                   applications.",
