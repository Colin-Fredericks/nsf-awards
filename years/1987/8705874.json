 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1978 the University Museum's Collections Management                     Program began with a grant from the National Science Foundation.                The museum's program includes the systematic renovation of the                  storage facilities, conservation, and a computerized inventory of               the collections.  This project continues this important program                 by upgrading the ethnographic collections in the American                       section.  Special attention will be given to the extensive                      collections from the Northwest Coast and South America.  Funds                  are provided for storage equipment and interns to assist the                    project.                                                                             The University Museum, University of Pennsylvania, contains                one of the most outstanding anthropological collections in the                  United States.  The collections come from all the inhabited                     continents of the world.  Museum research programs, which began                 in 1887 with an excavation at Nippur in Mesopotamia, have                       produced many significant collections of well-documented                        archaeological and ethnological materials.  Particular strengths                of the collections lie in the Americas, Egypt, the Near East, the               Mediterranean, West Africa and the Pacific.                                          The University Museum, in conjunction with teaching                        departments in the university, has a long-standing committment to               research.  The collections are in great demand by researchers                   from around the world.  The upgrading of these collections will                 lead to greater accessibility of the collections and encourage                  future research.",
