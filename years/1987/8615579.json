 "awd_abstract_narration": "The hippocampus is a structure in the brain that is                        extremely important for learning and memory.  Dr. Charles Ribak                 is studying the micro anatomy of the hippocampal formation.                                                                                                          The overall objective of this research project is the                      understanding of neuronal circuitry within the rat hippocampal                  formation, including specifically the dentate gyrus and                         hippocampus proper.  He has used a Golgi-electron microscopic                   method to explore the local circuit connections of basket and                   granule cells in the dentate gyrus, mossy cells in the hilus                    and non-pyramidal neurons in CA 1.  The current research will                   utilize a similar approach to analyze other neurons in the                      dentate gyrus and hippocampus proper.  First, non-granule cells                 in the outer 2/3's of the molecular layer will be analyzed to                   determine where their axons synapse and if their dendrites and                  somata are contacted by terminals which also contact granule                    cell dendrites.  Second, the ultrastructural features and                       synaptic connections of other hilar neurons besides the mossy                   cell will be analyzed.  These studies will determine if every                   hilar neuron receives a major synaptic input from granule                       cells.  Third, he will begin an analysis of neurons in the CA 3                 region of the hippocampus.  The initial focus will be to study                  the local axonal connections of basket and pyramidal cells in                   CA 3.  Finally, the last specific aim of this research project                  involves an analysis of the development of symmetric synapses in                the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus.  These synapses are                considered to be GABAergic and inhibitory and an assessment of                  their development will complement existing data on the                          development of excitatory synapses in the dentate molecular                     layer and of the mossy fibers in stratum lucidum of CA 3.                       These experiments will attempt to better define the local                       neuronal circuitry of both local circuit and projection neurons                 in the dentate gyrus and hippocampus proper.",
