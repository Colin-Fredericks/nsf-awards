 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to provide electrical engineering                   undergraduate students with a unique, low cost and modern approach to           laboratory instrumentation, circuit and system design.  A prototype             computer workstation has been created that allows the students to               quickly access hardware and software programs so they can do both               analysis and design of circuits and systems.  The equipment to be               purchased will extend the capabilities of the workstations and provide          an adequate number to service the entire electrical engineering                 curriculum.                                                                                                                                                     A/D and D/A converters and software added to the personal computers will        allow real time digital control, data acquisition and signal processing.        Digital scope interfaces will make the computer a storage scope and will        allow signal analysis via computer programs.  A logic interface turns           the personal computer into a powerful, menu driven logic analyzer.  With        powerful software design tools and interface hardware the students can          design, simulate, and test circuits and systems from the computer               workstation.",
