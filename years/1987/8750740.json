Students will have the opportunity to access large data bases,        perform more sophisticated statistical analyses, and produce maps,              graphs, and charts in a much less time consuming manner.  This will             allow more time for material research and report writing, as well as            encouraging additional in-depth data analysis and graphic presentation.         The proposal will continue the computer applications upgrading begun by         the Department in the middle l970's as part of an ongoing effort at             affording geography students the best education possible within the             discipline with regard to both personal enrichment and career                   opportunities.",
