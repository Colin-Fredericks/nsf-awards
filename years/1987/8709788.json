 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Waage's research has three related goals. Although the work focuses on one species of insect, it has wider relevance to the question of how  habitat and female behavior interact and how they in turn influence male behavior, and it contributes to the general methodology for experimental testing of hypotheses under field conditions. Dr. Waage's first goal is to continue to develop methods for testing hypotheses about the causes of behavior under field conditions.  This is important because many species cannot be raised in captivity and because        experiments done under simplified laboratory conditions may often not reveal much about about what goes on in nature.  Dr. Waage's choice of damselflies as research animals stems from his familiarity with their  biology and his ability to manipulate individuals and their habitat.  For example, his research will involve creating, removing, and altering   egg-laying (oviposition) sites to test what features of them or their           locations are important for choice of these sites.    Determining what influences the choice of oviposition sites by females   and by males of the damselfly Calopteryx maculata- is Dr. Waage's second    goal.  Oviposition sites (vegetation in streams) are key resources for   individuals of both sexes.  Females use them as places to put their  eggs, and males defend them and use them as places to encounter females.    Dr. Waage will investigate what features of oviposition sites and  surrounding vegetation make them attractive to males and females.  He  will also investigate why there is so much temporal and spatial  variation among sites in their use by males and females.  Answering the  simple question of what determines oviposition-site choices by C. maculata actually may help explain much of male and female behavior and    the interactions between the sexes.  Although this work is on one   species, the findings will contribute to the general body of information        on how insects deal with finding and exploiting resources.  The third goal of this project is to test a number of general ideas  currently in the behavioral-ecology literature.  Like most rapidly  growing disciplines, theory in behavioral ecology is far ahead of its   testing.  Dr. Waage will focus on the idea that female behavior (for   example, where they lay eggs) may underlie or determine much of male  behavior (for example, male choice of places to look for females, or   competition among males for access to such places).  Behavioral ecology    has long been biased towards explaining things from the male  perspective.  These damselflies seem to be ideal animals with which to  explore how male and female behaviors are related.  Together with Dr.  Waage's previous work, this project should enable him to show how female egg-laying behavior influences male behavior and how, in turn, male- female interactions influence the process of location and use of   important resources.",
