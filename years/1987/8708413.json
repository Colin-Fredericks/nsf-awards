 "awd_abstract_narration": "X-ray diffractometry is a standard method for identifying               and characterizing mineral phases in geological research.  This                 proposal requests 50% of the cost of acquiring a modern x-ray                   diffractometer system to be installed in the Department of                      Geology of the University of Missouri in Columbia.  The unit                    will replace a 25 year old instrument which is no longer                        functional for research purposes.  Major current research                       projects in the department requiring x-ray diffractometry                       include the study of low-temperature chemical alterations                       altering the reservoir properties of Tertiary sandstone oil                     reservoir rocks, the effects of homoionic clay interactions on                  laboratory pyrolysis of kerogen (a petroleum precursor), and                    surface properties of mixed-layer illite-smectite clays from                    Gulf Coast sediments.  Much of this research focuses on basic                   problems of the origin, migration and recovery of oil.  In                      addition to its use by researchers in the Department of Geology,                the diffractometer will be used by members of the Nuclear                       Research Center, Dalton Research Center, and the departments of                 physics, chemistry, and mechanical & aerospace engineering at                   Missouri.  The university will contribute the remaining 50% of                  the cost of purchasing the equipment.",
