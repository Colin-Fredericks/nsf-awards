 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is increased interest in constructing buildings, dikes, and               highways over marginal sites with compressible, fibrous, organic soils          such as peat.  The purpose of the proposed research is to develop               laboratory techniques and theoretical models to characterize the                behavior of peat soils under compression.  This activity will be focused        on developing predictive methodology that can be used in engineering            design of embankments and other foundations that must be constructed on         peat soils.  It is planned to verify the predictive models by field             testing.  The combination of theoretical modeling, laboratory                   experiments and field testing should provide reliable guidelines for            predicting and design against settlement.                                                                                                                       The PI is well-qualified to conduct this research.  His past                    accomplishments have demonstrated that he is experienced and                    knowledgeable in the proposed area of research.  An award is                    recommended.",
