 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the design of a complex object, such as a VLSI circuit, evolves,        many subcomponents are designed in parallel.  Conflicts can arise when          subcomponents fail to meet the specifications that are assumed at a             higher level, and conflicts can also arise when two different                   representations of the same object, such as the circuit and logic               representations, become inequivalent due to changes in one                      representation that are not reflected in the other.                                  This research project will investigate techniques for automatically        detecting the presence of conflicts through the information stored in an        engineering information system and will explore tools and methods for           resolving detected conflicts.  The process of conflict recognition will         be characterized by the use of complete and formally correct methods to         identify and classify all potential conflicts.  Conflict resolution will        rely on artificial intelligence techniques involving the use of encoded         heuristic rules of thumb and human intervention as necessary.   The goal        of this research is to construct a skeletal set of formal results on            conflict detection, enumeration, classification, and minimization,              tailored to the VLSI design process but applicable to other design              domains.",
