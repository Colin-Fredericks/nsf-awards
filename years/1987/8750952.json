The advent of                 inexpensive, easy-to-use and reliable dye lasers makes it possible to           introduce a variety of experiments into physical science programs at the        undergraduate level.  Students in the Departments of Physics and                Chemistry will use the lasers and auxiliary detection equipment to              perform a variety of experiments including:  the measurement of the             speed of light in air and liquids, studies of one and two photon                fluorescence, the use of Raman scattering to study the structure of             molecules, and the detection of subnanogram amounts of toxic aflatoxins         from grain samples.  The experiments developed in this project will be          made available to other schools to extend the impact, and prepare more          students for careers in the physical sciences.",
