 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cleveland Museum of Natural History contains over two               million specimens and related documents in their archaeology and                physical anthropology collections.  These objects were gathered                 in a systematic fashion on many research expeditions and as such                contain a valuable resource for anthropological research.                               The museum has completed several collections managment                  projects in the past, making the collections safe and accessible                to researchers. However, the documentation that accompanies these               collections is in need of improvement.  To date, this information               has been inaccessible, damanged by continuous use, and  proven                  time consuming to use.  With this grant, the museum will be able                to computerize and cross index its collections papers.  This will               produce a data base that can be used by several researchers                     simultaneously and prevent serious deterioration of the resource.                       The collections of the Cleveland Museums of Natural History             are used by scholars from all over the world.  They are the basis               for significant anthropological and interdisciplinary research.                 With this improvement grant, the collections will be even more                  accessible and will stimulate integrated and comparative                        research.",
