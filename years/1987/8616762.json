 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will allow the PI to analyze secondary data pertaining               to the sex ratio (girls versus boys) in the Northern plains                     region of India.  There is a scarcity of girls relative to boys                 in this region, while proportions of the sexes in southern and                  eastern India are more nearly equal.  The PI has published                      statistical analyses of comparable data but recent research by                  other scholars, at the national as well as the local level in                   India, has shed additional light on patterns and causes of the                  son preference/daughter disfavor complex.  The most compelling                  issue pertains to class differences.  The PI has argued that in                 rural North India propertied groups discriminate more heavily                   against daughters than unpropertied groups.  Others argue that                  daughter disfavor is the result of poverty and thus is more                     prominent in lower social strata.  The research will explore                    class patterns and their determinants through analysis of recent                census data and information in ethnographic sources.                                                                                                            This research is important because the causes of parental                       preferences for girls or boys in peasant societies have                         significant potential effect on world population patterns.",
