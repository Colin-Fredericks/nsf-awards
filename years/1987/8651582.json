 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore strategies for using students' mathematical           errors that will examine the potential of errors to motivate and direct         activities involving problem generating, problem solving, and critical          thinking.  This is in contrast to the current practice that focuses             solely on obtaining correct answers and eliminating errors as quickly as        possible.                                                                                                                                                       A combination of conceptual and empirical investigations will be                employed.  This approach will include the in-depth study of several             errors to unravel their potential to motivate creative activities; the          development of instructional material which makes use of such potential;        a conceptual analysis of the possibility of using errors as motivation          and means for inquiry with different audiences; the analysis of                 students' reactions to implementations of the strategy in instructional         contexts at the secondary level, both in natural classroom settings and         in \"teaching experiments\" with small groups.                                                                                                                    Findings from this research should assist in understanding the role of          errors in education and lead to further occasions in mathematics                instruction for crucial activities such as problem solving and critical         thinking.  Though this project will focus on the use of errors in               mathematics instruction at the secondary level, it will create the basis        for the application of a reconstructed view of the educational role of          errors with other audiences and in other subject areas.                                                                                                         This project addresses the Directorate primary goal of advancing the            quality of mathematics instruction through exploratory research and             development on a new strategy that recognizes the epistemological value         of trial and error in the historical development of mathematical ideas          and algorithms.  It will also generate prototype instructional materials        that will incorporate this approach with the potential for use by               classroom teachers; consequently, co-funding is being provided by the           Instructional Materials Development Program.  The PI is a young                 researcher who is well-qualified to conduct this research.",
