 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has long been perceived that control of the flow to a                   gas bearing might aid in stiffening or stabilizing it.  There                   is rapidly increasing interest in precision instrumentation and                 machine tools, and bearings may provide convenient adjustment                   points in their structures for compensating thermal distortion,                 effects of load movement, and vibration.  This research is                      designed to exploit the potential for feedback control in the                   gas supply.  The parameters to be examined include:  gas                        bearings as vibration isolators, stabilization of pneumatic                     hammer, stiffening and stabilization of dynamic systems, and                    positioning over an absolute frame of reference.                                     The industrial potential for these applications in                         principally in high precision instruments and machine tools to                  control static deformation and dynamic force transmission.  An                  actuator invented in the program promises much broader                          applications.  Control of pneumatic hammer offers much broader                  application in that bearing stiffness and bearing load may be                   increased beyond the present limits.",
