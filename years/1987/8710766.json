 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to analyze the initiation and organization of           lateral root meristems in radish (Raphanus sativus) where large numbers         of meristems can be induced to develop synchronously and rapidly.  By           analysing patterns of protein profiles generated by in vitro translation        we will determine times at which to produce cDNA libraries from which to        isolate probes for genes that are expressed uniquely or preferentially          in a staqe-specific manner in the organizing meristems.  These probes           will then be used to examine the tissue and cellular location of gene           products, and to examine whether homologous genes are expressed in other        types of meristems, such as the shoot apical meristem, or in meristems          of other species.  Our experiments will be aided by the use of                  primordiomorphs formed in gamma plantlets or by colchicine treatment.           Primordiomorphs are meristems formed in the absence of cell division,           and in them we will be able to examine the relationship between                 molecular genetic events and a requirement for cell divisions at                specific stages of meristem initiation and organization.                            Apical meristems are initiated in the embryo of vascular plants and         function directly, or indirectly through the formation of other                 meristems, to produce the entire post-embryonic organism.  The                  initiation and organization of meristem function in localized groups of         cells at specific sties is a major event in establishing the patterns of        plant development. Little is known of the molecular genetic events that         control the developmental pathway of meristem formation, or how these           events are related to observable chanages in cellular and tissue                structure.",
