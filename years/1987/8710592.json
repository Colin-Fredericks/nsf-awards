 "awd_abstract_narration": "Corn is well suited for the study of genetic control of                    embryo morphogenesis in plants.  Embryo-lethal mutants                          defective in morphogenesis have been identified and                             characterized but the involved genes have not been isolated.                     Dr. Janice Clark has worked with these mutants in the                          laboratory of Dr. William Sheridan of the University of North                   Dakota and now will attempt to isolate and characterize these                   developmentally important genes in the laboratory of Dr.                        Jeffrey Bennetzen at Purdue University.  Dr. Bennetzen is                       studying the Mu transposable element of corn and that element                   can be used as a \"tag\" to isolate the desired genes.  After                     they are isolated, the genes will be characterized and the                      mutants will be developmentally analyzed.                                            The molecular and developmental analyses provided by                       this study will enhance our insight into the genetic control                    of embryogenesis.  While this type of analysis is being                         productively pursued in Drosophila it has not yet been                          possible in plants and this study should be a first step in                     that direction.",
