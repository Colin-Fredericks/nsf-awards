 "awd_abstract_narration": "A transportable image analysis computer system is being used for the            objective acquisition, analysis, and presentation of diverse imagery            data collected in the field and laboratory.  Primary goals in the               extensive undergraduate field projects supported through this award are         to illustrate limitations on population distributions; students thus            uncover major limits at opposite boundaries in zonation along                   environmental gradients.  Nearby marshes on San Francisco Bay provide           gradients between marine, aquatic, and terrestrial environments, both           natural and disturbed.                                                                                                                                          One such set of quantitative experimental field ecology studies is              providing students with valuable insights into field experimentation            through high-resolution, time-lapse monitoring of transplant                    experiments.  Students are comparing the fates of plants (and of                sedentary animals) that have been moved experimentally beyond their             normal zones, with the fates of replaced individuals.  These studies            strikingly illustrate the selection pressures that operate when an              organism attempts to invade a new habitat.  Such modern field                   experimental approaches are preparing students to make practical,               technical, and logical applications of science in their personal lives          and, for some, in environmental careers.",
