 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two year project addresses the mathematical and computer science           needs of 40 Memphis middle and high school teachers of minority students        by providing an intense summer workshop with academic year follow-up.           Le Moyne-Owen, a traditionally Black college, will run this project with        the cooperation of the Memphis Urban Mathematics Collaborative (funded          by the Ford Foundation).                                                                                                                                        The objectives include strengthening the mathematics background,                improving teaching skills, fostering cooperation between teachers and           college faculty, and introducing teachers to the microcomputer and              programming.                                                                                                                                                    During the five week workshop the teachers will study logic, sets,              function optimization, induction and combinatortics, probability,               matrices, linear programming, discrete mathematics and computers. The           teaching strategies include problem solving, development of mathematical        models and teacher presentations.   Teachers will earn three credits for        the course work. The academic year follow-up includes two mini-                 conferences for all participants and on-site visits by the staff to the         teachers' classes.",
