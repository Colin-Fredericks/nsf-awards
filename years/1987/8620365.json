 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides for four lines of research: (1) The testing                 of independent calibration methods to broaden the application of                a free radical detector (the PERCA; see below) to a wider range                 of hydrocarbon peroxy radicals, along with improvements in the                  detector itself; (2) the further optimization of an existing                    fast ozone monitor for eddy correlation measurements; (3) the                   development of a gas chromatograph for measuring atmospheric                    nitrogen dioxide and PAN (peroxyacetyl nitrate); (4) the                        development of systems for measuring the response of molecular                  species to exposure to light (\"j values\").                                                                                                                      PERCA is the acronym for a \"peroxy radical detector using                       chemical amplification.\"  The principal object of measurement is                the transient chemical species formed by the attachment of a                    hydrogen atom to an oxygen molecule (formula: H0 ).  Under                                                                      2                               atmospheric conditions these molecules are constantly being                     produced in the presence of sunlight, and also constantly being                 destroyed in chemical reactions.  A minute concentration may be                 sustained, however, sufficient to confer on H0  an important                                                                  2                                 role in oxidizing other trace species, e.g., nitric oxide (NO).                 It is therefore important to be able to measure these low levels                of HO  and of its hydrocarbon-derived analogues in order to                          2                                                                          construct valid mathematical representations of the total                       atmospheric chemical system.  The PERCA is now operational, but                 further calibration studies are needed in order to extend its                   use to a wider range of peroxy radicals.                                                                                                                        A fast ozone monitor is now operational, but the proposed                       optimization is directed to the development of a simpler device                 of lighter weight better adapted to aircraft measurements of                    upward or downward fluxes of ozone through the atmosphere.                                                                                                      The PAN/NO  chromatograph is a device for field measurement of                            2                                                                     these nitrogen compounds.  PAN is a \"reservoir\" species for                     active nitrogen in the atmosphere and it has deleterious                        biological properties.  Nitrogen dioxide is a principal carrier                 of light energy in atmospheric photochemical systems.                                                                                                           The system for measuring \"j values\" will find use in correlating                the progress of atmospheric photochemical changes with the                      driving force of variable light intensity.",
