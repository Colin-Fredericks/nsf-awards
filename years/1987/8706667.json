 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), thought to              be a key component of the energy budget of stream ecosystems,                   will be investigated in streams draining deciduous forest                       ecosystems of the northeastern United States.  The major goal of                this research is to develop a state-of-the-art synthesis of                     carbon cycling in these stream ecosystems, with an emphasis on                  DOC and microbial processes.  Results from previous NSF-funded                  research will provide most of the data needed to complete the                   synthesis.  New field and laboratory research will be conducted                 to supply data that is essential to the synthesis effort, but is                unavailable either in the existing data sets developed by Dr.                   Bott and his colleagues, or in the literature.                                          For the past eight years Dr. Bott's research group has                  studied carbon cycling in streams draining hardwood forests in                  Pennsylvania.  They have conducted many pioneering processes                    studies on carbon cycling in these streams.  In this new research               they will synthesize information from previous studies and                      interpret it in the context of ecosystem disturbance.  The data-                synthesis effort will culminate in a detailed conceptual model of               the structure and function of streams of the northeast and an in-               depth analysis of how these streams respond to, and recover from,               disturbances such as changes in storm discharge patterns                        associated with land use changes like expansion of agriculture                  and development of suburban housing tracts.                                             The new laboratory and field research will have the primary             objectives of: 1) refining and validating experimental techniques               pertinent to the assessment of DOC utilization in streams: and 2)               obtaining a few key measurements of DOC availability and turnover               rates using these techniques.  These activities are essential to                further studies of the carbon cycle in streams.                                         The research team that will conduct these studies is highly             qualified.  The Stroud Water Research Center will provide                       excellent institutional support for the research.  The Ecosystem                Studies Program recommends award of this grant.",
