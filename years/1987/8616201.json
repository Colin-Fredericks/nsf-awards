 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an investigation of reaction-coupled transport                  associated with PTC (phase-transfer catalysis).  The general                    objectives are to develop and employ novel contacting devices,                  based on rotating-disk hydrodynamics, to investigate the                        chemical-kinetic and transport mechanisms which govern the rate                 of PTC.  Specific projects are:  1) to continue current studies                 of solid-liquid PTC over a rotating disk 2) to develop a novel                  fluid-fluid contacting device, for which a theory is already                    worked out, and to employ it to investigate liquid-liquid PTC,                  and 3) to carry out several exploratory studies of novel                        applications and membrane-based energy transduction based on PTC.               To date, PTC has been studied mainly by chemists, who have now                  discovered hundreds of new organic synthesis having potential                   industrial importance.  At present, not enough quantitative                     knowledge is available on chemical mechanisms and rates to allow                for systematic chemical-reaction engineering and scale-up of PTC                systems.                                                                                                                                                        The novelty in this approach resides in the development and use                 of contacting devices with hydrodynamically variable mass                       transfer characteristics to study PTC kinetics and mass transfer.               The proposed research is expected to have an impact on 1) the                   basic scientific understanding of PTC, 2) the reaction                          engineering and scale-up of PTC reactions, and 3) new applications of           PTC to the coupling of reaction and transport processes                         (\"phoretochemistry\").  In addition, the proposed development of a               novel fluid-fluid contacting device with uniform interface would                contribute to numerous other branches of physicochemical                        hydrodynamics.",
