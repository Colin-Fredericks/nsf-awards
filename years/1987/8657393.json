 "awd_abstract_narration": "Libbrecht has built a telescope designed to measure velocities on               the Sun with very high accuracy.  From the spatial and temporal                 velocity patterns he deduces the precise frequencies of the solar               five-minute oscillations.  Analysis yields, among other                         parameters, the lifetimes of the various modes and the rotation                 of the Sun deep in its interior.  Both observations and theory                  need and will receive refinement to allow further deductions                    about solar convection and solar structure.                                                                                                                     This award is made under the Presidential Young Investigators                   Program to a young physicist who has already excelled in the                    field of solar seismology.  He explores the solar interior using                techniques much like those used in terrestrial seismology to                    explore the interior of the Earth.  He has built and brought into               operation two telescopes suited to measure very accurately both                 the shape and the oscillations of the Sun.  He has demonstrated                 the ability to use the data for significant interpretations.                    Solar seismology promises fundamental new insights into practical               problems such as the understanding of convection and into                       astrophysical problems such as the emission of neutrinos and the                internal rotation of stars.  Libbrecht has shown initiative in                  teaching by building a telescope for the use of undergraduate                   students.",
