 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanism by which estrogen induces proliferation of its               target cells is poorly understood.  Three hypotheses have been                  proposed:  (1), that estrogen acts directly upon the responsive                 cells; (2) that estrogen induces growth factors which in turn                   stimulate the responsive cells; and (3) that estrogen neutralizes               the action of an inhibitor which blocks the responsive cells from               going through the cell cycle.                                                        The goal of this proposed research is to explore the third                 hypothesis.  Evidence has already been presented that such a                    postulated inhibitor exists in mammalian serum, and that it can                 be specifically neutralized by estrogen.  The specific objectives               of this proposal are: (1) to at least partially purify and                      physicochemically characterize the putative inhibitor; (2) to                   search for the body organ which secretes the inhibitor, and                     evaluate the relative usefulness of that organ as a starting                    material vis-a-vis serum for purification; and (3) based on this                information, to design a purification protocol for the inhibitor.               Long-range plans are to test the validity of the inhibitor                      hypothesis using purified inhibitor and defined medium.",
