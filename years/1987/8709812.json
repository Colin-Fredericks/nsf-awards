 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, a renewal of Clark's current NSF-supported                       research project, addresses two central issues in people's use of               language.  The first is how people make sure what they say adds                 to the conversation they are taking part in.  It isn't enough for               them to utter the right sentence at the right time.  In addition,               all the parties to the conversation must try to ground the                      content of that utterance--establish the shared belief that                     everyone has understood it well enough for current purposes.                    Study 1 will investigate how two people ground what is said in a                conversation when they have to deal with occasional                             interruptions.  Study 2 will investigate how listeners infer what               speakers are thinking when they hesitate just before or in the                  middle of an utterance.  Study 3 will analyze the many ways in                  which speakers and their listeners comment on what the speakers                 are actually doing as they speak, with words like uh huh, uh, and               well, and with corrections by the speakers or listeners.  Study 4               will investigate the many techniques by which people accomplish                 grounding.  And study 5 will examine how speakers use these                     techniques for \"saying\" things indirectly or \"off the record\".                                                                                                  The second issue is how speakers and listeners keep track of                    changing perspectives of narratives or other types of discourse,                as when listeners try to follow the viewpoint of the narrator of                a story or the attitude and emotions of a person being quoted.                  Study 6 will devleop a model of quotation, or direct speech, in                 which the quoted words are viewed as a reenactment or                           demonstration of what the quoted person actually did.  Study 7                  will study people's memory for direct vs. indirect speech in                    narratives or stories, and Study 8 will investigate the                         difficulties speakers have in retelling stories in which they                   have to quote themselves and others, and otherwise keep track of                changing perspectives.  Study 9 will examine the perspectives                   people take in making invitations, offers, and compliments that                 are pro forma and not intended to be taken seriously.                                                                                                           What makes this work important is that it investigates                          interpersonal features of communication that are overlooked in                  most studies of language.  These features are crucial to the                    design of complex modern communication systems, especially those                in which computers take the role of speaker or listener.  These                 systems cannot work efficiently, perhaps even at all, unless they               are able to deal with grounding and perspective, both of which                  require the delicate coordination of timing, thought, and actions               by two individuals.",
