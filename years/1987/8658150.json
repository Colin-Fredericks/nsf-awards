 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support to Prof. Petros Maragos under the                   Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) program.  His                research concerns the development of a vision module and more generally         morphological signal processing. The vision module also uses                    morphological signal processing which is an attempt to use structure            such as size and shape in signal processing.  It has been most notably          effective in image and vision processing, where these attributes                correspond to physical quantities.  Prof. Moragos is a basic contributor        in this exciting new field.                                                                                                                                     The PYI Awards program provides research support to the Nation's most           outstanding and promising young science and engineering faculty.  The           awards are intended to improve the capability of U. S. academic                 institutions to respond to the demand for highly qualified science and          engineering personnel for academic and industrial research and                  engineering.  This PYI has made significant contributions to his field          of engineering and has potential to become a leader in academic research        and education.                                                                  The diary note describes the rigorous PYI selection process.  Prof.             Moragos has obtained $34500 of industrial matching funds, thus an award         of $59500 is highly recommended.",
