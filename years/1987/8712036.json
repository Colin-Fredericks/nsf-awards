 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purposes of this research (a one-year pilot program)                are to examine the sediment and isotope geochemistry and                        paleomagnetism of cores from the N.E. Pacific Ocean and to                      establish a framework for later sedimentological,                               micropaleontological, and geochemical studies of the                            paleoceanography and sediment history in conjunction with the                   JOIDES RESOLUTION operations in the region in 1990-1991.  Our                   immediate goal is to establish a regional isotope and carbonate                 stratigraphy using existing cores and material to be collected on               a Canadian cruise to the Gulf of Alaska in August, 1978.                        However, the geochemical information obtained in this study will                also provide important information on outstanding questions                     concerning the history of the N.E. Pacific.                                             Specifically, we will 1) examine the temporal and spatial               behavior of the carbonate compensation depth (CCD) during the                   Quaternary; 2) establish whether North Pacific Bottom Water                     (NPBW) was formed during glacial times; 3) evaluate the history                 and extent of marine and backarc volcanism; and 4) examine the                  effects of climatic change on the provenance, supply, and                       dispersal pathways of continentally-derived material.  If,                      indeed, the North Pacific has been a locus of deep water                        formation, then its history becomes of major importance in                      understanding global climatic change.                                                   The REU supplement will enable a University of Washington               undergraduate to participate in this work and gain valuable                     experience in both observational and analytical aspects of marine               geology.  Under the guidance of the PI, the student will                        participate in core opening, description, and sampling for                      sedimentology, geochemistry, paleo/rock magnetism, and isotope                  analysis.  He will assist in routine paleomagnetic measurements                 and learn to apply quantitative analytical techniques to                        geochemical and paleomagnetic data.  He will also work with the                 PI in the interpretation and synthesis of the results with                      available geophysical data to understand temporal and areal                     patterns of sedimentation.",
