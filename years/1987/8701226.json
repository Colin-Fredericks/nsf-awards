 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for support of a seasonal study of the nitrogen                metabolism of the brown alga Laminaria japonica.  The studies will              focus on the relationships between nitrogen deficiency, nitrate                 utilization and kelp growth with the goal of establishing a productive          fertilization approach for natural populations of the alga while                assessing questions relating to the timing of nitrogen-limited growth.          The work will be conducted by Dr. Boudewijn Brinkuis, SUNY at Stony             Brook, and Dr. Wu Chaoyun, Chinese Academy of Science's Institute of            Oceanology, Qingdao, China, under the terms of the US-PRC Protocol for          Cooperation in Basic Sciences.                                                                                                                                  The proposed research will draw on a vast store of empirical knowledge          which China has accumulated in response to the commercial demand for            kelp (laminaria).  This seaweed is one of the major seaweeds used for           food and chemical extracts and has been mass produced in China since            the early 1950's.  While other studies have been conducted on kelp              species, no studies to date have looked at the commercial kelp,                 Laminaria japonica.  This study, while of potential practical benefit,          will also attempt to answer questions unresolved in earlier research on         nitrogen metabolism in kelp.  Field studies will be conducted in China          and laboratory analyses will take place both in the CAS laboratories in         Qingdao and at SUNY Stony Brook.",
