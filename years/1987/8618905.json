 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new, comprehensive method for the analysis of seismic hazard is               developed to incorporate features of the earthquake source, the                 attenuation of seismic waves, and the effects of local geology and soil.        The new method, based on a fast probability integration scheme developed        in structural reliability, will allow the incorporation of refined              models in the hazard analysis.  It will also allow proper analysis of           model uncertainties and evaluation of sensitivities of the hazard to            various models or parameters.  Alternative measures of ground motion            intensity, including vector representations, will be possible with the          new method. A general-purpose computer code with the above capabilities         will be developed and will be made available to the engineering                 community.                                                                                                                                                      The research will lead to a rational hazard analysis method which breaks        across the interdisciplinary barriers by making use of the expanded             seismic data base available and the better understanding of the physical        process involved by earthquakes achieved lately.",
