 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human behavioral lateralization as preferential hand use has existed at         least throughout recorded history.  Lateralization became a matter of           even greater interest in the present century when it was discovered that        such other human functions as language and spatial abilities are                lateralized between the cerebral hemispheres.  However, the development         of a theory of neural lateralization has been impeded by an assumption          that behavioral functions with lateralized neural mediation are only to         be found in humans.  This view has been particularly strengthened by            studies of nonhuman primates that have concluded that handedness is             characteristic of human primates only.                                                                                                                          Dr. Ward has recently found that prosimians, the most primitive                 primates, do have hand preferences in reaching for food, and that use of        the dominant hand is systematically affected by posture.  This research         project will explore a variety of lateralized behaviors and the factors         that affect their expression in ten species of prosimians.  Two species         will be studied in Dr. Ward's laboratory with a battery of formal tests         and informal observations.  Eight other species will be observed at the         Duke University Primate Center under free-ranging conditions.                   Observations will be videotaped and analyzed for patterns of lateralized        behavior specific to individuals and families, by task, activity, and           posture, and for species-typical patterns.  The data base will permit           Dr. Ward to evaluate the generality of prosimian laterality, will               contribute to development of a biological theory of neural                      lateralization, and will enable scientists to identify suitable animal          models for further study.",
