The program is designed to enable            U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research         institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well          as Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.  Exchange awards provide  unique          or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in           foreign countries.                                                                                                                                              Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to             his/her field of science, the prospective potential of the applicants           for professional growth, as well as criteria relevant to the furthering         of international cooperation in science and engineering.  The program           is particularly directed to scientists and engineers who are embarking          on their research careers.                                                                                                                                      This research project will explore the nature of the colonial                   communities and their internal divisions through an ethnographic                reconstruction of one such community, namely that of the Dutch East             Indies' Sumatran plantation belt.  Through interviews with former               members of the planter and government administrations now living in the         Netherlands, Belgium and France, combined with archival research, the           project will examine some of the social and economic commonalities and          antagonisms out of which they emerged.                                                                                                                          The project is under the direction of Dr. Ann L. Stoler, Assistant              Professor, Department of Anthropology, University of Wisconsin,                 Madison, WI 53706 and Professor Klass W. van der Veen, Chairman,                Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies, University of                  Amsterdam, The Netherlands.                                                                                                                                     This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,              international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents                  allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat            administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
