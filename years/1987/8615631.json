 "awd_abstract_narration": "The summit of Mauna Kea on the island of Hawaii is a premier site for           optical, infrared, and submillimeter astronomical observations.  The            University of Hawaii has access to a wide range of facilities including         the 2.2 meter operated by the Institute for Astronomy, the National             Aeronautics and Space Administration Infrared Telescope Facility, the           Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, and the United Kingdom Infrared                 Telescope.  In order to make best use of these facilities and the               superb atmospheric conditions on Mauna Kea, the Principal Investigator          will undertake the development of Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) detectors         and associated control systems for use on these telescopes.  These              systems will be used in a wide-ranging program of research that                 includes the investigation of the nature of quasi-stellar objects and           the galaxies associated with them, the distances to nearby galaxies,            the motions of star clusters in other galaxies and other programs               requiring very sensitive, geometrically-stable detectors.                                                                                                       Implementation of these detectors will serve not only the Hawaiian              astronomers, but also the international community of astronomers that           uses the telescopes on Mauna Kea.  Information about detector                   performance, image processing techniques, and techniques to optimize            the image quality of telescopes will be of benefit to many users.  The          scientific return is expected to add much to our knowledge of the early         era of our Universe.",
