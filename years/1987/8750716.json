 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry Department at Albion College has based its efforts in             curriculum development and the preparation of instructional materials on        the premise that a chemistry curriculum should: (1) be designed for the         specific students it serves; (2) serve majors and non-majors equally            well; (3) provide maximum flexibility; (4) reflect current practice in          chemistry and chemical education at all levels of the curriculum, both          in the classroom and the laboratory. Current laboratory practice                dictates the involvement of students with modern instrumentation, an            outcome which is being enhanced by the recent acquisition of a nuclear          magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This instrument is being utilized        by students in laboratory courses in organic chemistry, advanced                laboratory instrumentation, and advanced laboratory projects. In                addition the availability of the NMR broadens the range of possibilities        for student research projects.",
