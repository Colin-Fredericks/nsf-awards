 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past dozen years atmospheric scientists have determined              that the hydroxyl radical (OH) apparently plays a pivotal role in               controlling the trace chemical composition of the lower atmosphere              (troposphere).  Hydroxyl radicals (a pair) are produced when an ozone           molecule (O ) is decomposed by ultraviolet light to form an                                3                                                                    energetic oxygen atom which then reacts with a water molecule.  It is           believed that the hydroxyl radical is the primary species responsible           for converting a number of water insoluble reduced chemical compounds           (e.g. methane, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide,               ammonia and others) into condensable and/or water soluble oxidized              species.  It is this oxidation by OH which permits these compounds to           be cleansed from the atmosphere by precipitation or the gradual                 settling of small solid and liquid particles.  Our understanding of             the atmospheric photochemical oxidation process has been developed              primarily by laboratory and computer modeling studies.  To date it              has not been possible to evaluate the completeness of the theory of             tropospheric photochemical cycles.  To test this theory requires                making direct atmospheric measurements of OH and its relationships to           the compounds believed to be responsible for its creation and                   destruction.  The detection of the hydroxyl radical in the ambient              atmosphere has been a primary objective of atmospheric chemists for             the past several years.  The difficulty in measuring this species               results from its exceedingly low concentration in the atmosphere.               Theory predicts OH to be in concentrations one million to a hundred             million times smaller than ozone, its parent compound (which itself             has a tropospheric concentration of less than one part in ten                   million).  The techniques presently available for measuring OH are              not sufficiently sensitive to make the necessary measuremetns in the            atmosphere to study the chemistry of this important species.                        This research is aimed at constructing and testing a portable               instrument for the simultaneous determination of tropospheric OH and            the hydroperoxyl radical (HO ) in clean air at ground level.                                                2                                                   Initial tests will be carried out in the vicinity of Portland and               then at the Oregon coast.  Field measurements will determine the                diurnal variation of OH and HO  in the marine boundary layer at 45                                            2                                                 degrees north latitude.  Perturbation experiments will be carried out           to determine the in situ kinetic response of OH and HO  to changes                                                                    2                         in light intensity.  The observations will be interpreted with                  tropospheric models.  In addition to providing an initial examination           of fast photochemistry and providing data of value to atmospheric               chemists, these experiments will enable the instrument to be ready              for intercomparison with other OH and HO  measuring devices and for                                                     2                                       participation in field tests of the fast photochemistry of the                  troposphere.",
