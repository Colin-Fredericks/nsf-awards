 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pennsylvania State University will renew and further develop the science        knowledge base, science teaching competencies and attitudes toward              teaching science of 55 K-6 teacher leaders from diverse central                 Pennsylvania school districts during a cooperative two year project             which includes a five week Renewal Institute, five academic year teacher        planned meetings and, in the second year, dissemination to fellow               teachers by teacher leaders with assistance from the project staff.             After the two year NSF funding cycle this cadre of 55 science teachers          will be utilized by Penn State in the training of preservice science            teachers to demonstrate science lessons and be recommended to assist            university faculty for inservice activities for an area in which 39% of         the elementary teachers teach little or no science.                                                                                                             Responding to the explicit request of the targeted participants four            junior high school science teachers will deliver the science content and        process based instruction for this program during which teachers will           present, videotape, review and critique science microteach lessons and          create their own materials for a curriculum which includes Life and             Earth science, Chemistry and Physics. Pedagogical instruction will be           provided by the senior personnel.                                                                                                                               In order to establish a supportive environment required for elementary          science instruction, a week long Principal's Workshops required of all          participating schools will provide a model of a good science program,           the role of the principal in developing science programs and research           findings on elementary school science. Evaluation will include                  examination of the instructional components and follow-up of the                participants in their classroom as they teach science.                                                                                                          Cost sharing for Renewal Activities in Science Education for Elementary         Teachers in Central Pennsylvania is assumed by Penn State, the school           districts, and the Pennsylvania Department of Education.Participants            from this economically depressed, rural area will receive five hours of         graduate credit in science.                                                                                                                                     Dr. Peter Rubba, Director of the Center for Education in Science,               Technology, and Society is an associate Professor with nine years               experience as a science educator. Mr. David Kleindienst, a science              curriculum coordinator is the assistant director. Ms. Patricia F. Keig          is a doctoral student at Penn State teaching elementary science methods.        The outstanding experienced school teachers, Ms. Barto, Ms. Johnstone,          Mr. Shope and Mr. Eysenbach have been chosen because of their competence        in using hands-on, inquiry approaches to science instruction.",
