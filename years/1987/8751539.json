In the first                   year, an inventory was conducted in the states to identify the                  information they now collect on the dimensions and quality of                   mathematics and science education, using the framework being                    developed for such indicators by the National Research Council,                 and applying a data-collection \"shuttle\" procedure to describe                  how each state defines and collects the information.                                 In the second year, the information compiled through the                   inventory will be analyzed with reference to emerging models for                indicators of math/science education, and strategies and                        priorities will be set for the development of math/science                      indicators in each state that will bring states toward a standard               model of important, technically-acceptable information.                              At the end of the first year's work, a major on-site review                was made of the project.  It was the unanimous recommendation of                the reviewing officials that the project is meritorious and                     should be continued for at least another year.",
