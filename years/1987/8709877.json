 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goals of this research are to understand the                 structure, organization, and expression of immunoglobulin (Ig)                  heavy chain genes in the goldfish, Carassius auratus.  A genomic                library has been constructed in lambda phage; initial sequencing                of three VH.related genes has been completed, and putative JH                   regions have been identified by oligonucleotide probe                           hybridization.  These studies will be expanded in three areas.                  First, representative VH, DH, JH, and CH regions will be                        identified and sequenced to elucidate their germline                            organization.  Standard DNA cloning, mapping, and sequencing                    strategies will be used.  To identify CH regions, peptides of                   goldfish IgM heavy chains will be microsequenced, and specific                  mixed oligonucleotide probes will be synthesized to correspond to               their coding sequences.  Second, computer assisted analyses of                  goldfish VH gene sequences and comparison of these with each                    other and with published VH sequences for other vertebrates will                be undertaken in an attempt to infer the relative contributions                 of selection, mutation, drift, and non.reciprocal exchange in the               evolution of these genes.  Third, the function of putative                      regulatory regions of the goldfish Ig heavy chain genes will be                 studied.  Appropriate expression vectors will be constructed to                 test whether the goldfish heavy chain promoter (in association                  with a mammalian Ig enhancer region) permits gene expression in                 mammalian lymphoid cells.                                                            The mechanisms of immune function in animals other than                    mammals are as yet poorly understood.  Basic knowledge of the                   structure, organization and regulation of expression of                         immunoglobulin genes in fish is of importance not only for its                  intrinsic interest, but also because understanding of immune                    function in fish is fundamental for the capability to grow and                  maintain of fish in commercial culture and for understanding the                factors involved in the success or failure of fish to survive in                natural environments.   Knowledge of the evolution of immune                    function obtained from these studies may also shed light on the                 function of immune systems in higher vertebrates.",
