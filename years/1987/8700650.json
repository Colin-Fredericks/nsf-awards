 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposes to develop new techniques to produce three               dimensional images of internal organs such as the brain.  Before                surgery, the surgeon can actually use the three dimensional view                to inspect potential damage by using the computer to \"cut away\"                 the three dimensional picture.  Three dimensional information of                the brain and skull are vital information to the surgeon to                     permit the assessment of the most non-damaging surgical approach                in, say, removing a tumor.  The three dimensional image locates                 the precise position of the tumor as well as its shape.  It is                  now feasible to use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to form maps               of the internal organs with a clarity previously only achieved                  with X-rays; NMR lowers the radiation risk to the patient.                      However, NMR can be used to determine the physiological well                    being of the tissue as well as its shape.  Thus, this proposed                  research has far reaching implications and a great many medical                 applications.  This research can also be logically extended to                  provide valuable information for those projects which intend to                 construct \"artificial eyes\" for robots and the blind.  Thus,                    there it is expected that this research will have considerable                  technological fall-out to many other areas of research.",
