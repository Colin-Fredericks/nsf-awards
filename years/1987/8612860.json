 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for renewed support of the Materials Research                     Laboratory (MRL) under the direction of Dr. Myron B. Salamon at                 the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  The MRL is                     comprised of about 40 faculty members from six academic                         departments; 55 graduate students and 7 postdoctoral research                   associates are also supported.  The research effort is                          concentrated on interactive, multidisciplinary research projects                in several major thrust areas.  The MRL also operates major                     central facilities that underpin materials research efforts at                  the University, and maintains a number of research service                      facilities in collaboration with other units on campus.  There                  are interactions with industry and government laboratories in                   relation to MRL thrust area research.                                                                                                                           The planned research includes major thrust areas in optical                     semiconductors and heterostructures, advanced catalytic                         materials, metastability and dynamics of disordered materials,                  and advanced computational materials research.                                                                                                                  This MRL provides a superb environment for interactive research.                Its central research facilities are second to none and it is                    effectively managed.  The recent establishment on campus of major               research centers in fields that complement materials research                   provides new opportunities that are fully recognized by the MRL.                Many of the faculty are outstanding in their own areas of                       research; together they bring a formidable array of talent to                   bear in a strongly interactive manner on a number of important                  problems in materials research.  The recommended budget provides                adequate resources to support the proposed efforts in optical                   semiconductors and heterostructures and in advanced computational               materials research; to make a rapid start in the area of advanced               catalytic materials; to support thrust research in the dynamics                 of disordered materials; and to provide appropriate seed funding                for new initiatives.  It also provides for continuing strong                    support of instrumentation and central research facilities.",
