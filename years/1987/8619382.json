 "awd_abstract_narration": "Permafrost temperatures at depth represent a systematic running mean            of the temperature history at the permafrost surface.  Global changes,          such as climatic warming are, or will be, reflected in the permafrost           temperature profiles.  Recent permafrost temperature measurements show          that some Alaskan permafrost has warmed as much as 4 C over the past            50-100 years and limited meteorological data suggest that this warming          is directly related to changes in mean air temperature in an area               where carbon dioxide warming is predicted to be the greatest.  A host           of serious environmental and engineering problems that have a                   substantial impact on the use of polar lands are associated with                warmer and/or thawing permafrost.  However, data on the thermal regime          of permafrost in Alaska are very sparse and mostly unusable because of          surface disturbances near the drill holes.                                                                                                                      This investigation will measure permafrost temperatures at sixteen              undisturbed sites along the trans-Alaska pipeline corridor which                includes Alaska's three major climate and permafrost zones and at               fifteen other widely distributed sites in Alaska.  Measurements will            include temperatures in the air, at the ground surface, in the active           layer, at the permafrost table and in the permafrost to depths of 80 m          or more.  Interpretation and modeling of these data will be carried             out to determine the relationships between temperatures at all levels           and the effects of changes in surface temperatures on the permafrost.           These studies will contribute to our ability to extract information on          past climate from the permafrost temperature profiles.  Drilling the            holes, the greatest cost of these investigations, has already been              completed.",
