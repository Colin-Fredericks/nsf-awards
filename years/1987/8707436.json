 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concentrates on field investigations of five               crucial localities within the Cordilleran region of the United                  States and Canada.  It will provide meaningful data on the                      evolution of late Triassic reefs and reeflike carbonate rocks                   within a number of displaced terranes accreted to western North                 America.  Utilizing the dual approach of microfacies analysis                   and detailed paleontological study of calcareous algae and                      diverse benthic faunas of foraminifers, sponges, corals,                        molluscs and echinoids, the research will test ideas about the                  dispersal of the biota and the movement of accretional terranes                 in Alaska, the Canadian Northwest, and Oregon.                                          The proposed project will build upon a foundation of prior              research on Upper Triassic faunas and carbonate rocks of                        central Peru as well as recent reef discoveries at localities                   in Idaho and northeastern Oregon.  The project will benefit                     from collaboration with alpine workers of Europe, pooling their                 knowledge to bring current understanding of the North American                  Triassic to levels approaching those of well-known counterparts                 of Europe.                                                                              The formulation of a viable model for the dispersal of the              biota in light of terrane theory and reef evolution, along with                 integration of data acquired from other regions of the world,                   will permit a general synthesis for global Triassic                             paleogeography, allowing the type of detailed resolution not                    currently available in either reef studies or terrane analyses                  in North America.",
