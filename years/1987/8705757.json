 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will concentrate on various problems related                 to arithmetic algebraic geometry.  Professor Dwork will work on                 the theory of p-adic differential equations.  More specifically                 he will work on the p-adic properties of generalized                            hypergeometric functions, or more exactly upon the p-adic                       properties of the Frobenius matrix associated with the                          corresponding cohomology.  Professor Shimura will work on                       arithmeticity properties concerning zeta functions and                          automorphic forms.  These include special values of Eisenstein                  series, certain combinations of zeta functions and periods of                   automorphic forms associated with quaternion algebras.  Dr. Bien,               a post doctoral associate, will work on the representations of                  Kac-Moody algebras.  Another post doctoral associate, Dr. Chai,                 will work on the moduli schemes of abelian varieties.                                The theory of arithmetic algebraic geometry has benefited                  greatly in the past from the important contributions of the two                 principle investigators.  They are one of the strongest pairs in                arithmetic in the world today.  The subject uses geometric (and                 in their case analytic, as well) tools to delve deeply into                     number theoretic questions.  Certain types of special functions                 play important roles in number theory.  These two researchers                   attack problems on these types of functions in complementary                    ways.  Dwork looks at p-adic analogues while Shimura concentrates               on their transformation properties.  The post doctoral associates               work in similar areas.  Much of great interest will surely result               from this work.",
