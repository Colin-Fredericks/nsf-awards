 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for research describing and explaining how          people make judgments and choices and in what ways these decision               making behaviors are at variance from rational prescriptive theories of         decision making.  Specifically the objective of this research is to             extend the study of preference reversal behavior into real world                situations and to develop formal models which describe and explain              judgement and choice behavior.                                                                                                                                  Since the early reporting of preference reversal behavior the                   phenomenon has been shown to operate in many diverse decision making            situations.  Various competing explanations have been advanced to               account for decision making which violate the prescriptions of                  quantitative theories of decision analysis.  This research effort which         will extend prior laboratory research into real world situations has            the objective of developing more comprehensive process descriptions and         explanations of preference reversal behavior as well as to develop              formal models of the psychological phenomena of judgement and choice.           Such progress is crucial if normative decision models were to serve as          a basis to increase the rationality and effectiveness of actual                 decision making behavior.",
