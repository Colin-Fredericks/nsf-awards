 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transient isotopic tracing is applied to Fischer-Tropsch and                    related syntheses producing hydrocarbons and oxygenated                         compounds.  These reactions furnish the basic path for production               of carbon compounds from coal.  Previous work has applied this                  method to methanation over nickel, molybdenum sulfide, and                      ruthenium and has identified the key surface intermediates.  This               work aims to illustrate how these one-carbon intermediates react                with each other as well as with hydrogen and with carbon monoxide               to form simple hydrocarbons and oxygenated species of higher                    molecular weight.  Ruthenium catalysts are employed. It is known                that a large variety of compounds are produced in this system;                  this work should provide the knowledge needed for control of                    conditions to maximize production of desired species.",
