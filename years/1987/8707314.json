 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interest in the physical processes controlling systematic fracture              (joint) formation in sedimentary rocks has heightened in recent years,          motivated by the importance of fractured rock masses to the petroleum           industry, nuclear waste disposal efforts, and earthquake forecasting.           This research focuses on:  1) characterization of joint geometries in           sedimentary rocks by field mapping, 2) determination of the loading             histories responsible for the geometries of multiple joint sets, and 3)         understanding the influence of mechanical interaction on propagation            paths, joint lengths, and joint intersections.  The field work involves         detailed mapping at scales of 1:50 to 1:100 of joint traces on bedding          surfaces of well-exposed sedimentary units near Mexican Hat, Utah.  The         effects of stress state and crack interaction on joint development will         be analyzed using solutions to boundary value problems of elasticity            theory and the principles of fracture mechanics.  Two dimensional               laboratory model experiments of crack growth in PMMA plates using a             computer-controlled, biaxial testing machine will investigate the               influence of stress state on crack path and intersection.  Experiments          on PMMA plates with an easily fracturable brittle elastic coating will          investigate the sequential development of multiple fracture sets as a           function of loading history. The results of this research will provide          guidelines for interpreting the loading history implied by certain joint        patterns in sedimentary rock. It will also address important questions          about hydraulic connectivity of joint sets and the mechanical behavior          of a jointed rock mass.",
