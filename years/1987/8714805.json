 "awd_abstract_narration": "Meharry Medical College proposes the establishment of a                    Center for the Study of Cell and Molecular Biology.  Researchers                at the Center, including four new scientists, will expand the                   medical school's current work in cellular and molecular biology                 and will at the same time, initiate work in the characterization                of genes that are developmentally regulated.  Work will continue                on advanced applications of recombinant DNA technology to the                   neurosciences.  The Center will also be used to motivate minority               students at all educational levels to consider careers in science               and engineering.  In addition, the Center will develop                          strategies to strengthen partnerships with industry and academia.                    This project meets the major goal of the Minority Research                 Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program:  to increase the minority                 presence in science and engineering by making substantial                       resources available to upgrade the research capabilities of                     strong and productive minority institutions.  The project will at               the same time enable this institution to use research as a tool                 to increase the effectiveness of related science and engineering                activities for minority groups in its region.  In addition, the                 project will provide opportunities for minority faculty and                     students at Meharry and nearby institutions to engage in                        meritorious research that leads to publications in refereed                     journals.",
