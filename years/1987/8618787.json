 "awd_abstract_narration": "A conceptual design of an inherently safe reactor (ISR) has been        developed by Nuclear Engineering Faculty and Students at the Ohio               State University (OSU).  The design, which won critical acclaims of             many experts in the field of nuclear reactor safety, makes extensive            use of conventional light water reactor (LWR) technology, but also              incorporates several innovative passive features.                                       The ultimate goal of the research outlined in this proposal is          twofold:  to develop and document a methodology for quantifying the             benefits of passive reactor safety features, and to determine the               safety gains in incorporating into a 340-MWe boiling water reactor              (BWR) (a) natural circulation and (b) a passive steam-driven emergency          core cooling system (ECCS) contained within a prestressed concrete              reactor vessel.  The method as applied to the OSU-ISR will include              verification of full power, shutdown and accident natural circulation           modes, identification of system reliability based on natural                    circulation parameters and finally, comparison of results with current          LWR systems.  The proposed research program in essence will develop a           methodology and apply to the OSU-ISR concept to determine the relative          safety and reliability of the modified BWR system as compared to                current light water reactor technology.",
