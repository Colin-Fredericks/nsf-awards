 "awd_abstract_narration": "The psychology department to upgrading equipment in existing                    laboratories in learning and perception, in a cognition course, and             further promoting and broadening the opportunities for independent              student research.  The laboratories and research activities supported by        this proposal are intended to illustrate the principles and concepts of         psychology through first hand exposure, to familiarize students with the        scientific methodology and instrumentation in these areas, and                  ultimately to develop the skills necessary for independent                      investigation.  Six microcomputers, six printers, and two interfacing           devices are being requested.  Two computers, printers, and the                  interfaces will be used to support laboratories in learning and three           computers and printers will be used in cognition and                            sensation/perception courses.  The sixth computer and printer will be           devoted to data analysis and preparation and report writing by students         enrolled in the above courses and those carrying out a senior thesis.",
