 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapidly growing interest in multiprocessors for                     concurrent, or parallel, computation has created a need for the                 training of graduate student of computer science and postdoctoral               researchers in this field.  There is also a need to interest                    outstanding undergraduate students in this emerging field.  The                 field is so new, and developing so rapidly that many programs in                computer science do not cover it adequately.  The proposed                      workshop addresses this need.  The two-week program of the                      Workshop will give participants an opportunity to learn about                   parallel computation from lectures offered by a number of experts               in the field and workshop sessions in which they will use several               different kinds of commercially available multiprocessors.                              The proposal has been submitted to help train and                       familiarize the research community involved in computational                    science with the important nuances of parallel processing.                      Parallel processing is recognized as a rapidly growing field of                 computational science which promise large increases in                          computational speed and computer power.  This workshop will                     introduce and train scientists on programming techniques and                    difference in machine architectures of various problem-solving                  opportunities.",
