 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although migration occurs in many communities and                          theoretical studies suggest that it can be an important influence               on community dynamics, it is not well understood.  Stream                       communities provide an excellent opportunity to investigate                     migration.   Recent research suggests that movement may be                      influenced by intraspecific and interspecific competition such                  that it is density-dependent. However, the prevalence of                        biotically induced migration in these communities is unknown.  A                few theoretical studies suggest that density-dependent migration                can have important consequences for community dynamics; however,                no thorough investigations have been undertaken.  It is clear                   that both empirical and theoretical investigations are needed to                understand not only the prevalence of density-dependent migration               in streams, but its importance to community structure.                               A combination of laboratory and field experiments will be                  used to quantify the effects of environmental heterogeneity and                 intraspecific competition on the migration  of a caddisfly,                     Hydropsyche slossonae. Laboratory studies will document processes               and field studies will verify their importance in natural                       communities.  Existing theoretical models will be modified to                   incorporate density-dependent migration.  Through this modeling                 effort, the influence of such migration on community structure                  will be assessed.  A computer model to will also be used to                     generate predictions specific to stream communities.  Combining                 both empirical and theoretical studies will provide a unique                    opportunity to understand the influence of migration on                         population dynamics.",
