 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award would support research collaboration between Professor Jack          M. Parker, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, and Professor              Charles G. Kurland, University of Uppsala, Sweden.  They will study             errors of biological information transmission concerning the genetic            code.  Mistakes seem to occur on the ribosome which refer to the amount         of energy invested in protein synthesis.  The proposed research will            attempt to discover the types of errors, their costs or benefits, and           the strategies cells have for coping with the errors.  Much of the data         on missense errors comes from early in vitro work, but it is not clear                                              ________                                    how these results correlate with the in vivo situation.                                                              _______                                                                                                                    Professors Parker and Kurland will study the misreading of                      phenyla-lanine codons in a native message, both in vivo and in vitro.                                                           _______     ________            Professor Parker has systematically explored in vivo missense errors in                                                      _______                            selected proteins and has expertise in gene manipulation.  Professor            Kurland and his group have developed a refined in vitro system to study                                                        ________                         errors in protein synthesis, but he has confined his studies to                 synthetic messages.  Combining the approaches of the two researchers is         important because it allows a comparison of in vivo and in vitro                                                            _______     ________                misreading of a single message.  The proposed research should lead to           refinements in the interpretations of the data derived from the two             experimental methods.",
