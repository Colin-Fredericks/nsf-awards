 "awd_abstract_narration": "Compounds containing two metal atoms directly bonded to one                     another are of great current interest because of their                          catalytic properties and also because of their utility as                       models of species which occur at the surfaces of heterogeneous                  catalysts. Many of these metal-metal bonded compounds are                       highly colored and consequently are susceptible to light                        induced reactions, so that they have potential for use as                       catalysts for photochemical or photoelectrochemical                             applications.                                                                                                                                                   The focus of this project is the chemistry and photochemistry                   of metal-metal bonded organo-transition metal complexes. Two                    classes of complexes will be studied: i) those which contain                    unsupported M-M sigma bonds, and ii) those which contain M-M                    bonds supported by bridging CO, CNR or di-phosphine ligands.                    New organometallic chemistry will be developed based on excited                 states of d-10-d-10 binuclear complexes with a single bridging                  ligand (CO, CNR, or NO+). The roles of excited states in                        activating the bridging ligand toward bimolecular alkylation or                 condensation reactions will be determined. The formal \u01312+2!                     photocycloaddition chemistry of olefins, acetylenes, and                        cumulenes with the bridging ligand will be explored. New                        classes of bridging ligand cycloaddition reactions of the \u01314+2!                 and \u01312+2+2! types will also be developed. The \u01314+2} additions                   of dienes to bridging CO and CNR ligands and \u01312+2+2!                            condensations of olefins with a pair of bridging CO and CNR                     ligands will be examined. New chemistry of carbon dioxide will                  be developed, including exploration of its cycloadditions to                    bridging CO and CNR ligands, as well as O-atom transfers and                    reductive couplings to oxalate derivatives.",
