 "awd_abstract_narration": "As social scientists the laboratory is the world and the best                   approximation and understanding of the ways in which nations operate is         through representative experiments such as simulations.  Simulation as          a technique for teaching and learning is an integral part of the                Political Science curriculum.  However, the simulations were based on           human interaction and simple forms of communication.  The project is            enabling the college through the addition of computers, printers,               modems, and support equipment to become a full participant in the               International Negotiation Project, which is a simulation of foreign             policy decision making that relies on computer technology for                   communication between member institutions.  The simulation is unique            and of special interest because institutions around the world routinely         participate and communicate in their native tongue.  This helps stress          problems of decision making while also addressing issues of cross-              cultural communication and problems of translation.",
