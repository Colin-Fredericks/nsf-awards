 "awd_abstract_narration": "Light scattering experiments are planned for supercooled water                  and aqueous solutions to elucidate the structural mechanisms                    responsible for thermodynamic anomalies in supercooled water.                   Raman data obtained from this work will have direct structural                  information for supercooled water.  The OH stretch modes will                   yield nearest neighbor information including hydrogen bond                      probability, and mean O-O separation and distribution.  The low                 frequency intermolecular modes will yield information regarding                 the second neighbor shell wherein the most dramatic structural                  changes relevant to the supercooled anomalies are thought to                    occur.  The photon correlation spectroscopy measurements will                   be used to extract effective density correlation lengths due to                 cooperative behavior between many water molecules.                                                                                                              Water's importance on the face of the earth cannot be                           overstated.  This importance stems from two sources:  its                       abundance, and its unique physical and chemical properties.  In                 the past decade it has been found that liquid water is even                     more unusual in the supercooled regime below zero degrees                       Centigrade.  Here it displays anomalies in its thermodynamic                    and transport properties which may be approaching a                             singularity.  The key to water is in its hydrogen bonded                        structure.  Raman spectroscopy can give microscopic information                 regarding structure and dynamics.  It can determine the extent                  of hydrogen bonding, make decisions regarding ice-like or                       clathrate structures, and give information on both the first                    neighbor shell and molecular clustering.",
