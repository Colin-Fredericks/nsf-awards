 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current numerical solutions of most engineering problems are                obtained on computers based on the classical von Neumann                        architecture where a set of instructions are executed in a                      sequential or serial fashion.  The utilization of computers to                  tackle more and more complicated problems requires that there be                a continued increase in computational speed.  However, the \"von                 Neumann bottleneck\", the serial nature of the computer system                   itself, is the restriction.  The present supercomputers with                    vector processing, special arithmetic/logic units, etc. is one                  approach.  Despite the power and speed of supercomputers, such                  systems will rely on a basically serial execution of instructions               and their capabilities are approaching the physical limitations                 imposed by the speed of light and quantum mechanical effects.                                                                                                   Recent developments in computer science indicates that the                      parallel processing has the most promising and viable computer                  architecture for significant improvements in computational                      performance.  Such systems use a large number of processors, each               of which is assigned one computational task.  Since the                         processors execute computations simultaneously, the potential                   computational speed is far than the serial systems.  As yet there               is very little application software for engineering problems on                 parallel systems.                                                                                                                                               The goal of this Engineering Initiation project will be to apply                parallel computations to nonlinear dynamical system.  Efficient                 parallel processing software will be developed including; cell                  mapping techniques for analysis and synthesis of optimal control,               bifurcation curves for two and three degrees of freedom systems,                and implement and test the algorithms on FLEX/32 Parallel                       computer at the University of Southern California.",
