 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Grover is studying a key regulatory enzyme of plants                   adapted to a high temperature, low moisture environment.  The CAM               plants, commonly known as succulents, absorb carbon dioxide                     through stomata in their leaves only at night where                             temperatures are low and water loss through these leaf openings                 is minimized.  Reactions of carbon fixation and metabolism are                  regulated on a diurnal basis and the enzyme PEP carboxylase plays               a key role here.  With the assistance of undergraduate students,                Dr. Grover will determine how certain known                                     \"regulatory ligands\" bind to and control the activity of this                   enzyme.  He will probe the physical nature of the binding sites                 with chemical modification and labeling.                                                                                                                             This study will likely lead to knowledge of new regulatory                 mechanisms for enzymes of photosynthesis, an important payoff.",
