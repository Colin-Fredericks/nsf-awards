 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research develops knowledge based computer systems for             \"qualitative physics,\" allowing computers to reason more                        effectively about the physical world.  Qualitative physics                      complements traditional physics by providing (1) fast answers in                simple situations and (2) a framework for more detailed analysis.               Specific qualitative models are being developed for fluid                       systems, thermal systems, and motion, adequate to describe                      complex systems such as as mechanical clocks and boilers.  The                  models include methods for prediction, measurement,                             interpretation, and for constructing plans and procedures.  The                 research also includes an investigation of how people learn                     physical domains, including cognitive simulations of analogical                 processing.                                                                             The significance of this research is its potential to                   produce \"robust\" computer reasoning systems, comparable to humans               in their ability to reason approximately about how the physical                 world around them will behave, without the detailed information                 and mathematical equations required for classical models of                     physics.  In addition, studying the range of qualitative physics                expertise in humans may provide important insight into the nature               of cognition.  Practical and effective qualitative reasoning                    systems will also be essential in developing many advanced                      technological systems: Examples include intelligent monitors for                complex systems such as factories and power plants, and                         intelligent computer assistants for mechanical and engineering                  design.",
