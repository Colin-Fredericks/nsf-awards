 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to develop a new approach to the                          manufacture of thermoplastic matrix continuous-fiber composite                  materials by means of computer-controlled rollers which form an                 initially flat composite laminate into a complex shaped                         component.  As the flat plate moves through the machine, only                   that region of the component which lies within the machine is                   hot and is being formed; all other regions are at room                          temperature and are rigid.  Because of this, the envisioned                     forming machine can be much smaller than the component it is                    shaping. This approach eliminates the use of fixed dies which                   are employed in the current manufacture of this material.  The                  proposed research plan includes initial forming experiments,                    process model development, sensor and control strategy                          development, design and building of a prototype forming                         machine, and demonstration trials with the prototype machine.                   The initial forming experiments will verify the concept in a                    bench test setup and will explore roller operation and control,                 determine forming limits, gain insight into the appropriate                     forming temperature, and gain experience with sensors.  The                     process model will enable the integration of design and                         manufacturing for these components and will also be used for                    process control.  The sensor development work is necessary to                   assure proper fiber alignment in the formed component.                               This new concept could lead to die-less forming of                         thermoplastic matrix fiber composite materials which would                      reduce costs through lower tooling costs and shorter lead                       times.  Initial application is expected to be in fabrication of                 aerospace structures.",
