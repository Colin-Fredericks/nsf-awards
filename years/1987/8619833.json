 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a three-year cooperative research project in            physics between Professor Walter R. Johnson, Department of Physics,             University of Notre Dame, and Dr. Peter Zoller, Institute for                   Theoretical Physics, University of Innsbruck, Austria.  The scientists          and members of their research groups are collaborating in theoretical           calculations regarding multiphoton ionization of atoms.  The goal is to         develop a modern theoretical basis for the description of this process,         particularly in heavy atoms, including the effects of electron-electron         correlation.  The theoretical framework of the calculations will be the         time-dependent Hartree-Fock method.  Parallel to this work, a quantum           defect theory of nonlinear optical processes will be developed.                                                                                                 Current interest in multiphoton processes stems in large part from the          availability of lasers.  When certain atoms are subjected to high               intensities of laser radiation, there is an unexpected, enhanced                production of multiply charged ions.  It is to explain such experimental        results on a quantitative basis that both research groups wish to               develop a modern theory of multiphoton ionization.  At the present time,        theoretical analyses of multiphoton ionization processes in atoms are           usually based on the so-called independent particle model of the atom,          which neglects interactions between the electrons (electron correlation         effects).  This model is simple, but does not give satisfactory results         when applied to atoms with several electrons in the outer shells, such          as the alkaline earth and rare gas atoms.  Professor Johnson has                developed methods for treating such atoms that go beyond the independent        particle model.  His expertise in electron correlation effects in atoms         will be combined with that of Dr. Zoller, whose field of research is            laser-atom interactions and multiphoton processes.  Funds from this             award would support necessary transportation and subsistence expenses           for the U.S. principal investigator and a member of his research group.         The Austrian Science Foundation (FWF) is providing counterpart support          for the project and has approved the inclusion of this activity under           the Memorandum of Understanding between the NSF and the FWF.",
