 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research objectives are:  (1) To determine the smolt                       status of one-year-old landlocked Atlantic salmon; (2) to                       compare survival and growth between landlocked and sea-run                      Atlantic salmon in commercial scale sea-cages; (3) to determine                 maturity characteristics of landlocked Atlantic salmon grown in                 sea-cages.  To accomplish these objectives, the research will                   use tests of smoltification including gill Na+-K+ ATPase,                       plasma thyroxine, and osmolality; comparative rearing trials of                 landlocked and sea-run salmon in sea-cages; incidence of                        grilse; hormone profiles in maturing adults; and egg viability.                      This research would contribute basic and applied knowledge                 on the physiology and endocrinology of landlocked Atlantic                      salmon and on their potential for marine culture.  Results                      could be applied to increase the supply of seedstock needed by                  U.S. growers and thus reduce reliance to imported salmon.  A                    major problem in marine culture of Atlantic salmon (Salmo                       salar) in the north-eastern United States is the lack of                        smolts.  Diadromous (sea-run) Atlantic salmon are difficult and                 costly to rear through the pre-smolt stage.  Maine has native                   populations of landlocked Atlantic salmon (S. salar) that reach                 smolt size in half the time of sea-run smolts at ambient water                  temperatures.  These landlocks may serve as an alternative to                   sea-run salmon for marine culture.",
