 "awd_abstract_narration": "Regulation of Glucose Transport in Yeast:  Glucose and                     galactose transport in yeast cells is regulated by addition of                  phosphate to the sugars catalyzed by sugar kinases.  In cells                   containing active kinases, the sugars are transported by a high                 affinity process, which may couple transport and phosphorylation.               In the absence of ATP or in mutants deficient in the sugar                      kinases the sugars are transported by a low affinity, facilitated               diffusion process.  To understand the mechansims of sugar                       transport and the basis of its regulation, the sugar carriers are               being isolated from yeast cell membranes and reconstituted in                   artificial proteoliposomes.  Three approaches are being used to                 isolate and purify the carriers: (l) fractionation of membrane                  extracts, (2) the use of affinity labels, and (3) gene cloning                  techniques.                                                                                                                                                          Most cells can regulate the rate of glucose metabolism by                  controlling the rate of sugar transport, however, the mechanism                 of glucose transport is not fully understood much less the                      mechanism of its regulation.  Yeasts are convenient cells in                    which to study the process of sugar transport and its regulation.               They have a high rate of glucose metabolsim and they can be                     manipulated genetically.  The study of sugar transport with the                 purified carrieres from yeasts should contribute to an                          understanding of this important process.",
