 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant concerns eclipsing binary stars.  Caton will improve                 on methods to extract from eclipse data a more nearly exact time                of light minimum and an estimate in the errors of that time.  The               procedure will be developed using the computer program of Wilson                and Devinney for binaries with eccentric orbits and spotted                     stars.  An observing program will be continued.                                                                                                                 Most stars occur in binary pairs.  A few binaries move about each               other so that one star eclipses the other.  The timing of                       eclipses yields orbital periods, which inform us about the                      stars, and sometimes changes in orbital periods with time, which                inform us about gases leaving the system or transferring from one               star to the other.  This grant is to seek more accurate methods                 to detect the slow changes in orbital periods.  The grant is made               under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) Program                  and is the first astronomy research grant both to this                          investigator and to his institution.",
