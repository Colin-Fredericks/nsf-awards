 "awd_abstract_narration": "Further research on the preparation and properties of fluorine                  compounds is important because the presence of one or more fluorine             atoms or fluorinated groups in molecules has a marked effect on the             chemical and physical properties as well as on the biological activity          of these materials.  The substitution of fluorine for other atoms in a          compound often leads to profound increases in resistance to thermal             degradation or decomposition in water.  These drastic differences in            properties are seen in comparing polyethylene, which does not contain           fluorine, to teflon, which does contain fluorine.                                                                                                               The research will involve the syntheses and characterization of a wide          variety of fluorine-containing nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus                  compounds in an effort to either modify characteristics of previously           known compounds or to develop entirely new families of compounds that           may have many applications, e.g., as thermally and hydrolytically               stable polymers, as plant growth inhibitors, as muscle relaxants, or as         anticonvulsants, in addition to providing much useful basic information         when fluorinated and nonfluorinated analogs are studied concurrently.           This study will provide other researchers with information about                thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities, properties, structures and               bonding as well as methods of synthesis of a diverse collection of              compound types.  All new materials will be characterized via infrared,          Raman, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectra and elemental                analyses.  Many will be submitted for biological testing and some for           structural studies.",
