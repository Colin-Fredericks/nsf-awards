 "awd_abstract_narration": "Preceding studies have shown that wave-induced anomalous ion            heating is occuring in the Caltech Encore toroidal plasma                       facility.  Wave-induced anomalous ion heating is not well                       understood and yet has applicability to plasmas in many domains,                ranging from laboratory to astrophysical.  The next experiment                  will use advanced plasma diagnostic techniques to determine the                 physical phenomena underlying this basic process.  The special                  features of this approach are the following:  (i) the plasma has                a confined geometry free of end-walls, is highly reproducible                   over a large range of parameters, and has a unique high                         repetition rate; and  (ii) an advanced diagnostic system                        (including Laser Induced Fluorescence) is now available with                    exceptional space and time resolution, full computer automation,                and the ability to follow the evolution of particle and waves                   with the required detail.  This program seeks to exploit this                   conjunction of technology and physics to obtain a fundamental                   understanding of how two basic aspects of plasmas -- particle and               wave -- interact.",
