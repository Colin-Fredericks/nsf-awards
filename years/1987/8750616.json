 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Project is to develop a graphics workstation laboratory.  The              equipment will be used in a sequence of four junior and senior level            computer science courses to demonstrate modern methods in software              engineering and computer graphics.  Students will acquire expertise in          such methods by using state-of-the-art instrumentation to implement             software projects which illustrate theoretical results in those fields.         The project focuses on the use of graphics tools as visual aids for the         design and analysis of software and on the use of those tools in the            development of graphics software itself.  The equipment includes a color        monitor and four workstations for a student laboratory and a file server        and one workstation for a faculty laboratory.  The server, a high-speed         microprocessor with a disk drive, provides disk space and additional            computing power to the workstations.  Eight existing PCs would be               connected to the server; four would be placed in the student laboratory         and four in faculty offices.  Both laboratories will be housed in a             newly remodeled facility.  Project implementation span a 2-year period          with ample personnel available for equipment installation and course            preparation.",
