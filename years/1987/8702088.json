 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Jacobs proposes to isolate, characterize and begin a                    developmental analysis of plant genes activated by Rhizobium.  This             includes obtaining cDNA clones for any genes which exhibit                      transcriptional induction at the earliest stages of Rhizobium infection.        Using heterologous probes from well-characterized plant systems, he will        also obtain cDNA clones for defined genes which are expected to play a          role in root dedifferentiation and nodule meristem induction.  Genes            expected to be activated by Rhizobium infection include those encoding          cell division functions and cytoskeletal elements such as actin, tubulin        and extensin.  Recovered clones will be analyzed in several ways.               First, clones will be confirmed by Northern analysis to assure the              presumed developmental relevance of their cognate genes.  Next, the cDNA        clones will be restriction mapped and subcloned into plasmid vectors.           These subclones will be used for analysis of the activation of their            cognate genes, as influenced by mutant bacterial and host plant                 genotypes, by cell-free extracts of activated rhizobia and by abiotic           factors such as calcium and nitrogen availability during inoculation.               Dr. Jacobs has begun a molecular analysis of the plant genes during         the Rhizobium/legume symbiosis.  This symbiotic interaction is important        in a practical way for the assimilation of nitrogen by the plant but            also can be a useful model for differential plant gene expression during        organogenesis.",
