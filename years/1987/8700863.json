 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reproduction in most species of animals occurs during that season               of the year when conditions for raising young are optimal. This                 study explores physiological control of seasonal reproduction in                the American tree sparrow by focusing on the mechanisms that                    regulate secretion of an essential hormone of reproduction                      \u0131luteinizing hormone) (LH)!. Previous work has established that                 LH secretion increases when male tree sparrows are transferred                  from a short to a long daily photoperiod (for example, from 8 hr.               of light per day to 20 hrs. of light per day). Two mechanisms                   control LH secretion: one is analogous to a throttle and drives                 LH secretion; the other is analogous to a brake and retards LH                  secretion. A long daily photoperiod is stimulatory because it                   augments the drive on LH secretion, rather than in the brake, and               largely determines when the reproductive season begins and ends                 in birds exposed chronically to long daily photoperiods. The                    mechanisms that decrease the drive on hormone secretion or                      modulate the brake to terminate or control the transition from                  the non-breeding to the breeding state, respectively, are not                   understood. This investigation specifically explores (a) whether                the drive on LH secretion in male tree sparrows exposed to short                daily photoperiods is daylength-dependent; (b) whether the eyes                 are components of the mechanism that decreases the drive on LH                  secretion at the end of the breeding season and modulates the                   brake on LH secretion; and (c) the relationship between restoring               the drive on LH secretion and intensifying the brake.                                                                                                           The results will clarify general physiological principles                       underlying initiation and termination of seasonal reproduction                  and suggest improved management strategies for domestic and /or                 wild (including game and pest) species that breed seasonally.",
