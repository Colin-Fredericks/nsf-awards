 "awd_abstract_narration": "This multi-investigator research project will address mechanisms                of plant competition and their linkage with the process of                      competition and plant community development in the Great Basin                  sagebrush-dominated ecosystem.  The research is based on                        manipulative field studies in replicated plots with extension to                a landscape setting.  Belowground competition is emphasized in                  four sets of hypotheses concerning (1) the occurrence, magnitude                and significance of water leakage from roots and water transfer                 between plants -- experiments involving whole-plant gas exchange,               soil psychrometry and time-domain reflectometry, stable isotopes,               and root anatomy, (2) exploitation of resource-rich patches --                  involving microscale root distributions, mycorrhizal dynamics,                  dual-isotope labeling, and root physiological properties, (3)                   characteristics of roots associated with competitive ability --                 using indicator plant approaches with a broad germplasm resource,               and (4) linking competition with plant fitness components such as               seed output and seedling establishment -- using plant demographic               and competition exclusion approaches.  Additionally, a set of                   predictions extending these concepts to landscape situations will               be tested.  In all, 22 hypotheses and 4 predictions are posed and               these range in scale from individual roots and associated                       mycorrhizae to community-level phenomena.                                                                                                                       The research team for this project is excellent and will                        undoubtedly maintain its pest productivity.  Facilities provided                by the institution for both field and laboratory positions of the               project are first-class.  A high level of scientific productivity               can be expected to result.",
