 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Geographic Kids Network Project is a series of exciting,           flexible elementary science units featuring cooperative experiments in          which students in grades 4-6 share data nationwide using                        telecommunications.  Topics will involve students in issues of real             scientific, social, and geographic significance.  Combining basic               content from typical school curricula and guided inquiry learning, the          Network Project can be used to supplement textbooks and existing                materials or to form complete year-long science courses.                                                                                                        Technical Education Research Centers will produce six units and software        for sending, processing, and displaying data.  The  National Geographic         Society will develop at least four additional units, publish all the            materials, and provide teacher development assistance.  Materials and           telecommunications will be designed for practicality in partnership with        experienced classroom teachers and administrators.  The                         telecommunications will be software-controlled for ease of use and              reliability.  The National Geographic Society and a network of                  professional organizations, state education agencies, and museums will          widely  disseminate information about the program.  Local support and           technical assistance will be generated through industry members of the          Triangle Coalition for Science and Technology Education, school boards,         and community groups.                                                                                                                                           This project is a superb response to the Solicitation, Programs for             Elementary School Science Instruction, issued by the Instructional              Materials Development Program.  The project has high potential for              bringing about a meaningful change in elementary school science learning        and teaching.                                                                                                                                                   The project director, through training and experience, is eminently             qualified to conduct activities.  His track record speaks well for the          success of this project.",
