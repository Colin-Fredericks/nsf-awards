 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hunter College of the City University of New York jointly with the              Research Foundation of the City University of New York will develop an          Urban Environmental Program for Middle and junior High School Teachers          with energy and environmental control as the main theme.  The program           includes workshops, lectures, demonstrations, field trips and a camping         experience where the 70 participates will have the opportunity to               compare and contrast urban and rural environments.                                                                                                              The objectives for the program include developing program for teachers          based on staff prepared materials, computer programs, and material              prepared by NSF sponsored curricula projects and other national                 programs; enabling teachers to master the requisite subject matter and          to acquire techniques for teaching urban environmental studies;                 assisting teachers to develop activities for the classroom and to               implement them; providing problem solving experiences in science and            improving the practice of techniques in teaching problem solving.                                                                                               The staff will develop the program in the fall of 1987, test it during          the spring semester for a small group of participants, and use the              information gained during an intensive three week summer session for            which participants will receive four graduate credits.  Five                    participants will be Visiting Adjunct Lecturers.                                                                                                                Approximately one-half of the project activities will take place at the         Fireboat House Environmental Center, a research center for the study of         energy conservation and analysis of environmental problems.  One-half of        the activities will be held in the science education laboratory at              Hunter College.                                                                                                                                                 Hunter College CUNY has been designated as a minority institution, with         more than one-half of its student body being black or hispanic.  It has         a deep commitment to teacher education and close rapport with the New           York  City public schools built on numerous joint projects.  There is a         unique cooperation between the education division and the division of           science.",
