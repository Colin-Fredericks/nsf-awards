 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this study is to learn the role that cell lineage plays        in specifying the development of the nervous system of a vertebrate.            Dr. Kimmel proposes to determine neuronal cell lineages directly by             filling single progenitor cells present in early embryos of the                 zebrafish with a fluorescent lineage tracer dye.  With the aid of an            image intensifying video camera, he will watch the subsequent                   development of the marked cell and its clonal progeny.  Dr. Kimmel will         keep track of the sequence of divisions and of the movements of                 individual cells in the clone during the period of gastrulation and             subsequent formation of the nervous system, until the time that cells           stop dividing and begin growing axons.  At that stage specific types of         neurons can be recognized.                                                                                                                                           To do this study, Dr. Kimmel will take advantage of the small size,        optical clarity, and rapid development of the zebrafish embryo.  The            principal investigator has described individually identifiable neurons          that begin to differentiate during the first day following                      fertilization, and the primary objective of this project is to learn the        cell lineages that generate these cells.  Dr. Kimmel has a solid                reputation for careful analysis of the development of zebrafish, and            this research will substantially increase our understanding of the role         of cell lineage in specification of cell type in the nervous                    system.",
