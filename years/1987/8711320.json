This can be seen               in the remains of bone and antler projectile points.  This                      project will focus on processes of technological change by                      studying functional continuities and developments in projectile                 points during the early Upper Paleolithic in Belgium, Germany,                  France, and Spain.  Specifically the student will look at                       manufacturing strategies, morphology, and patterns of wear on                   tools.                                                                               While the cultural and biological changes surrounding the                  Middle/Upper Paleolithic transition have recently been the focus                of extensive archaeological inquiry, to date anthropologists have               devoted little attention to patterns, structures, and processes                 of early technological innovation and invention.  This study will               go beyond traditional uses of bone and antler projectile points                 as chronological markers and will enable scholars to discuss the                role of technological styles during the Upper Paleolithic.                           This research involves new methods of investigation and will               result in new information on early Upper Paleolithic technology.                In addition, the use of the concept of innovation to explain the                technological changes connected with early Homo sapiens sapiens                 will shed new light on the emergence of modern human beings.",
