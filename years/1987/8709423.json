 "awd_abstract_narration": "Autonomous Lagrangian Circulation Explorers (ALACEs) are                current-following subsurface floats which periodically rise to                  the surface to be located by the Argos satellite system and                     then return to depth to continue following currents.  They are                  intended to be used in mapping the oceanic general circulation                  and will be of particular value in the World Ocean Circulation                  Experiment (WOCE).  It is proposed to develop and demonstrate                   an operational capability to use these presently developmental                  floats.  Proposed engineering are (a) extending operational                     depth improvements from 1500 m to 4000 m, (b) expansion of data                 relay capacity to permit satellite relay of profile data on                     each ascent, and (c) addition of RAFOS acoustic tracking.                       Proposed field operations include (a) series of local tests of                  longevity, (b) demonstration of a capability to lauch from                      commerical ships of opportunity, and (c) a deployment of 25                     ALACEs in the tropical Atlantic in which floats will be used to                 describe cross-equatorial flow of Antarctic Intermediate Water.                 As a step toward WOCE operations, investigator will be invited                  to suggest other programs to use the ALACE capability developed                 at Scripps.",
