 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cell surface structures that mediate the activation of T               lymphocytes have been identified by genetic means.  To extend our               understanding of the function of this complex of molecules,                     information on the physiology of interaction between these                      structures and their ligand, antigen, must be developed.                        Identification of the antigen binding sites possessed by the                    genetically identified structures will be accomplished by                       utilizing an antigen that can covalently bind to such structures                when irradiated with visible light.  Specifically, sulfo.SANPAH                 immune T lymphocytes will be incubated with sulfo.SANPAH,                       irradiated, and the sulfo.SANPAH labelled structures will be                    identified immunochemically.  A similar approach will be employed               to examine antigen presentation.                                                    The information derived will contribute fundamental knowledge               basic to our understanding of the ontogeny and regulation of the                immune system.  Since this research will be carried out at an                   undergraduate institution, it will also provide undergraduate                   students with exposure to research on a problem at the forefront                of modern immunobiology.",
