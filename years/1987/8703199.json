 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of Dr. Suzanne M. Kay of                  Cornell University in a program of cooperative research with Prof.              Beatriz L. Coira of the Universidad National de Jujuy, Argentina,               aimed at relating visible changes on the surface of the                         earth--collisions between adjacent \"plates\" reflected in the                    formation of mountain ranges or plateaus, for example--to the                   geochemistry of igneous rocks.  Both very old and relatively young              rocks from the high plateau region of central Argentina will be                 analyzed for major and trace element chemistry, and in some cases for           isotopic composition, and the results will be correlated to the                 processes that were involved in the uplift of the plateau and                   generalized to the formation of mountain ranges and high plateaus               generally.                                                                                                                                                      Our understanding of the growth and evolution of the earth's crust              may be improved by studying the distribution and geochemistry of the            volcanic rocks found at the intersections of the plates which form              the earth's crust, since this geochemistry is a function of the time            scale, thermal history, and structural mechanics of the formation of            the crust.  The high plateau of Argentina is an excellent location              for the study of this geochemistry, due to the past concentration but           current cessation of volcanic activity there.  In addition, the area            is well mapped geologically, both terrestrially and from satellites,            and is well-known to local geologists.  The proposed analysis of                volcanic rocks should yield information on time scales and                      temperatures involved in the geological processes of the plateau's              formation, and on the evolving chemistry of crust forming the plateau           itself.  Overall, the proposed study will make excellent                        complementary use of the U.S. principal investigator's expertise in             geochemical analysis techniques, and the Argentine collaborator's               expertise in field petrology, and should result in obtaining a fuller           understanding of the processes that occur in the formation of                   mountain and high plateau regions in general.",
