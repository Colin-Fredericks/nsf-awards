 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  In a joint research project Dr. S. M. Chitre of the Tata          Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay, India and Dr. David Schramm          of the University of Chicago will study the phenomena of supernova.             The physics of supernova has been a theoretically-dominated field for           centuries, but recent events, namely the supernova that occurred on             February 23, 1987, have added a new dimension through the observations          that have occurred, especially in the Large Magellanic Cloud.  The              project will seek to study the physics of the core of the supernova, as         well as the nucleosynthesis products of the supernova, and the                  evaluation of massive stars and their subsequent production and                 dispersion and supernova explosions.                                                                                                                            Significance:  The two scientists who are eminent in the field in their         respective countries plan to collaborate in theoretical studies and             analysis of observational data made worldwide in 1987, to study the             interest phenomena of supernova.  The results of advances in this field         are wide-ranging in the understanding of physics of matter, astronomy           and astrophysics.",
