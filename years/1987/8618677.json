Their                 family ties may be disrupted, their own health often seems to                   deteriorate and it is apparently common for their economic                      situations to be adversly effected. The precise effects expected                would vary, of course, with the relationship between deceased                   and survivor; but there are a number of theoretically                           interesting hypotheses that could be examined. Studies of the                   economic, familial and health-related effects of deaths have                    been limited, however, by the absence of rich data bases.                                                                                                       For nearly 20 years, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)                  has been following a representative sample of households in                     which there are between 50 and l00 deaths each year. These                      deaths have been noted, but not systematically pulled together.                 The extensive information already gathered for PSID households                  along with its longitudinal qualities make it an ideal source of                information from which to create a data base for studying the                   effects of death. In addition, the investigators will link                      information from state death certificates with the PSID data to                 create a data base that will be of substantial value to future                  researchers.",
