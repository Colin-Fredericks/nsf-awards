 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing new insights into the natural source, structure,                     chemistry and catalytic properties of the substances associated                 with the energy fixing cycle of plants is a key element in                      understanding and harnessing the biosynthesis of organic                        compounds.  This project proposes to carry out broad-based                      studies on the chemistry, synthesis and biosynthesis of                         porphyrins, chlorophylls, and other photosynthetic pigments.                                                                                                    Several lines of investigation will be followed, these involving                1) studies of the biosynthesis of certain chlorophylls from green               bacteria, using organic synthesis of radiochemically labeled                    precursors and feeding to a cell homogenate; 2) studies of the                  biological origins of certain unusual side-chains in these                      chlorophylls with respect to photosynthesis; 3) syntheses and                   characterization of novel products (such as chlorins,                           isobacteriochlorins, pyrrocorphins, hexahydroporphyrins,                        octahydroporphyrins) obtained by controlled site-selective                      reduction or photoreduction of porphyrins; 4) studies aimed at                  the organic synthesis of chlorophyll-a and its important divinyl                analogue; 5) syntheses and characterization of the RCI-                         chlorophyll proposed to be in photosynthetic reaction centers; 6)               studies of the biosynthesis of bacteriochlorophyll-a, using                     compounds synthesized in project                                                and spectroscopic characterization, of the products of                          chlorophyll breakdown in senescent leaves and in fruit ripening;                and finally, 8) studies of the biosynthesis of phycocyanobilin,                 an algal photosynthetic pigment, using syntheses of likely                      precursor molecules.  All eight projects rely heavily upon                      synthetic organic chemistry and spectroscopic identity of                       products using physical techniques.",
