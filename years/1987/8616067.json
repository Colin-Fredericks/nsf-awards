 "awd_abstract_narration": "An integrated, field based project will be carried out to:  (a)                 continuously monitor subaqueous debris and turbidity flows for                  temperature, density, velocity, and travel distance in a reservoir              environment; (b) study flow conversions of debris flows to turbidity            currents, specifically by means of hydraulic jumps, and the role of             bottom geometry in such conversions; and (c) correlate the                      characteristics of the flow with the nature of the sediment                     deposition/erosion processes, the bottom geometry, and other parameters         governing the transport processes.  The work will be conducted in               conjunction with a project jointly funded by the U.S. Forest Service,           the Los Angeles County Fire Department, and the L.A. Flood Control              District, in which controlled fires, pollutant and smoke effects,               sediment yields, and debris flows emanating from the burned areas are           being studied.  The site is the Lodi Canyon and Puddingstone Diversion          Reservoir, located in the San Gabriel Mountains near Los Angeles, that          has long hydrologic and sediment records, detailed geologic and                 geomorphic data available, a single sediment input source, a reservoir          of manageable size, and other convenient characteristics and conditions.        The results from this work will help increase the accuracy of                   predictions of the movement patterns and incidence of subaqueous debris         and turbidity flows; the determination of threshold conditions; the             probable travel distance of such events; and an assessment of both the          ability of subaqueous hydraulic jumps to control the deposition of              sediments; and the possible engineered use of these jumps to control the        location of sediment during major flood events.",
