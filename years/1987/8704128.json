 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oncogene activation by retroviral DNA insertion has been                        implicated in a variety of neoplasms.  The present                              application represents our continued effort to understand the                   molecular mechanisms involved in the induction of chicken B                     and T-lymphomas.  In the past two years, we have focused on                     the characterization of a novel avian T-lymphoma identified                     by the CoPI.  This lymphoma is induced by avian                                 reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) and resembles Marek's                         disease herpes virus (MDV) induced T-lymphoma.  We have                         demonstrated that insertional activation pattern differs from                   that found in B-lymphomas induced by the same virus.  We have                   also characterized in detail the structure and expression of                    a provirus involved in c-myc activation in one B-lymphoma                       sample.  Our studies, together with others, have revealed a                     number of interesting ways that retroviruses can modulate the                   LTR promoter activities and their interactions with host                        oncogenes.  Understanding transcriptional modulation of viral                   LTR's and adjacent oncogenes are not only key to our                            understanding of the oncogene-activation process but also                       important in our appreciation of the complex eucaryotic                         transcriptional machinery.  This represents a major focus of                    the present application.  In addition, we wish to continue                      our investigation of possible relationships between REV                         (retroviral) and MDV (herpes viral) induced T-lymphomas.  In                    particular, we propose to further explore the structure and                     significance of the REV LTR-related sequence we have recently                   identified in the pathogenic MDV genome.",
