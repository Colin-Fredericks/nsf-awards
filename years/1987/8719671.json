 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF has sponsored a series of science policy seminars for over a decade         for the science policy community.  PRA wishes to continue the seminar           series for an additional three years.  Since the current contract for           conducting, planning and managing the seminars lapses in November, 1987,        PRA issued an RFP to ensure that the new contractor will be in place by         then.                                                                                                                                                           The purpose of the seminars is to bring together members of the science         policy community on a periodic basis in a venue that allows for                 discussion of science policy issues that are of general interest and            concern.  Speakers and topics for each of the seven annual seminars are         chosen, with NSF input and concurerence, by the contractor, who also            manages and conducts the seminars.  The seminar series serves to keep           PRA, science policy professionals, and local graduate students in the           field, abreast of the issues facing the science policy community.",
