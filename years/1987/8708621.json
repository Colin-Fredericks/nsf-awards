 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aluminosilicate mineral phases allophane and imogolite                 occur as tiny particles in soils and have important effects on                  the movement of nutrients and pollutants in soil, on forest                     productivity and on the response of soils and during road and                   building construction.  These minerals are highly surface-active                and are also metastable relative to the crystalline clays in                    soils.  A knowledge of their surface properties and their                       reactivity is essential to understanding soil evolution and                     surface geological processes.  This proposal requests 50% support               for the acquisition of a high-speed centrifuge that is needed to                separate allophane and imogolite from soil samples in order to                  measure their chemical and physical properties.  The centrifuge                 is to be housed in the Department of Agronomy and Soils at                      Washington State University.",
