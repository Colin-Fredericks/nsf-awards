 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives and Relevancy:  This project is for a cooperative research           between Dr. P. Somasudaran of Columbia University and Drs. R.                   Mallikarjunan and S. Venkatachalam of the Indian Institute of                   Technology (IIT) at Bombay.  The project is aimed towards understanding         the mechanisms of a potential fine beneficiation technique, namely,             electroflotation and developing it for beneficiation of selected                problem ores.  The expertise in IIT, Bombay in electrochemistry and             flotation techniques complement that at Columbia University in surface          and colloid chemical aspects of flotation of fines in the                       investigation.  The study will include the electroflotation of selected         oxides, salt type and sulfide minerals as a function of bubble size and         size distribution charge produced, using different electrode designs,           and studiesof forces of interaction of such bubbles with minerals.  The         U.S.-India program supports cooperative research between scientists of          the two countries in areas of interest to NSF when benefit is expected          to result from the collaboration  This project falls in that category.                                                                                          Merit:  The U.S. scientist is one of this country's top scientists in           the field of materials and minerals processing.  IIT Bombay is one of           India's prestigious academic and research institutes.  The research             area deals with an important problem facing the mining industry in the          U.S. and is also important to India.                                                                                                                            Funding:  The project is being funded under two grants:                           The Indian Inst. of Tech. at Bombay: INT 87-16926                                                    $57,143 in Indian currency                                 Columbia University: INT 87-04303                                                                    $17,135 in Indian currency                                              plus  US$29,218",
