 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem addressed in this project if the estimation of the                  probability or return period for floods when the available information          is for more than one site.  Since floods events are non-deterministic,          the prediction of such events is usually accomplished by using                  probabilistic modeling, usually based on data available at the site of          interest.  But often data exists at regional sites as well, and this is         the information that will be used.                                                                                                                              The project will explore the joint modeling of flows, including                 parameter estimation, and determining the precision and robustness of           the modeling/estimation procedures, testing them against actual flood           data.  Selected joint distribution functions that have marginals used in        single-site flood prediction will be studied together with the joint            models for which some relationship among their parameters are assumed.          Procedures will be developed to estimate parameters and quantile points         as well as deriving the standard errors of such estimators.  Criteria           will be developed to indicate under what conditions better estimators           are obtained using multiple-site data, and the robustness of these              procedures will be assessed.  Software and corresponding manuals for the        developed flood prediction procedures will be produced for personal             computers whenever possible.                                                                                                                                    The P.I.s are highly capable to carry out this work, thus a Standard            Grant is recommended in the amount of $154,310 with a first increment of        $79,526.",
