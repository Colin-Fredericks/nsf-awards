 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal by Dr. Fakhri Bazzaz of Harvard University                   presents an interesting approach to comparative studies of                      seedling growth in a large number of Dipterocarp species from                   Malaysia.  In the past, seedling growth studies in tropical                     forests have largely focused on single or small numbers of                      species.  As a result, it has been difficult to generalize from                 their results.  However, as our knowledge of the ecological                     relationships of tropical forest trees increases, we badly need                 more comparative studies which can allow broader ecological                     principles to be delineated.  In a sense, this study is a more                  physiological approach to the type of demographic studies being                 carried out by other researchers in Panama and Sarawak.  It is                  most timely given the increasing concern about decreasing                       biodiversity in tropical forests and the general alarm about the                rappid disappearence of many tropical forests.                                       Dr. Bazzaz is a world renowned plant ecologist with many                   recognitions and honors for his outstanding work.  Harvard                      University is preeminently suited to support this kind of work.                 The Program recommends funding.",
