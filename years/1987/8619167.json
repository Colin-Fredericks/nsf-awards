 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year cooperative research project between         Dr. James J. Alberts, Senior Research Ecologist and Director, The               University of Georgia Marine Institute, Sapelo Island, Georgia, and             Dr.Zdenek K. Filip, Institute for Water-, Ground-, and Air Hygiene,             Federal Health Office, Langen, Federal Republic of Germany.  The                scientists are collaborating in a study of the binding of ions of the           toxic heavy metals copper, cadmium, and lead to humic acids isolated            from salt marsh estuaries in the United States and from groundwaters in         Germany.  The binding studies will be conducted with selective ion              electrode techniques, in known aquatic matrices of controlled pH and            ionic strength, and will examine the maximum binding capacities of these        humic materials for these heavy metals.  In addition, the effect of             competitive binding by common environmental cations will be                     investigated.  Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectral analyses will         be conducted on the uncomplexed humic materials and on the same                 materials after complexation to the elements in an effort to obtain             information regarding the mechanism of binding by the metals.                                                                                                   Heavy metals introduced into the environment from many commercial               processes continue to pose a potential health hazard to a large portion         of the population in industrialized countries.  The fate of these               elements in the environment is often controlled by chemical reactions of        the metals with naturally occurring organic compounds (humic matter),           which may lead to a greater mobility of the metals in aquatic                   environments.  Two such environments which are of extreme importance are        groundwaters, because of their widespread use as a source of drinking           water, and coastal estuaries, which often support large animal and plant        populations and have both commercial and recreational value. Knowledge          of the interaction of heavy metals with humic matter in these systems is        critical to our understanding of basic environmental processes involving        heavy metals.  The studies to be carried out here will involve                  state-of-the-art analytical techniques in two laboratories with long            histories of research in these areas.  By sharing their complementary           expertise and experimental facilities, the cooperating scientists expect        to make significant advances in their individual research programs.  The        Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft is providing German counterpart support         for the project.",
