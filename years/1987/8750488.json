 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biological Sciences recently has implemented a                curriculum revision involving the creation of three core courses for all        majors - namely - Genetics, Ecology and Cell Biology.  Of these, Cell           Biology had not existed on this campus in the past and Genetics had been        in need of revision.  Instruments procured through this project are             being used to provide current technology to the laboratory portions of          both of these core courses.                                                                                                                                     Included among the new instruments are teaching and instructor's                microscopes equipped with phase-contrast optics that provide for more           effective observation of living cells, and an ultracentriguge.  The             instruments are enhancing both laboratory teaching and student research         projects by making the modern techniques of Light Microscopy and of             Molecular Genetics (especially methods of isolating cellular components)        available to undergraduates.",
