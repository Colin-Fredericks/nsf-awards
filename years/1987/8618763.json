 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has become clear that all, or nearly all, present day star                   formation takes place in molecular clouds, and the process of                   star formation is being vigorously investigated on many fronts.                 In the fundamental stellar cycle -- molecular cloud - star                      formation - stellar structure - stellar evolution - mass ejection               - molecular cloud formation -- it is probably the formation and                 the evolution of molecular clouds which is the least well                       understood.  Furthermore, because the problem of star formation                 on a global scale has been reduced largely to the questions of                  how, when, where, and why molecular clouds form, an understanding               of the formation and evolution of molecular clouds will provide                 an important key to understanding the optical appearance of                     spiral, irregular, and in some cases, peculiar galaxies.                                                                                                        Dr. Blitz, at the University of Maryland, will continue a very                  highly regarded research program to better understand the                       structure and evolution of molecular clouds.  A large number of                 observations will be undertaken using radio astronomical                        techniques, primarily in the millimeter portion of the spectrum,                to probe the full range of known molecular clouds, from the                     recently discovered high latitude clouds to the giant star                      forming clouds.  The radiation from various molecules will be                   observed with most emphasis on the carbon monoxide molecule                     because of its usefulness as an indirect tracer of the dominant                 species, molecular hydrogen.  The data will be combined with                    optical and infrared observations, as well as with observations                 of the atomic hydrogen gas to obtain as complete a picture as                   possible of the progenitors of star formation in our Galaxy and                 in other galaxies.  An equally valuable aspect of Dr. Blitz'                    program is his direct involvement of undergraduate students at                  the University of Maryland in the research effort.",
