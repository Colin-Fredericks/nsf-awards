 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives and Relevance to Program Objectives:  This recommended award         would support a one-year cooperative research project in earth sciences         between Professor David V. LeMone, Department of Geological Sciences,           University of Texas at El Paso, and Dr.Heinz A. Kollmann, Natural               History Museum, Vienna, Austria.  The joint study is aimed at comparing         and contrasting the fossils of gastropods (snails, etc.) found in the           Middle Cretaceous platform carbonates of Europe (Greece) and North              America (Trans-Pecos Region, Texas).  The areas have been separated by          the formation of the Atlantic Ocean as a result of sea floor spreading          during early Cretaceous time, approximately 100 million years ago.  The         resulting analysis will record the degree of endemism (evolutionary             rates) of the gastropods as well as evaluate their potential for use as         index (time) and facies (environment) fossils in comparison with                traditionally utilized forms (bivalves, ammonoids, et al.).  The project        is expected to contribute to improved means of reconstructing geological        history.  The University of Texas at El Paso houses the Southwest               Biostratigraphic Institute, of which Professor LeMone is Director.  The         Institute contains many local paleontological specimens, and is well            situated with reference to the regional Cretaceous sections.  Dr.               Kollmann is an internationally known expert in the field of this                research, and his department at the Natural History Museum in Vienna has        excellent collections and equipment that will be useful in this study.          The project thus contributes to an important objective of NSF's                 cooperative science programs with Western Europe, which is to stimulate         scientific progress by bringing together scientists from the U.S. and           Europe who have similar research interests and who wish to engage in            mutually beneficial research cooperation.  Funds from this award would          support necessary transportation and subsistence expenses for the U.S.          principal investigator, as well as shipping costs.  Return visits by Dr.        Kollmann and members of his research group are expected.                                                                                                        Merit of Proposal:  The prospect of a significant contribution to               scientific knowledge from this proposed research is very good.  The U.S.        principal investigator is a respected, productive scientist.  He will be        working with a foreign researcher who is widely recognized for his              expertise in this field.  The work plan is sound and the budget is              reasonable.  The Austrian Science Foundation (FWF) is providing                 counterpart support for the project and has approved the inclusion of           this activity under the Memorandum of Understanding between the NSF and         the FWF.                                                                                                                                                        Funding:  This award will not duplicate other funding.",
