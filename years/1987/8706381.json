 "awd_abstract_narration": "The reaction chemistry of molybdenum sulfide complexes is                       important in the chemical processing, required to convert crude                 oil to refined products.  The process of hydrotreating crude oil                to remove sulfur and to upgrade feedstock product quality uses                  molybdenum sulfide as a catalyst.                                                                                                                               The objective of the proposed project is to develop the hydrogen                activating capabilities of cationic molybdenum complexes for                    application in the hydrogenolyses of small molecules.  In                       particular, the reactivity of the molybdenum complexes under a                  hydrogen atmosphere will be investigated with substrates such as                nitriles, isonitriles, cyanide ion, dinitrogen, carbon monoxide,                and aromatic heterocycles.  The proposed studies are based on                   promising preliminary results with some of these molecules.  The                characterization of synthetic systems which carry out the                       reductions of these molecules could provide the basis for the                   development of important new catalysts.  The work is also                       significant because it appears to define fundamentally new                      reaction chemistry for sulfido and hydrosulfido ligands in                      homogeneous systems.  The soluble complexes are proposed to                     provide uniquely relevant functional models for reactions                       catalyzed by molybdenum sulfide surfaces, including the                         commercially important hydrodesulfurization reactions.  The                     studies may also provide a basis for understanding mechanistic                  features of reductions catalyzed by metallosulfur sites in                      enzymes.",
