 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the discipline of nonlinear mechanics, much is known about the               theory of deterministic systems.  Phenomena such as internal                    resonance and catastrophic deformation of elastic systems have                  been demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally.                        However, the existence and mechanism of these phenomena in random               vibration have not yet been verified experimentally.  This                      project conducts a series of experimental investigations to                     measure the random response statistics and stability boundaries                 of a number of dynamical models.  In a previous grant, the PI has               developed a non-Gaussian closure scheme for nonlinear systems                   under random parametric excitations.  In this project, the                      theoretically predicted results (from the aforementioned theory)                will be compared to the measured results in order to verify the                 theory.  The models selected for experiment are a liquid sloshing               in a tank, a cantilever beam, and an autoparametric vibration                   absorber.  These models have received extensive experimental and                analytical investigations under harmonic excitations and are                    appropriate models for this project.  The proposed experimental                 work will be very valuable in providing more insight ot the                     random behavior of non-linear systems.                                                                                                                          The Principal Investigator has been a major contributor to                      nonlinear dynamics for several years.  He is well-qualified to                  implement this project.  An award is recommended.",
