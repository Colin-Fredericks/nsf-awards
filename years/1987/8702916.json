 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemical effects of ultrasound have significance in the areas of            bulk liquid processing, in technologies related to emulsification               (e.g. pharmaceuticals and cosmetics), in processes for solvent                  degassing, and solid dispersion (e.g. fume scrubbers).                                                                                                          Although the chemical effects of ultrasound have been recognized for            more than 50 years, understanding of the nature and range of                    sonochemistry remains quite limited.  The principal mechanism involves          acoustic cavitation:  the creation, expansion, and implosive collapse           of small vapor vacuoles in the liquid.  The rapid compression in this           cycle proces intense local heating and thus creates high energy                 chemistry in a cold, condensed medium.  By using comparative rate               thermometry, it has recently been determined that the effective                 temperature reached during cavitational collapse is 5200 Kelvin with            heating and cooling rates of two billion degrees per second|  The               proposed research will deal with the chemical effects of ultrasound on          both homogeneous liquids and on heteerogeneous (liquid-solid) systems.          In the homogeneous area, special emphasis will be placed on                     sonoluminescence of non-aqueous liquids and on organometallic systems.          Examples of homogeneous sonocatalysis with rate enhancements of one             million have been developed and will continue; as well as developing            further analogies to bomb reactions and metal vapor chemistry.  In              heterogeneous systems, the effect of cavitation near surfaces on                particle morphology, surface structure, and both stoichiometric and             catalytic reactivity will be explored.  Already, a 100,000 enhancement          of catalytic activity of Ni due to the removal of a passivating oxide           coating has been discovered.  A wide range of surface analysis                  techniques, especially SEM and Auger electron spectroscopy, will be             used in this work.",
