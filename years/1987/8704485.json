 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Government supports much of the Nation's arctic research and nearly         all its antarctic research.  Because of the relatively high cost of             this research, it is in the Government's interest (and likely but               unprovably to its financial advantage) to facilitate access to                  information resulting from the polar research of other nations.                                                                                                 Polar Geography and Geology was established in 1977 using startup funds         awarded by the Foundation.  The funds were provided in recognition of           the extra cost of publishing a translation journal as compared to a             journal that accepts papers already written in English.  The journal            has consistently met or exceeded the planned publication of four 64-            page issues per year.  It focuses on significant polar literature               translated from the \"difficult\" languages such as Russian, rather than          the Romance languages more familiar to U.S. scientists.  Also included          in each issue are News Notes gleaned from review of the Soviet                  literature and translated tables of contents of selected overseas               journals.                                                                                                                                                       V.H. Winston & Sons Inc. is well suited to publish Polar Geography and          Geology.  It is a large publisher of English-language editions of               Soviet and Japanese scientific journals, and it holds translation and           publication copyright to Soviet publications from which many of the             journal's papers are selected.  A board of editors consisting of                experienced polar scientists (both arctic and antarctic) assists in             selecting articles addressing current needs of the polar science                community.                                                                                                                                                      The intent has been for the journal to become self-supporting through           subscription receipts.  However, the number of subscriptions has not            risen enough to offset increased publication costs, which include               increased royalties to the Soviet Union copyright agency.  In recent            years U.S. scientific interest in polar regions has increased                   substantially.  This award provides for support of the journal over a           2-year period during which an unprecedented marketing effort will be            mounted to try to attract enough additional subscribers to make the             journal self-supporting.                                                                                                                                        Polar Geography and Geology is one of three mechanisms supported wholly         or partially by the Foundation to provide continuing awareness of               foreign-language polar literature.  One of the other two, the Library           of Congress Cold Regions Bibliography Project, lists and, for antarctic         literature, presents English-language abstracts of, the world polar and         cold-regions literature.  In the other mechanism, overseas contractors          paid using excess foreign currencies held by the USA translate papers           into English and translate and publish selected whole books containing          information of lasting value.  Polar Geography and Geology fills the            gap between the bibliographic current awareness service and the books           by translating papers selected for their significance and timeliness.",
