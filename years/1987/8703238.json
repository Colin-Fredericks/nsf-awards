The program is designed to enable U.S.                  scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research              institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well          as Japan, Australia and New Zealand.  Exchange awards provide                   opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of          unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental                  conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                                                Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to             his/her field of science, the prospective potential of the applicants           for professional growth, as well as criteria relevant to the furthering         of international cooperation in science and engineering.  The program           is particularly directed to scientists and engineers who are embarking          on their research careers.                                                                                                                                      This research project will address the study of particle formation              mechanisms occurring during thermal plasma synthesis of fine-powdered           ceramics.  This will be investigated by use of equilibrium-composition          computer codes, and the selection of suitable model systems for                 experimental powder production.                                                                                                                                 This project is under the direction of Dr. Robert M. Young, Department          of Mechanical Engineering, University of Minnesota, 111 Church Street,          S.E., Minneapolis, MN 55455, U.S.A., and Professor I. J. Polmear,               Chairman, Department of Materials Engineering, Monash University,               Clayton Victoria, 31268, Australia.                                                                                                                             This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,              international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents                  allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat            administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
