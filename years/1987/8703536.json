 "awd_abstract_narration": "Narrative:  The proposed research program seeks to conduct a                    systematic study of the hydrodynamics of lifting solid particles                in air drilling; the latter being the process of making bore                    holes (wells) by utilizing air as the circulating fluid for hole                cleaning. Through multiphase hydrodynamic modeling, a predictive                capability would be developed which could be utilized both in                   the design phase as well as the operational phase of air                        drilling.  Numerical solutions of the model would serve as a                    basis for its validation since comparison can be made with                      experimental data obtained.  Not only would the result of this                  study foster a better understanding of the hydrodynamics of the                 system, but equally important is its impact in the optimization                 of air drilling which could result in substantial savings in                    drilling costs.  Furthermore, it would reduce the uncertainties                 currently involved in the air drilling design which is based on                 rules-of-thumb and trial-and-error approaches. These would serve                to encourage greater utilization of this technology which would                 eliminate some of the environmental problems associated with                    traditional drilling methods.",
