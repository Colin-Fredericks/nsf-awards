 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern technology requires that certain mechanical components (in air-          breathing jet engines or nuclear reactors, for example) be subjected to         a limited number of cycles at very high loading.  Failures in these             components begin at stress concentrations; however, very little is              known about the effects of the constraint of the surrounding material           on localized low-cycle fatigue.  The objective of this research is to           use a novel, realtime, interferometric strain measuring technique to            begin to fill this gap.  Strain will be measured over a very short              gauge length at the root of stress concentrations for a variety of              materials and loading conditions.  The research will:  evaluate the             effect of constraints on the cyclic Neuber relation which is currently          used in design of mechanical components; provide design guidance, on an         empirical basis, which will permit a more intelligent estimate of the           effects of the local stress/strain state on low-cycle fatigue; generate         previously unobtainable data which will be valuable to those evaluating         or developing theories for predicting localized cyclic behavior.",
