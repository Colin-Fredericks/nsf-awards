 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational geometry has arisen as an extremely important             field of theoretical computer science and is finding applications               in many other fields, such as robotics, computer-aided design,                  mechanics, computer graphics, operations research, and VLSI                     design.  While the field of computational geometry is still                     young, many recent breakthroughs have resulted in a flurry of                   activity, particularly in applications to robotics.  This project               is designed to identify important areas of robotics to which                    techniques of computational geometry may be applied.  It will                   initially focus on the design and analysis of geometric                         algorithms for robotics, particularly those problems related to                 motion planning and shortest path planning.  The research builds                on an existing body of work in shortest path algorithms for                     motion in the plane in the presence of obstacles and \"weighted                  regions.\"  Further research should improve the bounds on the                    computational complexity of a variety of fundamental problems.  A               better understanding of basic geometric algorithms will lead to                 efficient and effective heuristics for solving important problems               in robotics.",
