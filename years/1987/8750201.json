Use of such technology provides an excellent learning                           environment/program in an introductory Human Physiology laboratory.  For        some years, students have collected and interpreted data related to             physiological concepts by using transducers, monitors and bioamplifiers.        By combining an IBM XT computer and Coulbourn's physiology research             system, students now are able to store the data and to develop                  simulations based upon them.  Use of such models permits them for               example, to observe the effects of an experimental intervention without         actually putting the subject at risk.  The system is bridging concepts          in physiology and computer information management, allowing students to         further advance their science education as well as to develop their             skills with computer applications.",
