 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for support of research under the Foundation's            Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) Awards program.                                Dr. Chandra's research efforts aim at developing a knowledge-              based system that will rationally arrive at an integrated design of             the actual manufacturing process.  The ability to make rational                 decisions based on the synthesis of various pieces of information               and to eventually arrive at an integrated design plays a very                   important role in everyday engineering practice.  Accordingly, the              proposed project aims at developing a conceptual framework for                  manufacturing design from a causal perspective.  This framework is              then used in developing a knowledge-based system that will gain                 insight into the process from a few detailed analyses and                       experiments on simplified models and will rationally arrive at an               integrated design of the actual process using a hybrid axiomatic-               algorithmic approach for design synthesis.  The fundamental                     principles are quite general and may be applied to any manufacturing            process such as metal cutting, metal forming, casting, welding, etc.            This project on manufacturing design has three primary components:              (1) establishment of a conceptual framework from a causal                       perspective and identification of general principles and axioms for             manufacturing design, (2) identification of functional and physical             hierarchies through a causal analysis, and (3) integration of                   manufacturing design based on the conceptual framework according to             the identified hierarchies.                                                          The objectives of the PYI program are to provide support to the            Nation's most outstanding and promising young science and                       engineering faculty.  The awards are intended to improve the                    capability of U.S. academic institutions to respond to the demand               for highly qualified scientists and engineers for academic and                  industrial research and teaching.  In accordance with those                     objectives, a Presidential Young Investigator Award for Dr. Chandra             is recommended.                                                                      This is a five-year continuing award.  Annual funding will be              at the base level of $25,000 with a supplement of up to $37,500 to              match industrial support obtained.",
