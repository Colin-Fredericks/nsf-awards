 "awd_abstract_narration": "Backstops of accretionary wedges must play a critical role              in the evolution of wedge development, but no agreement exists as               to their significance or fundamental structure, whether backstops               dip toward or away from the toe of the wedge.  No region is                     sufficiently well imaged to answer this fundamental question                    satisfactorily.  We propose a large source, multichannel study of               the forearc and backarc areas of the eastern Sunda arc,                         Indonesia, where we have found evidence of backthrusting in the                 forearc and backarc thrusting in the backarc.  Imaging the                      backthrust (the Sawu thrust near Sumba Island) and backstop                     geometry will have significant implications for:  a) defining the               tectonic incorporation of forearc basin strata into the rear of                 the wedge during backthrusting;  b) identifying the earliest                    accretionary products of the wedge, and thus initiation of                      subduction accretions; and c) determining relative timing                       relations between backthrusting and back arc thrusting in a zone                of arc-continent collision.  The latter will require a program of               drilling, and the multichannel study will provide a framework for               such a program.  These questions will also be addressed in a                    small accretionary wedge developed along the zone of backarc                    thrusting, where we can completely image the structure of the                   backstop and lower plate beneath the wedge.  In addition, we                    propose to carry out 8 days of digital single-channel seismic                   profiling within the Banda Sea, using a 1,000 cubic inch tuned                  source array.  The objective will be regional seismic                           stratigraphy in preparation for drilling in l988.",
