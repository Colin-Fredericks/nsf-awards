 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support to Prof. John Cioffi under the Foundation's         Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) program.  This research concerns          the digital signal processing implementation of communication systems.          Specifically much of the work concerns algorithms for adaptive filtering        for data transmission.  Such adaptive filtering is quite useful for             obtaining the highest data rates on the largely unknown but slowly              varying environment which is the typical communications line.  The              adaptive filters slowly track this variation and then alter the                 transmitted signals so as to maintain maximum thruput.                                                                                                          The PYI Awards program provides research support to the Nation's most           outstanding and promising young science and engineering faculty.  The           awards are intended to improve the capability of U. S. academic                 institutions to respond to the demand for highly qualified science and          engineering personnel for academic and industrial research and                  engineering.  This PYI has made significant contributions to his field          of engineering and has potential to become a leader in academic research        and education. The diary note describes the rigorous selection                  procedure.  A grant award is highly recommended.  Dr. Cioffi has                obtained the maximum matching funds, so an award of $62500 is                   recommended.",
