 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Dr. Longacre to return to Northern Luzon in                  the Phillipines to continue research among the Kalinga people.                  The Kalinga are a \"traditional\" group in which both pottery and                 basketry is locally produced. With the help of both U.S. and                    Phillipino assistants Dr. Longacre will continue his work to                    learn how material objects are produced, used and finally                       discarded. In particular, he will continue to follow a population               of over 2,000 pots in use and through household inventories to                  obtain an accurate picture of just how long pots last. He will                  also undertake detailed studies of the surface alteration of                    pottery which results from use and make a substantial collection                of \"used\" pots for research and teaching. This pottery project is               an outgrowth of prior NSF supported research. Dr. Longacre will                 also begin a basketry study which is important because while                    women produce pottery, baskets are made by men. Thus it will be                 possible to compare male.female differences in production.                                                                                                      Although the team is working with living people, the goal of this               research is archaeological. Because potsherds are well preserved                they are often recovered in archaeological contexts and in many                 sites constitute the majority of the excavated finds. From these                archaeologists must make inferences about the people who made                   them, and unless one knows how pottery is produced and how it                   functions in a society this can be extremely difficult to do. In                this project the study of use wear should make it possible to                   infer the uses to which particular vessels were put. Through                    study of breakage rates it should be possible, on the basis of                  archaeologically recovered remains, to determine the number of                  total pots in the population.",
