 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator will study a number of questions                concerning maps of surfaces into a compact manifold. The maps                   under consideration will satisfy an elliptic partial differential               equation. In particular he plans to study the structure of the                  moduli space of harmonic maps of the two-sphere into a                          homogeneous Kaehler manifold. He will also investigate minimal                  surfaces in the complex projective plane and study pseudo                       holomorphic curves with a view to applications in symplectic and                other geometries.                                                                    Jon Wolfson has established himself as one of the world                    leaders in the theory of harmonic maps. He has accumulated a vast               repertory of techniques, such as the structure of semi-simple Lie               groups, complex algebraic geometry and partial differential                     equations.                                                                           The subject of harmonic maps has recently acquired                         prominence following the discovery of interesting global                        structure theorems on their moduli spaces. In addition the                      connections with minimal surface theory in low dimensional                      topology and with sigma-models in mathematical physics have led                 to a spectacular growth in the number of researchers in this                    area.",
