 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular species in fluid solution, in rigid matrices, and attached            to surfaces are to be considered with the overall objectives and                significance being the correlation of electronic structure and                  reactivity and in establishing the detailed pathway by which light-             and electrochemically-induced reactions occur. There are potential              applications in electronic switching devices, microelectronics,                 semiconductors and related electronic materials.                                                                                                                Photochemical and electrochemical studies of organometallic molecules           in fluid solution, in rigid media, and on surfaces are proposed.  The           objective of the research is to understand chemical and physical                consequences associated with changes in the electron configuration of           the metal complex.  Additionally, chemical and spectroscopic                    characterization of photochemically and electrochemically generated             intermediates will be carried out in order to better understand                 mechanisms of photoreactions and redox processes.  Specific systems to          be investigated include metal-metal bonded complexes to determine               factors influencing photosubstitution reactivity and the reactivity of          coordinatively unsaturated metal-metal bonded systems.  Another class           of molecules to be investigated are mononuclear systems to establish            aspects of the mechanism of stoichiometric and catalytic reactions.             The approach involves using light to generate coordinatively                    unsaturated species at low temperature followed by warm up experiments          to effect thermal reactions.  The remaining thrust of the research              involves synthesis of redox polymers to illustrate that reactivity of           bound organometallic subunits can be tuned by electrochemical means.",
