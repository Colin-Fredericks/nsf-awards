 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is a study of conformation disorder in polymer               systems by vibrational spectroscopy.  Disorder plays an important               role in determining the properties of polymeric materials, and                  this has stimulated much activity aimed at characterizing and                   understanding its complex nature.  The range of applicability of                vibrational spectroscopy to disorder has been seriously limited                 by the absence of a general, but practical, theory that can be                  used to provide quantitative relations between the conformational               statistics and the infrared or Raman spectrum of a system of                    disordered chain molecules.                                                          Work by the authors has led to a model that enables general                relations to be established between the structure and spectra of                disordered chains.  The model is based on the finding that the                  vibrations of disordered chains have some of the long-range                     coherence of ordered chains.  Preliminary results on a simple                   system show that infrared band shapes calculated with this model                reproduce the main features of those observed.                                       This model will be modified to make it more widely                         applicable.  A second approach to this problem will also be                     pursued in which the spectra of ensembles of disordered chains                  are generated numerically by summing the spectra computed for                   each constituent conformer.  Spectra obtained in this way will be               used to develop models that relate spectra and disorder, and to                 test conformational models that have been proposed for various                  polymers.  In addition, vibrational spectroscopy and other                      available techniques, including inelastic neutron scattering,                   will be used to study a variety of disordered polymer systems.                  Special emphasis will be devoted to systems that exist in                       nonequilibrium states and to chain monolayers, liquid crystals,                 and liquid crystal polymers.",
