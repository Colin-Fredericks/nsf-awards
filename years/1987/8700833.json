 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in Organic Chemmistry will significantly contribute to our         understanding of the relationship that exists between the chemical              composition and structure of a cell and the function of cell surfaces.          Insights into the molecular basis of cell-cell recognition using will           be gained through use of supported planar lipid films (SPLF's) as cell          surface probes.                                                                                                                                                 This research focuses on the preparation of a new class of supported            planar lipid films (SPLF's), based on the spontaneous assembly of               sulfur-bearing phospholipids on gold.  Resulting surfaces are intended          to provide an opportunity for studying surface structure-bioactivity            relationships that would be difficult or impossible to examine using            conventional SPLF's.                                                                                                                                            Immediate chemical objectives of this program include:  (1) defining            the compactness, uniformity and orientation of a series of thiol-               bearing phospholipid monolayers on planar gold surfaces, (2) exploring          the feasibility of polymerizing adsorbed thiol- and disulfide-based             phospholipids on gold, (3) preparing polymeric phospholipid monolayers          on gold from preformed lipid polymers and (4) defining the stability of         each of the above phospholipid monolayers with regard to lateral                migration, and displacement by thiol-containing agents and organic              solvents.",
