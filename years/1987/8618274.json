Survey data on products, markets, production facilities, and workforce          characteristics will be integrated with data from other sources on local        labor markets and on the semiconductor industry generally.  The goal of         the research is to relate internal firm activities and business                 strategies to the locational behavior and regional impacts of those             firms.                                                                                                                                                                  This research will bridge a gap between work that focuses on the        spatial division of labor within narrowly-defined industries and studies        of local economies dominated by externally-owned establishments.  It            will produce information on the enterprise-specific effects of                  industrial location and change.  In addition to deepening our general           understanding of the operations of local labor markets, Professor               Harrington's research will improve the ability of economic development          planners to forecast the impacts of specific industrial location                decisions.",
