 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experiments are proposed to investigate the permeability                   properties of the nuclear pores during periods of cellular                      activity in which there are differences in macromolecular                       exchanges between the nucleus and cytoplasm.  Since qualitative                 and quantitative changes in RNA and protein synthesis are known                 to occur during cell proliferation, the experiments will be                     performed on quiescent, growing, and dividing human diploid                     fibroblasts, and also HeLa cells in different stages of the cell                cycle.  Pore function will be analyzed by microinjecting various                size colloidal gold particles coated with 1) endogenous proteins                that are transported into the nucleus, 2) exogenous                             macromolecules that lack transport signals  but can diffuse                     through the pores, and 3) RNA which is transported out of the                   nucleus.  The coated gold particles will be injected into either                the nucleoplasm or cytoplasm, and the cells will be examined with               the electron microscope.  By analyzing the size distribution and                number of particles present in the nucleus and cytoplasm it                     should be possible to determine the functional size of the                      transport and diffusion channels, as well as the relative rates                 of exchange across the envelope.  In addition, the percent of                   pores involved in transport during specific periods of activity                 will be determined.                                                                  Nuclear pores selectively control the flow of macromolecules               between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of the cell.                   The rules governing transport are currently unknown.  The studies               proposed are significant in that the results obtained will                      provide a clearer understanding of the types of signals that are                involved in establishing the direction and rate of transfer.",
