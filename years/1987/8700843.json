 "awd_abstract_narration": "A peptide  called Neuropeptide Y has been known for some                   time to be present in brain and peripheral nerves of vertebrates,               including in nerve fibers innervating the pancreas.  It has been                reported to have a number of actions, including effects on                      insulin release from the pancreas (islets of Langerhans).  An                   analog of Neuropeptide Y, known as \"aPY\", has been characterized                and was found to be synthesized as a precursor, pro-aPY, in one                 cell type of the anglerfish islets of Langerhans. (The anglerfish               islets are an ideal experimental system for these studies because               they are anatomically distinct structures in contrast to other                  vertebrates where the islet tissue is mingled with tissue of the                exocrine pancreas.)  A distinct form of Neuropeptide Y-like                     peptide has been identified in peripheral nerves present in the                 anglerfish islets.  The objectives of the proposed research are:                                                                                                1. To determine whether aPY is amidated (Amidation is necessary                 for maintainance of biological activity of many peptide                         mediators.) and, if so, to determine the characteristics of the                 enzyme responsible.  2. To determine the primary structure of the               Neuropeptide Y-like peptide found in the islet neuronal tissue.                 3. To determine the neurotransmitter in the neuronal processes                  that contain the neuronal form of Neuropeptide Y.  4. To study                  the effects of Neuropeptide Y, aPY, and the neuronal Neuropeptide               Y-like peptides on islet hormone release.                                            The results will provide the first information about the                   biologically active, distinct forms of Neuropeptide Y-like                      peptides from islet cells and from peripheral nerve fibers                      present in the islets, about the neurotransmitters which may be                 released coordinately with the peptides , and the roles of                      cellular and neuronal forms of NPY-like peptides in regulating                  insulin release from the islets.",
