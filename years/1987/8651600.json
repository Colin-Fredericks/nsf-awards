 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will conduct a 15-month exploratory research effort to             examine the feasibility of working with experienced LOGO teachers as            collaborative researchers in their own classrooms, to define critical           aspects of LOGO learning, and to develop a methodology for assessing and        enhancing critical aspects of LOGO learning in elementary classrooms,           grades 4-6.                                                                                                                                                     The Principal Investigators plan to accomplish the following specific           tasks:                                                                                                                                                          1.To develop a well-defined set of approximately ten critical                   aspects of LOGO learning, articulated in developmental sequences                informed by observations in elementary classrooms, grades 4 - 6.                                                                                                2.To develop a draft set of observation, data collection, and                   enhancement techniques, suitable for use by classroom teachers,                 with respect to these critical aspects of LOGO learning.                                                                                                        3.To develop and document a methodology of teacher/research seminars            designed to enable practicing teachers to observe, enhance and                  report on critical aspects of LOGO learning in their own                        classrooms.                                                                                                                                                     4.To conduct a preliminary study of the professional development of             participating teachers, as the basis for a testable plan for                    teacher enhancement, using the research seminar methodology                     developed by this project.                                                                                                                                      5.To develop a plan for the next phase of development of a guidebook            for teachers on observing, assessing and enhancing critical                     aspects of LOGO learning in their classrooms, and for the                       development of any other educational materials needed to use this               approach with less experienced LOGO teachers.                                                                                                                   6.To develop a plan for further research based on these methods, in             the areas of teacher development and student mathematical                       learning.                                                                                                                                                       The potential of LOGO as a tool for teaching and learning mathematical          (numerical and geometrical) problem solving is vast but unrealized in           elementary school classrooms.  This exploratory research holds high             salience for the Research in Teaching and Learning Program in its effort        to generate knowledge of high utility for the development of programs           and materials of national significance for teacher education.  Because          the propotype teacher education materials and strategies being developed        have potential for national utility, the project is co-funded by the            Instruc-tional Materials Development Program.                                                                                                                   The Principal Investigators have extensive experience with teaching             LOGO.  They are well-qualified to conduct this project and will be              assisted by a distinguished groups of LOGO research experts.",
