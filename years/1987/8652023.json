 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mechanical Universe and Beyond The Mechanical Universe is a one-            year college-level physics course for national television currently             under development at Caltech and supported by a $5.8 million grant from         the Annenberg/CPB Project.  This project has three objectives: (1) to           produce videotape adaptations and print materials based on Beyond The           Mechanical Universe for use in high schools, (2) to conduct regional            workshops on the use of the materials, and (3) to plan dissemination            procedures for promoting the increased effective use of the materials by        all teachers.  The last objective will utilize results from two years of        field testing and from related special projects.                                                                                                                The academic and television staff of the Caltech project will work              closely with a group of outstanding high school teachers, the Materials         Development Council, to continue the development of the materials.  In          addition, Council members will conduct workshops on the use of materials        for teachers residing in their local areas.  The videotapes and                 supportive written materials will be field tested by the Council members        and by the teachers participating in the workshops.  The results of the         evaluation will be utilized to modify the materials.  The project has           undergone thorough evaluations, and staff have made effective use of the        results in revising the materials.  In addition to evaluation done to           yield information for revisions, data was also gathered from teacher and        student participants as to their reactions to the materials.  \"The              strong positive nature of the responses and the comments received               encourages the evaluators and the staff to believe that what has been           begun and what will continue to be accomplished has the potential to            make a major contribution to the strengthening of physics instruction in        the nation's public schools\".  The project director's training and              experiences, as well as his track record amply qualify him to undertake         project direction responsibilities.",
