 "awd_abstract_narration": "Associative memories are composed of a collection of interconnected             elements having data storage capabilites.  The elements are accessed in         parallel by the content of a data probe vector rather than by a specific        address.  Recently, models referred to as the Hopfield AMN have received        much attention.  These models are simple to analyze and exhibit some of         the behavioral features of neural networks.  To incorporate these               features, some new models will be explored which retain enough of the           simple structure of the Hopfield AMN that makes them amenable to                analysis.  The objective is to obtain a better understanding of the             properties and behavior of various types of AMN.  The principal                 investigator is analyzing the dynamic and information storage                   capabilities of several new models.  Many of the new models are subject         to some physical constraints and interconnection costs, and it is               appropriate to formulate various network design and analysis problems as        optimization problems.                                                          The research will have important implications for the use of AMN in             computer architectures of the future, matched to challenging problems in        signal processing, communications, control, and artificial intelligence.        Understanding the relationship between parameters of various AMN and            their information storage capacities is a step towards determining the          most useful aspects of this form of parallel distributed computing.",
