 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bowdoin Scientific Station (BSS) is a biological field                 station located on Kent Island in the Bay of Fundy.  BSS contains               over 125 ha of boreal forest, old field, and marsh.  Since 1935                 the field station has fostered research in terrestrial ecology,                 resulting in usage of the station by over 3000 people and the                   publication of over 55 scientific papers.                                            Current research programs at BSS include long-term                         population censuses, behavioral ecology, mate choice, lifetime                  reproductive success and developmental biology of birds; acoustic               communication in colonially breeding birds; and the effects of                  herbivore grazing and fog-borne pollutants on forest dynamics.                  BSS offers an excellent opportunity for integrative, multi-                     faceted research in terrestrial biology because of its habitat                  diversity, 50-year data base on climate and populations, and                    recent initiation of new research directions at the site.                            This project will provide funds for improvements in                        facilities and scientific instrumentation to modernize the field                station and enhance the research programs of all station users,                 especially undergraduates.  Three general improvements are                      included:  1) electrification of the research laboratory; 2)                    upgrading of equipment, including a microcomputer and data                      loggers with environmental sensors for on-site data entry and                   analysis; 3) insulation of the laboratory and dormitories to                    extend the useful season of the station.",
