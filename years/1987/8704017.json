 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is being sponsored jointly by the Divisions                   of Chemistry and Advanced Scientific Computing.  Professor                      Friesner intends to develop new and rapid means for carrying                    out quantum-mechanical calculations on molecules too large to                   be treated by conventional means.  The methods would be of                      significant value to experimental chemists, allowing detailed                   quantum-mechanical treatments of systems now accessible only to                 semi-empirical approximate methods.                                                  The work involves a novel algorithm for solving                            self-consistent electronic structure equations that leads to a                  reduction of computation time by a factor of 1.6N, where N is                   the basis set size, while maintaining accuracy comparable to                    existing methods.  The method involves a synthesis of the usual                 quantum-chemical LCAO approach with the pseudospectral method,                  a numerical technique used in hydrodynamic simulations of                       turbulence.  The efficiency of the calculations is achieved by                  eliminating the vast majority of two-electron integrals and by                  altering the computational scaling from a proportionality to                    N^4 to one of only N^3.  Accuracy in relative energies is                       retained by removing aliasing errors, rendering the results                     nearly equivalent to those obtained from the Roothaan                           procedure.  The algorithm will be tested and optimized for a                    series of small molecules and will be generalized to excited                    state, density functional, and generalized valence-bond                         calculations.",
