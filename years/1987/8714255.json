 "awd_abstract_narration": "The tectonic evolution of orogenic systems developing at                   convergent margins involves steady state and episodic processes.                Steady state processes, such as subduction or arc magmatism have                received considerable study, however, it is becoming apparent                   that many orogenic belts have a history involving relatively                    short, discrete periods of deformation superimposed on the steady               state processes.  This project examines the effect of a collision               of an active spreading center with a convergent margin.  The                    Chile margin triple junction in southern Chile is the best modern               example available for study because of its relatively well known,               simple kinematic evolution.  The work involves study of a 3-4 Ma                ophiolite exposed on land 15km from the trench, silicic plutons                 near the ophiolite and associated hot springs, and faults and                   uplifted recent deposits.  Results are expected to document a                   variety of features related to the subduction of an active ridge                that may be used in the interpretation of ancient systems.",
