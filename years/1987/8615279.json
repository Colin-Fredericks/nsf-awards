 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support research to improve understanding of air-water         mass transfer.  The liquid film coefficient relates to low solubility           and relatively unreactive compounds where air-water transfer is                 controlled by the water phase or by both phases, such as O2, N2, CO2,           DDT, most PCB's, and several mercury compounds.  The coefficient                describes the resistance to transfer in the liquid phase.  A unique             flume has been designed and built to study water-phase controlled mass          transfer on the scale of a laboratory flume, while maintaining the              measurement accuracy of a contained tank or laboratory beaker.  The most        fundamental objective of this research is to determine the basic                mechanism by which a flowing open channel interacts with the free water         surface to reduce the liquid film coefficient.  The results are expected        to provide a basis for the evaluation of existing natural stream data           and to specify the important parameters to be measured when determining         the liquid film coefficient in natural streams.                                                                                                                 The principal investigator is highly qualified to carryout the proposed         research.  A two year continuing grant is recommended.  This award is           for $75,827 for the first year.",
