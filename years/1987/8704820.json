 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thyristor converters are used in a wide variety of applications such            as industrial drives and power supplies.  During the process of power           conversion, harmonics of varying levels are introduced in the output.           It becomes necessary to limit the harmonic content below a specified            value.  While the computation of harmonics by analytical methods is             not possible, the only other method is to record the actual waveform            and analyze it using a computer.  In the method analysis proposed, the          experimental waveform is monitored and stored using a digital                   oscilloscope and then analyzed using a personal computer system.  It            is possible to evaluate different types of converters and identify              sources of malfunction by this method.                                                                                                                          In a conventional thyristor rectifier, an attempt to reduce the out             put voltage by increasing the firing angle results in a low power               factor.  It is proposed to develop converter systems with improved              power factor by adding a suitable force-commutation circuit.  This              simulating package I-G SPICE will be used to design and analyze new             converter configurations.  The outcome of the research, thus, will              have a definite impact on the current thyristor drive technology.",
