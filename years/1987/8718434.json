 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamic simulation of multi-chain robotic systems, such as multiple             manipulators for multilegged vehicles, is computationally complex               involving a large number of repetitive matrix inversions and                    trigonometric function evaluations.  \"Super-realtime\" computational             rates for simulation (planning seconds of motion in milliseconds) are           needed for predicting the response of the system in order to determine          the coordination/control strategies to ensure safety and stability while        optimizing the planned trajectory.                                                                                                                              It is believed that parallel algorithms for the dynamical equations can         be developed which will significantly speed up simulation so that               realtime prediction of system response will be possible.  The Electrical        Engineering Department of the Ohio State University will be purchasing a        32-node suitable for developing parallel algorithms.  In fact, the              dynamical equations in the recursive doubling form may map directly onto        the hypercube.  The dynamical equations are known, but the hypercube is         a new computational system for which only limited software is available.                                                                                        This Expedited Award for Novel Research will take full advantage for            this new parallel computer to test the viability of parallel algorithms         for realtime system simulation.                                                 The institutional support is adequate and the PI is well                        qualified, I recommend support.",
