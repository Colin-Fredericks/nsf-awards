 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical advances in the design and current applications of the                Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) are making it increasingly desirable         for undergraduate Biology majors to gain experience in using it.  The           recent arrival of two new faculty members with expertise in SEM                 technology have made this a propitious time for the Department to               develop two new courses, Electron Microscopy and Advanced Developmental         Biology.  Both of these use scanning electron microscopy as a primary           technique.  In addition, the SEM will be used for demonstrations in the         Introductory Biology, Developmental Biology (core) and Botany courses,          providing an introduction to the instrument for all students taking             courses in this Department.                                                                                                                                     This faculty successfully employed a SEM in the instructional program           until the demise of their former instrument several years ago.  The old         SEM had featured prominently in student research projects.  Based on            their educational experience with the earlier, somewhat primitive               instrument, they now have selected a modern, more adaptable instrument -        - the Zeiss DSM 950.  The virtues of this instrument include its ease of        operation for students and its digitalized design which allows                  integration into existing computer facilities, providing enhanced               capability for automating analyses.  The Department already possessed           the requisite ancillary equipment such as coating devices, critical-            point drying apparatus and computer facilities.  Thus funds were needed         only for the SEM itself.  A substantial contribution from the Hilden            Trust, when added to the College matching funds, has provided a                 substantial overmatch to the Federal grant for this project.",
