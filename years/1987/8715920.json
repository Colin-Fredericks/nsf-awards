This award is funding an Industry Planning Meeting to study                the feasibility and viability of an I/UCR Center on Thin Films and              Interfaces to be operated by Brown University and the University                of Rhode Island.  The universities have drafted a prospectus for                the centers research and operations that will provide a basis of                study at the September 28 and 29, 1987 meeting.  The co-principal               investigator and their colleagues are recognized experts in their               fields and have the necessary industrial interaction to run this                meeting.                                                                             This award has been coordinated with Dr. Ranga Komanduri,                  Division of Mechanics, Structures, and Materials Engineering.                        The Program Manager recommends that Brown University (along                with the University of Rhode Island) be awarded a $12,000 grant                 for one year for an Industry Planning Meeting for an I/UCR Center               for Thin Films and Interfaces.  Future funding will be based on a               new proposal.",
