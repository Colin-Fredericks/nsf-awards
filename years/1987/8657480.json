 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for support of research under the Foundation's            Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) Awards program.                                Dr. Stein's research is directed at design and control of servo            systems.  The work is divided into six projects.  Four of these                 areas are concerned with machine development for factory automation.            The other two areas are concerned with the development of improved              prostheses for lower limb amputees.  The specific projects are as               follows: Control of DC Servo Machine Tool Drive Systems for Machine             Diagnostics, Design and Control of Pneumatic Servo Systems for                  Factory Automation, Expert Systems Applied to Model Based                       Diagnostics of Servo Systems, Models of Machine Tool Drive Train                Components for Machine Diagnostics, Design and Control of Prosthetic            Limbs, and Development of Microprocessor Controlled Above-Knee                  Prostheses Simulator.                                                                The objectives of the PYI program are to provide support to the            Nation's most outstanding and promising young science and                       engineering faculty.  The awards are intended to improve the                    capability of U.S. academic institutions to respond to the demand               for highly qualified scientists and engineers for academic and                  industrial research and teaching.  In accordance with those                     objectives, a Presidential Young Investigator Award for Dr. Stein is            recommended.                                                                         This is a five-year continuing award.  Annual funding will be              at the base level of $25,000 with a supplement of up to $37,500 to              match industrial support obtained.",
