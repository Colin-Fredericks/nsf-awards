 "awd_abstract_narration": "Appellate processes in state courts have on the whole been woefully             neglected as an area of social scientific research.  They have been             particularly ignored with respect to criminal appeals, a vital area to          be examined in view of the wave of reform that has swept over criminal          sentencing in many states during the past few years.  Only a handful of         empirical studies of these processes exist.  Dr. Moore's research               will not only increase our understanding of the criminal appeal                 process, but will reveal the kinds of problems that sentencing reform           has created in a state that has been in the vanguard of the sentencing          guidelines movement.                                                                                                                                            The immediate objectives of Dr. Moore's study are to examine                    1) increases in appellate caseload due to the sentencing guidelines,            2) the area of sentencing policy generating a given appeal, 3) the              extent to which factors other than sentencing policy explain the                tendency to appeal, and 4) appellate court outcomes.  Minnesota                 is an excellent choice as the research site for the study since this            state has been a pioneer in developing sentencing guidelines and in             involving appellate courts in criminal sentencing.  Minnesota's reforms         have been a model for other states and knowledge of their consequences          for the state's appellate courts and the reactions of those courts to           reforms will add a valuable dimension to our understanding of changes           in criminal sentencing.  The data set to be compiled and archived               includes a comprehensive corpus of appellate court opinions since the           initiation of sentencing guidelines, data on all criminal appeals, and          on sentenced offenders.  Thus, this research should add an important            component to our scientific understanding of both appellate process and         a major change in American law--the involvement of appellate courts             in sentencing decisions.",
