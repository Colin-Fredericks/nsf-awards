 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent work from the laboratory of Dr. Patterson as well as from                other research groups has identified several secreted and cell                  surface molecules which may be involved in the intercellular                    interactions mediating axon growth and synapse formation.  The                  goal of this project is to determine the functional role in                     neuronal development and regeneration of one of these sets of                   molecules . proteolytic enzymes or proteases.                                                                                                                   Dr. Patterson and his colleagues have biochemically characterized               several proteases, including plasminogen activator, which are                   spontaneously released by the distal tips of growing neurites in                culture.  In addition, these researchers have partially                         characterized two irreversible plasminogen activator inhibitors                 which are released by muscle and peripheral glial cultures.                     Recent evidence from Dr. Patterson's lab has shown that                         inhibition of plasminogen activator can increase the rate of                    neurite outgrowth in culture.  The proposed work will extend                    these studies to an \u001a\u001ain viv\u001a\u001ao (rat and chick) preparation.  The               experimental strategy is to use antibodies to perturb the                       activity of this protease and observe the effect on regenerating                peripheral and central nerves in the intact animal.                                                                                                             The establishment of complex synaptic arrays during vertebrate                  neural development is the result of an equally complex series of                cellular interactions between neurons and their targets.  These                 interactions occur throughout the various stages of cell                        migration, axonal outgrowth, recognition of target cells,                       differentiation of synaptic elements, and reorganization and                    maintenance of final connections.  This research will contribute                to our understanding of the role of proteases in axonal outgrowth               during development and regeneration in the nervous system.",
