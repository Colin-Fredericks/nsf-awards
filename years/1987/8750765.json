 "awd_abstract_narration": "Goucher College will buy an atomic absorption spectrometer (AA).           The AA will be used in a variety of upper level chemistry and biology           courses, and it will also be the major piece of equipment used in six           week intensive projects, where chemistry and biology students join              forces to investigate the uptake of heavy metals in aquatic organisms.          This project will simulate the interaction of biologists and chemists           typical of research or industrial settings and will require both                independence and communications skills.  This project may serve as a            model for cooperative teaching between disciplines where shared                 expertise is focused on different aspects of the same question.                      After receiving background in toxicology and instrumental analysis         respectively, the biology and chemistry students will join forces.              Biology students will formulate the basic questions about metal uptake          and toxicity and then consult their chemist peers to develop the                experimental design and analytical protocol for metal analysis in               tissues using the AA.  The biology and chemistry students will then             analyze the samples and interpret the data together.  This is an                excellent place for students to experience the benefits of modern               computer interfaced instrumentation, for it will greatly affect their           ability to answer scientific questions.  The sensitivity of the AA will         permit detection of trace levels of metals in the environment or in             tissues.  Sample automation will allow enough samples for thorough data         analysis, which will in turn be greatly facilitated by the onboard              graphics and data management software of the AA.",
