The PIs' earlier work has shed significant light on how we                      understand anaphoric or pronominal references and their                         relationship to their antecedents in the context of a                           discourse, and how we decide which of various possible readings                 of a word or phrase is the right one in a given context.                                                                                                        The latter work has led to the focal topic of the current                       research.  Results of their experiments and those of others,                    coupled with recent developments in linguistic theory, have                     suggested that the so-called \"thematic\" structure of verbs                      plays a key role in interpreting sentences containing those                     verbs.  The investigators have developed a model of the                         language-understanding process, centered on thematic structures,                that makes strong empirical predictions.  The current research                  is a series of experiments designed to test those predictions.",
