 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although more light-frame wood buildings are erected in the United              States than any other type of construction, their design is                     oversimplified and does not reflect modern developments in structural           analysis and wood science.  The proposed research is aimed at developing        both a prototype of methodology for a probability-based design and the          data needed for application of the methodology to typical (baseline)            diaphragms, bending components, and connections among components.                                                                                               The research plan calls for using the probability density functions for         material and joint properties to simulate samples of systems of                 components and component connections.  The simulated systems will be            analyzed to obtain the parameters limiting performance, such as ultimate        load and critical deflections.  Thus, sets of probability density               functions will be generated that can be compared to external loading            spectra for assessing the probability of exceeding design limits.               Results will be incorporated into the design methodology developed as           another task of the proposed research.  The data will be useful in              calibrating the code for future wood building systems.  The methodology         will be presented in a form ready for evaluation by practicing engineers        and builders.                                                                                                                                                   The research to be conducted is a cooperative effort of research teams          at Oregon State University (OSU) and Washington State University (WSU).         The principal investigators of the two teams have a history of                  successful cooperation in the past four years and are currently                 coordinating parallel investigations that were awarded as cooperative           projects by the National Science Foundation.",
