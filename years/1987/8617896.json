 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Furnarii is an assemblage of approximately 500 species              of passerine birds in South and Central America that live in many               habitats and have a variety of life styles.  The group shares a                 common ancestry and exemplifies the historical process of                       adaptive radiation, in which a single group evolves into a                      diversity of ecological niches.  This general process and its                   results will be studied through the comparative anatomy of the                  limb muscles of representative species.  These will be dissected                under the microscope and the anatomical variations will be                      described and recorded.  These variations will then be used in a                computer analysis to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the                group.  This phylogeny, in turn, will be used as the basis for a                new classification of the group, and of an explanation of its                   interrelationships.  In addition, the historical pattern thus                   developed will be analyzed in terms of the locomotor                            specializations of the various species so as to reconstruct the                 historical process of adaptive evolution.  Thus, the study will                 be significant at two levels of analysis.  The first is as a                    specific study of a particular group of organisms, and the second               is as a general study of the widespread phenomenon of adaptive                  radiation.",
