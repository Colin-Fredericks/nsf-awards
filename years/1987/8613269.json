 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three senior U.S. scientists, S. R. Riggs (East Carolina University),         R. E. Garrison (U.C. Santa Cruz), and J. A. McKenzie (University of             Florida), in addition to the principal investigator, will work with Dr.         R. J. Cook, Chief of the Division of Continental Geology of the Bureau          of Mineral Resources in Canberra, and colleagues in a project aimed at          increasing our understanding of the nature and origin of sedimentary            phosphate deposits in various on- and off-shore areas of Australia.             This knowledge may shed light on the use of phosphorites to explain how         major chemical and biological changes occur through geologic time.              Phosphate deposits in Australia will be studied both in the field and           in the laboratory through sedimentological and geochemical research             methods jointly by the U.S. and Australian scientists.  Such questions          as:  how phosphates are precipitated to form phosphorites; whether the          biota of phosporites is unique; under what depositional conditions              phosphorites are formed; what chemical/biochemical processes are                involved in the weathering of phosphorites; and, whether the processes          involved in the formation of phosphorite have varied over time, will be         addressed.  The Australian and U.S. groups have complementary expertise         for this study, and both sides will benefit from a synergetic                   approach.  The project fulfills the Program's objective of supporting           research of scientific benefit both to Australia and the United States,         and of providing access for U.S. scientists to the research                     environments and expertise of their Australian colleagues.                                                                                                        The research propsed here extends studies being conducted by the              investigators under other NSF grants (e.g., OCE 85-20724), to include                                                 _ _                                       data on Australian phosphates, and the use of various cross-                    disciplinary techniques available in Australia.  This award provides            travel and subsistence for one trip to Australia for each of the four           senior researchers involved in the work.                                                                                                                          Results of the proposed research should lead to increased                     understanding of the processes involved in the evolution of the earth.          In addition, both Australian and U.S. investigators will benefit from           bringing the varied experimental techniques of sedimentology,                   paleobiology, oceanography, microbial ecology, and remote sensing to            problems of this type.  The project will take place under the aegis of          the Agreement betweeen Australia and the United States for Scientific           and Technical Cooperation.",
