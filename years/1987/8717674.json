 "awd_abstract_narration": "Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers on a                 path to \"self-sufficiency\" are funded by NSF generally for a five               year period.  During this period an evaluation protocol provides                data on industry/university interaction and other factors that                  effect the Center's status.  Until recently, no data was planned                to be  collected after \"self-sufficiency\" was attained.                                   This project is conducting an assessment of                           \"self-sustaining\" centers via a questionnaire.  The objectives of               the study are to:  1) assess the current status of Centers which                no longer receive NSF funding; 2) describe the process of                       becoming self-sustaining and how Centers respond to this                        challenge; 3) identify functional and dysfunctional practices and               strategies for coping with this  transition; 4) develop                         recommendations for improving the rate and ease with which                      operating Centers become self-sustaining.                                            The National Science Foundation and the Co-Principal                       Investigators have agreed to increase the research scope and add a              task to study the impact of Industry/University Cooperative                     Research Centers on the experiences, attitudes and career paths of              graduate students.  Graduate students involved in a center will be              compared with those not involved.  Studies of both groups will be               made while in graduate school and after graduating.                                  The Co-Principal Investigators are noted experts and well                  qualified to perform the studies.                                                    The Program Manager recommends that the North Carolina State               University (in collaboration with the University of Florida) be                 awarded $38,173 for one (1) year for this study which includes                  $5,000 for the added task entitled \"The Impact on Graduate                      Students of Participating in Industry Funded Research.\"",
