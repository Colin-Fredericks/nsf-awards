 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design of certain classes of products can be                           considered as a multi-stage decision making process.  These                     products tend to be those for which the components are                          well-defined and where the design can be characterized as one                   of component specification and selection; that is, modular                      designs.  For this class of designs, dynamic programming can                    provide the basis for a framework through which design problems                 can be structured, quantitatively described, analyzed and                       resolved.                                                                            This research is directed toward the development,                          formalization, and implementation of a dynamic programming                      approach to engineering design problems.  A major goal is the                   creation of a specific framework through which design problems                  can be structured, decomposed, and resolved.  This will entail                  the development of logic structures, methods of decomposition,                  quantitative characteristics, and solution procedures.",
