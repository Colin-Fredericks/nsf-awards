 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research in this proposal concerns the removing (or                    resolution of) singularities of an algebraic variety by                         birational transformations.  This problem was solved 23 years ago               by Hironaka in the case of characteristic zero.  The case of                    characteristic p > 0 has resisted all attempts since then.  This                problem is the focus of this research.                                               In algebraic geometry many of the geometric objects one                    studies (varieties) have singularities, i.e. corners or cusps.                  It is a very important problem to remove these in certain                       prescribed ways.  The principal investigator has the first really               new idea on this problem in many years.  If he solves this                      problem or even makes significant headway on it, it would be a                  significant advance.  One can only wait and see on a problem of                 this depth.",
