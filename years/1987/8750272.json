 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent developments in technology now enable biologists to study                organisms at the cellular and subcellular levels.  This new field of            Molecular Biology promises to answer many previously unanswered                 questions about, e.g., regulation physiology and the development of             organisms.  Use of radioactive isotopes for the labeling and tracing of         molecules has proved invaluable in Molecular Biology -- a technique             which requires the new liquid scintillation counter provided through            this award.                                                                                                                                                     Actual experience with radioactive labeling and scintillation counting          is helping the students better understand new concepts and developments         in Biology.  By incorporating labeling experiments into the study of            plants, animals and bacteria, the universality of cells is being                stressed, thus demonstrating how modern techniques may be applicable to         diverse sets of organisms and disciplines.  Through this experience the         students are receiving practical training in the use of modern                  biological instrumentation, and are improving their skills in                   understanding and solving biological problems.",
