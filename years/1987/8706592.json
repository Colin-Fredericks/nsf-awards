 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the shape representations offered by contemporary Computer        Aided Design Systems are adequate to do routine calculations, they are          deficient in having reliable sectioning and offsetting capabilities.            The P.I. is seeking a way to mathematically represent the surface so            that the computer realization can serve not only visualization but              important manufacturing issues such as the computation of the offset            surface.                                                                             The principal investigator proposes to use an algebraic                    representation of the surface.  However, the two problems with such an          implicit representation are that it does not allow for representing             finite segments and the coefficients do not have geometric meaning.  The        P.I. proposes a novel approach to overcoming these problems.  The first         is his use of a windowing method for bounding the algebraic surface.            The second is his approach to determining the characteristic points of          the solution through a guided subdivision algorithm.  The research will         test the feasibility and robustness of this novel approach.                          The principal investigator is a new investigator who shows                 excellent promise.  Funding is recommended under the program for                Expedited Awards for Novel Research.",
