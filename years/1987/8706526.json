 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of natural selection suggests that individuals should                possess the ability to evaluate the suitability of mates and make               beneficial choices.  A beneficial choice leads to maximum production            of breeding offspring whereas a poor choice leads to little or no               reproductive success.  In many species, it is the female sex that               makes the choice of a mate; males typically compete among themselves            for control of resources important to reproduction and attempt to               attract females to their domain.  Despite its general importance, the           biological bases of mate choice are poorly understood for most animals.                                                                                         In the current research, behavioral and physical characteristics of             males and how these traits function in the process of mate choice by            females will be studied.  Two species of birds have been selected               because they are easy to observe in nature, their communication                 behavior is relatively simple, males learn their vocal \"language\"               much like humans learn speech, and birds can be taken into the                  laboratory for more controlled experiments to reveal the properties             of the communication system.  All these reasons make birds one of               the most widely used research animals for uncovering the biological             principles of social behavior of animals, particularly in the area of           communication.  Questions that will be addressed include:  1) How do            males and females communicate, both visually and vocally, in the                context of mate choice and reproduction, 2) do females discriminate             among potential mates by their vocal characteristics, their physical            characteristics, or both, and 3) what properties of the male are                communicated by his vocalizations or by his physical traits and                 behavior.  By field studies in natural populations, and by laboratory           experiments with captive males and females, the current research                allows a powerful approach to answering these questions.",
