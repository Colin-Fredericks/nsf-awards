 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enhance lower-division students' understanding of the         basic concepts of calculus and increase the likelihood that these               concepts will be properly applied in new situations.  The project will          incorporate the use of a Computer Algebra System (CAS) to carry out             complex computational and symbolic operations, thereby freeing time for         students to better understand and apply the rich collection of ideas            embodied in calculus.  Many applied mathematicians and engineers have           used CAS in their work, but the computer power required to sustain CAS          has, until recently, prohibited its use in most academic environments.          Denison University will purchase two Micro VAX II computers with 20             attached terminals on which to run Maple, a CAS software package.  This         configuration is well within the capability of the faculty and one that         meets the needs of the students.  This project is especially important          now, when many mathematicians are calling for attempts to make calculus         more \"lean and lively\" and to interest more students in mathematics.",
