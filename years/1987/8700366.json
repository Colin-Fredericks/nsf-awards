 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several forms of intracellular transport, or movement, which               are essential for normal cell growth and function depend on                     linear intracellular elements called microtubules.  One example                 is chromosome movement during cell division; another is the                     transporrt of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles from one end                 of a nerve cell to the  other.  Two molecules have been described               which serve as \"molecular motors;\" i.e., which are able to                      convert the chemical energy of ATP into  mechanical force                       associated with the microtubules.  One is called kinesin, and the               other is called dynein.  The objective of this proposal                         is to test the idea that an unusual form of dynein found in sea                 urchin eggs is the motor for microtubule-associated motility in                 this system.  The specific goals of the project are: first, to                  obtain specific antibodies against the sea urchin egg dynein and                use these to localize and quantitate dynein during embryonic                    development; then, to obtain a DNA clone for the sea urchin                     dynein using recombinant DNA techniques, and to use this clone as               a probe to determine whether there are multiple, and possibly                   even tissue and stage-specific dynein genes.  The anticipated                   results will add new and important information regarding the                    molecular basis of microtubule-based motility.",
