 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lunar and semilunar cycles of spawning activities have been                   described in many species of fish.  It is not known whether                     these cycles are essentially endogenous in that they might                      occur in the absence of obvious lunar cues or whether they                      are directly dependent on lunar-related stimuli such as tidal                   changes.  Our initial studies in gulf killifish, Fundulus                       grandis, indicate that the spawning cycle persists in fish                      held under controlled laboratory conditions for many months                     without any obvious lunar cues (i.e., moonlight or tidal                        changes).  However, it is probable that the fish receive less                   obvious (subtle) exogenous information that adjusts the                         phase of the cycle.  Meier's investigations will determine                      whether these persistent cycles are synchronized by an                          external cue so that peak spawning activity maintains a                         specific relation to the tidal cycle in the Gulf of Mexico                      where these fish reside. If the cycles are essentially                          endogenous but synchronized by subtle external stimuli, he will                 determine whether the external stimuli provide daily (tidal) or                 lunar information.                                                                                                                                                Peak of spawning activity occurs at different times of the                    tidal cycle as a function of site where the fish were                           obtained.  Accordingly, experiments will be carried out to                      determine whether site specificity is genetically determined                    or imprinted on the fish during development. The tidal cycle in                 the Gulf of Mexico where gulf killifish are found has a period                  near 13.6 days and thus differs from the lunar cycle of moonlight               and from tidal cycles in many other areas (about 29.5 days).                    Furthermore, the semilunar cycles occur in natural as well as                   controlled laboratory conditions.  Experiments will be performed                to determine whether such cycles are maintained in other areas,                 such as in Canada and along the Atlantic coast where related                    teleost fish exhibit similar cycles.",
