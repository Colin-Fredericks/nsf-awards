The symposium            and workshop will bring together an interdisciplinary group, to assess          recent developments in research and education about ethical and value           aspects of scientific and engineering practice and its use.  The group          will produce an agenda of research priorities and mechanisms for                implementing research in science, engineering, and ethics.  It will             also identify priorities and strategies for improving national literacy         abour freedom and responsibility in science and engineering.  The               workshop will generate recommendations on these matters for                     consideration by researchers, educators, public and private                     organizations and interested individuals.",
