 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Dr. Roosevelt and her colleagues to continue                 their archaeological investigations on Marajo Island located at                 the mouth of the Amazon River in Brazil.  Previous work by Dr.                  Roosevelt and other investigators has revealed a long prehistoric               sequence.  Dr. Roosevelt will focus on the impressive Marajoara                 Phase mound which dates between 500 and 1300 AD.                                                                                                                The team will investigate structures and chronology at the site                 and sample nearby cemeteries in preparation for excavation.  On                 the basis of these the team hopes not only to obtain more                       precise dates for the site, but also to provide detailed                        reconstructions of subsistence practices, social organization                   and demography.  It is unclear how this large prehistoric                       Amazonian group subsisted, whether it had a chieftan system of                  organization and whether this level of complexity present at                    Marajo Island developed locally or results from migration of                    peoples from elsewhere.  This project should help to answer                     these questions.                                                                                                                                                Although humans have inhabited tropical South America for a long                time, prehistoric adaptations to this tropical environment are                  not well understood because tropical vegetation makes sites hard                to locate and humid conditions do not favor preservation of                     organic remains.  The sites at Marajo Island are rich and should                yield valuable scientific data.",
