 "awd_abstract_narration": "The following topics will be investigated:  (1) Some                          Singular Stochastic Control Problems:  Two problems:  One is                    concerned with the analysis of a class of singular control                      problems in several dimensions, and the second pertains to a                    adapted version of singular stochastic control in one dimension.                (2)  Impulse Control Problems:  Two novel applications of impulse               control theory to optimal maintenance and sequential scheduling                 problems will be studied.  (3) Ergodic Control Problems with a                  class of stochastic control of diffusion with jumps with a long-                term average criterion.  The emphasis is on the study of the                    associated invariant measure.  (4)  Numerical Analysis of                       Stochastic Control Problems:  Numerical algorithm for solving a                 class of singular control problems in several dimensions.                       Numerical approximation of some Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman                         equations.  (5)  Some Problems in Stochastic Distributed-                       Parameter Sytems:  The investigators plan to study the solution                 of an infinite-dimensional H.J.B.  equation arising from optimal                control of a non-linear stochastic distributed system.  The                     stability and asymptotic behavior of such a system with possible                degeneracy will be investigated.                                                  This research is part of control theory with potential                        applications in engineering and computer science.",
