 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research considers the problem of determining parametric           bounds for the performance criterion of perturbed nonlinear programming         problems.  Initially special problem structure, such as separability            will be exploited, the aim however is to apply the results to so-called         \"factorable functions\" which occur in a wide variety of problems.  Thus         the eventual outcome of the research could have wide applicability.  The        central idea is to use branch-and-bound techniques to generate regions          in which sequences of approximating convex programming problems can be          used to get bounds, then piece together the information from different          regions to create global bounds.  The goal of the research is to produce        an algorithm for general nonconvex parametric problems.  The methods            will be implemented on practical applications and user friendly code            will be produced.                                                                       This research considers the problems of producing parametric            bounds for the performance criterion of perturbed nonlinear programming         problem. It is expected that the research will lead to techniques and           computer implementations of direct use in computing the solution to             difficult nonlinear optimization problems.",
