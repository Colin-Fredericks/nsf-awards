 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wisconsin Public Television Network (WPTN) will develop the                     Science/Technology/ Society (S/T/S) project which will emphasize the            presentation of scientific concepts in a context of real-world                  problems that are social/technical in nature, in order to teach the             mutual dependence of science and society.  The pilot phase of the               project was partially funded by NSF.  This proposal will work towards           the completion of the Secondary Grades Science S/T/S Project whose              design is to enable teachers to incorporate essential instruction about         the interrelatedness between science/technology/society in secondary            grades curricula.  The project includes production and evaluation of            classroom video and computer materials for students and of video                programs for in-service teacher training accompanied by printed                 materials.  The video programs will use the facilities of WHA-TV in             Madison, Wisconsin.                                                                                                                                             The project will draw on the skills of specialists in the design and            creation of instructional media, subject-matter experts, and other              educators.  The project director, Nancy Bauer, will coordinate the              efforts of these individuals, the agencies, and organizations they              represent.  Ms. Bauer is well qualified to serve in this capacity.                                                                                              WPTN's project strongly addresses the goals and scope of the                    Instructional Materials Development Program in establishing basic               science literacy for the general student through an alternative method          delivering instructions.",
