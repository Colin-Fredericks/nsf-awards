 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will take advantage of the availability of a 1:50 scale               physical model of the Long Dam that includes part of the upstream               reservoir and the downstream river, built under the sponsorship of the          Washington Water power Co., and presently been used to determine the            maximum water levels at the powerhouse in case the dam fails.  The              testing program will be modified slightly by measuring simultaneously           the water levels at sixteen locations (instead of one or two) using             precision capacitance probes.  The tests will be repeated at least once.        The propagation o\u001a the wave front will be recorded using a high-speed           camera, and maximum water levels on both banks will be recorded using a         high-speed camera, and maximum water levels on both banks will be               measured.  The complete data set recorded in magnetic tape will be made         available to interested engineers and scientists.                                                                                                               The purpose of this project is to produce quality currently not                 available, laboratory data to be used in the development of new two-            dimensional mathematical models, and in the validation of existing              models that simulate the generation and propagation of dam-break waves.                                                                                         The work will be conducted at the Albrook Hydraulic Lab., Washington            State University, one of the largest in the country.  The P.I. is highly        qualified to carry out this project.  Consequently an award is                  recommended.",
