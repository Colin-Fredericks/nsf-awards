 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Summary:  This is an Engineering Research Equipment                    Grant.  A gel permeation chromatograph (gpc) capable of operation               from ambient to 150oC is provided by NSF.  This instrument is                   capable of measuring the molecular weight distribution of                       important crystalline polymers that are insoluble at room                       temperature, such as polyethylene and polypropylene.  It provides               the most efficient means that is currently available for                        characterizing molecular weights of polymers.  The instrument is                to be used in several projects under way in this department,                    including one aiming at the fractionation of crystalline polymers               in supercritical solvents.                                                                                                                                      Innovation:  The fractionation of crystalline polymers in                       supercritical solvents, to be analyzed by means of the high                     temperature gpc, represents a novel concept.  The other                         analytical tasks outlined in the proposal that require use of the               gpc also represent novel research.                                                                                                                              Practical Significance:  The practical significance of the                      research which requires use of the instrument includes the design               of more efficient fractionation processes for crystalline                       polymers, the development and study of polymer blends with new                  physical properties, and the assessment of a new process for coal               liquefaction.  More specifically, polymer fractionation of the                  type described might be applicable to high pressure polyethylene                processes and the purification of isotactic polypropylene.  In                  addition, novel and useful polymer morphologies might be                        generated by precipitation from supercritical solution.  The high               temperature gpc will be necessary for the analysis of the                       products generated in most of the studies referred to.                                                                                                          Recommendation:  An award of $35,445 in FY 1987 is recommended,                 with SUNY-Buffalo providing $19,085 in matching funds.",
