 "awd_abstract_narration": "ln old reinforced concrete buildings and bridges corrosion of the steel         reinforcing bars has become a serious problem and in some cases has             caused a complete collapse of parking structures.                                                                                                               In order to eliminate or at least minimize the corrosion of steel               reinforcement in concrete structures, current practice uses epoxy-              coatings on the bars.  However, the bond adherence of the coated bar            with the concrete has not been evaluated with respect to the various            strength levels of the concrete and the various sizes of steel bars.                                                                                            This project will examine the bond characteristics of epoxy-coated              reinforcing bars in order to establish design values which will ensure          the safety of the reinforced concrete structures.  The two major                parameters to be investigated are the different sizes of the                    reinforcement which may be embedded in concrete of various strength             levels.  The experimental data will be used to establish code                   regulations and will serve as a basis for a mathematical model.  The            results of this research will be beneficial to local, state and Federal         bodies involved with construction of reinforced concrete structures of          all types.                                                                                                                                                      The project is highly recommended by practitioners and academicians as a        needed activity to ensure the safety of reinforced concrete structures.                                                                                         The researcher is highly qualified from past experience in research             activities of concrete, and the experimental facilities are available at        the university.                                                                                                                                                 This is the first year award of a two year project.  The amount for the         first year is $109,657 and $113,787 for the second year.",
