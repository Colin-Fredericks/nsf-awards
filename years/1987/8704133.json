 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            established to provide support to strengthen the research environments          and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions or                      institutions that have substantial minority student enrollments.                Eligible institutions must also have graduate programs in science or            programs in engineering.  Funding is provided for faculty research in           fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and for           the acquisition of research instrumentation.  Tennessee State                   University will use RIMI support to establish an institutional                  facility for ultrastructural cell chemistry research.  This project             will focus on acquiring technical assistance and release time to allow          the performance of meritorious research.  In addition, greater                  utilization of an existing electron microscopy facility will be                 possible.                                                                                                                                                       The research capability of Tennessee State will be strengthened                 specifically in the areas of cell biology and biochemistry.  The                principal investigators for this work are currently conducting                  research in anatomical features of cells and tissues and have                   published in scientific journals.  The Foundation has supported this            project because the participation of minorities in research will be             increased at an urban institution that is located in an ideal location          for attracting minority constituents.",
