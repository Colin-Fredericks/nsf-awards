The laboratories in which         these new facilities are being used are designed to give the students           hands-on experience in manipulating environmental variables.  This              provides them with a better understanding of the effects of the various         environmental factors on the physiology and behavior of organisms, as           well as helping them to improve their investigative skills.                                                                                                     Courses to which these chambers are contributing fresh opportunities for        student originality and creativity include Animal Physiology, Plant             Physiology, General Ecology and Vertebrate Zoology, as well as                  Independent Research.  Since the school is located in the Appalachian           Mountains, numerous local montaine species of fish, amphibians, reptiles        and small mammals will be employed in these studies.",
