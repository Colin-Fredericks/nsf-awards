 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is aimed at mapping the Ra-228 distributions              in the South Atlantic basin to upgrade circulation models and                   predict changes in ventilation.  Approximately 1500 samples will                be collected for Ra-228/Ra-226 ratios and Ra-226 values to obtain               an accurate measure of Ra-228 from the product of these analyses.               High sampling density requirements are required to resolve the                  low concentration gradients found in mid-basin areas.  Only a                   portion of the sample set analyses will be supported until the                  need for greater detail is justified.                                                   Two campaigns to measure transient tracers in the Atlantic              Ocean (TTO/NAS and TTO/Equatorial) were funded by NSF during the                period from 1980 to 1985.  A complete data base for modelling                   this ocean basin would include a South Atlantic Study to:                               1.Determine CO2 transports and their influence on world                 climate,                                                                        2.Constrain models of major ocean currents in this area,                        and                                                                             3.Confirm an observed 5-fold increase in the addition                           rate of new carbon to the thermocline.                                                  Eight components of such a study (SAVE) will be performed by            investigators from LDGO, Princeton, University of Washington,                   WHOI, and SIO.  The track record of these scientists is well                    established by successful completion of previous studies in the                 Equatorial and North Atlantic.  They will provide physical and                  chemical expertise which will be directed toward a cooperative                  effort to reach the goals of the geochemical study.",
