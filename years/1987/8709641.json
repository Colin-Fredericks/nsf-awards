 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research Nygaard will study Galois representations                 of Siegel modular forms of degree 2 and weights 3, at first in                  the special case of level 4 but hopefully later on in more                      generality.  The motives occur in the cohomology of Siegel                      modular varieties but are exposed in the cohomology of some much                simpler 3-folds.  These 3-folds are constructed using the theta                 formulas of Riemann and are simple complete intersections of                    quadrics.  As a consequence of the existence of these motives we                find Andrianov L-functions as factors in the Hasse-Weil Zeta                    function of the Siegel modular 3-fold.                                               Modular forms are analytic functions which encode number                   theoretic information allowing the researcher to use the deep                   tools of analysis to solve number theoretic functions.  In this                 research modular forms attached to objects in algebraic geometry                further enrich this technique.  The P.I. poses some very exciting               problems and will surely be successful in his endeavors.",
