 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's identified high frequency variability in faunal                assemblage, stable isotopes and lithology of the Holocene section               of North Atlantic deep ocean sediment cores with very high rates                of accumulation (>20 cm/1000 yrs).  Combined, these results                     suggest significant variability in deep ocean circulation and sea               surface temperature on non-orbital timescales over the last                     11,000 radiocarbon yrs BP.  Particularly significant deep                       circulation events are a decrease in NADW (relative to AABW) flow               during the Younger Dryas cooling (11 kyr BP) and maximum flow of                NADW between 9 and 6 kyr BP.  Maxima in surface water temperature               are evident in recent times, 4 kyr ago, and between 6 and 9 kyr                 ago.                                                                                    The PI's intend to continue their study of marine evidence              for high frequency variability in Holocene climate, to extend our               record to 30 kyr BP, and to integrate our results with those of                 others studying the continental record.  Proxy evidence for 103                 yr variability in climate has been clearly identified in                        terrestrial records at least as far back in time as 30 kyr BP.                  Limited marine evidence suggests similar variability.  By                       extending our study of the deep sea from the Holocene through the               last glacial maximum, we will be able to define and contrast the                characteristics of high frequency change for two completely                     different climatic regimes (glacial and interglacial).                                  This effort is important to the goal of providing records               and understanding of climate change over short time spans,                      periods short enough to occur at human/cultural timescales.                     Understanding of abrupt climate changes is an important objective               of CDP.",
