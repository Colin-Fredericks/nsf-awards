 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will undertake the design of a program to improve students'        abilities to think critically, use language, and solve problems using           the natural world as an experimental base.  Since urban systems face            extremely complex problems, the science program is specifically aimed at        these systems.  Cleveland and San Francisco will collaborate fully in           the development effort.  Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and             Boston will provide input and feedback, to insure that the program meets        the needs of a number of urban systems operating under a variety of             state and local mandates.                                                                                                                                       The project will involve teacher development teams in the design of 24-         36 activity-based modules for grades K-6.  In choosing the natural              phenomena to be explored, the project will try to balance life,                 physical, and earth sciences, tying the experiential base to the urban          setting where appropriate.  The new modules will be informed by teacher         review of existing materials; and will integrate science with the rest          of the elementary curriculum, particularly language arts and                    mathematics.                                                                                                                                                    Boston College Center for the Study of Testing, Evaluation and                  Educational Policy will serve as the outside evaluator.  Delta                  Education, Inc. will publish the materials as well as assist in the             design and dissemination.  Delta will invest approximately $2 M in the          project during the 4-year development stage, and continue to provide            marketing assistance and teacher development aid following development.",
