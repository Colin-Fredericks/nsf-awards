Two principal techniques will be                     employed:  energy and angle resolved spectroscopy of positrons                  re-emitted from surfaces; and surface electron capture by (spin-                                                                                                polarized) positrons to form positronium.  The electronic                       properties (positron work function, electronic exitations, and                  mean free paths) and magnetic properties (surface critical                      exponents and anisotropies) will be studied as a function of film                                                                                               thickness and substrate composition as the film evolves from 2-                 dimensional to 3-dimensional character.  Both techniques are also                                                                                               sensitive to trapping of positrons at surface and near surface                  defects and thus structural properties (surface roughness, island                                                                                               formation, nucleation densities, interface interdiffusion) of                   supported thin films can be studied as well.  Ultimately, the                   goal is to incorporate the above techniques into a scanning                     positron microprobe to allow imaged spatial resolution of thin                  film and surface phenomena below 1 micron.                                                                                                                      Thin films and surfaces exhibit properties that can be distinctly                                                                                               different from a material's bulk properties.  Such differences                  can produce great technological opportunities in such diverse                   areas as chemical catalysis, magnetic films, and tribological                   coatings.",
