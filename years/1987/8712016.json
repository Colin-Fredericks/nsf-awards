 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs propose a comprehensive research program to study the                   chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reaction between tungsten                       hexafluoride (WF6) and silicon/silicon dioxide surfaces.                        Understanding of this reaction could help semiconductor                         processing companies in the manufacture of very large scale                     integration (VLSI), ultra large scale integration (ULSI), and                   wafer scale integration (WSI) chips.                                                                                                                            Tungsten has potential usage because of (1) its resilience to                   electromagnetism, (2) low resistivity, (3) high melting point, and (4)          a thermal coefficient of expansion that is close to silicon. The                selective nature of tungsten along with its electrical and physical             properties makes it suitable for many VLSI large circuit applications           because selectively-deposited tungsten films provide highly reliable,           low resistance, and low cost contact barriers for shallow junctions.            As the scale of devices decreases, tungsten's potential use will                increase as an interconnect for multilevel metallization.  This will            be essential for advances in ULSI and WSI technology.                                                                                                           CVD of tungsten has the advantages of low temperature                           processing, selectivity, radiation-damage-free deposition and                   conformal coverage.  To obtain a better understanding of the                    gas-solid reaction between silicon and WF6, the PIs plan to                     use a Auger electron spectroscopy  (AES), temperature-                          programmed reaction (TPR), and high resolution electron energy                  loss spectroscopy (HREELS) in ultrahigh vacuum.  AES permits                    analysis of a surface to determine its elemental composition.                   TPR gives the rate that each gaseous product forms during                       reaction.  HREELS determines chemical bonds present in                          adsorbed species.  This combination of measurements of gaseous                  products, adsorbed species, and elemental surface composition                   should provide a complete picture of the reaction process.",
