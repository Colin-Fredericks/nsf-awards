 "awd_abstract_narration": "The families Bach, Mozart and Strauss are known for music.                      Similarly, there are families known for their science.  Among the               more famous are the Huxley, Curie, and Bohr families.  Another, not             so well-known scientific family is that of the Krogh's of Denmark.              August Krogh won the Nobel prize in physiology for his study of                 capillaries, but this work was only a small part of his many                    contributions to the field including pioneering studies of                      respiration in animals and man, in comparative physiology of                    osmoregulation, and in membrane transport.  His wife, Marie Jorgensen           Krogh, not only collaborated with her husband on many of his                    projects, but carried out independent research of her own including             her classic study of the diffusion capacity of human lungs, other               work in human physiology and nutrition.  Their daughter, Bodil                  Schmidt-Nielsen, also became a successful scientist carrying out                important research on kidney physiology and rising to become the                president of the American Physiological Society.  Though the Krogh              family is not so well-known now, this situation seems likely to                 change.  The daughter, Professor Schmidt-Nielsen, is undertaking with           the support of this grant a scientific biography of her parents.                Professor Schmidt-Nielsen brings unique qualifications to this study.                                                                                           As a physiologist herself, she thoroughly understands her parents               work and can communicate with their students and friends.  She knows            Danish, and, because of her position, has special access to sources.            Further, she has a sophisticated understanding of historical                    methodology which is rare among eminent scientists.  She will examine           vast amounts of archival material in the Royal Library in Copenhagen            including personal family letters.  She has already contacted and               obtained materials from her parents collaborators and students.  Her            study promises to provide us with a classic study of the scientific             enterprise from a very personal and intimately informed position.               While such studies can be problematic at times,  Professor                      Schmidt-Nielsen fully understands these problems and has demonstrated           her ability to overcome them and write with real understanding about            the scientific work of her parents.  This study promises to be of               great interest for historians, philosophers and biologists interested           in the development of 20th century research.",
