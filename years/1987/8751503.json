The first season of 75 half-hour shows premiered on public television           stations in January 1987.  The second and third seasons will each               consist of 65 programs to capitalize on the success of Season I and             compound its educational utility.                                                                                                                               SQUARE ONE TV has three goals:  to promote positive attitudes toward,           and enthusiasm for, mathematics; to encourage the use and application of        problem solving processes; and to present sound mathematical content in         an interesting, accessible and meaningful manner.  Based on preliminary         research results, the series appears to be meeting these goals.  The            series has attracted a substantial audience from throughout the country         during its initial season, and a very positive reception from                   mathematicians, parents, teachers, and the press.  Most importantly, the        target-aged children are enjoying and learning from the series.                                                                                                 The goals and content for additional seasons will basically remain the          same, with refinements made as research results are assembled and               digested by in house staff in conjunction with mathematics advisors.            Production plans will take advantage of the learning experiences                acquired from Season I.                                                                                                                                         The additional seasons of SQUARE ONE TV will be supported by a full             range of promotion, community outreach activities and school services,          including teacher's guides.  Season II should be ready to air in                September 1988.                                                                                                                                                 The highly skilled production team responsible for season I remains in          place:  Dave Connell, Vice President and Executive Producer, CTW; Dr.           Keith Mielke, Vice President for Research, CTW; Dr. Joel Schneider,             Content Director, SQUARE ONE TV; and Bettina Peel, Director of Research,        SQUARE ONE TV.  An 18 member National Advisory Board is chaired by Dr.          Gerald Lesser, Bigelow Professor of Education and Developmental                 Psychology at Harvard, and more than 15 additional distinguished                mathematicians, scientists, and educators serve as project consultants.                                                                                         With the addition of SQUARE ONE TV to the existing 3-2-1 Contact science        series, america's children now have a full hour a day of math and               science learning opportunity at home.  Continued development of SQUARE          ONE TV mathematics programs is essential to sustain our national                commitment for improved mathematics and scientific literacy for our             young.  An award of an additional $3,000,000 for FY87 and $3,000,000 for        FY88 is recommended.",
