 "awd_abstract_narration": "Secondary metabolites (products) from plant roots are under-                    utilized and under-explored sources of pharmaceuticals and                      agrichemicals.  Roots of the Asteraceae (Sunflower family)                      accumulate a wide range of valuable natural products including                  fungicidal, anti-bacterial, antiviral and nematicidal  polyacetylenes.          The mechanisms of synthesis and accumulation for  most of these                 compounds are poorly understood.                                                                                                                                The PIs have recently developed fast-growing root cultures from                 various Solanceae and Asteraceae species which have been                        transformed into \"hairy roots\" following infection with the                     bacterium Agrobacterium rhizogenes.  These \"hairy root\" cultures  grow          at rates faster than normal roots and comparable to those of                    undifferentiated cell suspensions; at the same time, they continue              producing the secondary metabolites characteristic of roots.  The  PIs          suggest that this experimental system is well suited for development            into a large-scale production process.  Large bioreactors will be built         for the growth of root clones in batch, semi-continuous or continuous           culture.                                                                                                                                                        This grant application is an excellent example of the type of                   crossdisciplinary proposal we wish to see in the Engineering                    Directorate's Biotechnology Program.  It was rated excellent by                 the crossdisciplinary Panel reviewing this proposal and the                     Principal Investigators are considered well qualified to carry                  out the proposed research.  I recommend funding of this proposal                for three years in accordance with the revised budget.",
