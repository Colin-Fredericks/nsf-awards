 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for an equipment grant to renovate and improve        the capabilities of the earthquake simulator (shaking table) facilities         at the Richmond Station University of California, Berkeley.  The                simulator was constructed in 1972, it is one of the largest such                facilities in the United States and has been in use virtually                   continuously since its construction for research performed by faculty           members at Berkeley and other Universities throughout the U.S. and by           engineers from consulting companies, industrial corporations and                government agencies.  It continues to be used on a full-time basis, but         it suffers repeated break-downs and is clearly in serious need of               renovation.  In recognition of this need the State of California has            recently allocated $230,000 for renovation of this and related                  facilities, and this proposal requests complementary funding from the           National Science Foundation to restore the shaking table facility to a          current state-of-the-art capability.  Specifically funds are requested          to provide a new and improved control system for the shaking table, new         data acquisition facilities, a micro-wave link between the data                 acquisition facilities at the simulator facility and the computer               network on the Berkeley campus and a feasibility study to explore the           possibility of adding an additional component of motion to the table so         that tests can he performed under three-dimensional earthquake shaking          conditions.                                                                                                                                                     The earthquake simulator at Berkeley is a major research resource in the        U.S. and is depended on to conduct shaking tests of structural                  assemblages and complete systems required to advance the knowledge of           earthquake behavior of structures.  It is extremely important to                maintain this facility at a state-of-the-art level of operation.  An            award is strongly recommended.",
