 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will allow the PI to do five months of ethnographic                  fieldwork in Western Nigeria.  She will interview small-holder                  farmers to analyze the effects of technical changes in farming                  and social changes in the organization of work in this African                  rural economy, which has been exposed to rapid and dramatic                     increases in the demand for goods.  Due to the oil boom and                     subsequent collapse, this part of Nigeria has experienced                       increased rates of urbanization and food price inflation during                 the past 15 years.  Economic change in the hinterland of cities                 has caused changes in family farms.  This project will document                 farm organization in small-holder and larger scale farms with                   special attention to the use of labor, the gender division of                   labor, and the relations between small farms and large farms.                   The current situation will be compared with the situation 20                    years ago, when the PI did a baseline study of small-holder                     farms.                                                                                                                                                          This research is important because African small-holder farmers                 are seen by most development theorists as the major current                     economic problem facing the continent.  Increased understanding                 of how small farms function, and specifically how they relate to                the newer, larger farms, and how they have withstood the boom                   and bust cycles that the region experienced in the previous 20                  years, will be valuable to theorists and policy makers alike.",
