 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Dr. Hylander and his colleagues to study the                 effect of canine size on how animals chew. A detailed analysis of               jaw movements and loading patterns will be conducted on 4 adult                 male and 4 adult female baboons to answer three related                         questions. During mastication, what is: (1) the influence of                    canine size (males vs. females) on jaw movements, (2) the                       influence of the mechanical properties of food on jaw movements,                and (3) the relationship between loading and jaw movements. The                 investigators wish to focus particularly on the interaction of                  the three questions. To accomplish this they will analyze                       vertical, lateral and front.to.back jaw movements with a magnet                 sensing jaw.tracking system originally designed for humans.                     Loading patterns of the mandible will be analyzed by both strain                gage and electromyograplhic techniques.                                                                                                                         One tgait which distinguishes human from other primates is the                  reduced size of our canine teeth and the functional significance                of this, which is evident in the earliest humans, continues to be               a crucial and much debated topic in paleoanthropology. This                     research is designed to test the hypothesis that canine reduction               eliminates mechanical constraints on mandibular movements during                mastication. The elimination of these constraints supposedly                    allows an increase in the sideway movement of the mandible during               biting and thus increases the overall efficiency of mastication.                This project will help to answer this question.                                                                                                                 The research is important because it will help to explicate the                 factors which underlie human development and led to the                         appearance of our own species.",
