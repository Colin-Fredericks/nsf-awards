 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carbon-carbon composites tend to be weak, since they contain cracks and         pores, and oxidize rapidly at elevated temperatures.  This research             project uses a variation of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to produce          an oxidation resistant layer.  The method involves maintaining the              inital composite in a thermal gradient while time varying the                   constitution of the reacting gas in such a way as to periodically               gasify the pores near the surface while simultaneously depositing               carbon on the internal cavities.  A similar technique will be used to           produce graded surface coatings of mixed oxides and carbides from Si,           Hf, Zr, and Ta.                                                                 Carbon fiber reinforced carbon matrix composites are attractive                 materials for high strength, light weight structural applications.              Characteristics such as high heat of ablation, good thermal shrink              resistance and chemical inertness result in a material that offers high         performance in extreme thermal and chemical environments (e.g., disk            brakes, space structures, jet engine parts, medical protheses, chemical         plants, and heat exchangers).  Carbon-carbon composites tend to be weak         due to the presence of pores and cracks, and oxidize rapidly at                 elevated temperature.  This project will address some of the weakness           of this material by a novel processing technique.",
