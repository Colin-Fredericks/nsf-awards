 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed study is to investigate ion-implantation of         boron, carbon, and nitrogen into pure iron and several steels with              simple metallurgical structures.  The proposed research is a                    cooperative/interdisciplinary program between Professor Wilbur at the           Department of Mechanical Engineering, Colorado State University (CSU),          and Professor Williamson at the Department of Physics, Colorado School          of Mines (CSM), MSM-8704488.  Ion-implantation will be done with a              unique facility at CSU, where the tribological testing will also be             carried out.  The primary microstructural characterization of the               surface before and after wear testing will be done at CSM in a non-             destructive manner with Mossbauer spectroscopy.  The general goal is to         develop an improved understanding of the effect of ion implantation on          wear reduction.  The outcome of this collaborative research should have         a significant impact on tribology.",
