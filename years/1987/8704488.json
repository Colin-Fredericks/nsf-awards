 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed study is to investigate ion-implantation of         boron, carbon, and nitrogen into pure iron and several steels with              simple metallurgical structures.  The propsed research is a                     cooperative/interdisciplinary program between Professor Williamson at           the Department of Physics, Colorado School of Mines (CSM) and Professor         Wilbur at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Colorado State              University (CSU) MSM-8617811.  Ion-implantation will be done with a             unique facility at CSU, where the tribological testing will also be             carried out.  The primary microstructural characterization of the               surface before and after wear testing will be done at CSM in a non-             destructive manner with Mossbauer spectroscopy.  The general goal is to         develop an improved understanding of the effect of ion implantation on          wear reduction.  The outcome of the research should have a significant          impact on tribology.",
