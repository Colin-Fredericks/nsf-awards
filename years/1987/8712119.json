In their family lives, their                 political orientations, their friendships networks, and so on,                  Lenski documented consistently different patterns among                         Protestants, Catholics and Jews.                                                                                                                                Lenski reported most of his major findings in a subsequent book                 entitled, The Religious Factor. This book is widely considered to               be a landmark study of religion in America, and in the 30 years                 since Lenski's study there have been numerous detailed                          examinations of specific aspects of Lenski's findings. However,                 none of the more recent analyses have approximated a complete                   replication.                                                                                                                                                    Alwin will survey a representative sample of Metropolitan                       Detroit, the same population from which Lenski sampled. The same                questions will be asked, supplemented by questions which have                   appeared in more recent national surveys. Thus, it will be                      possible to relate the Detroit Area findings to themselves, 30                  years earlier, and to national patterns as well. The analysis                   will focus both upon trends within the major religions and the                  degree to which, in people's secular lives, there has been                      convergence among the major religious denominations.",
