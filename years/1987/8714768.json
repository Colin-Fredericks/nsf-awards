 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project tests structural contingency theory as it                     applies to information technology in 72 white collar work                       groups.  Strucxtural contingency theory states that an                          organization or organizational subunit tries to \"fit\" its                       technology to its existing structure and good fit between                       structure and technology increases effectiveness.  Although                     structural contingency theory is usually treated as a static                    theory, it is implicitly dynamic: structure and technology                      continually change and adapt to each other and effectiveness                    may lag behind achievement of a good fit.  Although widely                      used, structural contingency theory has not been applied to                     the study of information technology.                                                 In this research, 72 work groups will be studied twice,                    8-10 months apart. Eighteeen computer-using work groups will                    be selected from each of four types of white collar work                        groups.  Interviews of 60 to 75 minutes will be conducted                       with all members of the work groups, including the                              supervisors.  Questions are designed to elicit information                      about structure, technology, fit, and effectiveness of the                      work group.  A second set of 40 to 60 minute interviews 8 to                    10 months later will provide information to test dynamic                        aspects of the theory.  Data will test eight different                          models--six static and two dynamic--of structural contingency                   theory.                                                                             The reseqrch is signifficant because it adds to our                         knowledge on how information technology can increase the                        efficiency of work and the quality of work life.",
