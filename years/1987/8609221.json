 "awd_abstract_narration": "On March 3, 1985, a strong earthquake shook central Chile causing about         150 deaths, about 2,000 injuries, and extensive property damage.  Strong        motion records were obtained at about 25 stations, one station recording        a peak horizontal acceleration of about 0.7 g and several stations              recording values over 0.2 g.                                                                                                                                    Two tailings dams developed massive liquefaction failures while other           tailings dams in close proximity did not fail.  Thus these dams provide         a unique opportunity to study the factors that determine the potential          for liquefaction failures.                                                                                                                                      Within the U.S., there are a larger number of tailings dams in areas            where there is significant seismic activity.  Because hazardous                 chemicals are used in the extraction of minerals from the ores,                 accidental release of these tailings can produce a significant                  environmental hazard, as well as a hazard to human lives in the                 downstream areas.  This research program is highly relevant to reducing         these safety and environmental hazards.                                                                                                                         The program consists of field and laboratory work to determine the              properties of the tailings which are relevant to their liquefaction             potential using state-of-the-art techniques.  The properties to be              determined include the steady state strength of the tailings and the            generation of strains due to cyclic loading.  The investigation will            provide means for judging the appropriateness of state-of-the-art               liquefaction evaluation techniques and will indicate any modifications          that may be needed in these techniques.",
