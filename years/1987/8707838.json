 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to explore how robots might follow a               trajectory more accurately with practice of that trajectory.  The               research focuses on an adaptive feedforward control, where a                    feedforward command is modified on the basis of previous performance            errors.  Proposed trajectory learning algorithms will be analyzed               mathematically, evaluated through simulation, and implemented on the            MIT Serial Link Direct Drive Robot Arm.  The objective of this research         is to make robots, and machines in general, move more accurately.  This         research will lead to improved robot performance, and the ideas and             algorithms developed can be applied directly to the control of a wide           variety of machines.  Robots and other machines will be able to move            more accurately at higher speeds, allowing faster throughput and                greater productivity.  In addition, more accurate performance will make         it easier to program robots to do particular tasks, as programmers will         no longer have to anticipate and compensate for dynamic errors.",
