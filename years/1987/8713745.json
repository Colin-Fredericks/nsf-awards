 "awd_abstract_narration": "A model is proposed for the structural design process for buildings             which enables a computer-based representation of the contents and intent        of the governing Building Code Specification.  This computer-based              representation will be easily accessed, readily understood by structural        design engineers, amenable to straightforward updating as the                   Specification evolves, and compatible with existing procedure-based             design software as well as with evolving knowledge-based design                 software.                                                                                                                                                       The enabling technology will be demonstrated by implementing an                 electronic version of the LRFD Specification for steel buildings.  The          results will be a computer design tool that can be delivered as a               layered product to give a range of capabilities, from a tutorial package        to a software development environment, extensible to other design               philosophies and other construction materials.",
