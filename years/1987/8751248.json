 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using lab-teaching technology developed at their laboratory, Cold Spring        Harbor will hold teacher-teacher-training workshops at six locations in         the Northeast, Southeast and Midwest each summer, 1987-89.  A mobile DNA        laboratory carries all the equipment necessary to perform with 24               participants a series of nine experiments which culminate in the                production and analysis of a recombinant-DNA molecule.                                                                                                          Each course will draw from teacher populations within commuting distance        of workshop site.  Propose site and dates for 1987 workshops are:  (1)          Winsor School, Boston, Massachusetts, June 29 - July 3; (2) Bronx School        of Science, The Bronx, New York, July 6-10; (3) Jefferson School of             Science, Fairfax, Virginia, July 27-31; (4) Argonne National Laboratory,        Argonne, Illinois, August; (5) Choate-Rosemary Hall, Wallingford,               Connecticut, August; (6) State University, Albany, New York, August.                                                                                            On-site preparation is coordinated by a local organizer at the host             institution.  Although the program is designed to select advanced               placement and honors teachers a proportion of similarly-qualified               general biology teachers will be selected.",
