 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past decade a number of model systems have been                      studied in attempts to understand the cellular correlates of                    sexual dimorphisms in the behavior of vertebrates.  Much of this                work has focused on neurons and muscles controlling the                         production of social communication signals that play a major role               in reproductive behavior during breeding seasons.  The principal                advantages in studying sexual dimorphisms in all of these systems               is that the communication signal--a song, a call, or an electric                organ discharge--is stereotyped in appearance, easily                           quantifiable and controlled by a discrete set of muscles and                    central neurons.  Dr. Andrew Bass is interested in structure-                   function studies of physiologically identified cells which are                  sexually dimorphic.  This research project concerns studies of a                motor system controlling the production of sound communication                  signals in fishes.  The system chosen is the swimbladder or sonic               motor system of marine teleosts.  The acoustic signal is produced               by a single set of muscles which are controlled by a central                    motor nucleus that may be comparable to the hypoglossal motor                   nucleus of tetrapods.  Dr. Bass has discovered a dramatic sex                   difference in the gross and ultrastructural features of the                     muscles controlling sound production in one group of marine                     teleosts, the midshipmen, Porichthys notatus.  There is also a                  behavioral sex difference in that only males are known to be                    sonic. Although a major goal of this research project is                        characterization of structure-function organization in the sonic                motor system of male midshipmen, the same studies will be carried               out with females to elucidate sexual dimorphisms in the system.                 Such studies will lead to more well delineated experiments for                  understanding the cellular mechanisms underlying the development                of sexual dimorphisms in the brain behavior of vertebrates.",
