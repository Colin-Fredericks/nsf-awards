 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to establish a scientific basis                for the prediction of catalyst dispersion  from fundamental                     studies of the impregnation step of catalyst preparation.                       Techniques must first be developed for this new approach.                       Experiments will be designed in which the number of coupled                     elementary processes of impregnation is minimized.  Thus, the                   first type of system to be studied will be adsorption over a                    planar substrate.  A high-resolution electron microscopy                        technique will be employed with a special \"cold stage\" to enable                direct, detailed observation of catalyst precursor morphology                   just after impregnation.                                                                                                                                        A second scheme will be designed for strongly adsorbing systems                 to permit measurement of an adsorption isotherm from the liquid                 phase (by atomic adsorption) and measurement of dispersion                      directly from the solid phase (by chemisorption and possibly TEM)               for the same catalyst batch.                                                                                                                                    A third apparatus will be designed to investigate the variation                 of dispersion with position in nonuniformly distributed                         catalysts.  Different one-dimensional distribution profiles will                be produced in an elongated catalyst sample, containing                         sufficient material so that the bulk metal concentration and                    metal dispersion can be measured for discrete sections along the                sample length.  In all cases, direct measurements of catalyst                   dispersion will be compared to existing impregnation theory.                                                                                                    Finally, revised theory will be developed where needed, using as                a basis these relatively simple impregnation systems.                                                                                                           These studies are intended to provide a background to design of                 catalyst system preparation procedures that would give                          predictable results, in contrast to the trial-and-error methods                 now in use.",
