 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal for support of a conference on vision to be held             July 26-31, 1987.  It is part of the FASEB conference series, modelled          on and sharing many of the virtues of the Gordon Research Conferences.          The number of participants is relatively small; this favors                     communication among them.  The format also promotes interaction among           the conferees, who live and eat together during the week of the                 conference. Since all discussion is \"off the record\" open                       communication is encouraged.  The topics are well chosen and integrated.        This conference should be of considerable value to the progress                 of research in the field of vision science and represents an excellent          investment for NSF, which is providing less than 20 per cent of the             total budget for conference expenses.",
