 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern communications theory has played a major role in                    increasing the efficiency and reliability of communication                      systems.  The aim of the proposed research is to achieve                        efficiency and reliability for the storage and retrieval of                     digital data in magnetic recording systems.  Specifically the                   aim is to increase the packing density of the digital data,                     that is, the  amount of data that can be stored in a unit                       area of the magnetic media.  This can be achieved by                            increasing the linear density (i.e. the number of bits per                      inch along a track) and/or by increasing the density of the                     tracks (i.e., the number of tracks per inch).  All of this                      must be done without sacrificing the reliability of the                         retrieved data.                                                                      The principal investigator will explore two distinct                       techniques for utilizing modulation and coding for increasing                   the packing density for magnetic recording systems.  The                        first is an improvement of a presently used techniques,                         including a class of codes called modulation codes, as well                     as error detection and correction codes.  The second ignores                    the present systems and uses techniques that have worked with                   channels with characteristics similar to magnetic recording                     channels.                                                                            The PI will continue the search for modulation codes                       that gave good error correction properties.  In particular,                     he will study trellis codes that have good Hamming distance                     and satisfy run length constraints.  Second he will attempt                     to improve his model for channel errors to better reflect the                   actual performance of real systems.  Third the PI proposes                      research that includes a experimental program in which he                       will make measurements on disk drives and of the burstiness                     of errors that occur in magnetic recording systems.  This                       part of the research also includes building circuitry to                        implement new signal processing algorithms such as adaptive                     equalizers, and new modulation and coding systems.  Finally                     the PI proposes to continue research on new codes for                           insuring the reliability of digital data recorded on magnetic                   and optical media.",
