 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) has become the                    primary analytical tool in organic and bioorganic chemistry,                    and of major importance in inorganic and biophysical chemistry                  as well.  Acquisition of such sophisticated instrumentation                     greatly increases the ability of a department to carry out                      front line research.                                                                                                                                            Recent advances in two-dimensional (2-D) NMR (COSEY and NOESY                   techniques, etc.) have dramatically enhanced its application in                 these fields, in spite of the fact that such experiments are                    very time-consuming.  This award, when coupled with an                          instrumentation award from NIH, will enable the acquisition of                  a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer capable of carrying out 2-D                          spectroscopy and other techniques requiring state-of-the-art                    equipment and large blocks of time.  The instrument will also                   complement the present capabilities of the department and                       maximize the overall utility of the present facility.  Programs                 involved in studies of organometallic chemistry, organic                        synthesis, biorganic synthesis and bioorganic mechanisms will                   be enhanced by acquisition of the instrument.",
