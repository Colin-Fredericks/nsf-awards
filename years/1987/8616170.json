 "awd_abstract_narration": "The silver halides will be studied by the techniques of angle                   integrated and angle resolved photoemission using continuously                  variable photon energy in the range 10 to 500 electron volts.                   Three types of experiments will be carried out:  (1) The first is               angle integrated valence band photoemission with photon energy                  variable through the Cooper minimum for the silver 4d levels.                   Thin polycrystalline samples will be employed, and an attempt                   will be made to separate d from p-derived valence bands by the                  known variation of photoemission cross section.  The angular                    anisotropy factor will also be measured on these randomly                       oriented polycrystalline samples.  (2) Angle resolved                           photoemission will be carried out on single sheet crystals in                   order to map the valence bands and observe calculated spin orbit                splittings.  (3) High resolution core level photoemission will be               carried out in order to observe surface/volume core level shifts                on well characterized silver bromide surfaces.  High resolution                 thin film adsorption coefficients will be measured in the range                 50 to 1500 electron volts on selected materials.  These studies                 take on a new significance because of the current interest in the               development of tunable solid state lasers.",
