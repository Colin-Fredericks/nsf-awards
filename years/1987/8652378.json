 "awd_abstract_narration": "The North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics will conduct               National Workshops for Introduction to College Mathematics for 44 high          school teachers from 11 districts nationwide. Eight of these districts          are members of the Urban Mathematics Collaboratives program sponsored by        the Ford Foundation, which will assist in support of the participants in        their schools. Building on materials for fourth-year high school                mathematics developed by the staff under Carnegie Corporation of New            York funding, the participants in this program will have an intensive 12        day summer training in mathematics and leadership skills and then, based        on their academic year experience and schoolroom use of the materials,          help to develop new materials for in-service workshops which they will          conduct in their districts for over 200 mathematics teachers of grades          7-12 in the second summer.                                                                                                                                      The primary goal of this project is that middle and high school teachers        experience a professional opportunity which will result in growth and a         greater involvement in mathematics education along with a change in the         perception of themselves with regard to mathematics education. The new          Carnegie funded syllabus used for the workshops exposes participants to         six modes of mathematical thought: geometry, analysis of data,                  probability and statistics, mathematical models of the real world,              computers and finance. With a focus on application, reflecting advances         in technology, this new course, which includes mathematics of                   contemporary importance, will provide better preparation for students           who will encounter the changing role of mathematics in a wide range of          college majors and careers.                                                                                                                                     The PI, Dr. Steve Davis is Head of Mathematics and Computer Science at          NCSSM and has received grants in previous years from NSF-NIE, Apple             Foundation, Carnegie and IBM to develop tool packages of use in                 mathematics and science, educational applications of clustering and a           syllabus for Fourth Year High School Mathemtics. Other staff members are        Daniel J.Teague, Mathematics Instructor who has also been an Instructor         in the Woodrow Wilson Institutes on High School Mathematics; Helen              Compton and Julia Graves are Mathematics Instructors at NCSSM.                                                                                                  NCSSM is eminently qualified in terms of staff, faculty, facilities, and        institutional commitment, to act as a national leader in the development        of new ideas in instruction. The NCSSM syllabus responds to the                 challenges posed by NCTM'S Agenda For Action and other reports.                 The PI has conducted numerous successful workshops in the past five             years and has developed materials which are suitable for them in scope          and philosophy. Each teacher will receive training in four areas: 1)            Units in unfamiliar mathematics; 2) Motivating applications; 3)                 Effective use of a single computer in front of a classroom to deliver           instruction; 4) The philosophy behind the syllabus. The training                materials will provide better problem solving skills and increase the           breadth of mathematical experience.",
