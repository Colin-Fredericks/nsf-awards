 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine the role of time-scale structure in          high-gain feedback systems and its relation to robustness of a design           with respect to uncertainties and disturbances.  Based on this, a novel         concept of time-scale structure assignment for general dynamic systems          is to be explored.  Furthermore, unification and consequent                     generalization of various exisiting analysis and design of high-gain            feedback methods is sought by casting them into the framework of                singularly perturbed systems.  Partitioning of a given design into              subparts is facilitated through consistent exploitation of time-scale           separation concepts embodied in singular perturbation theory.  The              specific problems which are to be examined are: (1) Eigenstructure              assignment via quadratic regulator theory , (2) Direct methods of               eigenstructure and multiple time-scale assignment in linear systems, (3)        Almost disturbance decoupling with internal stability, (4) Guaranteed           stability of uncertain systems, (5) Kalman filter with weak measurement         noise, (6) Multiple time-scale assignment and shaping of slow and fast          dynamics in nonlinear systems and (7) Nonlinear \"cheap\" control                 problems.",
