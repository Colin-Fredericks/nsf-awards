 "awd_abstract_narration": "Significant revisions have recently been made in the curriculum of the          senior-level modern physics theory course at Weber State to include             Nuclear and Particle Physics as a distinct subject area.  A                     corresponding change in the Modern Physics Laboratory course is planned.        The Physics Department will acquire an IBM-PC-based multi-channel               analyzer system (MCA), a high resolution HPGe gamma-ray detector, and           fast timing detectors, with associated electronics components for this          nuclear physics lab.  This will permit a wide range of nuclear                  experiments to be carried out in this laboratory that are not currently         possible with available equipment.  In addition to the laboratory               course, the equipment will also make possible student research projects         in nuclear and solid state physics.  The computer-based MCA will give           students an opportunity to work with computer-interfaced scientific             equipment which is invaluable to their training as physicists.",
