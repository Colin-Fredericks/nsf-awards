 "awd_abstract_narration": "The special characteristic of this project is its plan for creating a           \"research commons\" for undergraduate science majors.  A student research        and study suite surrounded by faculty offices has been established and          equipped to support a curriculum that places major emphasis upon                students' learning through research participation.  Basic scientific            skills in research are being developed by underclassmen through regular         use of microscopes, spectrophotometers, and related equipment.  By              requiring all  Biology, Natural Science, and Biochemistry seniors to            participate in student research, graduates leave the program with               ability to design, plan, and execute experiments, to critically evaluate        experimental results, and to design new experiments based on such               evaluations.  The students also are developing skills in reporting and          communicating ideas and experimental findings in both informal and              formal presentations.                                                                                                                                           The new equipment is aimed at meeting the needs of the students for             experience in conducting research under faculty direction.  The physical        reorganization of the Department is complete, the faculty all are               actively directing student research, and now the equipment needs are            being met.  This places the Department in a strong position to                  accomplish its goal of developing problem-solving capabilities in its           majors, not just providing them with an accumulation of biological              facts.",
