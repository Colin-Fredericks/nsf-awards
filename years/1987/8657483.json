 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will study problems related with diffusion                   processes.  These special Gaussian processes, with Markov                       property, arise mainly as limits of models used in many areas                   such as microscopic biological phenomena or various computer                    communications and manufacturing systems.  Professor Williams                   will study diffusion processes in three or more dimensions.  The                first problem will study reflected Brownian motion in a                         polyhedral domain.  Professor Williams has shown necessary and                  sufficient conditions for the existence of a two dimensional                    diffusion with given geometric data.  She will now explore these                problems in three or more dimensions.  Professor Williams plans                 to obtain characterizations of the stationary distributions and                 numerical measures of performance for the reflected Brownian                    motions arising as diffusion approximations to closed queueing                  networks and to networks with heterogeneous customer populations.               Proposed study of the excursions of diffusions in Lipschitz                     domains will provide important insight to the sample path                       properties of diffusions.  Diffusions with                                      discontinuous/degenerate diffusion coefficients are called                      singular diffusions.  Study of these processes is of great                      importance to areas such as optimal stopping, filtering and                     stochastic control.",
