 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to experimentally and theoretically            investigate the effect of fiber orientation on fiber damage during              sliding wear.  The experimental investigation will consist of preparing         graphite fiber composite specimens with specific fiber orientations,            friction and wear testing, extracting damaged graphite fibers from the          wear debris, and evaluating the wear track and the damaged graphite             fibers by scanning electron microscope.  Typical sliding directions             against fiber orientation will be longitudinal, transverse, and normal          directions.  Extraction of damaged graphite fibers from the wear debris         will be achieved by thermally degrading the matrix material.  It is             expected that the shape and size of the fiber debris collected from the         wear particles will reveal different damage mechanisms for different            fiber orientations, e.g., buckling, bending, pulling, or sliding wear           of individual fibers.  The theoretical investigation will employ a              finite element method to determine the deformation of fibers and the            stress distribution within the composite subsurface under normal and            tangential loadings.  The stress distribution in the subsurface and the         deformation of fibers obtained from the finite element analysis will            indicate the possible fracture point of the fibers during sliding wear.         Microscopic examination of the fiber debris will be compared with the           results of finite element analysis.",
