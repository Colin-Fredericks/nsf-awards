This eight part         series will present in compelling terms the recent scientific                   innovations in archeology and how new techniques have added startling           insights into past civilizations.                                                                                                                               The programs are aimed at the general public and will reach an estimated        7,000,000 people.  The series is thematically organized around vital            issues such as:  New Worlds; Great Spirits; Scribes and Subscriptions;          The Artisan; Power and Prestige; The Hearth; Realms of the Maya; and            Collapse.  A major traveling museum exhibition will parallel the series         and a trade book will be developed.  The Annenberg/CPB project has              authorized $2 million towards production and development of                     instructional materials for use as a college level course.

This series is a well designed, comprehensive and effective presentation        of a most \"visual\" discipline.
