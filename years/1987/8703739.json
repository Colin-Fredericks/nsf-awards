 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) is the major phospholipid of                  eukaryotic cells.  It is found in most membranes of those cells                 and serves as a general structural lipid, a responder to hormone                messages, an intermediate in fatty acid synthesis, and in other                 roles.  Dr. Moore is continuing his investigations into how this                phospholipid is synthesized in plant cells, and how that                        synthesis is regulated.  He is examining the source of choline                  for the nucleotide pathway of synthesis, which terminates with                  incorporation of choline-phosphate onto diacylglycerol to form                  the PtdCho.  Choline appears not to originate directly from L-                  serine, but perhaps from phosphoserine.  The work includes an                   investigation of the potential regulation of the enzyme that                    catalyzes synthesis of CDPcholine, cytidylyltransferase, and the                terminal enzyme of the pathway, cholinephosphotransferase.  Some                aspects of the lipid methylation pathway also will be                           investigated.  Attempts will be made to solubilize the                          methylation enzymes so that the possibility of their regulation                 may be better tested.                                                                                                                                                The results of this work would lead to a better                            understanding of how phosopholipid, and thus membrane, synthesis                is regulated and how structural organization effects this                       activity.",
