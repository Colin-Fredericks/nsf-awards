 "awd_abstract_narration": "Education has played an important role in shaping distinctive                   traditions in science.  Though we think of science as                           transcending national boundaries, the way in which fields of                    science have in fact evolved conceptually is in important part                  due to local concerns and circumstances.  Although Scotland is a                small country, its scientists were of major influence and                       importance in the nineteenth century.  However, little is known                 of the way physics was taught at the universities nor of how                    traditions were established in the culture.  Dr. Wilson's study                 shows the important role that Scottish institutions played in                   shaping a distinctive tradition in physics.  His work sheds                     light both on current historiographical issues in the cultural                  influences on science and on the history of the rise of physics.                                                                                                Specifically, he is writing a history of the natural philosophy                 class as taught by the professors of natural philosophy in the                  Scottish universities.  Though concentrating on the natural                     philosophy class, the study seeks to integrate a number of                      related themes:  interactions between Scotland and other                        countries, the industrialization of Scotland, the history of                    Scottish higher education, developments within other Scottish                   subjects like engineering and moral philosophy, and the                         careers of Scottish students, as well as the changing definition                and content of physics itself.  Not only will the study                         contribute to our understanding of the development of physical                  thought within an important geographical-cultural region, but in                doing so, it will also add to our comprehension of the conceptual               development of the several internationally prominent physicists                 produced by Scottish universities during the nineteenth century.                                                                                                Dr. Wilson has established himself as a leading scholar of the                  nineteenth-century Scottish influence on British physics and                    higher education.  His publications on the Stokes-Kelvin                        relationship, the results of his prior National Science                         Foundation support, are an important contribution to the internal               and institutional history of British physics.  Moreover, he has                 shown a distinct capability for distilling conclusions of broad                 significance from his work.",
