 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work to be undertaken in the area of atmospheric and spray icing of         structures consists primarily of experimental studies conducted within          the framework of parallel analytical studies.  The main objective is to         develop improved predictors of loading (icing weight, aerodynamic drag          and lift) associated with icings, and formulation of collection                 efficiency, and freezing fractions, n.                                                                                                                          Two sets of experiments will be conducted using the Iowa Institute of           Hydraulic Research (IIHR) Icing Wind Tunnel.  The first set will consist        of measurements of icing accretion rates, icing forms, and structural           loadings due to major icing types (glaze, and hard and soft rime).  The         second set of experiments will focus attention on:  the dynamics of             droplet trajectory through, and deposition from the local flow field            around a structural element undergoing icing; and the heat transfer             processes associated with icing accretion.  These measurements and the          analysis of the obtained data will help in improving the understanding          and formulation E and n.                                                                                                                                        State-of-the-art force transducers and measurement, and flow-                   visualization instrumentation will he used in carrying out this work.           The pioneering use of laser-sheet and holographic methods for image-            processing will be an important contribution to droplet trajectories and        deposition measurements.                                                                                                                                        The P.I. is highly qualified to perform this research and the facilities        at his disposal are among the best in the world.  An award for two years        is recommended with the proviso that a third year of support can be             granted only upon the presentation of a satisfactory report on findings         together with an updated workplan.",
