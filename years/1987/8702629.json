 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) project will                  examine controls over ecosystem structure and function in the                   boreal forest of interior Alaska.  A combination of experiments                 and observations will be used to document the changing nature of                ecosystem controls during primary succession on river floodplains               and during post-fire secondary succession in the uplands.  The                  central hypothesis of the project is that the pattern of                        succession is determined primarily by initial site character-                   istics and by the life history traits of component species and                  that the rate of successional change is then determined by                      vegetation-caused change in environment and ecosystem function.                 The following aspects will be emphasized: (1) vegetation change                 and demographic controls, (2) vegetation-caused changes in                      resources and standing crops of biomass and nutrients, (3)                      controls over nutrient supply, (4) the role of herbivores as                    consumers and modifiers of succession, and (5) the role of                      invertebrates and microbes as regulators of organic decomposition               and nutrient remineralization processes.                                                This new research project builds upon a past record of major            research accomplishments and productivity stemming from the site                upon which the new project will be based.  New research themes                  are derived from past observations and experimental results                     spanning a period of more than a dozen years of work.  The                      project will provide an integration of sound fundamental                        ecological research with opportunities to have substantial impact               upon the stewardship and management of vast tracts of renewable                 natural resources.                                                                      The primary research team and project leadership are of                 proven high quality in their own right, and the total effort will               be further strengthened by the use of outside consulting                        expertise in certain specialty areas.  Facilities provided by the               University of Alaska are excellent.  Additional facilities                      provided by the USDA/Forest Service will further enhance the work               as will other support in kind from that source.                                         It is reasonably expected that the output from this extreme             of the forested environment will provide a valuable comparison                  base for other similar work being conducted on temperate forest                 ecosystems.  In a similar fashion it is expected - and documented               for its earliest phases - that this project will easily integrate               itself into the network of similar ongoing projects in a major                  contributory role.                                                                      The Ecosystem Studies Program recommends that funding be                made available for the first year of this five-year continuing                  award.",
