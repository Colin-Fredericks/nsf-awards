 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past 10-15 years atmospheric chemistry has evolved from            a young research discipline devoted primarily to local problems of              urban pollution and air quality to a mature science concerned with              the hemispheric to global scale cycling of a wide variety of chemical           species.  To a large extent this change has resulted from an                    increasing realization that human activities can cause chemical                 disturbances to the natural troposphere on scales far beyond local              concerns.  Well-known examples include changes in the                           regional-to-global concentrations of certain nitrogen compounds, lead           and other heavy metals, artificial radionuclides, a number of                   synthetic organic substances, certain acid-forming species, carbon              dioxide and methane.  These chemical changes in the atmosphere can              often extend to the earth's soils, oceans, and biota far from the               original source region.  They can result in alterations in the                  earth's climate, changes in vital nutrient cycles, and impact                   significantly on the public health and quality of life on earth.                    The Atmosphere/Ocean Chemistry Experiment (AEROCE) will be a                coordinated multi-institutional atmospheric and marine chemistry                research project centered in the North Atlantic region.  The ultimate           goal of the AEROCE project will be the development of a predictive              capability for the continentally derived species observed in the                marine troposphere over the North Atlantic.  The selection of sites             and the measurement protocol in AEROCE has been developed jointly by            modelers and field experimentalists.                                                This element of the AEROCE project is designed to provide a body            of data and information on the temporal and spatial distributions of            concentrations of 222Rn and 210Pb which will be usable for the                  \"calibration\" of models that simulate the transport and removal of              trace atmospheric species.  The chemical inertness of 222Rn makes it            a nearly ideal substance for validating the transport portion of the            models.  Study of the daughter nuclide of 222Rn, 210Pb, can give                useful information on the aerosol removal processes occurring in the            marine atmosphere and thereby provide guidance in the modeling of               these processes for other trace substances.                                         It is proposed to use proven methods of sampling and analysis of            222Rn and 210Pb to provide, as a component of AEROCE, surface level             air measurements of the concentrations of these two naturally                   occurring radioactive tracers on island sites in the North Atlantic             Ocean.  The sampling scheme will provide 4-hour samples at each site            of 222Rn continuously from start-up time to the end of the project.             Filter samples will be taken for 210Pb analyses at the same sites               during passages of selected well-formed fronts between contrasting              air masses.  One-hour samples will be taken starting 12 hours before            the forecast passage time and ending 12 hours after passage.  About             one set of 24 samples will be taken each month at each location.  The           resulting data will be interpreted using data-analytical methods to             correlate the concentrations with the air mass characteristics and to           generate a body of statistical characteristics (4-hour, diurnal,                seasonal, and annual averages and associated standard deviations).",
