 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with developing and testing a theory                 of human cognition.  That theory sees human cognition as                        operating according to a set of production rules.  Each                         production rule specifies that a mental act should take place                   when a particular type of mental state occurs.  The research will               continue the development of the PUPS computer simulation program,               begun under Anderson's prior NSF support, which enables one to                  trace out the interactions of these production rules.  An effort                will be made to make the PUPS simulation available to other                     interested researchers in the cognitive science community.  Part                of the effort will be devoted to the writing of a research                      monograph that will describe the support for Anderson's                         production system theory.                                                                                                                                       Empirical research will be devoted to analyzing the distinction                 between procedural and declarative knowledge which is central to                the theory.  Procedural knowledge is knowledge about how to                     perform various cognitive skills and is encoded as production                   rules.  Declarative knowledge is factual knowledge about the                    world which can be used by the production rules.  The research                  will try to establish that these are separate types of knowledge,               by showing that there is little transfer between learning                       procedural and learning declarative knowledge, that declarative                 knowledge is more readily interfered with by performing a                       concurrent task which involves similar information, and that                    people have more conscious control over expression of declarative               knowledge.  The research will also compare the basic parameters                 associated with acquisition and retention of the two types of                   knowledge.                                                                                                                                                      The theory is of general applied significance, because it is                    concerned with the processes by which complex cognitive skills                  (like doing a proof in logic) are acquired.  In particular, in                  examining the relationship between declarative and procedural                   knowledge, the research is laying the foundation for                            understanding how people make the transition from reading written               instruction in a technical domain to solving problems fluently in               that domain.  Anderson is following up this applied challenge in                other projects with other funding.",
