 "awd_abstract_narration": "Belau is a U.S. Trusteeship in western Micronesia.  The                 society has changed in response to U.S. political control after                 World War II, and has been especially affected by U.S. policy on                nuclear armament.  The proposed research will analyze the                       response of the people of Belau to changing U.S. policy.  It will               focus especially on the political participation of women and on                 how women characterize the transformations that have taken place                in their lives.                                                                         For anthropology, this project is part of a growing body of             ethnographic research that attempts to analyze changes in                       societies in terms of global context.  It has methodological                    significance in that it will combine social history with                        anthropological field techniques.  It will provide much needed                  information on South Pacific Islands where nuclear enterprises                  have affected local people's environments.                                              This research will try to develop a new way for social                  scientists to understand the debate on international nuclear                    arms.  By understanding how individuals and social groups come to               grip with the threat of nuclear warfare and how they respond to                 changing political policy, this project will help us understand                 social processes within the international nuclear context.",
