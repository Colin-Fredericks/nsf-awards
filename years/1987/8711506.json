 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the past several years, Drs. Phillips and Votey have                   been collaborating on a set of studies using the National                       Longitudinal Survey as a data base to model the choice to engage                in criminal behavior.  Operating from a rational choice model of                behavior but attentive to a broader range of social and economic                variables than are often the focus of economic models, they have                produced a number of important papers that look at the choice of                criminal activity as a function of opportunities and of costs and               rewards.  They now plan to follow up on two of the most important               issues that theoretically would explain youth crime:  The first                 is to estimate the effects of past contact with the criminal                    justice system on present behavior controlling for such factors                 as schooling, achievement in school, and the individual                         attributes that determine the choices among school, work, and                   crime.  The second is to test a model that decisions about work                 and crime are a continuous process.  Their objective is to                      examine whether and under what circumstances crime is not a time-               intensive activity that substitutes for work but an additional                  and complementary option to work and school.                                         Drs. Phillips and Votey have already contributed                           significantly to unraveling the causes of crime.  This research                 holds considerable promise of further illuminating the                          theoretical and empirical dimensions of criminal behavior among                 juveniles and young adults who vary by age, race, sex, and a                    broad array of individual characteristics.  To date, no one using               individual data has successfully evaluated the contributions of                 deterrence effects, aspects of family and other economic support,               and social and moral factors on the choices among school, work,                 and crime with models where such activities do not need to be                   mutually exclusive.  Also, the decision to integrate a broader                  range of potential influences explicitly into the choice process                is a major advance in assessing the very real social,                           psychological, and economic trade-offs involved in crime.",
