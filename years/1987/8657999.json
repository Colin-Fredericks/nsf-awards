 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to combine constitutive equations,            bifurcation theory and finite element methods to improve our                    understanding of the collapse mechanisms and unstable phenomena within          soils and rocks.  A better understanding of the catastrophes and                instabilities resulting from nonlinear material behavior is of                  fundamental importance not only to Geotechnical Engineering, but also           to Earthquake Engineering and Structural Geology.                               The transition between continuous and discrete modeling of soil and             rock masses will be analyzed with the theory of bifurcation.  The               emergence and growth of discontinuities within initially continuous             soil and/or rock masses will be studied by combining nonlinear                  description of material behavior (including stress-dilatancy and                strain-softening) and some finite element techniques similar to the one         developed in Structural Mechanics to analyze the problems encountered           in the buckling of shells.  The description of strain localization is a         fundamental and necessary step to understand not only the emergence and         growth of failure surfaces within earth slopes or beneath structures            but also the formation of faults in sedimentary deposits caused by              tectonic forces.",
