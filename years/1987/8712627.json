 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a need in the biomedical and biotechnological industries  for a        range of systems to serve as sources for the isolation of                       therapeutic compounds and as hosts for the expression of                        genetically engineered products.  While bacterial, fungal, and                  insect cells may fulfill some of the requirements for expression  of            proteins of low to moderate complexity, only mammalian and                      human cell lines may be capable of the extensive port-                          translational processing necessary for the function and stability  of           many complex proteins.  The PIs are proposing an in-depth                       examination of the potential of incorporating cellular and viral                oncogenes into primary cultures of human cells as a reproducible  and           direct method for the creation of established (\"immortalized\") human            cell lines and of the effects of such procedures on product formation           and stability and on the growth factor requirements of the resulting            human cell lines.                                                                                                                                               The projects described in this proposal will result in the                      development of a rational and practical framework for the                       application of oncogenes for the immortalization of various                     mammalian and human cell types, for the reduction of their growth               factor requirements, and for their use as host systems for genetic              engineering.",
