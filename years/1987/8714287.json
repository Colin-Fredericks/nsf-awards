 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves a study of the role of supporting                   infrastructures, such as laboratory facilities, equipment, support              personnel, funding, communication, etc., in technology development.             These studies will be addressed in particular to understanding the              role of these infrastructures in promoting or hindering the                     development of a group of critically innovative technologies that               exhibit certain well-defined characteristics.  The investigation will           be conducted from an historical point of view, and will focus on a              carefully selected group of case studies, which include instances in            which contemporary technologies, such as high-temperature                       superconducting materials, are included.  This research seeks to                provide anecdotal data on the technologies studied that may help in             understanding the role that NSF/ENG can play in technological                   innovation in emerging engineering technologies.",
