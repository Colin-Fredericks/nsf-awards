 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biological role of structural fluctuations in proteins                      has not been established although their presence has been                       amply demonstrated.  This is partly due to uncertainty about                    the thermodynamic basis for the phenomenon.  Possibilities                      range from passage between defined conformational substrates,                   as in the allosteric model for hemoglobin, to pure kinetic                      regulation of the passage along the reaction coordinate of                      enzyme substrate complex.                                                                                                                                       Dr. Rosenberg will base the planned research on a physical                      model that he has developed for these phenomena.  The overall                   goal will be to test the validity of model and then                             demonstrate its usefulness in explaining the possible                           function of structural fluctuations in biological processes.                    He has selected sound experimental systems using well-                          characterized proteins and tested analytical methodologies.                     A major strength of this project is the diversity of                            methodologies (hydrogen-exchange, fluorescence-quenching,                       thermal stability) being applied to the study of protein                        motions.",
