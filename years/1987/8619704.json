 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an analysis of the distribution of two species of               chlorofluoromethanes (freons) in the southern Weddell Sea.  The                 samples were obtained by the principal investigator as part of the              Filchner III Expedition of the West German research vessel POLARSTERN.          The analysis of freons, a time-dependent, anthropogenic tracer in the           water column, is part of a collaborative chemical and hydrographical            study of the circulation of Ice Shelf Water (a particular water type            formed under the Filchner Ice Shelf).  The outlow of this water type            through the Filchner Depression, its subsequent evolution on the                continental slope, and its penetration into the deep Weddell Sea will           be followed, and the derived data used to study formation rates and             transport paths of deep and bottom water masses in the Weddell Sea.                                                                                             Air samples that were collected on the cruise will be analyzed for              freon concentrations in order to determine the extent of equilibrium            between the surface sea water and the overlying atmosphere.",
