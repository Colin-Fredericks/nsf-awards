 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research and development related to composite steel-and-concrete economy        and efficiency of structures, to implement new construction techniques,         to incorporate new and improved materials, and to devise methods to             rehabilitate and strengthen existing structures all contribute to               advancing the state-of-the-art in this field.  Researchers and                  practitioners in the field of composite construction need to meet               periodically to exchange information related to these topics.  Such             exchanges would avoid duplication of research efforts, provide transfer         of technology and spur new developments.  An international conference on        composite construction is proposed to satisfy these objectives.                                                                                                 The conference will cover all phases of design, construction and                research related to steel-and-concrete composite members.  Both new             construction and rehabilitation and strengthening of existing structures        will be discussed.  Researchers and practitioners from around the world         will be invited to participate, with total attendance limited to                approximately 100.  The primary objectives of the conference are as             follows:                                                                                                                                                             1.  To exchange information in the field of composite construction;                                                                                             2.  To provide technology transfer between researchers and                  practitioners;                                                                                                                                                      3.  To promote the use of research in the development of design                     procedures; and                                                                                                                                             4.  To identify research needs related to composite construction.                                                                                          The conference will be held June 7-l2, 1987, in Henniker, NH at a site          normally used for Engineering Foundation Conferences.                                                                                                           The partial support budget requested is appropriate.  The Principal             Investigators are capable and the institutional resources are                   appropriate.                                                                                                                                                    An award is recommended.",
