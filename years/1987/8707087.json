 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this work is to develop a short-term (in the                   order of days) ice hazard warning system for shallow, partially                 ice-covered waters.  This system will vastly improve the present                capability of accurately predicting the movement of individual                  ice floes, while retaining sufficient numerical efficiency so as                to facilitate its use on small, e.g., shipborne, computers.                                                                                                     The formulation of this system will couple the ice floe motion                  and the underlying water circulation, and will apply the                        Eulerian-Lagrangian concept of transport modelling to ice drift                 prediction.  A detailed investigation of the range and variation                of the drag coefficients at the ice surface and bottom will be                  carried out as well, so as to establish guidelines for estimating               these coefficients under a variety of environmental conditions                  and for a range of ice floe characteristics.",
