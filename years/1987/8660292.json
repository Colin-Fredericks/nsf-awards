Available data on the dynamic          tensile strength of brittle materials such as rocks and ceramics is             extremely limited, and the data available is open to question because it        is obtained by surface measurements where surface flws may have an              influence on the fracture properties.  This research program involves           the measurement of dynamic tensile strength with an embedded gage placed        in the interior of the test specimen.                                                                                                                           Specifically, the research program entails the development of an                electromagnetic gage of small dimension which will sense particle               velocities which can be related to the imposed dynamic stresses.  Gage          placment techniques in the specimen will be an important part of the            project.  The data will be recorded digitally and processed                     automaticallly to give velocity, displacement and stress as a function          of time during the dynamic fracture process.  The method will be                demonstrated and dynamic tensile strength and/or toughness will be              determined for several brittle rocks, plastics, composites and ceramics.                                                                                        Sunburst Recovery is a small company with an excellent laboratory for           conducting this experimental program.  The principal investigator has an        excellent background in rock mechanics and has shown the feasibility of         using electromagnetic transducers in measuring properties of geo-               materials.
