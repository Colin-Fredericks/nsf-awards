 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program was                  established in FY 1987 to provide substantial resources to                      upgrade the research capabilities of the strongest and most                     productive predominantly minority institutions.  This planning                  grant project lays the foundation for a plan that will increase                 the institution's quality of research and research-related                      training.  Specifically, support for this project will permit the               establishment of an MRCE advisory committee of scientists and                   engineers, local leaders, and industrial representatives who will               assist the institution in evaluating its current and future                     potential for performing meritorious research during the next                   five years.  Jackson State University will develop strategies to                strengthen research in chemical physics and nuclear magnetic                    resonance.  In addition, cooperative program with the                           Lawerence Laboratories at Berkeley and Livermore will be                        reassesed.  Dual degree programs in chemistry and chemical                      engineering will be implemented with the California Institute of                Technology at Davis and Santa Barbara.                                                                                                                          This institution has the facilities and personnel to develop a                  Minority Research Center of Excellence.  The Foundation has                     supported this project because the proposed work can lead to the                performance of meritorious research and will increase the                       participation of minorities in science and engineering.",
