 "awd_abstract_narration": "Northern Arizona University will develop a five-year model program for          the preparation of middle school science and mathematics teachers. The          proposed effort will involve the teaching of strong content courses in          science and mathematics in agreement with NSTA and NCTM guidelines, and         the development of a series of courses, referred to as \"integrated              laboratories\", that attempt to help students tie the science and                mathematics content to the realities of the middle school curriculum.           The focus throughout the program is on integrating the mathematics and          science and helping students to apply the formal content to the middle          school.                                                                                                                                                         The proposed program represents a coordinated effort involving                  scientists and mathematicians, science and mathematics educators,               teacher educators, master teachers and school personnel. This program           will prepare a teacher who has both content knowledge and skill with            methods of teaching in the middle school. Numerous experiences with             middle school children are planned. A capstone experience, following            student teaching, is a summer \"camp\" in which students teach middle             school children full-time under the guidance of master teachers and             university personnel. Part of the evaluation of the project is to               compare the content knowledge and teaching performance of teachers in           this program with a matched control group.                                                                                                                      Dr. Gordon P. Johnson will direct the project. Dr. Johnson is a                 Professor in the Department of Physics and is very well qualified to            direct this major effort. During the first year the project will be co-         directed by Dr. Ray Tamppari, Professor of Biology. The critical staff          involved in program development hold academic appointments in science           and mathematics departments or are science and mathematics educators.           The links with the public schools are evident and the necessary school          personnel are intrically involved in all aspects of the project.                                                                                                This is a very strong project and will serve as a model for those               institutions desiring to prepare middle school teachers having                  exceptionally strong science and mathematics content knowledge.",
