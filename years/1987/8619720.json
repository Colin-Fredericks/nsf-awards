 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Objectives:  The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary                cooperative research project between Dr. Otto Vogl of Polytechnic               University and Dr. Ferenc Tudos of the Central Institute of Chemistry is        to study oxidation of polyolefins of various stereochemistry and                structural similarities.  The research should help answer the                   fundamental question of how the chemical structure of macromolecules            affects degradation process and may lead to methods for increasing the          service life of polymers.                                                                                                                                       Relevance to Program Objectives:  This project in polymers research             fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by             enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to             combine complementary talents, pool resources, and share research               facilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.                                                                                                   Merit:  The proposal ranks in the Excellent/Very Good category.  Its            technical merit therefore warrants NSF support.  The U.S. and Hungarian         researchers are well regarded and the rationale for international               cooperation, in terms of anticipated mutual scientific benefits, is             clearly articulated.  Significant research results are anticipated from         this cooperative project which could be useful in locating vulnerable           linkages in conventional polymers.                                                                                                                              Interrelated Projects:  Dr. Vogl currently receives support from the NSF        Polymers Program for the study of Helical Polymers Optical Activity             under grant number DMR-8617768.                                                                                                                                 Funding:  The requested budget covers the incremental costs to the U.S.         of international cooperation associated with the research in accordance         with program guidelines.",
