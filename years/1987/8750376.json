 "awd_abstract_narration": "SUNY College at New Paltz will improve an undergraduate electron                microscopy program for the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Geology,          and Physics, as well as a newly organized School of Engineering.  The           college will purchase a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), model JSM-          840 manufactured by JEOL.  The primary application of the SEM will be to        shift from the old, descriptive, morphological applications to current,         quantitative, analytical uses of the SEM.  This will impact on 1) E.M.          courses for science and engineering majors; 2) the undergraduate                research program; 3) programs for non-majors, specifically, the general         education program; and 4) community outreach to other colleges,                 community colleges and high schools.  This project will upgrade a               program in electron microscopy, and provide undergraduate science,              engineering and science education majors with the necessary technical           background and analytical skills to be competitive for graduate programs        at major universities or to go directly into the scientific workforce in        science, medicine, industry or public education.",
