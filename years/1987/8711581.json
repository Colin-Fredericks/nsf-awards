A                      vehicle for this attack will be the lattices generated from                     finite subsets X of Euclidean space by taking unions and                        intersections of the convex hulls of subsets of X.  A wealth of                 such combinatorial problems exists.  Those closely related to                   Tverberg's theorem will be singled out, for example a conjecture                of John Reay, as being particularly suited to the methods of our                attack.                                                                              This research will consider lattices of finite unions of                   convex polytopes.  A polytope in space is a region with flat                    sides.  It is convex if the segment joining any two points in the               region lies in the region.  Starting with a finite set of points                and joining them together and taking unions of the resulting                    regions forms such a lattice and makes for an important                         combinatorial and geometrical object of study.  This proposal                   will bring to bear novel techniques for obtaining properties of                 these lattices.  It should bear interesting fruit.",
