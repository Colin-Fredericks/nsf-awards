 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues a line of research focusing on investor behavior,        managerial objectives, asset pricing, and capital structure.  Under the         previous award the investigator concentrated on developing and analyzing        single-period models in conjunction with various combinations of                possible financial instruments.  In particular, he analyzed the call            provisions of convertible bonds, which is a relatively simple situation,        to gain a better understanding of managerial objectives, conflicting            interests between management and stockholders, and the rationality and          objectives of stockholders.  The purpose of this project is to extend           the analysis to a multi-period setting, where financial managers and            investors have asymmetric information.  This research is important              because it will provided a more fundamental understanding of financial          markets.  The research results should shed light on the issue of to what        extent do financial managers adopt strategies that maximize shareholder         wealth.",
