 "awd_abstract_narration": "High concentrations of donor or acceptor impurities in                     silicon, the omnipresent technical material of the computer age,                produce a metallic system rather than a semiconductor.  The                     characteristics of the transition from metallic to insulating                   properties as the impurity concentration is decreased have been                 of interest for many years but particularly since about 1980 as a               result of a confluence of new experiments and new theories.  In                 spite of these advances, a satisfactory description of some                     unusual electrical transport and magnetic properties of the                     classic semiconductor system, n-type silicon remains elusive.                   Samples of doubly-doped (\"compensated\") silicon are available for               these studies. New theories connect a description of the                        electrical conductivity to unusual magnetic properties which have               been observed in samples with electron concentration near the                   critical concentration for the transition from metal to                         insulator.  By comparing properties of our samples of compensated               silicon with those of uncompensated silicon, a test of the                      validity of current theory is possible.  These properties will be               measured to make that test.",
