 "awd_abstract_narration": "The area of optical neural networks has evolved by adopting the                 techniques proposed by various \"connectionist\" models.  The optical             implementation was first demonstrated by Psaltis and Farhat in 1985 Opt.        Lett. 10, 98 (1985) and was followed by a direct optical associative            memory demonstration by Anderson in 1986 Opt. Lett. 11, 59 (1986) and by        Soffer, Dunning, Owechko and Marom Opt. Lett. 11, 118 (1986) as well as         Yariv and Kwong Opt. Lett. 11, 186 (1986).  Since this time the field has       evolved rapidly and many insights, problems, and approaches have been           considered.  Most interesting has been Chinese to English three character       recognition and translation demonstrated by Psaltis and co-workers, an          optical novelty tracking filter by Anderson and co-workers, and recent          work by Lischer and Lee at N. R. L.                                                                                                                             Some of the problems to be addressed include multiple image holographic         storage, implementation of learning, and faster nonlinear crystals              exhibiting large effects.",
