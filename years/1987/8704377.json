 "awd_abstract_narration": "How masses of complex evidence in the legal system are generated and            used effectively in the formulation and structuring of argument and in          the process of drawing conclusions is not well understood.  This is             partly because these processes involve discovery, proof, deliberation,          and choice which can entail creative or imaginative reasoning.  Yet             illuminating these processes is fundamental to general knowledge of             human inferential reasoning and to a specific understanding of the              behavior of advocates and fact-finders in law.  Dr. Schum's research on         the inferential use of evidence involves building upon and integrating          research in multiple fields--legal theory, statistics, psychology, and          decision analysis.                                                                                                                                              The aim of Dr. Schum's research is to enhance our understanding of              evidence-marshalling and argument-structuring theory and to apply this          theory to specific inferential and evidential issues.  While attending          to fact-finding, of particular interest in this research is the                 important task of structuring arguments from a mass of evidence in              preparation for presentation and defense at trial.  His specific                theoretical objectives involve study of ways of integrating various             forms of argument structuring activity and study of the ways in which           such activity can facilitate the process of discovery, the recognition          of evidential subtleties, and the assessment of the probative weight or         value of evidence.  His methods of study incorporate the development            and use of a computer-based system to aid in the analyses of large              collections of evidence.  Also, the computer-assisted methodology               should permit sorting out of the structural and temporal elements               involved in integrating, weighing, sequencing, and presenting evidence.         The results of the research should be relevant to efforts to design             computer-based systems for assisting the research, practice, and                teaching of discovery-related and other inferential tasks.",
