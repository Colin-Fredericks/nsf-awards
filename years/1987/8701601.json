This meeting will continue the                       tradition of dealing with emerging areas and major advances in                  existing areas.  The specific topics and speakers will be                       determined at a meeting of the program committee in October,                    1986 with supplementary areas and speakers added in the Spring                  of 1987 to allow response to new development in rapidly                         evolving areas.  The areas to be included in the meeting                        include both theoretical and experimental programs with                         emphasis on fields which have presented conceptual challenges                   and which have a broad impact beyond their initial area of                      activity.  Interest in recent atomic physics Gordon Conferences                 has been very high.  The meetings represent a unique                            opportunity to assemble a critical number of the leading                        researchers in related but differing specialization                             to bring new points of view to the most exciting current                        problems.  This proposal requests National Science Foundation                   assistance in support of the Atomic Physics Gordon Conference                   by participants.",
