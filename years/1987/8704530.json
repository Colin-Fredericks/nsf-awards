 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project consists of four parts: nonlinear partial                       differential equations, calculus of variations in nonlinear                     elasticity, stochastic control and stochastic functional                        differential equations.                                                             In the nonlinear partial differential equations part the                    investigators want to study the existence of radially symmetric                 solutions of two special Dirichlet problems for quasilinear                     elliptic equations, one of which contains a mean curvature                      operator. They would like to obtain the same results as Serrin,                 Peletier and Ni, using the calculus of variations rather than                   methods based on ordinary differential equations.                                   In the nonlinear elasticity part the authors propose to re-                 examine certain issues in 3-dimensional nonlinear elasticity,                   which give rise to the one dimensional variational methods. They                propose to use the connection between the elastic cavitation                    effect discovered by Ball and a higher dimensional form of the                  Lavrentiev's phenomenon.                                                            In the two stochastic parts the investigators want to study                 Bolza problems with regular or singular control, and to apply                   these ideas to another class of integrands for variational                      problems. They plan to incorporate memory effects in their                      analysis and use Hilbert space methods in the analysis of                       stochastic functional differential equations.                                       This research effort belongs to applied analysis and calculus               of variations, two branches of mathematics that come in contact                 with physical problems such as elasticity. Both investigators are               senior experienced scientists with a lot of credit for their                    previous mathematical accomplishments.",
