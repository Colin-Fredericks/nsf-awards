 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Guckenheimer will carry out research in a number of                   different areas. These include one dimensional mappings,                        quadratic vector fields in the plane and multiple bifurcations.                 He has already established himself as an international leader in                all of these areas. The current proposal is a continuation of                   this very successful program.                                                        Over the last decade there has been a rapid growth in the                  mathematical theory of iterations of one dimensional mappings.                  This theory has been successfully applied in such diverse areas                 as the theory of chemical reactors, the dynamics of semiconductor               devices and the transition to chaotic behaviour in fluid                        dynamics. Guckenheimer has a good record of interaction with                    scientists in other fields.                                                          His research into multiple bifurcations will be aimed at                   classifying types of degenerate bifurcations which occur near                   quadratic Hamiltonian systems. This will be used to find                        solutions to a restricted form of Hilbert's 16th problem.",
