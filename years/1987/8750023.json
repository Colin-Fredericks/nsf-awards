 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ten Botany courses in the Biology curriculum share a common need for            environmental growth chambers where factors of light, temperature, and          relative humidity can be regulated to observe their effects on plant            growth and behavior.  The wide range of biological phenomena being              investigated using the two new PT-80 Percival Growth Chambers include           the initiation of the sexual phase in algae and bryophytes, the study of        physiological processes in various groups of plants, developmental              differentiation in plant organs and in callus tissue, and the effects of        environmental factors on growth, survival and competition in populations        of native plants.  The growth chambers also are being utilized in the           study of ectomycorrhizae by General Mycology students, and in conducting        tissue culture experiments in Plant Growth and Development and                  Biotechnology courses.",
