 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will allow Professor William G. McDougal, Oregon State               University, to collaborate with Professor Hans F. Burcharth, University         of Aalborg, Denmark.  They will study the strain resistance                     characteristics of the dolos armor unit.  Such units are used to                provide protection against wave induced forces for shorelines, jetties,         and breakwaters.  Traditionally, large stones have been used to make            rubble structures to form the protection, but as construction has been          extended into increasingly hostile wave environments, the necessary             weight of hydraulically stable stones becomes unreasonable.  Such               stones are hard to find and to handle.  As an alternative to stones a           variety of armor units have been developed.  The dolos has received             considerable attention, because it has a high hydrodynamic stability            coefficient, it's units interlock well, and it is relatively porous,            but it is also susceptible to structural failure.                                                                                                               The proposed research will test dolosse for strain under a variety of           simulated conditions.  Professor McDougal is one of the few U.S.                engineers studying this problem, and Professor Burcharth is an                  international authority on concrete armor units.  It is necessary to            conduct the research at Aalborg University, because the test dolosse            are there.  They would be expensive to move or to construct in the U.S.",
