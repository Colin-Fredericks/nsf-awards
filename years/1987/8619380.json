 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polymeric glasses serve as the basis for many strong,                      lightweight materials.  The engineering properties of these                     materials and the processing characteristics can be modified and                controlled by addtion of low-molecular-weight compounds, a second               polymeric component, or a reinforcing particle or fiber.  The                   interactions between the components play a critical role in                     determining features such as homogeneity of the resultant                       material, the glass transition and the modulus.  A new nuclear                  magnetic resonance technique based on carbon-13 spin diffusion                  can probe the relative intermolecular structure of the                          constituent components at the level of the chemical groups of the               polymer repeat unit.  With this level of structural data, the                   chemical interactions leading to properties such as compatibility               or increase in modulus can be identified.  Changes in the modulus               typically reflect the local chain dynamics present in the glass                 and NMR is a particularly powerful tool for identifying these                   features.  The influence of diluents, a second polymer or a                     filler on the local dynamics can reinforce the unit level                       structure.  The materials to be studied include two polymer                     blends with strong interactions where compatibility is not                      controlled by hydrogen bonding and where NMR is the technique of                choice for identifying the nature of the interaction.  A special                class of low molecular weight diluents which are particularly                   effective antiplasticizers will also be investigated.  In                       addition, the interactions and changes in mobility of an                        engineering resin in the presence of a reinforcing fiber will be                studied from the local structural viewpoint characteristic of NMR               spectroscopy.",
