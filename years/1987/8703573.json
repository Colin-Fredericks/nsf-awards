 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a five-day conference in Algebraic Topology             and Homotopy Theory to be held during August of 1987 at the                     University of New Hampshire, Durham, New Hampshire.  Rapid and                  deep developments indicate a definite need for a conference of                  this sort in order that researchers meet and exchange ideas.  It                is expected that the conference will draw mathematicians from the               U.S., Great Britain, France, and the Federal Republic of Germany.                       Topics that will be discussed include applications of                   simplicial methods, classical homotopy theory, cohomology of                    groups, stable homotopy theory, and applications of extraordinary               theories.  For example, the work of H. Miller on the Sullivan                   conjecture and its offshoots has led to some understanding of                   maps between classifying spaces.  In addition, related work of                  Lannes and others has made new breakthroughs in the cohomological               description of spaces of maps.  It is very likely that these                    results will lead to even more exciting and basic theorems.                     Other examples include the work of Devinatz, Hopkins, and Smith                 in the direction of Ravenel's nilpotence conjectures.  The                      results here indicate a glimmering of  some global understanding                of the stable homotopy groups of spheres.",
