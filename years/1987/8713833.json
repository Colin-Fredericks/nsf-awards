 "awd_abstract_narration": "To achieve high power plant efficiencies, the turbines in the plant must        operate at the highest possible temperature.  Present-day materials             place a limit on these temperatures, so that cooling of the turbine             blades is necessary to maintain their integrity in the face of the high         temperature gases that pass through the turbine.  One approach is to            pass a coolant through flow passages situated within the blades.  To            further enhance the heat transfer within the passages, fins or ribs are         used.                                                                                                                                                           The available information about the heat transfer characteristics of            such finned or ribbed passages is insufficient for design.  The                 experiments to be performed under the present proposal will remedy this         deficiency.  The heat transfer measurements will be supplemented by mass        transfer measurements carried out by means of the naphthalene                   sublimation technique.  The measured mass transfer coefficients will be         converted to heat transfer coefficients via the analogy between the two         processes.  The obtained data will not only be useful for design but            will also serve to verify numerical simulations.",
