 "awd_abstract_narration": "The presence of hypersaline ocean water in the Michigan                    Basin region approximately 400 million years ago can be tied to                 the deposition of thick upper Silurian salt sequences, to the                   plugging of porosity by ancient saline groundwater in nearby                    middle Silurian hydrocarbon reservoirs, and perhaps to the                      development of extremely saline and metal-rich modern groundwater               brines.  In order to determine whether the ancient saline sea was               isolated, with its surface well below the level of surrounding                  seas, both internal and external carbonate units will be analyzed               for primary stable carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios.  Carbon                   isotopic signatures will be used to deduce the depth of the saline              sea whereas oxygen isotopic signatures will be used to deduce its               regional extent and evaporation state.  The presence of ancient                 saline groundwaters in middle Silurian hydrocarbon reservoirs will              be documented by microthermometric analysis of trapped ancient                  fluids, which can reveal their temperature of formation, total                  salinity and cation content.  Finally, the recent theory that                   saline seawater evolved into modern brines will be tested by                    reconstructing the late fluid history of middle Silurian                        carbonates located throughout the Michigan basin region.  Both the              timing of brine development and the extent to which basinal brines              traveled out of the basin will be documented by analyzing both                  oxygen isotopic                                                                 trends and the chemistries of fluid inclusions trapped in these                 rocks.  The project will benefit undergraduate instruction                      through acquisition of equipment, rock samples and involvement                  of students in development of senior these topics.",
