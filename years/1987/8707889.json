 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scope of our continuing research is the application of                      image reconstruction or tomographic techniques to a systematic                  and rigorous study of the Earth's laterally-heterogenous mantle                 and core seismic velocity structures.  In the course of the                     initial funding period of this proposal, using a large-matrix,                  row-action inversion method that was developed, tested and                      refined during the first stages of our analysis, we have                        constructed spherically-symmetric, lower-mentle P and S-wave                    velocity models as well as P and S-wave seismic-station travel-                 time residual correction sets.  We are using travel-time data                   from the International Seismological Centre's (ISC) short-                      period, global earthquake catalog.  Nearly 2.4 million source-                  receiver data points from 24,423 earthquakes, representing                      teleseismic P and S ray paths in the 25o-105o epicentral                        distance range (bottoming depths from 700 kilometers to the                     core-mantle boundary) were used in the model inversions.  The P                 results and the S velocity model show significant variation and                 improvement from results obtained by other studies and the S                    station correction set is possibly the first usable set ever                    developed.  Using these improved models of both the lower                       mantle's spherically averaged structure and the upper-mantle                    and crustal lateral velocity variations as starting models, we                  are continuing and extending our analysis in a systematic                       investigation of the structure of the Earth's mantle, outer and                 inner core and core-mantle boundary.",
