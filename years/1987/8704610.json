This equipment will be used to            study catalysts consisting of thin films on oxide substrates.  Thin             metal films on various oxides will be used to examine changes in the            electronic levels of the metal following adsorption and to determine            reasons for differences in the properties of metal catalysts on                 different supports.  Thin oxide films on other oxides will be examined          to determine the nature of intermediates formed on mixed-oxide, acid            catalysts.  These systems are simplified models of classes of catalysts         widely used in both production chemicals and refining of petroleum.             Better understanding of the energetics involved in their behavior is an         important step toward designing new catalysts.",
