 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Franklin Institute Science Museum will design, test,                        fabricate, and circulate to eight museums an exhibit, \"The                      Science of Music:  Sound Waves and Sound Forms\" that will                       introduce visitors to the physical laws that govern sound waves.                By using music as an attractive and concrete subject to engage                  broad public interest, the exhibit will illustrate such topics as               sound wave amplitude, phase, frequency, reflection and                          interference.                                                                                                                                                   Primary support for the project comes from the eight member                     Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative, consisting of:  the                       Franklin Institute Science Museum, Philadelphia, PA; Discovery                  Place, Charlotte, NC; the Fort Worth Museum of Science and                      History, Fort Worth, TX; the California Museum of Science and                   Industry, Los Angeles, CA; the Science Museum of Minnesota, St.                 Paul, MN; the Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago, IL; the                  Center of Science and Industry (COSI), Columbus, OH; and the                    Museum of Science, Boston, MA.  Each has contributed $50,000 and                the costs of exhibit shipping and maintenance.  Direct matching                 fund support totals more than $381,000.                                                                                                                         The exhibit will spend three months in each location, and the                   total audience will exceed 1.5-million visitors over its eight                  museum tour.  This project will extend the work of a group of                   museums that are already helping each other in a collaborative                  effort.  The exhibit concept has high public appeal among groups                that science finds it hard to reach, including teenagers and                    minorities.  An FY87 award of $145,000 is recommended.",
