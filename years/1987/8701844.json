The program is designed to enable U.S.                  scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research              institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well          as Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.  Exchange awards provide                  opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of          unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental                  conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                                                Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to             his/her field of science, the prospective potential of the applicants           for professional growth, as well as criteria relevant to the furthering         of international cooperation in science and engineering.  The program           is particularly directed to scientists and engineers who are embarking          on their research careers.                                                                                                                                      This research project will utilize Pulse Field Gradient NMR (PFGNMR)            diffusion measurements to investigate the formation and structure of            macromolecular complexes of isotactic and syndiotactic poly(methyl              methacrylate) (PMMA) and lignin preparations.  An analysis of the               structure and molecular weight distributions of PMMA and lignin                 preparations will precede characterization of their diffusion                   coefficients as a function of concentration, molecular weight and               degree of association.  The development of a model for the diffusion of         the associated macromolecules from diffusion results will entail                analysis to obtain hydrodynamic volume and shape information as a               function of degree of association.                                                                                                                              The project is under the direction of Dr. Theodore M. Garver, Research          Assistant, Department of Forest Products, University of Minnesota at            St. Paul, MN 55455, U.S.A., and Professor Paul Callaghan, Department of         Physics and Biophysics, Massey University, Palmerston North, New                Zealand.                                                                                                                                                        This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,              international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents                  allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat            administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
