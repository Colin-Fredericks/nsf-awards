 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of design optimization has evolved over approximately            two decades.  One fruitful area of design optimization research is              design sensitivity analysis which enables approximation analysis,               analytical model improvement, and assessment of design trends.                  Thus, design sensitivity analysis has become more than a utility for            optimization, and is a versatile design tool in its own right.                  However, in the past, most research in this area tended to focus on             theoretical studies.  The research interests of this Presidential               Young Investigator are to develop reliable sensitivity analysis                 techniques that consider modelling uncertainty, system nonlinearity,            and large-scale and interdisciplinary problems that are encountered             frequently in industrial environments.  The results of this research            should prompt the application of sensitivity analysis to practical              design processes.                                                                    This grant also provides for one undergraduate to assist                   Professor Hou in his research.  This supplement is made under the               program for Research Experiences for Undergraduates.",
