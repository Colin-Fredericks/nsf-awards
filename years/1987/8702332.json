 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will initiate a long-term integrated study of              interactions among organisms in agricultural ecosystems.  The                   general goal is to test the hypothesis that management based on                 ecological concepts can effectively substitute for reliance on                  chemical subsidies in production-level agronomy.  By imposing a                 range of management treatments on a series of experimental plots                specific hypotheses will be tested that follow from the general                 hypothesis that nutrient subsidies can be minimized by                          manipulating plant-microbe interactions; that herbicide subsidies               can be minimized by manipulating crop-weed interactions; and that               pesticide subsidies can be minimized by manipulating plant-                     insect-pathogen-vertebrate interactions.                                                Primary experimental treatments are designed to alter                   radically the controls on population-level interactions in                      agronomic systems.  This will allow the testing of hypotheses                   about how long-term interactions among populations affect system-               wide attributes such as nutrient availability, herbivory and                    pathogenesis, plant competition, and systemswide carbon                         allocation and nutrient/pesticide outputs.  Treatments will                     include four main species-levels with two management levels                     nested within each: conventional corn/soybean cultivation                       (moldboard plowed vs. no-till), organic-based, low-input                        corn/soybean/cover cultivation (minimum chemical input vs.zero                  chemical input); short-rotation Populus (woody biomass)                         cultivation (above ground allocation vs. belowground allocation);               and native successional vegetation (historically-tilled vs.                     never-tilled).  These treatments will be established within the                 same general area, and the development of these systems will be                 followed indefinitely.  Selected satellite sites in other                       portions of the landscape will also be examined to formulate a                  basis for addressing landscape-level questions in later phases of               the project.                                                                            Many would assert that the future of modern agriculture                 demands a basic, mechanism-level understanding of the ecology of                production-level cropping systems.  This endeavor requires a                    multidisciplinary, long-term approach at a site that is relevant                to North American agronomy and that can provide the logistical                  support and administrative infrastructure to facilitate this type               of major research effort.                                                               The project team for this research is excellent comprising a            broad and appropriate array of expertise and very productive                    records of past performance.  Institutional facilities are                      excellent at both the main campus and at the Kellogg Biological                 Station (KBS) field site.  Institutional commitment to the                      project is substantial, both as direct support and in kind.                     \f       It is expected that this project will rapidly establish                 itself as an invaluable collaborator within the extant family of                related projects and that it will provide an instructive suite of               comparisons for work on unmanaged, natural ecosystems.  A large                 number of other related research projects will continue to be                   conducted at the KBS and will both benefit from and lend strength               to this new work.                                                                       It is recommended that this new, five-year continuing award             be made as requested.",
