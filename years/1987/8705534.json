 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most important industrial processes is the                           conversion of olefins, i.e. hydrocarbon molecules containing                    double bonds, to polymers. Examples of two such polymers are                    polyethylene and polypropylene. Although organometallic                         catalysts have been used in the commercial polymerization of                    olefins for several decades, remarkably little is understood                    about the detailed mechanism of the catalytic processes, and                    catalyst design has been largely empirical. The Principal                       Investigator has developed chemistry which promises to yield                    mechanistic details of olefin polymerization and allow more                     logical design of catalyst systems.                                                                                                                             Migratory insertion reactions of transition metal alkyl olefin                  complexes are key transformations in hetero- and homogeneous                    olefin polymerization reactions and numerous stoichiometric                     carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. The proposed work focuses                 on understanding fundamental aspects of this reaction coupled                   with preparation and study of new olefin polymerization                         catalysts. The Principal Investigator has obtained results                      recently which suggest that there is a relationship between the                 structure and dynamics of ethylene hydride complexes and their                  alkyl analogs and that ethylene hydride complexes which exist                   as bridged or agostic structures can serve as ethylene                          polymerization catalysts. A cobalt complex possessing an                        agostic ethyl group has been discovered which catalyzes living                  polymerization of ethylene. Goals of the research are (1) to                    synthesize and explore the reactivity and catalytic activity of                 cationic and neutral Co(III) complexes containing an agostic                    ethyl group, a neutral or anionic two-electron donor group, and                 either a Cp or a Cp* ligand, (2) to prepare new agostic                         ethylene hydride complexes and evaluate these species as olefin                 polymerization catalysts, (3) to develop these new complexes                    for living polymerization of a diverse group of olefins, with                   emphasis on correlations of mechanistic features with polymer                   structure and utilizing living systems for block and                            copolymerization, and 4) to develop methods to functionalize or                 cap one or both ends of the polymer chain with functional                       groups.",
