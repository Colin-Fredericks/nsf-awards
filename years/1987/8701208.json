 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's on this grant have been actively engaged for many              years in describing the global magnetospheric field                             configuration, and its time evolution on the convection time                    scale, in terms of the MHD equilibrium theory.  This theory uses                magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) to describe time-dependent processes                such as magnetospheric convection.                                                      Basically four lines of research are followed:  first, to               understand two fundamental magnetospheric processes, namely                     convection and substorm; second, to develop a reliable numerical                code for calculating non-symmetric three-dimensional MHD                        equilibria; third, to develop quantitative models for the                       magnetosphere of Uranus; and fourth, to develop three-dimensional               Magnetospheric B-field models that include as many physical                     features as possible, but are designed for more models such as                  the Rice Convection Model.                                                              Specific question to be addressed include how do magnetic               boundary conditions for an \"open\" magnetosphere influence the                   global equilibrium configuration of the magnetotail and the                     adiabatic convection process?  Do magnetotail equilibria with                   plasma islands convect according to the standard picture of                     magnetospheric convection?  How does the location of the inner                  edge of Earth's magnetotail plasma sheet depend on the                          distribution of the thermal plasma pressure?  How does a storm-                 type sudden commencement re-configure the magnetospheric plasma                 distribution and the magnetic field?                                                    These questions are all fundamental to magnetospheric                   dynamics.  The end result should be a greater understanding and a               better model of the magnetosphere.",
