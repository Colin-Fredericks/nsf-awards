Competencies are being developed through a series of Biology           projects requiring skill in monitoring, data collection, statistical            analysis, modeling, and report generation.                                                                                                                      With this new academic thrust, even lower division students are becoming        better prepared to undertake undergraduate laboratory research, to              complete major field projects, and eventually to participate                    successfully in graduate, medical, dental, and other professional               programs.",
