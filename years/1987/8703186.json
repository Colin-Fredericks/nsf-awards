 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of B lymphocytes is characterized by ordered changes       in gene expression.  The overall goal of this research is to understand         the mechanisms responsible for the increase in heavy chain (mu) and light       chain (kappa) synthesis and expression during the differentiation of            immunoglobulin-producing cells.  A murine B lymphoma cell line, 7OZ/3 is        the model system.  7OZ/3 expresses both the membrane specific form and          the secretion specific forms of heavy chains as intracellular proteins.         The cells can be induced to synthesize kappa chains and express membrane        IgM by treatment with the polyclonal B cell mitogen LPS, interleukin-1,         supernatant from concanavalin A stimulated spleen cells, or gamma               interferon.  Variants have been isolated which fail to respond to either        LPS or interferon, and their responses to the other inducers have been          characterized by somatic, genetic, cellular and molecular biological            methods.  The results indicate that the pathways of induction by the four       inducers are different, but that the induction of kappa transcription is        a common target of all pathways.  Cloned kappa and mu chains have been          introduced into both wild type and mutant 7OZ/3 cells.  The wild type           cell lines transfected with the introduced genes express them both              transiently and as stable clones, and the introduced kappa gene is              inducible.  One of the mutants is unable to express kappa transiently and       only a few stable subclones can express the introduced kappa gene even at       low levels.  The next goals of this project are to determine which              missing factor(s) prevent kappa expression in this mutant.  Mutant and          wild type kappa genes will be introduced into previously characterized          variant 7OZ/3 cells to determine whether the cellular activation system         or endogenous kappa gene is responsible for the mutant phenotype.                    The results of this research will enhance understanding of the             regulation of B cell development and, more generally, of the regulation         of gene expression.",
