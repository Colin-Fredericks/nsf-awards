 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long term potentiation (LTP), a long lasting enhancement                   of synaptic efficacy in the hippocampus, a brain structure, is                  considered a model for memory and learning.  However, the                       stimuli used for its induction, typically 50-400 pulses                         delivered at frequencies of 100-400 Hz, are distinctly above                    physiological levels.                                                                Long term potentiation (LTP) of principal cell groups of                   the hippocampal formation may play an important role in                         learning and memory.  The precise role that LTP might fulfill                   is unknown, but possible models of neocortical-hippocampal                      interaction are currently under consideration.  Whatever the                    circuitry underlying learning and memory, and whatever the role                 of LTP may be, it is clearly of interest to determine the                       physiological conditions under which LTP is actually induced in                 the normal, unanesthetized animal.  Dr. Jonathan Winson                         proposes here to carry out a series of experiments, first in                    anesthetized and then in freely moving rats, to investigate                     the phenomenon that may be present and physiologically relevant                 to the induction of LTP.                                                             Assuming that LTP proves to be a physiologically relevant                  aspect of hippocampal function, it will be of considerable                      importance to determine the conditions underlying its induction                 in the normal animal.  This will have a two-fold benefit.                       First, it will further our understanding of the function of LTP                 and its possible role in memory.  Second, it will provide a                     knowledge of physiologically relevant stimuli to serve as a                     basis for the investigation of the pre- and/or post-synaptic                    mechanisms, at the cellular level, responsible for LTP.                              Dr. Jonathan Winson proposes to study particular                           conditions by which LTP may be induced in normally behaving                     rats.  The proposed experiments are based on the following.                     1) He has recently shown that LTP is preferentially induced in                  the rat at 400 Hz compared to lower frequencies.  The same                      effect is achieved when lower frequency input volleys are                       applied to the medial and lateral perforant pathways                            asynchronously such that the composite stimulus seen by granule                 cell dendrite is 400 Hz.  Such asynchronous inputs may reflect                  the manner in which LTP is induced physiologically.  2) In                      preliminary studies he has found that LTP is preferentially                     induced on one phase of the theta rhythm.  3) Studies in the                    hippocampal slice in other laboratories have demonstrated a                     \"priming\" effect on the CA 1 field, i.e., bursts applied to CA                  1 afferents separated by 170-200 ms, the periodicity of theta                   rhythm, preferentially induced LTP.                                                 Dr. Winson proposes to study these newly revealed phenomena                 in the dentate gyrus, first in anesthetized and then in freely                  moving rats during several behaviors.  Time permitting, similar                 studies will be performed in the CA 1 field.",
