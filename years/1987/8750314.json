 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will provide students in the natural and social sciences            with experience in detailed image analysis.  The instrumentation will           allow Whittier College to make full instructional use of the Fairchild          Aerial Photography Collection--a unique archive of historical (1928-            1964) aerial photographs.  Because of the age and breadth of photography        in the collection, both major and non-major students in several                 disciplines can use it for laboratory, class, and research projects.            Geology students will use aerial photographs and maps to show the               progress of natural processes and analyze geological features.  Students        in biology will be able to map vegetation, habitats, or particular              environments and show how they have changed in response to natural              events (e.g., fire) and changing land use.  Sociology classes will              analyze processes of urban development and the distribution of social           and ethnic groups in terms of their geographic location in the natural          and man-made landscape.  The major piece of equipment to be purchased is        a Bausch & Lomb Zoom Transfer Stereoscope.  This instrument allows all          types of images to be compared by carefully matching scales and removing        distortions, and information on an image can be transferred to special-         purpose maps.  A digitizer tablet with appropriate software and a               computer will be used to convert the graphical data to numerical form           for image and statistical analyses.",
