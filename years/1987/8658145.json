 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of the relationships between tectonic processes               and metamorphism is one of the most active and exciting areas                   of current research on the Earth's crust.  Thanks to new                        techniques, to whose development the PI contributed, it is now                  possible to track the pressure (P) - temperature (T) path of                    specific assemblages of minerals as they are subjected to                       burial, heating, compression, dehydration, faulting, uplift, and                erosion.  The application of geochronologic techniques to the                   same rocks makes it possible to deduce P-T time paths and opens                 the possibility of building accurate geophysical models of                      crustal processes.  The PI will conduct research on tectonics                   and metamorphism during the duration of the PYIA but, also,                     will study the possible role of fluid immiscibility during high                 pressure, low temperature metamorphism.                                                 Field research will be conducted in three areas:  (1) the               eastern Alps of Austria; (2) west-central Idaho, USA; and (3)                   the island of Sifnos in the Aegean Sea.  Laboratory work will                   be carried out primarily at Harvard where an electron microprobe                analyzer will be used to determine P-T paths from mineral                       assemblages and a heating/freezing microscope stage will be                     used to estimate conditions of fluid immiscibility.                             Geochronological work will be of the 40 Ar/39 Ar-type and will                  be performed in a laboratory whose identity is not specified.",
