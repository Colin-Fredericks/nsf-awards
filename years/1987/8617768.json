 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many naturally occurring macromolecules, and several synthetic                  polymers, exist in their helical conformation.  In synthetic                    polymers, unlike in their natural analogs, the material consists                of a mixture of equal quantities of right.handed and left.handed                helixes and, therefore, does not exhibit the property of optical                activity.  This research has as its aim to synthesize and study                 the properties of acetal polymers with helices predominantly or                 exclusively in one screw sense. These polymers, like helical                    natural macromolecules, should be optically active.                                                                                                             The research will seek to identify the basic macromolecular                     structure related to helicity, examine the influence of various                 side groups on the helix, and study various polymerization                      mechanisms of initiation and propagation leading to helicity in                 the products.                                                                                                                                                   These types of polymers are virtually unknown, and this                         investigation should further extend our ability to synthesize                   polymers with great structural precision and to relate their                    molecular structure to observed properties of the bulk material.",
