 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interaction of various geometric objects in an                         environment has generally been of interest to design and                        manufacturing engineers. These interactions can take a variety                  of forms.  The form of object interaction of interest for the                   proposed research is that of dynamic collision or impact.                            The stimulus for such research is automated assembly and                   manufacturing.  With an increased focus on transforming                         manufacturing and assembly tasks into automated or                              semi-automated tasks, additional facilities are necessitated to                 aid in task simulations.  While tools exist for some types of                   simulations, they are deficient for the simulation of                           impacts.  Mainly such deficiencies are in the area of the                       kinematic simulation algorithms.  It is the rectification and                   extension of such kinematic algorithms that is the nucleus of                   the proposed research.                                                               The simulation of impacts will be accomplished in a four                   phases: implementation of a dynamic collision detection                         processor; integration of solid modeling data into a kinematics                 program; integration of the dynamic collision detection process                 into a kinematics program; and development of techniques to                     guide the kinematics procedures through the impact.",
