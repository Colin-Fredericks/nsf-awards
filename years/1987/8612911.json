 "awd_abstract_narration": "Network location problems involve locating one or more new facilities           on a network, such as a transport network, when costs of some sort are          incurred which are proportional to network travel distances between new         facilities and existing facilites on the network, as well as possibly           to distances between new facilities.  The new facilities are to be              located on the network so as to minimize an objective function.  The            principal approach to solving such problems in the past, when the               problems have been continuous (considering all possible locations on            every link) has been to exploit network structure.  Recently it has             been shown that many such continuous problems may be formulated as              mathematical programming problems (well-defined mathematical                    optimization problems).  This research will focus on solving continuous         network location problems by exploiting connections with mathematical           programming.  Since the latter field is quite highly developed, the             opportunities for improving our ability to solve network location               problems appear very promising.",
