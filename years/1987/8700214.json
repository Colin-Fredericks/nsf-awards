 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Polyalthia hypoleuca species complex (Annonaceae) is a group           of six closely related (monophyletic) species that grow sympatrically           in various combinations throughout the lowland tropical rain forests of         Southeast Asia.  Restriction enzyme activity variation of ribosomal and         chloroplast DNA extracted from dried leaves will be investigated as a           means of comparing genetic variation within and among populations of            each species, and among species.  DNA variation within and among                populations of each species will not only be informative as to genetic          variability in tree populations of the humid tropics, but will                  illuminate the constant genetic variation among species.  This                  significant interspecific genetic variation will be analyzed                    cladistically (DNA of the most plausible outgroups will also be                 examined) to provide a molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for the                P. hypoleuca complex, and this will be compared with a phylogenetic             hypothesis derived from morphological data.  The most strongly                  supported (congruent) phylogeny emerging from these analyses will be            used to examine the radiation of the members of this group from a               common ancestor with regard to ecological differentiation and                   biogeographical distributions of the species.  Results will be                  interpreted in relation to the paleogeography of the region, and to             hypothesized differences in evolutionary forces between tropical and            temperate forests.  Dr. Steven H. Rogstad will perform this                     postdoctoral fellowship research during two years of tenure at                  Washington University (St. Louis, MO).",
