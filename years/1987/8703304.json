 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Dr. Cerling to examine the extent to which                   soil carbonates contain useful climatic information. It is                      possible that the stable isotopic composition of paleosol                       carbonate may provide a direct measure of climatic and ecological               conditions for non.marine sites. Since oxygen isotope composition               in rainwater is affected by temperature and may vary by almost 20               per mil if this is perserved in paleosol carbonate it may provide               a  potential climatic indicator. The isotopic composition of soil               carbon varies by about 15 per mil and is primarily a function of                the proportion of C4 plants in the local setting. Since this                    vegetation is also influenced by climate  carbon isotope ratio of               soil carbonate may also reflect climate.                                                                                                                        Dr. Cerling will collect samples along both latitudinal and                     altitudinal transcents to document variation in the isotopic                    composition of modern soil carbonate which is due to ecological                 and climatic factors. He will also measure the isotopic                         composition of soil organic matter and respired soil carbon                     dioxide to document important controlling processes. Finally he                 will analyze a series of anthropologically significant soils from               both Africa and Asia.                                                                                                                                           This research is important because, if successful, it will                      provide an important anthropological tool. To understand how                    humans developed it is essential to understand the environments                 in which they lived and how these changed over time. While                      techniques are well established for marine sediments, terrestrial               materials are much more difficult to interpret and very little                  work has been done. This project should help to remedy the                      situation.***//",
