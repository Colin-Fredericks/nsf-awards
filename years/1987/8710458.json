 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to further develop a comprehensive model of               the physical and chemical reactions occurring in the thermosphere               during auroral precipitation events, and to use them to interpret               spectrographic observations from recent and planned CEDAR                       campaigns.  The result will be information on the energy                        distribution of incident electrons and protons, and changes in                  atmospheric composition as a result of the precipitation.                            The proposed work is likely to lead to a significant advance               in our ability to use ground based observations to infer the                    physics and chemistry of auroral effects on the atmosphere,                     including heating effects and composition changes.  There is a                  current need for such an interpretive capability, which will be                 increasing during the next few years, as the CEDAR campaigns of                 coordinated auroral observations produce extensive data sets.                   The PI is highly qualified to perform such work, as he has                      developed the most comprehensive model currently available for                  such work.",
