 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project is for research on the molecular mechanisms          of cellular repair of alkylated DNA in M. Iuteus after its exposure to          alkylating agents.  The experiments will involve purification and               characterization of enzymes which are seemingly specific to certain             alkylating agents.  Their structural chemistry will be studied in order         to investigate the physiochemical interaction between repair proteins           and DNA base adducts.  These experiments will be carried out by Dr. A.          Athar at the Center for Advanced Molecular Biology (CAMB) in Lahere,            Pakistan.  The laboratory of Dr. Lawrence Grossman at Johns Hopkins             University will assist Pakistani collaborators in conducting those              experiments that could not be done in Pakistan.                                                                                                                 Scope:  The collaboration is beneficial to both institutions and is             expected to yield information leading to better understanding of                molecular mechanisms of cellular repair of alkylation damage to genetic         material.  The past work by the two laboratories has resulted in                several joint publications.",
