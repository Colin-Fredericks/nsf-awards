This award will allow the                     investigator to expand her research activities from the relatively              narrow area of applied production theory, and to apply her expertise to         the wider consideration of firm behavior and performance in different           market contexts and countries.  More specifically, this project will            involve studying price markup behavior and firm decision-making                 regarding inventory investment and advertising.  These three aspects of         firm behavior have important impacts on the observed economic                   performance of industries and countries, both in terms of their impacts         on the actual trends of indicators, such as productivity and capacity           utilization, and also in terms of the appropriateness of the measures           used to represent these trends.  Firm behavior and the implications for         overall economic performance will be analyzed and compared for the              U.S., Canada, and Japan.",
