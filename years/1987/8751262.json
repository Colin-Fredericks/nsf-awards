 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since its inception in 1982, Project SERAPHIM has achieved              great success in its three main functions: collector and                        disseminator of microcomputer-related instructional materials in                chemistry; the conduct of workshops to train teachers to use                    computers effectively in classrooms and laboratories; and the                   development of innovative chemistry software.  The project has                  developed collaborative efforts with other local and national                   projects and receives more than $150,000 annually from local                    school systems which use its materials or teacher development                   activities.  The project now plans to enhance its dissemination                 efforts by preparing \"Best of SERAPHIM\" learning packets and by                 developing an electronic journal that will allow phasing out of                 its distribution function.  New research and development efforts                will include effective, instructive computerized experiments, a                 simple and inexpensive voltage interface, instrument simulators,                and programmer's tools for new and existing microcomputers.                             Although the existence of microcomputers in precollege                  classrooms has grown significantly during the past few years, the               creation of effective software has not kept pace.  SERAPHIM is                  filling a great need in chemistry education through the                         development and evaluation of chemistry software.  SERAPHIM's                   teacher development efforts have resulted in a network of                       chemistry faculty from both the precollege level and institutions               of higher education, a collaboration which is enhancing learning                in both areas.  The project's efforts have demonstrated that the                the microcomputer can be quite effectively used to aid students                 in learning chemistry as well as being a motivating factor.  The                store of quality chemistry software has benefitted enormously                   because of the work of SERAPHIM.",
