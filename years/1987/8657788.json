 "awd_abstract_narration": "String theory has become the leading candidate for a unified            theory of the fundamental interactions, replacing theories of                   pointlike particle interactions with elastic, one dimensional,                  extended objects.  Strings enlarge and extend the symmetry and                  structure of spacetime, matter, and forces in ways that are not                 yet fully understood.  One of the goals of this research is to                  discover the underlying principles of string theory, which may                  enable us to solve some longstanding problems of physics.  One of               these is the reconciliation of quantum mechanics and general                    relativity.  String theory appears to reconcile the quantum with                the equivalence principle by modifying the microscopic structure                of spacetime while preserving differential geometry as a large-                 scale approximation.  One of the mathematical structures that may               be a key to this new geometry is the connection between string                  dynamics and two dimensional surfaces; this connection has been                 the focus of the recent work of this investigator.                                      The investigator is one of the new Presidential Young                   Investigators for FY 1987.  He is an exceptionally promising                    young theoretical elementary particle physicist whose future work               on string theory and on other areas of elementary particle theory               should be very significant and interesting.",
