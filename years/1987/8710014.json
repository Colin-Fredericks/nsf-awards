 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the construction of a pulse-accelerated                 flow spectrophotometer for use in the study of rapid                            light-induced electron transfer reactions. This type of                         instrumentation allows the recording of spectra for species                     with lifetimes as short as 1/100,000-th of a second and the                     measurement of rates of reactions which occur over such a short                 time span, but is not yet commercially available. Nearly all                    light-driven energy conversion processes rely at some point on                  electron transfer reactions, including photosynthesis. One of                   the most promising schemes for the use of synthetic substances                  for light-driven energy conversion involves the use of                          molecules containing two metals. The absorption of light causes                 an electron to be transferred between the metal atoms to create                 a high energy molecule from which electrical or chemical energy                 may be extracted as the electron returns to its preferred                       location.                                                                                                                                                       Two new approaches are being used in this project for the                       direct assessment of thermal intramolecular electron transfer                   rates. The first of these makes use of preferential solvation                   to interconvert mixed-valence redox isomers of unsymmetrical                    binuclear metal complexes. Pulse accelerated flow                               spectrophotometry is being used to time-resolve the redox                       isomerization process. The second approach is based on                          light-induced (pulsed laser) metal-to-metal charge transfer in                  the near IR to create high energy isomers, again in                             mixed-valence complexes. Relaxation by electron transfer to                     create low energy isomers can be followed in the visible by                     transient absorbance spectroscopy. This project is supported in                 part by a Presidential Young Investigator award.",
