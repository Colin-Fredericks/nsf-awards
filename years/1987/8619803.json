 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year cooperative research project in              chemistry between Dr. David H. Parker, Department of Chemistry,                 University of California, Santa Cruz, and Dr. Steven Stolte, Catholic           University Nijmegen, The Netherlands.  The investigators will combine           recent advances in laser methods for detection and characterization of          molecules formed in crossed-molecular-beam reactions with techniques            which prepare the reacting species in selected rotational and                   vibrational states.  In addition, directional properties such as the            dependence of the reactivity on the orientation of the reactants (the           so-called steric effect), which provide intimate details on how a               chemical reaction proceeds, will be emphasized.                                                                                                                 Dr. Parker has considerable experience in applying the technique of             laser ionization to detect reaction products in flames, supersonic              expansions, and other challenging environments.  By carefully selecting         the frequency of the laser light used in probing for reaction products,         he can also determine the specific energy level or levels those product         species are in.  Professor Stolte, in Nijmegen, leads a research group          that has developed elegant methods for producing beams of molecules in          selected orientations and energy states, allowing them to react with            various other species, and detecting the products as well as the                alignment of product chemiluminescence when it occurs.  By cooperating          in a detailed study of a few carefully selected reactions, the two              scientists expect to enhance current knowledge of molecular reaction            dynamics, and in particular to gain a better understanding of how a             chemical reaction takes place on the most basic level.  Funds from this         award will support necessary transportation and subsistence expenses for        the U.S. principal investigator.  The government of The Netherlands,            through the Catholic University Nijmegen, is also providing support for         the project.",
