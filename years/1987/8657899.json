 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is to provide research support for Dr. Lyle Ungar                    under the National Science Foundation's Presidential Young                      Investigator Awards program.                                                                                                                                    Dr. Ungar's research is in two areas: (1) the application of                    artificial intelligence techniques to automate reasoning about                  chemical plants and (2) the modelling of transport in systems                   with moving boundaries and phase transformations.                                                                                                               In (1), the area of design and control, he is writing                           knowledge-based expert systems which use causal models and                      first principles to gain a \"deep\" understanding of plant                        behavior which is applicable to a broad class of processes and                  problems.  The underlying reason for this work is that to be as                 useful and reliable as possible, expert systems should be able                  to work from descriptions of processes such as flow sheets, and                 not need extensive customization for each new process.  As part                 of this project the PI is developing an expert multivariable                    controller which diagnoses process malfunctions and makes                       appropriate structural changes to the controller structure,                     control algorithms and control parameters in order to acheive                   as tight control of the process as possible.  He is working on                  isolating as much plant-independent knowledge about equipment                   and control algorithms as possible and on formalizing notions                   of causality used by engineers i~ design and trouble shooting.                                                                                                  In (2), the area of transport through multiphase media, he is                   using analytical and finite element based perturbation methods                  to characterize the effect of solidification conditions on                      melt/solid interface shape and solute segregation and, in                       particular, to map out the transitions between interfaces of                    different morphology.  A detailed understanding of the                          solidification process is important for a variety of emerging                   techniques in electronic materials processing.  Pulsed laser                    annealing is one of these techniques.  Pulsed lasers can be                     used to rapidly melt thin layers (<1 micron) of semiconductors                  and metals which resolidify at rates of up to several meters                    per second.  At these velocities - some 10  times normal                        crystal growth rates, the melt/solid interface is no longer at                  equilibrium and dopant segregation is radically altered.                        Defects can be removed and nonequilibrium (metastable) alloys                   formed.  However, nonuniform solute segregation often limits                    the usefulness of the alloys.  He is incorporating results from                 atomic scale modelling of rapid solidification into macroscopic                 transport models, and studying the resulting growth                             morphologies.",
