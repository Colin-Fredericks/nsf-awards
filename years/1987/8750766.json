The equipment will provide students the                opportunity for \"hands on\" research experience in upper level                   departmental courses.  The workshop will concentrate on macroeconomic           model building with an emphasis on the HOWS II model, an econometric            model of the U.S. economy developed in a macro policy workshop over the         past few years.  The workshop will be located in a specific space on            campus and used exclusively by students and faculty involved in upper           level economics courses with an emphasis on research oriented and/or            model building efforts.  The project will support the acquisition of            computer equipment for use in the macroeconomic workshop that will              continue through the entire academic year and extend through the summer         months with a student/faculty research emphasis.",
