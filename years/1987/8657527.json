The focus of this research is on cryptography and                  computational number theory.                                                                                                                                    During the decade of the eighties cryptography was developed into a             formal discipline in which notions such as \"one-way function\" and               \"proving that a protocol is correct\" have a precise yet natural                 meaning. Rigor was accomplished by concrete proposals which were shown          to comply with the new complexity standards under a few complexity              assumptions.  Unfortunately, the complexity assumptions made, for               example the existence of one-way functions, are likely to remain                unproven for quite a while longer.  This situation provides motivation          for establishing a new foundation for cryptography.  Instead of making          intractability assumptions about functions, physical assumptions about          the model in which cryptography is being done (for example the kind of          channel or layout used for communication by the network participants)           are being made.    Unconditionally secure communication protocols for           the new model are sought. Results already achieved that involve proof-          systems with a \"distributed\" prover may have applications to fault              tolerant distributed computing.  Such applications are being explored.                                                                                                                                                                          Work is continuing on interactive proof systems.  Using tools developed         in this area an attempt is being made to clarify the complexity of              previously unclassified optimization problems.  Work in computational           number theory is also continuing.  Simpler and faster algorithms for            primality testing and other algebraic computations are sought.                                                                                                  The P.I. has been judged to be an outstanding computer scientist by the         Presidential Young Investigator Panel.",
