 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a request for funds to help support the 1987               Northeast Regional Conference on Developmental Biology.  The Conference         will be held at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole,                   Massachusetts, September 24-27, 1987.  The goal of the Conference is to         bring together developmental biologists from the Northeast to present           their work in formal sessions and informal discussions.  A special effort       is being made to bring together investigators at all career stages:             graduate students to established investigators.  The conference will            include 5-6 platform sessions, a poster session and a keynote address.              The purpose of the conference is to provide an effective opportunity        for the formal and informal exchange of information and ideas between           established investigators and graduate or postdoctoral students.  This          goal is achieved much more readily at the regional conferences than at          national meetings primarily because the regional conferences are smaller,       less rigidly scheduled, and allow ample time and occasion for                   discussions.",
