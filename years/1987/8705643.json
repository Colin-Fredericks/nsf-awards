 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives and Relevancy:  This project supports the particiation of a          U.S. delegation of 10 scientists in meetings in India related to                geotechnical research.  Specifically, the team will attend a                    standardization committee meeting in New Delhi, to be followed by the           6th International Conference on Expansive Soils to be held December             1-3, 1987, and attend an Indo-U.S. workshop on geotechnical engineering         perspectives on Dec.4th, then visit construction sites in southern              India and attend a one-day technical deliberation on the practices              observed.  It is hoped that these activities will help develop the use          of science and engineering knowledge to mitigate the damage that                results from expansive soils in India and the U.S.  The U.S.-India              program supports participation of scientists from the U.S. in important         international meetings in India as is the case in this project.                                                                                                 Merit:  The conference deals with a very important topic for the U.S.           and India.  The proposed extensive activities within this project are           quite appropriate and useful for the scientists from the two countries.         There is potential benefit in the experiences to be gained, in reducing         the structural damage, through the interaction with participants from           India and other countries.  The selection procedure of U.S.                     participants is planned to lead to a strong delegation.                                                                                                         Funding:  None other than this action.",
