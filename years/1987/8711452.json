 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research project is aimed at developing a nonintrusive             technique to measure the cross sectional average catalyst temperature           at each axial position of an operating packed bed reactor.  The PI's            ultimate goal is to develop a method to measure the catalyst                    temperature at each point in a reactor and thus develop an                      experimentally validated heterogeneous reactor model.                                                                                                           The overall objective of catalytic reactor model development is                 reliable design.  To reliably predict performance over a range of               operating conditions, the model must predict the correct temperature            and concentrations at each point in the reactor.  More precisely, the           model needs to predict the catalyst phase temperature and reactant              concentrations in the catalyst phase throughout the bed.                                                                                                        The PI began work on his magnetic method to measure catalyst                    temperature in a packed bed under an initiation grant.  In the                  proposed work he will move the bed into an AC permeameter sensing               coil, determine the incremental voltage due to each axial position,             and thus calculate the average axial temperature.  Measurement of               radial and/or intraparticle temperature gradients will not be                   attempted at this time.  When applicable to a given catalyst/reaction           system, the method could be used directly in kinetic and transport              parameter estimation, reactor control and reactor performance                   evaluation.",
