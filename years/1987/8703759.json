 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current understanding of the chemistry of the lower atmosphere              indicates that a wide variety of biological and geological processes            are responsible for the release of gaseous emissions from the earth's           surface into the atmosphere.  These emissions have a major impact on            the chemical composition of the atmosphere and therefore, on the                overall quality of the planetary life-support system.  The vast                 majority of the trace gases emitted into the atmosphere are in                  chemically reduced oxidation states.  By contrast, materials returned           to the surface from the atmosphere, via rain or dry deposition, are             highly oxidized.  The link between these reduced and oxidized species           is provided by atmospheric photochemical reactions.  Thus, a chemical           cycle is set up by which reduced gases are emitted into the                     atmosphere photochemically oxidized and finally removed from the                atmosphere.                                                                         This project is the initiation of a research/training program at            Atlanta University Center (WUC) in the rapidly growing field of                 atmospheric chemistry.  The program will have as its research focus,            \"A Study of Chemical Trends and Processes as Related to Photochemical           Oxidants.\"  During the next three years the photochemical species of            primary interest will be O3, H2O2 (aqueous phase) and H2O2 (gas                 phase).  To date there have been no systematic investigations                   reported in the literature showing diurnal or longer term                       correlations between these three key photochemical oxidants.  In the            short term, this new data base should also help elucidate the                   transformation rates of such environmentally important species as               SO2, particularly as it relates to aqueous phase oxidation                      processes.  In the long term this data base should also prove quite             informative in efforts to explore correlative relationships between             photochemical oxidant levels and damage to biologically sensitive               plant communities.                                                                  This project also has as a primary objective in the development             of a minority oriented training/educational program that will                   contribute significantly to the number of qualified Black scientists            entering the field of chemistry.",
