 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been shown that by increasing the temperature of tumors and              cancerous tissue, their growth rate decreases and the abnormal tissue           can even be killed.  The problem arises as to the best means to increase        the temperature of an abnormal internal tissue without damaging the             surrounding normal tissue.  One can focus electromagnetic radiation             which has a sufficiently low frequency that it will heat the tissue, but        will not ionize the tissue molecules.  Micro-waves and infra-red rays           are examples of non-ionizing radiation.  The material interactions              between the radiation and the body are very important and complex.              Thus, it is necessary  for an engineer to solve some rather difficult           differential equations in order to properly predict the best manner of          focusing the radiation.  This research will seek to use a mathematical          approach to optimize the means of focusing non-ionizing radiation.",
