 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is continuing and expanding an effort, begun several years         ago, to provide maintenance and repair service for chemical                     instrumentation at undergraduate institutions in the southeast. The             service is provided by trained electronic personnel working from a              mobile van outfitted as an electronics shop, and includes repair,               maintenance, calibration, and consultative instruction among the                offerings available. In the history of operation to date, 84                    undergraduate institutions in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina,        South Carolina and Tennessee have been involved and over 3000                   instruments have been serviced and calibrated. It is anticipated that 50        colleges and universities and over 5000 students will be affected each          year by this project. Institutions served include a number of colleges          for minorities and women.",
