 "awd_abstract_narration": "This middle school mathematics and science preservice teacher education         program builds on existing secondary and elementary teacher education           programs.  Certification with middle school science or mathematic               endorsements will be possible at either the elementary or secondary             level.                                                                                                                                                          At the elementary level, 36 semester hours of science or 27 semester            hours of mathematics courses will be required.  This will be                    accomplished by redirecting up to 20 semester hours from education              courses to science and mathematics content courses.  At the secondary           level, 20 of the 52 semester hours of science content courses will be           specific to the middle school, in addition to two specially designed            psychology courses.  Other specially designed program elements will             include: laboratory sections for existing science courses; three                capstone courses in earth, biological, and physical sciences; companion         methodology courses coupled with appropriately placed field experiences,        a mentor teacher system, and informal learning activities incorporating         applied mathematics and science concepts from \"the real world\" developed        for the new programs.  A special mathematics modeling and a mathematics         history course will be developed to be used in both mathematics tracks.         In all, fifteen new courses will be developed:  3 in science, 2 in              mathematics, 2 in psychology , 2 in methods, and 6 for field                    experiences.  The project takes advantage of an existing Entry-Year             Assistance Program in Oklahoma to provide support to graduates during           their first year and feed back to the university on the effectiveness of        the new programs.                                                                                                                                               The project director, a science educator is joined by an applied                mathematician and an inorganic chemist, these two people will serve as          co-directors.  The project staff draws heavily from the disciplinary            departments of the university and local school systems.",
