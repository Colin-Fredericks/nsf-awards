 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports continued use of the 0.6 meter telescope on                 the campus of Wesleyan University to monitor stars that appear to               have starspots and other activity.  Observations in the light of                hydrogen-alpha will be improved to the point where even the                     normally active, Sun-like stars can be monitored.  The                          observations will be extended to activity on cooler stars by                    monitoring the calcium infrared triplet lines.                                                                                                                  Stars with large spots change their brightness as they rotate the               spots into and out of our view.  Thus measurements of brightness                changes inform us directly of the rate at which the stars rotate.               A knowledge of stellar rotation is valuable because rotation is a               major cause for starspots and other activity similar to solar                   activity.  This program has emphasized observations of very young               stars, especially the star T Tauri and other members of the T                   Tauri class, because these show very strong activity.  The Sun                  may once have been similarly active.",
