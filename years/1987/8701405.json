 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will continue their studies over the last several         years of pattern formation in biological systems and the behavior of            nonlinear equations in fluid mechanics.  Their joint work includes              extending a recent theorem which proves the existence of oscillatory            solutions in an inhomogeneous reaction diffusion equation.  They will           also extend their recent studies of a fourth order nonlinear                    differential equation which arises in boundary layer theory in fluid            mechanics.                                                                          Professor Ermentrout will continue his joint research work with             Professor Nancy Kopell of Boston University on the behavior of                  aggregates of coupled oscillators.  He will also continue his joint             research work on molluscan pigmentation patterns with Professor George          Oster of University of California at Berkeley and work on fungal growth         with Professor Leah Edelstein of Duke University.                                   Professor Troy will extend his recent investigations of a reaction          diffusion equation arising in chemical reactor and combustion theory.           Depending on the values of physical parameters in the model, the                solutions exhibit a variety of possible behavior ranging from finite            time \"blow-up\" to finite time \"extinction\".  He will continue his               investigations of the behavior of self similar solutions which are used         in analyzing the asymptotics of both the blow-up and extinction                 processes.                                                                          This research falls into the general area of applied mathematical           analysis, with potential applications to chemistry and biology.",
