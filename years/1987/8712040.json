 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physiological regulators of behavior are complex and change in an           age-dependent manner.  It is well known that behaviors directed by              specific areas of the brain can be recovered following lesions in young         animals.  However, this ability of the brain that allows for recovery of        function is lost as the animal matures.  Little is understood regarding         the biological mechanisms underlying this ability to compensate for             damages to the brain in the young animal.  However, it is known that            these adaptations require compensational changes in the neural                  mechanisms and neurochemical systems that regulate behavior.                                                                                                    This research is important because it will provide essential information        about the neurochemical bases of behavior and the dynamics of this              regulatory system with age.  A wide variety of sensory-motor tests will         be used to ascertain the behavioral effects of specific lesions.  The           contributions of specific neurochemical systems to the specific                 behaviors will be determined.  Through an approach that considers               ontogenetic changes in response as well as the neurochemical systems            involved, an in depth understanding will be gained in the neurochemical         regulation of behavior.",
