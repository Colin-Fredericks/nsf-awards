 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator Award includes research in                 structural engineering and reliability.  Research includes computer-            based reliability analysis with special emphasis on systems with                nonlinear dynamic response and hierarchical damage states,                      development of a hybrid reliability approach applied to seismic                 response and fatigue crack growth.  The traditional approach to such            problems is not applicable since explicit relationships between                 loading and response parameters are not available.  For complicated             load and response models such as nonstationary ground acceleration              and seismic damage, an explicit relationship does not exist.                    Complete simulation to establish the reliability in such cases is               impractical due to the number of random variables involved.                     Through such studies, an attempt will be made to integrate simulation           and advanced reliability methods to solve multidimensional,                     nonstationary, nonlinear, time-dependent reliability problems.                  Methods developed will have an impact on many areas in structural               engineering including the design of buildings for wind and seismic              effects, design and development of offshore structures, aeronautical            and space structure design and nuclear plant design.",
