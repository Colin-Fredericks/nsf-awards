 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heat transport under a large temperature gradient is a topic of much            current interest. In order to develop methods for removing implantation         damage in ion-implanted materials and, also, to produce metastable              compounds and supersaturated alloys, it is important to achieve rapid           melting and subsequent recrystallization of semiconductor materials.            As heat flows in the solid phase, temperature profiles varying as much          as 10 degrees per centimeter are not unusual.  Under a large enough             temperature gradient, heat conduction becomes anomalous, particularly           near solid-liquid interfaces.  The phenomenon is not yet fully                  understood but it is known that thermal conduction at high temperatures         in semiconductors involves several processes, including some highly             non-linear ones, that may contribute to the anomalous case.                                                                                                     In this research project, Professor Gerald Mahan, in collaboration with         Professor Francisco Claro of the Catholic University of Chile plans to          investigate the trapping of carriers by a thermally induced                     gap-narrowing near the solid-melt interface in silicon and germanium.           The band narrowing produces a confining potential that should be                helpful in developing a theory of heat transport by electrons and               electron-hole pairs.  Additionally, the investigators are interested in         the threshold for suppression of thermal conduction by temperature              gradients, and in obtaining the space profile under steady heat flow            near solid-melt interfaces.  The combination of Professor Mahan's               expertise with semiconductors and with nonlinear transport theory, with         Professor Claro's complementary background in thermal transport                 techniques, creates a highly qualified team for addressing this complex         and significant research.  The mutual benefits of this collaboration            fulfill an important criterion of the Science in Developing Countries           Program.",
