 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a recommendation for an award to support research on                    biodegradation of pollutants that have contaminated soil in the vicinity        of states where coal tar residues have been buried.  Coal tar is a by-          product of a process used to produce coke and \"manufactured\" gas.               Estimates are that there are over 1500 sites in the United States where         these residue were produced and buried.  This research will address the         possibility of biologically degrading compounds that each from these            buried deposits and reduce their polutional potential with respect to           groundwater.                                                                                                                                                    The proposal leading to this recommendation was submitted in accord with        NSF 86-I9, Small Business Innovation Research.  This proposed work has          objectives consistent with those of the Propam in Environmental                 Engineering and the investigators have qualifications appropriate for           the work to be done.                                                                                                                                            Award is recommended in the amount of S4O,OOO for six months starting           on February 1, 1987.  This will be for Phase I as described in NSF 86-          19.",
