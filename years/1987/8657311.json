 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support to Prof. Nariman Farvardin under the                Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) program.  His                research currently centers on the design and analysis of efficient and          easily instrumentable data compression schemes for application to real-         world sources.  This work spans the range from stochastic modeling              through detailed bounding and analysis, all the way to complexity               analysis and VLSI design.                                                       The PYI Awards program provides research support to the Nation's most           outstanding and promising young science and engineering faculty.  The           awards are intended to improve the capability of U. S. academic                 institutions to respond to the demand for highly qualified science and          engineering personnel for academic and industrial research and                  engineering.  This PYI has made significant contributions to his field          of engineering and has potential to become a leader in academic research        and education. The diary note describes the rigorous selection                  procedure.  A grant award is highly recommended.  Dr. Farvardin has             obtained the maximum matching funds, so an award of $62500 is thus              recommended.",
