 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the geochemistryof mantle-derived, spinel                    peridotite xenoliths from localities in the Basin and Range                     Province and the adjacent Colorado Plateau, as well as the                      transition zone between the two provinces.  The heart of the                    study is the anlysis and modelling of the REE and Sr and Nd                     isotopic compositions of clinopyroxene seperated from the bulk                  peridotites, but xenolith population systematics and mineral                    composition will be investigated and will be particularly                       important in choosing representative samples for study.  In                     addition to standard analytical techniques, secondary ion mass                  spectrometry will be utilized to measure relative REE abundances                in single cpx grains.                                                           Present-day mantle composition beneath the two tectonic provinces               will be characterized and for each locality a model will be                     developed.  This will include observed heterogeneity (or homogeneity)           and where possible, the inferred age and nature of fractionation                events.  Ultimately models for all localities will be integrated                to provide a regional model for the systematic variation of                     mantle composition as it relates to large-scale crustal                         tectonism.",
