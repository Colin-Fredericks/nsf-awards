 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish an inservice program to incorporate human           genetics into the elementary school curriculum.  During the summer of           1987 two five day Peer Leadership Workshops, one for thirty-five                elementary teachers and one for thirty-five secondary teachers, will be         held in each of two regions in Kansas.  The participants will receive           instruction in human and medical genetics including information                 concerning genetic engineering.  In addition to basic content the               participants will also develop the methodology of examining and                 conducting student discussions of controversial issues such as:  gene           therapy, recombinant DNA, genetic screening, and genetic counseling.            The laboratory work will provide experiences with the BSCS materials and        with recombinant DNA technology.                                                                                                                                During academic year 1987-88 the staff members will work with the Peer          Leadership Teachers in their classrooms to insure mastery of the                materials and the ability to successfully utilize the materials.  In the        spring of 1987-88 the seventy teachers from each of the two regions will        attend a two day workshop to be held in each region.  This workshop will        conclude the formal preparation of the Peer Teachers to present                 inservice programs to their peers.  During the 1988-89 school year, the         thirty-five elementary teachers and the thirty-five secondary teachers          of each region will implement the inservice program by using the                materials and the content videotapes produced during the first year of          the program.                                                                                                                                                    Two hours of credit will be awarded upon successful completion of the           Peer Leadership program.                                                                                                                                        The project will be coordinated and directed by geneticists from the            Medical Genetics Division Department of Medicine, University of Kansas          Medical Center.  The staff consists of R. Neil Schimke, clinical                geneticist, Debra L. Collins and Laura L. Thomson, genetic counselors,          three master teachers (including two Presidential Awardees'), and               lecturers from the other universities in the state.  The various                university divisions, support agencies and school districts have made           substantial contributions to the program.",
