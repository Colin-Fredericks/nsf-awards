 "awd_abstract_narration": "Control categories provide a first-order framework for the denotational         semantics of control structures in which programs are represented by            algebraic expressions. The main innovation is the emphasis of an                axiomatized case statement in terms of which program simplification has         points in common with the manipulation of linear combinations in                noncommutative ring theory.  Assertion semantics is deduced and the             Dijkstra composition rule is equivalent to determinism.  Under                  development is a theory of canonical form based on algebraic reduction,         matrix similarity invariants and equational and first-order                     characterization.                                                                                                                                               The thesis is that lines of attack familiar to algebraists find new             applications in theoretical computer science.  Module-theoretic ideas           applied to a simplified model express conditional statements in terms           of guard action, leading to a canonical form expressed as a linear              combination.  A first-order axiomatization of iteration discovered with         Arbib in 1978 emphasizes how iteration transforms and this leads to a           proposed transformation theory analogous to techniques used to solve            linear differential equations.                                                                                                                                  The P.I. is a highly respected contributor to mathematical aspects of           computer science.  The proposed work is expected to make a useful               contribution to computer science especially as it expands the                   understanding of the concept of control categories as introduced                recently by the P.I.
