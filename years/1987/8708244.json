 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this project are to define the thermal history, direction,         sense and timing of motion(s) on potential terrane-bounding faults in           the northern Appalachians.  The regional geology is reasonably well             known with the exception of fault motions.  The fault system to be              studied marks the western boundary of the Avalon zone in southeastern           New England and may be a segment of a fault system which spans the              northern Appalachians. Although the faults have been proposed as marking        a Permian collisional suture, preliminary results suggest that various          segments have experience different motion histories.  The entire system         of faults may have experienced Silurian (430-400 Ma.) left-lateral              motion with a thrust component and some segments were reactivated in            Permian time as low-angle normal faults.  Additional work is required to        define the motion histories of fault segments not yet studied, to               establish relationships between segments with different motion                  histories, to investigate possible relationships between fault motion           and deformation in isolated occurrences of Pennsylvanian metasedimetary         rocks and to integrate these results with the regional geology.                 Techniques to be used will be standard detailed structural analysis in          the field and microstructural analysis on oriented thin sections.               Thermal histories will be established by characterization of temperature        dependent microstrutures corroborated by phase equilibria where                 applicable.  Timing of motions will be established by structural                analysis of dated igneous rocks.  Student involvement will take the form        of two undergraduate field assistants for each of the two field seasons         and several \"senior honors theses\".  Results are expected to help               constrain the tectonic history of some of the terranes in New England.",
