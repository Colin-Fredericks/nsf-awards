 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optical bistability, as the name implies, involves phenomena which can          have two states which are stable.  The common example is a thin semi-           conductor which transmits nearly all of a light beam impinging upon it,         or nearly none at all; depending upon the range of intensity of this            impinging light beam.  The transmission switches from low to high at a          particular intensity (or small range).  In addition, once switched, it          tends to stay high (high transmission) even though the intensity of the         impinent beam is brought below the particular switching intensity               referred to just above.  It will subsequently switch to a low                   transmission state but with a switching intensity less than that                referred to for the switch from low to high.  Obviously these two state         devices are fascinating from both a fundamental viewpoint and from a            practical viewpoint (the low is 0 and the high is 1 for a computer).            Since they have historical predecessors which operate totally on                electrical principles, they have been analyzed, considered for                  computation, and so on.  These previous analysis present a pessimistic          view for applications to computation.                                                                                                                           However, the optical situation is different in several respects - the           nature of the signal, the way the material interacts, and some of the           fundamental chaotic behavior.  Because of this there is considerable            controversy and the field of optical bistability continues to generate          new and exciting results and approaches.  This conference will bring            together experts worldwide and should prove to be exciting and important        for this rapidly changing field.",
