 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Philippine Fault, an active, left-lateral strike-slip fault,                transects almost the entire length of the Philippine Archipelago.  It is        one of several major strike-slip fault systems worldwide that occur at          obliquely converging intra-oceanic plate boundaries.  This and a                collaborative project (EAR87-07345) will study the genesis and                  emplacement of metamorphic rocks that occur along the fault.  Some of           these metamorphic rocks-- greenschist-facies metavolcanics, amphibolites        and serpentinites-- may be created at convergent suture zones, but we           will test the hypothesis that at least some of them were generated              entirely as a result of strike-slip related processes.  We will use             structural, geochronological and geochemical techniques to determine if         the deformational and metamorphic history of metamorphic rocks is               consistent with their creation along the Philippine Fault, rather than          by collisional process.  The common occurrence of major strick-slip             faults at modern obliquely converging margins suggest that similar              structures should occur as terrane boundaries in ancient active margin          assemblages, but few such structures have been recognized.  This may be         because many petrologic and structural associations common to both              convergent and strike-slip \"sutures\" are generally believed to be               associated only with the former. By studying the origin of metamorphic          rocks along an active strike-slip fault that also acts to juxtapose             disparate terranes in the Philippines, we hope to establish a framework         for recognizing such structures in old arc terranes.",
