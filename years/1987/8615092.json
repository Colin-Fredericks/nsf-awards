 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a lightwave communications system imparting information on a                 lightbeam and transmitting it, for instance through a fiber, is                 one aspect.  A second and equally important aspect is the                       extraction of the information at the receiving end.  This must be               done so as to have little distortion in the reproduction of the                 original information.  Of importance in doing this is increasing                the strength of (amplifying) the received signal after it has                   been converted from light back to an electrical signal.                         Otherwise the overall signal strength would be too feeble to                    complete with random electrical signals (noise) contributed from                the overall receiving process.                                                                                                                                  A second approach would be to amplify the incoming optical signal               rather than the converted electrical signal, however, for the                   moment at least it appears more favorable to amplify                            electrically.  The reason is two-fold:  inherent noise added in                 the amplification process, and the amplification magnitude that                 can be produced.  On both accounts, electrical amplification is                 superior up to the present.                                                                                                                                     The present proposal deals with the important aspects of                        electrical amplification of optical information with a minimum of               accompanying noise.  New artificially taylored electronic                       materials promise to provide better performance than more                       conventional natural materials.  Understanding the noise                        generation, the materials design, and amplification processes are               crucial and are the central topics of the present effort.",
