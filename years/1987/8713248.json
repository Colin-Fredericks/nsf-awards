 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current research on immigrants' social, cultural, and economic                  adjustments have been dominated by theories that were developed                 in studies of immigrants more than 50 years ago. However, there                 are potentially important differences both in immigrants and in                 their host countries that utilization of these theories tends to                overlook.  Specifically, current immigrants tend to be from                     third world rather than European countries, and current                         immigrants can receive welfare and assistance benefits that were                not available to earlier immigrants.                                                                                                                            This study will examine Indochinese refugees in France and the                  United States.  The Indochinese experience is generalizable to                  many other third world refugees and the two nation comparison                   will highlight the role of governmental policies toward                         immigrants.  Data for the analyses will be obtained from personal               interviews, fieldwork, and the analysis of archival records in                  both France and the United States.",
