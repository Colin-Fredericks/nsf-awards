 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rolls used in the rolling of steel, even if undamaged by                    catastrophic fracture or other major failure, must be changed                   frequently because of wear and spalling.  Proper cooling appears                to have a significant effect on roll life, but there is very                    little definitive information about the why and how.  The                       proposed study is aimed at providing a basic understanding of the               influence of roll cooling on the thermal and mechanical responses               of rolls.  Alternative cooling practices will be sought for                     reducing roll wear and spalling caused by thermal failure stress.                                                                                               A laboratory apparatus has been developed at Drexel University                  which models the cooled rolls used in steel mills.  The apparatus               will be heavily instrumented to determine the heat transfer                     coefficient between the roll surface and the water spray which                  serves as a coolant.  The thermal information will be used as                   input to a numerical model for determining the stress field in                  the roll.",
