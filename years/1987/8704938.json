 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experiments which utilize two complementary scattering                  techniques will be used to address a variety of problems of                     current interest in surface physics.  These include:  1) the                    study of novel structures in molecular monolayers and the                       determination of the interactions which stabilize them; 2) the                  nature of collective vibrational excitations in quasi two-                      dimensional (2D) molecular solids; and 3) the study of phase                    transitions in adsorbed monolayers which either do not occur in                 bulk or which may be more tractable theoretically in 2D.  The                   experiments will employ inelastic neutron scattering to                         investigate film dynamics and both elastic neutron diffraction                  and synchrotron x-ray scattering to probe film structure.  In                   designing the experiments, considerable effort has been made to                 match the probe to the system of interest and to utilize the best               facilities available in the United States.  The latter include a                neutron diffractometer equipped with a multidetector-data                       acquisition system at the University of Missouri Research Reactor               Facility, state-of-the-art triple-axis spectrometers at                         Brookhaven National Laboratory, and a specially designed ultra-                 high vacuum sample chamber to be used at the x-ray beamline at                  the National Synchrotron Light Source.  Of particular interest                  will be to apply this combination of probes to adsorbed                         hydrocarbon whose monolayer structure is crucial to a fundamental               understanding of catalysis, lubrication and adhesion.",
