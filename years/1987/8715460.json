 "awd_abstract_narration": "The diffusive and adsorptive properties of water vapor and                      organic compounds on highly silicious zeolites will be                          determined by a gravimetric technique and a well-stirred                        reactor.  The primary objective is to obtain adsorption and                     diffusion data as a function of Si/Al ratios for both single                    component and multicomponent systems to gain fundamental                        understanding of adsorption and diffusion in zeolites.                          Furthermore, competitive adsorption from gaseous mixtures will                  be investigated with water vapor as an important variable.                                                                                                      The current gravimetric system is unique in that the system                     pressure, the sample temperature and the sample weight change                   can be monitored simultaneously during the entire sorption                      process.  This unique feature allows one to examine the                         temperature effect on sorption.  More important is the fact                     that this feature makes it possible to differentiate the                        thermal effects from other factors by keeping the temperature                   rise at a minimum.  Also unique to the well-stirred system is                   the capability to investigate the displacement phenomena                        resulting from competitive adsorption which is important in                     practical adsorption applications.",
