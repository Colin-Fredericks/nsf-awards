 "awd_abstract_narration": "Construction site layout is widely acknowledged to have a substantial           impact on efficiency by affecting the travel time of workers,                   transportation of materials and equipment around a jobsite, and by its          potential impact on workes safety.  Yet formal design approaches for            site layout exist only in a few specific sub-areas, e.g., crane                 selection.  Publications which address the overall site layout problem          tend to offer, at best, empirical guidelines for designing an efficient         layout.                                                                                                                                                         Knowledge-based systems have achieved levels of performance comparable          to that of human experts for problems of diagnosis or selection in              several domains.  However, expert systems for planning or design tasks          are far more difficult to construct and have achieved only modest levels        of performance to date.  In addition to the generic challenges                  associated with developing expert systems for design tasks, an expert           system for construction site layout raises a number of specific research        issues including:  integration of multiple knowledge sources,spacial            reasoning and temporal reasoning.                                                                                                                               To address these issues, the BB1 blackboard architecture will be used.          This was specifically designed to employ and mediate between multiple           knowledge sources in expert systems, and which has been extended in an          ongoing research project to address the problems of spatial reasoning.                                                                                          The proposed research has the potential to advance the practice of              construction engineering, and to contribute to the development of expert        systems for spatial layout in a number of domains.",
