 "awd_abstract_narration": "Males in many animal species exhibit discontinuous                      variationin their reproductive behavior or adult body form.  The                geneticbasis, if any, for differences among males in such species               isunknown.  Moreover, the mechanisms maintaining different                      maletypes in a single population are poorly understood.                         \u001aParacerceis\u001a\u001asculpta\u001a is a marine isopod crustacean that                       exhibits threedistinct adult male types.  Dr. Sassaman's research               combinestechniques in behavioral ecology and biochemical genetics               to (1)identify the hereditary, behavioral and social                            mechanismsmaintaining the three male types in the population, and               (2) todetermine the nature of genetic differences among males.                  Usingenzymes as genetic markers, Dr. Sassaman will conduct                      paternityanalyses of young produced in the field.  By monitoring                changesin success among different males types, Dr. Sassman will                 measurehow relative male reproductive success varies over time.                 He willalso conduct specific crosses among lines to determine                   whether afew or many genes determine male body form.  A simple                  geneticmechanism could itself determine a polymorphism, while a                 morecomplex mode of inheritance could indicate that male body                   type issubstantially influenced by local conditions.",
