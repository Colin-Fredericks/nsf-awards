 "awd_abstract_narration": "Liquefaction of saturated sands and silty sands during seismic events           has been responsible for many failures of civil engineering structures,         resulting in high costs both in loss of life and property.  In light of         this, geotechnical engineers have investigated methods to evaluate the          liquefaction potential of soil deposits.  These studies have primarily          focused on sands, as compared to silts and silty sands, although the            latter materials are known to liquefy.                                                                                                                          Because of the variability and lack of repeatability often found in             standard penetration test results, there has been a growing move toward         other types of in situ tests for the evaluation of liquefaction                 potential.  One of the most promising tools is the cone penetrometer.  A        major void in the state of knowledge for liquefaction evaluation of             potential sites is the use of the cone penetrometer for assessing silty         sand sites.                                                                                                                                                     This research program will investigate the use of a cone penetrometer in        the evaluation of the liquefaction potential of sands and silty sands           using both laboratory tests and calibration chamber tests.  The work            will be broken into two phases, with the first dealing with the issue of        effects of fines, per se, on penetration resistance.  The second will           involve saturated silty sands.                                                                                                                                  The senior principal investigator is internationally recognized for his         research into the liquefaction of soils.  The junior principal                  investigator is starting his career and displays the talent and aptitude        necessary to contribute strongly to this project.  Together they are            highly qualified to undertake the research proposed, and they have              available the necessary institutional facilities.                                                                                                               This research program is very likely to make a significant contribution         to determining in-situ the liquefaction potential of silty sands.",
