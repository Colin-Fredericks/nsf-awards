 "awd_abstract_narration": "The infrared spectrum of the sun, observed through the earth's                  atmosphere, affords a wealth of information about atmospheric trace             gases, their identities, and their amounts in the whole atmosphere when         observed from ground level.  The information comes in the form of               individual spectrum line positions (wavelengths) in the solar spectrum,         and in the intensity with which any given spectral line is absorbed from        the background of the solar spectrum.  Each spectrum line is a signature        of some molecular or atomic species.  By sensitive ground-based, or             balloon-borne, spectroscopic instrumentation it is thus possible to             survey the atmosphere for trace levels of gases of natural or man-made          origin, and to observe changes over time.                                                                                                                       By using spectroscopic instruments of very high resolution, it is               possible to observe hundreds of spectral lines representing various             atmospheric trace gases, but to do this requires a detailed catalogue of        precise wavelengths of the various gases present in the atmosphere, and         of the solar spectrum itself as seen through the atmosphere.  This grant        supports an extension of research done under grants ATM-8315647 and             ATM-8609286. It continues the analysis and cataloguing of spectroscopic         data gathered in those earlier grants and, in its second and third              years, further laboratory measurements to produce new high-resolution           spectra of individual trace gases of atmospheric interest, including            gases believed to affect the stratospheric ozone layer.  These new data         will also be analyzed and catalogued.  Theoretical analyses of the              complex molecular spectra will be made as an aid to identification and          interpretation.  This activity, while not in itself yielding new                insights into physical and chemical science, yet builds an indispensible        reference tool on which more probing investigations can proceed.  The           atlas of solar infrared spectra being developed under this grant is             useful to all scientists working on the infrared spectroscopy of the sun        and of the earth's atmosphere.                                                                                                                                  The work will be done in a laboratory equipped with state-of-the-art            spectroscopic instrumentation.  This research group enjoys an                   international reputation for its role in advancing the application of           high-resolution spectroscopy to studies of atmospheric composition.",
