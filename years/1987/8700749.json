 "awd_abstract_narration": "While the current supremacy of U.S. technology in computers,               computer graphics and computational machines is clear, these                    technologies are not being adequately exploited in support of                   mechanical systems and designs.  Major developments have occurred               in these areas but vendors of computer aided design and                         engineering are just beginning to include support for some                      specialized analysis of mechanical system simulation and design.                The potential that exists for large scale interdisciplinary                     simulation and design optimization support to mechanical system                 design is virtually untapped.  Research bringing the many                       disciplines together to focus and develop this technology could                 benefit industry significantly.  An Industry/University                         Cooperative Research Center may be an approach to accomplish this               objective.  This planning grant is studying the feasibility and                 viability of an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on              Simulation and Design Optimization of Mechanical Systems at the                 University of Iowa.                                                                  The project is studying alternative organizations,                         operations, and policies for an Industry/University Cooperative                 Research Center on Simulation and Design Optimization of                        Mechanical Systems.  The study is also determining industrial                   research interests and those interest that a university could                   address.                                                                             The principal Investigator and his colleagues are nationally               recognized experts that have the industrial contacts necessary to               conduct this study.                                                                  The project has been coordinated with Dr. Alan de Pennington,              DMCE, and Dr. Elbert Marsh, MSME, in the Engineering Directorate.                    The Program Manager recommends a grant of $50,000 be awarded               to the University of Iowa for one (1) year for this project.  The               U.S. Army Tank Automotive Technology Directorate is providing half              of the funds for this project.",
