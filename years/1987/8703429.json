 "awd_abstract_narration": "Richard McGehee proposes to carry out research on two                      topics. These involve the application of the theory of dynamical                systems to digital circuits and a study of the dynamical systems                on finite state spaces which arise from approximations of                       continuous systems. Richard Moeckel's work will be concerned with               an investigation of collisions and of rejection to infinity in                  the three body problem, a study of central configurations in the                n-body problem, and an investigation of normal forms near                       elliptic fixed points of mechanical systems.                                         The research on finite approximation of continuous dynamical               systems recognises the fact that computer experiments can                       necessarily only reveal approximations of the original continuous               system. The focus of attention will be on questions asking                      whether the properties of attractors of the original system are                 faithfully exhibited on the video screen. McGehee's other project               is to study the mathematical idealizations of the digital and                   analog levels of hardware and develop a theory of how digital                   devices can be derived from analog circuits.                                         Moeckel's work will continue studies of periodic points and                invariant curves of area preserving maps, of homoclinic phenomena               and of normal forms. These investigations are all aimed towards                 an understanding of the possible qualitative behaviors of three                 point masses. The study of central configurations is important in               the context of escape to infinity, multiple collisions, and the                 topology of energy surfaces.",
