These processes assume more than local importance in                   that they have shaped a large proportion of terrane collagesw,                  and perhaps the continental crust in general.  In the Aleutian                  arc, most on-going magmatic studies emphasize recent volcanic                   rocks.  To complete the crustal cross-section, this project will                                                                                                focus on the more voluminous subvolcanic levels as represented                  by                                                                              plutons and xenolithic fragments.

These rock units indicate a buried oceanic crustal                  component in the Aleutian lithosphere and record details of the                                                                                                 processes of magmatic segregation in the crust.
