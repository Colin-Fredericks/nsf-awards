In                   addition, a full understanding requires an identification of the                precise effects of such structural variables as the type of                     community in which a person grew up, type of school attended,                   industry in which adult work-life began, and so on.                                                                                                             Data with which to link career lines to educational and work                    structures are available in the National Child Development                      Study. It includes virtually every child born in England,                       Scotland and Wales during the first week of March, l958.                        Information about this cohort was periodically obtained over a                  period of 23 years. Included is very diverse and complete                       information pertaining to their health, mental abilities,                       schooling, work, etc. Thus, the data correspond -- for a                        national sample -- with a period from birth through the                         completion of formal schooling and their entry into the labor                   force.                                                                                                                                                          Using path analytic and differential equation methods, the                      investigators will be able to link education and work, and show                 the effects of structural variables across these institutions.                  The results will be important in the development of comparative                 (i.e. United States and Great Britain) sociological theories of                 the life course.",
