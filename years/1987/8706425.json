 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bodega Marine Laboratory (BML), a research unit of the                      University of California, is situated on a 326 acre multi-habitat               ecological reserve, part of the UC Natural Reserve System.  For                 the past 20 years, researchers from throughout the UC system and                elsewhere around the world have worked at BML on terrestrial and                marine research topics.  UC Davis is currently carrying out a                   major continuing commitment of support for BML both in terms of                 construction of new facilities and recruitment of new faculty and               support staff.  In addition, the Natural Reserve System is                      substantially increasing its support of BML.  As a result, the                  number of current and proposed research projects utilizing the                  terrestrial portions of the Reserve has increased significantly.                     This proposal will facilitate three activities at BML:                     establishment of a surveyed, permanently marked and photo-mapped,               standardized grid system; development and expansion of portable,                microclimate datalogger monitoring stations; and renovation and                 expansion of an avian research laboratory.  These improvements                  will facilitate studies of plant and insect community ecology,                  physiological ecology and ecological genetics of plants, avian                  ecology, competition, and plant-insect interactions.",
