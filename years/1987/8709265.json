 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with the issue of robustness in              feedback control.  It has two primary goals:  To develop efficient              numerical procedures for certain robust feedback system design problems,        and to explore the merits of nonlinear feedback in robust control.              Regarding the first goal, preliminary work indicates that certain               control system design problems can be reduced to simpler optimization           problems involving nonlinear programming with only a finite number of           parameters.  This would represent a dramatic improvement over currently         available techniques.  This possibility and also the important numerical        details will be investigated.  The second goal is aimed at understanding        the types of control system design problems for which nonlinear feedback        is substantially superior to linear feedback.  In this context it has           recently been demonstrated that for some design problems in which the           plant model has unknown parameters, nonlinear control offers enormous           advantage.  However, for situations where the plant model has                   substantial unmodeled dynamics, nonlinear feedback is no better than            linear feedback. These results indicate that for many control systems           design problems, the precision to which the plant model is known                determines the type of feedback best suited to control that plant.  This        principle will be investigated to determine its validity in specific            control design problems.",
