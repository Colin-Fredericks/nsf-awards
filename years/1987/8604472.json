 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop a set of                           principles for machine/man compatibility that can be used by                    system designers or process engineers when designing or                         selecting computer-based manufacturing systems.  These                          principles are intended to aid in achieving maximum system                      effectiveness.  The proposal has the following steps:  Survey                   of the metalworking industrial sector with respect to the                       application of machine/man principles, case studies to extract                  tentative machine/human principles, and from the information                    gathered, derive principles intended to guide future system                     design and selection.  A computer-based revolution in                           manufacturing is now under way.  Now is the appropriate                         time to try to set up human factors guidelines for the design                   of such technology.  The principles derived in this proposal                    will address this need.                                                              The investigators are well qualified to conduct this                       research, and based on their past record should be successful                   with this work.",
