 "awd_abstract_narration": "Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building construction         in the U.S. and the world.  Reinforced masonry construction use is              increasing in moderate to higher seismic zones because of its apparent          features of economy, fire safety, architectural flexibility and ease of         construction.                                                                                                                                                   This research project is to partially sponsor the Fourth North American         Masonry Conference.  The objective of the conference is to provide for          the exchange of concepts, research, information, and experiences in             masonry construction.  It will provide a forum for nationally and               internationally known experts to exchange ideas and research.  A                technical dissemination document in the form of Conference proceedings          will be published.                                                                                                                                              The principal investigator is highly qualified to conduct this research.        The institution provides excellent support facilities for this twelve-          month complete project.",
