 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with developing systematic, formal techniques        for constructing VLSI systolic array architectures from machine                 independent algorithm descriptions.  Emphasis is on adaptive filtering          and matrix algebra algorithms since they are prevalent in modern signal         processing.                                                                                                                                                     The research focuses on three elements: (1) techniques for synthesizing         array interconnections and processing element operations based on the           notion of activity charts; (2) the development of efficient processing          element architectures examining the underlying kernel operations of the         algorithms; and (3) the exploration of VLSI realizations for these              processing elements with an emphasis on computation speed.                      The proposed research will extend and impact scientific knowledge               related to the construction of systolic arrays and DSP (digital signal          processing) architectures in several ways.   Methods developed will             increase the understanding of formal design techniques and could be the         basis for a DSP systolic array compiler.  Discovering the underlying            rotational framework of DSP algorithms and enhancing general                    understanding of these algorithms is a potential outcome of this work.          Finally, rapid computation of elementary functions is of paramount              importance to fast computers.  This project is developing VLSI                  architectures for fast rotation processors with multiplication and              division as a subset.",
