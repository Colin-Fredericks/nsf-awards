 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for renewed support of the Materials Research                     Laboratory (MRL) at Harvard University under the direction of                   Henry Ehrenreich.  The MRL is comprised of 21 faculty members                   from the Division of Applied Sciences and the Departments of                    Chemistry and Physics.  The research program concentrates on                    collaborative, multidisciplinary efforts in major thrust areas;                 in addition, outstanding ideas from individual investigators are                eligible for seed support.  The MRL helps new faculty embark on                 MRL-related projects and supports central experimental facilities               needed for a wide range of materials research activity on campus.               There are research links with other MRL's and with industrial and               government laboratories.  There are 22 graduate students and 8                  postdoctoral research associates in the program.                                                                                                                A research program of expanded scope concentrated in three major                thrust areas is planned.  The thrust on structural and electronic               transformations in solids includes studies of phase transitions,                diffusion processes and crystal growth mechanisms in a variety of               systems, and an increased emphasis on electronic transitions.                   Activities in the area of thin films, surfaces and interfaces                   include the intensive development of experimental facilities, the               pursuit of interdisciplinary projects involving chemistry and                   physics, and planning for a surface facility to be operated                     jointly with the MRL at MIT.  Collaborative efforts on thin                     films, wetting, adhesion, reconstruction and an expanded program                of surface studies are proposed.  The thrust on micromechanics                  has two major components, one directed towards a theoretical                    understanding of structural ceramics and the other, a                           collaborative effort with the MIT MRL and research groups in                    government and industry, addressing innovations in the technology               of high-strength steels.                                                                                                                                        The research quality in this MRL is outstanding, and the need to                work collaboratively in order to make progress on major problems                is driving most of the research proposed.  The MRL management at                Harvard is successfully fostering multidisciplinary, interactive                research on the part of the faculty, and the resulting research                 environment for students and postdoctoral associates is superb.                 Strong links to industrial and government laboratories and to                   ther MRL's are highly beneficial.  Central facilities are                       adequate and future plans for further development of the research               facilities are very promising.                                                                                                                                  This award will allow expanded scope of the MRL research program                to the three thrust areas, provide seed funding for outstanding                 bew research, and provide strong continuing support for the                     central facilities, with particular emphasis on the interaction                 with MIT in the operation of new facilities.",
