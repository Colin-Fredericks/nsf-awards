 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with the control of the physical and chemical                characteristics of BaTiO3 powder by developing a synthesis route                which is simple and economical.  This research should ultimately lead           to the first synthesis technique which produces a narrow size                   distribution BaTiO3 powder with submicron, unagglomerated particles             and a 1:1 Ba:Ti ratio at a synthesis temperature as low as 100oC.               Synthesis of such powder may also lead to great processing advances             in the production of BaTiO3 electrical ceramics.  The synthesis route           for this powder is envisioned to require three consecutive stages:              1) synthesis of monodisperse hydrous titania  2) hydrothermal                   reaction of a sterically stabilized dispersion of monodisperse                  hydrous titania in a strongly alkaline aqueous solution of Ba(OH)2              3) acetic acid rinsing to remove all residual Ba(OH)2.  Completion of           stage one will be accomplished using methods established by previous            workers.  Successful completion of stage two will rely on                       simultaneously maintaining BaTiO3 formation and colloidal stability             throughout the hydrothermal reaction.  Study of stage two is possible           with in situ and intermittent measurements using conventional powder            and solution characterization to monitor the effect of the chemical             processing variables on the progress of the hydrothermal reaction.              Identification of the critical processing variables which control the           powder characteristics will enable achievement of the ultimate                  objective and a better fundamental understanding of the process.",
