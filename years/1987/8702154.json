 "awd_abstract_narration": "The role of myosin in the structure and function of brush                  borders isolated from intestinal and colonic epithelial cells                   will be investigated. In the brush border cytoskeleton, myosin is               associated with two structural domains: one comprising the                      terminal web where it crosslinks the microvillus core bundles of                actin filaments, and the other a contractile ring of actin                      filaments that surrounds the terminal web.  Two subsets of myosin               are differentially extractable from the  brush border:  one that                is involved in terminal web contraction and one that is not.  The               aim of this research is to determine the molecular  basis for the               two subsets.  The possiblity that more than one isozyme of myosin               is expressed in the brush border, and the relationship between                  myosin isozymes and the subsets of myosin will be investigated.                 The localization of each of the subsets of myosin with respect to               the two major structural domains of the terminal web will also be               determined. Because the circumferential ring is organized long                  before the interroolet region during embryogenesis, the findings                on myosin isozyme  expression  and subset localization will be                  related to the normal sequence of intestinal development.                       Finally, the stable structural association of one myosin subset                 indicates the likelihood that it interacts with more than actin                 in the cytoskeleton.  Proteins that bind myosin in the brush                    border will be identified and localized.  The results of this                   research may indicate that myosin plays more than one role in                   brush border function and that a specific myosin performs a                     specific function within a single cytoskeletal system.  This adds               new significance to the general observation that cytoskeletal                   proteins are frequently encoded by multigene families.",
