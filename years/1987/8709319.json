 "awd_abstract_narration": "Salt dome hosted Zn-Pb-Ba-Ag deposits in the Gulf Coast                 Region of the United States offer unique information about the                  origin and evolution of metal-bearing brines and ore deposits                   in sedimentary terranes.  The salt dome mineral deposits have                   genetic affinities with Mississippi Valley Type Zn-Pb-Ba                        deposits and sedimentary exhalative Zn-Pb-Ag-Ba deposits.  Our                  previous studies, most of which have focused on the petrology                   and geochemistry of ore minerals, indicate that these deposits                  were apparently emplaced during and after the formation of cap                  rocks from relatively hot fluids leaking upward along the salt                  stock margins.  We propose to continue our study, concentrating                 more on the processes of cap rock formation than ore mineral                    formation (1) to better establish the links between basin                       brines, cap rocks, and sulfide/sulfate mineral deposits, and                    (2) to determine what constituents in the sedimentary section                   or beneath the salt stock provided metals and sulfur.  Detailed                 petrographic studies will be integrated with C, O, Sr, Pb, and                  S isotope, REE, and fluid inclusion studies cap rocks and                       associated minerals.  We propose to determine the relative                      sequence of events that must take place in a sedimentary basin                  to produce salt dome mineral deposits, to characterize the                      nature of sulfur- and metal-bearing fluids, to investigate the                  isotopic relationships between anhydrite cap rocks and salt-                    hosted anhydrite to see what reactions involving anhydrite take                 place during cap rock formation, and to investigate how fluids                  in different salt basins may give rise to distinct isotopic                     signatures of salt dome cap rocks within that basin.",
