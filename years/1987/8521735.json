 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is intended in this Phase II of the project to continue                 and complete the development of the general formulation of                      diffraction tomography that was initiated in Phase I.  This                     formulation is applicable to weak and strongly scattering                       objects, to general experimental configurations employing                       plane, fan beam or other types of incident wavefields and to                    applications where the data is sparse either because of a                       limited number of experiments (limited views) or under sampling                 of the waveforms over the measurement surfaces.  The general                    formulation will be implemented in software codes on a                          microprocessor equipped with an array processor and will be                     extensively tested in computer simulations and on experimental                  data drawn from seismic, electromagnetic, ultrasound and                        optical tomographic applications.  Major emphasis will be given                 to applications for which follow-on funding commitments are                     obtained.                                                                            This project is aimed at developing mathematical and                       computational techniques for the so called diffraction                          tomography.  This is a generalized formulation of tomography                    for applications involving radiation other than x-rays, such as                 for example, ultrasound tomography, optical tomography and                      geophysical tomography.  Earlier studies in diffraction                         tomography assumed plane wave illumination of the object and                    worked with the linearized version of the wave equation.  More                  recent approaches, including this one, work with the complex                    phase of the transmitted field.  Potential applications of this                 research include ultrasound tomographic scanners for medical                    and industrial applications, coherent optical tomographic                       scanners for monitoring combustion processes and a host of                      geophysical applications including seismic imaging, well-to-                    well tomography and ocean acoustic tomography.",
