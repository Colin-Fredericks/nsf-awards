 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many industries there are situations which require a storage or a            lining up of vehicles or people before an action can be taken.  An              example, is the processing of customers or goods at various locations           and in different industries, in order to reduce costs and congestion.                                                                                           This project will investigate the development of a mathematical model           for lightly congested systems, using ports as a case study.  Because of         the complexity of the concept, approximations will be investigated              analytically and with computer simulations.                                                                                                                     The researcher is qualified to perform this research activity.                                                                                                  The project is recommended for an award.                                                                                                                        This is a one time award for twelve months.                                     8660297                                                                         STEWART                                                                         The aging and subsequent deterioration of concrete structures is                becoming a major concern for governmental agencies and private owners of        these types of structures.  The question of whether to strengthen or            demolish is of prime economic importance.  In order to determine the in-        situ strength of the concrete, nondestructive evaluation equipment is           required.  Currently, there is no reliable equipment which can determine        the strength of individual structural members of concrete.                                                                                                      This project will investigate the possibilities of using a sonic wave           spectral analysis method to evaluate the strength of the concrete.  The         benefits to be derived from a successful completion of this                     investigation are:  enabling engineers to provide better advice to              owners on whether to rehabilitate or demolish a building or bridge;             allowing accurate evaluation of the strength properties of pre-cast             components produced from a manufacturing process; and identifying the           state of deterioration for a determination of the remaining life of the         structure.                                                                                                                                                      This award is Phase I of the 1986 Small Business Innovation Research            Program.",
