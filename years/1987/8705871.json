 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metal cluster compounds are an important class of catalysts and                 are also of substantial current interest as models of species                   which exist at the metal surfaces when they are used as                         catalysts. Such cluster compounds absorb light strongly and the                 high-energy (excited state) species which are formed thereby                    are very reactive in bringing about chemical transformations of                 organic molecules. This research project is expected to provide                 information which is essential to effective use of metal                        clusters as catalysts for light-induced chemical reactions.                                                                                                     The proposed research is focused on providing general                           guidelines for multielectron photochemistry beginning with two                  classes of transition metal compounds: multiply bonded metal-                   metal (M-n-M) dimers and hexanuclear clusters of Mo(II) and                     W(II). The excited states of these compounds are highly                         luminescent and long-lived. The factors governing the excited                   state dynamics of the hexanuclear clusters and the M-n-M dimers                 will be defined using electronic absorption, emission and                       time-resolved spectroscopies. Preliminary data indicate that                    the oxidation-reduction chemistry of these species is derived                   from the metal cores. The studies will be extended by using                     cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and electrogenerated                      chemiluminescence (ecl) to identify reaction pathways. Of                       special importance are experiments in which ecl will be used to                 probe several mechanistic features of the hexanuclear cluster                   oxidation-reduction processes. The spectroscopic and                            electrochemical studies are complementary and will be used to                   define a framework in which to construct multielectron                          transformations of excited state metal clusters. Excited state                  reaction pathways that rely on redox reactions of small                         molecule reactants and organic substrates at electronically                     excited, coordinatively unsaturated metal cluster cores will be                 developed.",
