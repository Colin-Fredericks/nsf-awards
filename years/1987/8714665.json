 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this research we seek a fundamental understanding of the                mechanical behavior of materials of scientific and engineering                  interest.  The objective underlying the work is a complete                      characterization of the resistance of material to deformation and               fracture. Research in this area is necessarily interdisciplinary                with activities that span the spectrum from basic theory, through               experiment and observation, to detailed modelling and simulation.               Theoretical studies provide the framework for discussing                        phenomena and for postulating physical mechanisms of materials                  deformation and fracture as well as provide definitions of                      physical quantities that should be measured.  Experimental                      studies, on the other hand, provide the means of identifying                    complex material phenomenology and provide quantitative                         information on the physical quantities identified in theoretical                work.  To complete the loop, analytical modelling and computer                  simulation provide the means to examine the validity of                         theoretical concepts and to draw conclusions about the behavior                 of materials that could not be inferred directly from                           experimental data.  It is essential that each of these                          ingredients be included in a comprehensive research program if                  significant fundamental contributions are to be made.                                                                                                           Major themes of this research include: (1) the effects of rate                  and temperature on inelastic deformation mechanisms and fracture                behavior; (2) the establishment of quantitative links between                   microscopic microstructural mechanisms and macroscopic behavior;                (3) exploration of the role of interfaces on the mechanisms of                  deformation and fracture; and (4) the study of unstable and                     localized deformation, especially as a direct precursor to                      failure.",
