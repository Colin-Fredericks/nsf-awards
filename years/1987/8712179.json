It will                be the sixth in a series of national summer schools:  the first                 and fourth being held at Fermilab in 1981 and 1984, the second                  and fifth at SLAC in 1982 and 1985, and the third in 1983 at                    BNL/SUNY.  This year the School will initiate a four-week format.                       The purpose of the School is to attract scientists and                  students to work in accelerator physics.  The first two weeks,                  Session I, will have a university style format and consist of                   three parallel courses on accelerator physics.  By agreement with               the University of Chicago, students may earn university credit (1               semester equivalent per course) by successfully completing up to                two of these courses.  The last two weeks, Session II, will have                lectures, seminars and tutorials in a symposium format, and will                include an intensive series of courses on the physics and                       technology of particle accelerators.  Approximately 300                         participants are expected to attend.                                                    This action will provide funds for the preparation and                  publication of the proceedings.",
