 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent molecular studies have identified the interesting                    phenomenon of overlapping genes within the 71CD interval of                     chromosome 3 of Drosophila melanogaster.  The overlapping genes                 exhibit distinct patterns of expression: the E600 gene is                       blastoderm-stage specific, the overlap (ov1) gene is a germ line                expressed gene, and the Eip28/29 gene is ecdysone inducibe.  We                 believe the analysis of these genes will allow us to address                    several important questions from the standpoint of developmental                biology.  In this proposal, we focus in on the expression of the                ov1 gene.  Strategies involving germ line transformation will be                used to characterize the cis-acting regulatory elements                         controlling ov1 gene expression.  These experiments should help                 us to understand the kinds of regulation used in the differential               expression of this germ line expressed gene.  We will also                      investigate the potential effect that overlapping gene                          organization may have on ov1 gene expression.  The unusual                      sequence organization may provide an important regulatory                       mechanism in the expression of this complex gene cluster.                       Finally, experiments utilizing in situ hybridization of gene                    specific probes to RNAs in tissue and animal sections should                    yield a detailed description of ov1 gene expression during normal               development.                                                                        This is a complex and interesting system of overlapping genes               that are apparently under independent control with respect to                   expression during development, tissue specific expression and                   hormone dependent expression.  Overall, information about this                  cluster may lead to a better understanding of the processes                     involved in the regulation of gene expression during cellular                   differentiation, during gametogenesis and embryogenesis.",
