 "awd_abstract_narration": "The subject of this proposal is a University/Industry                      Research Center in Pharmaceutical/Chemical Sciences at the                      University of Puerto Rico.  An operational grant to set up and                  operate the Center on the base of the University/Industry Research              Program in Pharmaceutical/Chemical Science is being requested.                  The planning work started in 1983 with University funds and was                 successfully accomplished with the aid of NSF grant no. ISI 84-                 21088, received in April 1985, by starting the University/Industry              Research Program in Pharmaceutical/Chemical Sciences at the                     University of Puerto Rico in November 1985.  The proposed Center's              main operational characteristics can be summarized as follows:                       Participants:  Puerto Rico pharmaceutical/chemical industry                (twenty-one pharmaceutical/chemical companies), (2) the                         University of Puerto Rico, (3) the Puerto Rico Community                        Foundation (through grant No. PRCF 1-85 (C) received in September               1985), (4) the National Science Foundation (through the                         operational grant which is being requested).                                         Industrial Focus of the Center:  Most major U.S. drug and                  pharmaceutical manufacturers have production facilities in Puerto               Rico.  Often pharmaceutical and chemical processes take place                   within the same company.  There are about 110 plans in operation.               Pharmaceutical/chemical plants in Puerto Rico are usually state-                of-the-art since they were built during the last 12-15 years.                   Practically the whole spectrum of drugs and pharmaceuticals is                  produced in Puerto Rico.                                                             The creation of the University/Industry Research Center in                 Pharmaceutical/Chemical Sciences at the University of Puerto Rico               will fill the existing vacuum in the relationship between the                   universities and the pharmaceutical/chemical industry in Puerto                 Rico in basic and applied research, education and training.  The                center will offer an effective mechanism through which assistance               can be sought from the industry to the Puerto Rico University                   System.                                                                              Twenty-one companies are supporting the setting-up of the                  University/Industry Research Center in Pharmaceutical/Chemical                  Sciences, and sixteen are participating actively in the                         University/Industry Research Committee.",
