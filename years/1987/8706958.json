 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will allow the PI to conduct ethnographic fieldwork                  in the Amazon Basin among two groups of Indians, the Siriono and                the Yuqui of lowland Bolivia.  The project will examine the                     long-term ecological and socioclultural consequences of resource                depletion resulting from faunal decline, intensification of                     horticulture, and increased extraction of forest products.  The                 project will also examine the results of settler incursion into                 the zone of these foraging peoples and the effect this has on                   resource depletion, labor, commodity market participation,                      sociocultural change and ultimately cultural survival.  The two                 groups being studied are in an area that has been little studied,               and pertain to a type of cutlure that is practically extinct at                 present.  This research is important because it will add a                      valuable case to the literature on native tribes' reaction to                   and adjustment to settler incursions into their area.  The                      project will contribute to the literature on appropriate                        technologies that allow for rational land use to encourage                      long-term resource sustainability.",
