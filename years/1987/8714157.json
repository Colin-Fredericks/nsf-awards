 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are to develop experimental and                 theoretical procedures for online measurement and analysis of                   combustion, ammonium sulphate and nitrate particles formed in dry               scrubbing processes, and silicon particles from the pyrolysis of                silane.  In silicon production, conditions are chosen to prevent                cluster formation by operating at temperatures below where homogeneous          nucleation occurs and with low concentration of nuclei.  In the                 electron beam scrubbing processes, operating and installation costs are         so expensive that short irradiation times at high doses are mandated.           These conditions yield comparatively high water vapor concentrations            will at least partially compensate, and a compact particle can be               expected.  The soot structures are extended chain-like structures.  The         specific research areas are:  (1) the experimental measurement of the           aerodynamic diameter of clusters and their correlation with primary             particle size and fractal dimension; (2) the development of a                   coagulation model based on the Kaplan lattice approach; and (3) the             diffusional charging of clusters and especially their role as a sink            for ions.",
