 "awd_abstract_narration": "A long range cooperative effort between the Illinois Institute of               Technology (IIT), the Educational Service Region of Cook County (ESRCC)         and the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) initiated in the summer of 1986 to         meet the educational needs in mathematics and science identified by             teachers and administrators at the Chicago Board of Education will              continue for three years.  The key features of Science and Mathematics          Initiative for Learning Enhancement (SMILE) are an emphasis on the              phenomenological approach to the subject matter, a format in which              teachers in grades 4-12 work together to develop and critique mini-teach        presentations of specific topics and the establishment of a permanent           teacher based interactive network of 450 teachers to further program            objectives.                                                                                                                                                     In each of three summers 60 Chicago area teachers will take part in an          intensive five week summer program where participants are separated into        two groups, either Biology+Chemistry or Mathematics+Physics. Each group         is supervised by a senior IIT faculty member and two high school                teachers who are members of the project staff.  Activities include              plenary lectures, shop and preparation sessions, computer awareness,            cross disciplinary interactions and mini-teaching in three member teams         reinforced by college faculty members.  This project is designed to             increase expertise and communication skills as well as an attitude shift        to increase classroom effectiveness.  In the academic year four courses         will be conducted paralleling the staffing and structure of the summer          program with an increased enrollment up to 100 teachers. At the end of          the three year program it is anticipated SMILE will have developed a            cadre of master teachers who would play key roles in a teacher                  enhancement activity focussed on elementary science and mathematics.                                                                                            The Illinois Institute of Technology has a long record of commitment to         and successful implementation of programs for high school teachers              directed by PI Dr.Earl Zwicker, Professor of Physics and coPI Dr.               Kenneth Schug, Professor of Chemistry and Department Chair.  In addition        Dr. Arthur Devito, Associate Professor of Mathematics at Loop College           and Dr. Daniel Koblic, Associate Professor of Biology at IIT will be            consultants for mini-teach presentations and develop and maintain               teacher networks in their respective discipline areas.  Four master high        school teachers will coordinate the direction of day-to-day activities          and serve as role models who understand the phenomenological approach:          Steve McVeigh (Biology), Val Dyokas (Chemistry), Larry Freeman                  (Mathematics), Roy Coleman (Physics).",
