 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of Prof. John A. W. Kirsch of             the University of Wisconsin-Madison in a program of cooperative                 research with Prof. Osvaldo Reig of the University of Buenos Aires              aimed at using the latest techniques of biochemistry and genetic                analysis to clarify the taxonomies of sister-group relationships                among various marsupials.  An additional object of this research is             to test the proposition that the average rate of evolution in DNA               is both regular and the same in mammals as in birds.                                                                                                            Determining the taxonomies among the major groups of marsupials can             be of great use, first in understanding processes of evolution and,             eventually, in obtaining a complete description of the sequence of              evolution in both marsupials and in man.  It is believed that                   biochemical signatures--e.g., genomes--evolve as regular functions              of time and therefore, each of different lines derived from a                   common ancestor evolves at the same rate.  Given this evolution,                the amount of divergence between any two lines will be proportional             to the time elapsed since their most recent common ancestor, and                the sequence of branching points among all lines may be accurately              reconstructed.  The researchers involved in this project will use               single-copy DNA-DNA hybridization, a relatively simple technique of             comparing the DNA from two species, in order to assess the                      magnitude of DNA complementarity.  Genetic variability will be                  analyzed using electrophoretic techniques, and chromosomal                      development will be studied using direct chromosome-chromosome                  comparison techniques.  The U.S. investigators are expert in                    hybridization studies, while their Argentinian collaborators will               perform the remainder of the analytical studies; both groups will               be involved in the collection of sample material in Argentina and               the U.S.  Verification that structural genes evolve in a                        predictable fashion with time would be important in demonstrating               that the degree of chemical similarity among organisms is                       proportional to their \"relatedness\"--or degree of common                        ancestry--and a biochemically based time-developing sequence of                 evolutionary branching points from common ancestors should become               possible based upon this theory.",
