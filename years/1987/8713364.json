 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for a workshop on the contrasts in          design specifications throughout the world that relate to the stability         of metal structures.  Specialists in stability and in seismic loading of        structures, from 6 major regions of the world, will attend this workshop.       Discussion will be focused on stability provisions to determine reasons         for differences between them.  Extensive preparation for this workshop          has resulted in production of reports on existing and proposed                  specifications from each participating region for various topics.                                                                                               The effort should lead to recommendations for revisions to the USA              specifications, by taking advantage of advances that have taken place in        other parts of the world, especially with respect to structural response        to earthquake forces.",
