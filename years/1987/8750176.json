 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using the scanning electron microscope (SEM), a critical point dryer and        a sputter coater, the College is bringing to its Biology curriculum a           new upper-division course on the Principles and Methods of Scanning             Electron Microscopy.  Students enrolling in this course gain enhanced           understanding of the methods of scientific investigation, greater               ability to interpret biological structure, and improved technical               skills.  An important additional benefit of the facility is the                 increased opportunity for student research it affords.  A substantial           fraction of the Department's graduating group of 15 majors annually will        have done independent work in ultrastructure.  Pre-service Biology              teachers, plus upperclassmen from chemistry, geology and physics, also          will have access to the SEM and ancillary specimen preparation                  equipment.  Topics include election optics (theory, lenses, resolution),        SEM design and operation, specimen preparative techniques (fixation,            dehydration, coating), interpretation of images (measurement and                shrinkage), surface labelling, elemental analysis, SEM applications to a        wide range of organisms and questions, and laboratory safety.                                                                                                   The SEM capability is having a valuable secondary impact on the                 Department's work in Developmental Biology, Plant Anatomy, Systemmatic          Botany and Entomology, among others.  Since SEM preparation does not            require time-consuming thin sectioning, it is superior to transmission          electromicroscopy in this wide variety of undergraduate applications.",
