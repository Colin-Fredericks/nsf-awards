 "awd_abstract_narration": "The elements of Group Seven of the Periodic Table, including oxygen,            sulfur, selenium and tellurium, are known as the chalcogens.  This              research project is concerned with the synthesis and properties of              metal chalcogenides, especially compounds of metals with sulfur.  Such          compounds play important roles both in biological and industrial                catalysis.  Metal Sulfides constitute the active sites of a number of           important enzymes and are the active ingredient in the industrially             important hydrodesulfurization catalysts.  This project is expected to          enhance understanding of these important catalysts and lead to the              design of more efficient catalysts.                                                                                                                             The goals of this project are to synthesize, structurally                       characterize and explore in detail the reactivities of specific metal-          sulfur complexes.  These complexes are expected to assist in our                understanding of a) The structures and reactivity of the metal sulfur           active sites in the industrially important hydrodesulfurization (HDS)           reaction catalysts.  b) The structures and reactivity of specific early         transition metal sulfur complexes and c) The structures and                     reactivities of a new class of heteronuclear M/Fe/S clusters.  Research         in the first area of interest will place emphasis in the synthesis,             structure and reactivity of the binary complex anions containing                molybdenum and sulfur and ternary molybdenum/sulfur/oxygen anions.              Heterometallic clusters will be obtained using the Mo/S(O)complex               anions as ligands for divalent transition metal ions.  The structures           and reactivity of the new M/Mo/S(O) complexes will be studied in                detail.  The effectiveness of supported or unsupported Mo/S(O) and              M/Mo/S(O) complexes as catalysts for the HDS of thiophene concerns the          chemistry of Zr/S, Nb/S and Lanthanides/S complexes.  These complexes           are expected to display exceptional reactivity, and will serve as               reagents for the synthesis of specific heterometallic clusters.                 Finally the ability of the Fe6S6L6 clusters to serve as ligands for             coordinatively unsaturated organometallic fragments, will be utilized           for the synthesis of hepta- and octametallic clusters with the MFe6S6           and M2Fe6S6 cores.  The importance of these clusters as templates for           the activation and reduction of small molecules will be evaluated.",
