 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Biological Facilities Center proposal requests funds to                    support the purchase of a distributed, networked-based computer                 system that will be used to enhance the research efforts of l8                  neuroscientists and to provide new opportunities for                            collaboration among these investigators.  The research programs                 that will use the proposed distributed computer system can be                   subdivided into three groups:  anatomical and physiological                     investigations on the development of the auditory and visual                    systems, psychophysical examination of perceptual processes in                  humans, and the acoustic, physiological, and behavioral                         examination of speech processes in humans.  All the investigators               in the three research groups described above have a common                      interest in understanding basic communication systems in humans.                Although their methods vary in detail, relatively few general                   approaches are represented, and many of the same technical                      problems are being addressed.  Although similar computing needs                 exist, individuals are meeting these needs with a variety of                    strategies.  The resulting mixture of hardware and software makes               substantive interaction difficult.  The proposed system, which                  will put common hardware and software components into each                      laboratory, will link all the laboratories in a high-speed                      network.  This will significantly enhance substantive                           collaborative interactions among the investigators by offering,                 use of identical stimuli and/or stimulus synthesis software,                    comparative data analysis techniques, and shared data bases.",
