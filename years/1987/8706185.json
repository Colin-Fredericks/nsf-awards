 "awd_abstract_narration": "The anthropology museum at the University of Kansas is                  undertaking overall improvements in their archaeology                           collections.  Their holdings have strengths in the Northern and                 Central Plains for both prehistoric and historic periods.  These                collections are among the best documented in the central Plains,                and are remarkably coherent, stemming as they do from tightly                   focused research projects carried out between 1945 and 1965.  In                all, more than 1800 sites from the Plains and Plains/Prairie                    border are represented in the collections.                                              This project will represent the completion of the upgrading             of the collection begun in a small grant funded last year.                      Significant improvements have already been made and with this                   grant the collections will be available for researchers in the                  anthropological community.                                                              One of the major priorities facing museums in North America             is the proper curation and management of archaeological                         collections.  Through NSF support considerable progess can be                   made in correcting problems that have plagued museums and                       hindered research.",
