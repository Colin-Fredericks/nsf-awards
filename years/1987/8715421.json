 "awd_abstract_narration": "An interagency transfer of funds by the NSF to the National Institutes of  Health will provide partial support for the Indonesian Primate Breeding and     Conservation Program.  Indonesia is presently one of the two remaining          countries in the world that is exporting cynomolgus monkeys for use in          biomedical research.  In addition, Indonesia is the only source country for     pig-tailed macaques and Celebes black apes.  While support for development of   the natural habitat breeding program will not satisfy U. S. needs for the       cynomolgus monkey by itself, it does strengthen future access to this and the   other species that occur naturally in Indonesian habitats.  The natural habitat breeding project provides a good potential model and testing ground for similar projects elsewhere in the tropical and semi-tropical areas of the world where   non-human primates are found.  A success in Indonesia could help future efforts to develop future projects in the Philippines, Malaysiam, Thailand, and perhaps India.  Cynomolgus monkeys are a model primate used in several NSF supported    projects and the continued availability of this primate is essential to several biological research programs.                                                        This interagency transfer will allow NSF support as a member of the        Interagency Research Animal Committee for the development of a natural habitat  breeding project in Indonesia to produce retrovirus free cynomolgus monkeys for                                                                                 biomedical research.  An addition project objective is to make a substantive    contribution to the achievement of broader conservation goals to assure more    dependable primate export.",
