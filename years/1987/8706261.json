 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Teller, in collaboration with Professor Michael Redhead, is           undertaking a major project to produce a new interpretation of quantum          field theory.  Heretofore, most work on this topic has used a particle          interpretation with much less sophistication than has been applied to           the interpretation of the parent theory, quantum mechanics.  Professors         Teller and Redhead will develop their new interpretation of quantum             field theory based on an application of the quantized harmonic                  oscillator and will build this into an interpretive tool which will give        a much more faithful grip on the theory than does the particle approach.        That such a new interpretation is needed is clear because this theory           provides our currently best explanation of the nature of matter.  The           current impoverished state of its interpretation constitutes an                 important gap in our larger scientific understanding of the world.  Yet         such an interpretation of QFT has been difficult to construct because of        the newness and complexity of the theory.  This study will begin by             showing the inadequacy of anything which could plausibly be called a            particle interpretation as well as develop their alternative. Both              Professors Teller and Redhead are well qualified to carry out this              research. Professor Teller has made significant contributions under             previous NSF grants to our understanding of the philosophical                   foundations of quantum mechanics.  Professor Redhead is a noted                 physicist and philosopher.  Their collaboration promises to make a very         significant contribution to our understanding of the most formidable of         theories concerning the nature of matter.  Their projected study will be        of great value for physics and philosophy alike.",
