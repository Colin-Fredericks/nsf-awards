The purpose of this conference is to foster an                   awareness of the technical, managerial and policy issues, both                  national and international, that are involved in global                         manufacturing and to delineate a research agenda that will                      contribute to our understanding of the complexities inherent in                 global manufacturing.  To achieve this goal, scholars actively                  engaged in research on the selected topics will be invited to be                speakers.  The topics to be addressed will focus on the technical,              economic and public policy issues relating to the future of                     automated manufacturing, advances in communications and computer                technologies, management of human resources, and national and                   international competition and cooperation.  The speakers will be                from key industrial nations.  Discussion of each topic will be led by a         panel composed of 3 to 5 individuals including a U.S.                           industrialist, a foreign manufacturer, an academic, and a                       discussant/rapporteur who will prepare a written synopsis of the                panel proceedings, focusing on needs for research.  The proceedings of          this conference will be published.",
