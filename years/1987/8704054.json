 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            established to provide support to strengthen the research environments          and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions or                      institutions that have substantial minority student populations.                Eligible institutions must also have graduate programs in science or            programs in engineering.  Funding is provided for faculty research in           fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and for           the acquisition of research instrumentation.  The University of                 Maryland - Eastern Shore (UMES) will use RIMI support to study the              influence of sensory and morphological characteristics on the feeding           habits of Portunid and Cancrid crabs.  The foraging behaviors and               sensory mechanisms involved in discriminating among prey items are              poorly understood in these animals.  One phase of the study will                analyze how the crabs detect prey and judge prey quality.  Another              phase will examine the relationship between handling time and prey              selection, including effects of claw morphology, and microhabitat               (position on the bottom), on prey selection.                                                                                                                    Researchers at UMES will use state of the art data collecting and               analysis instrumentation to collect real time data on the behavior of           three crab species.  The principal investigator has many years of               research experience with marine organisms, especially crustacea.  The           Foundation has supported this project because minorities will have              opportunities to participate in meritorious marine research, and area           where very few minorities choose careers.",
