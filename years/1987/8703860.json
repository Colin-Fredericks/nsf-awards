 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transport of ions across biological membranes is a                          fundamental process which is essential to a variety of                          physiological phenomena.  In addition to being critical to                      the basic metabolism and bioenergetics of most cells, it is                     key to many other more specific processes.                                      Neurotransmission, muscle action and vision are just a few                      examples of biological events that are mediated by the                          transport of ions.  A deeper understanding of ion transport                     could have far reaching consequences in several areas of                        biochemistry.                                                                                                                                                   Dr. Dewey is investigating the transmembrane ion transport                      kinetics for two of the better characterized transport                          proteins, bacteriorhodopsin and calcium ATPase.  Knowledge of                   the rates of the individual, elementary reaction steps is                       required for a detailed, molecular description of an ion                        transport process.  A modulation relaxation kinetic technique                   developed in his laboratory will be used.  This method will                     provide new information for evaluating reaction mechanisms.",
