 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parents in every society know that young children need to be                    socialized according to norms and conventions.  The                             transmission process usually begins when children begin to                      walk and talk.                                                                                                                                                  Psychologists believe that if parents convey their expectations                 for behavior with reason, sensitivity, and love, children are                   likely to comply with demands.  Psychologists also know that                    during the early years, children increasingly go along with                     parent expectations for behavior, and even assume                               responsibility for their own acts when alone.  The ability to                   act according to parent and social demands is often labeled                     self-regulation. By the preschool years, children are expected                  to be able to accept standards and to monitor their own                         behavior accordingly.                                                                                                                                           Despite the importance of self-regulation for childen's                         socialization, few details are known about its early                            developmental course.  In addition, little is known of the                      nature of conditions that help or hinder self-regulation's                      growth.  This research will attempt to fill this gap.                                                                                                           Specifically, this developmentally focused study will address                   the following:  What kinds of self-regulation do young                          children, who are in the second through fourth years of life,                   show?  What general level of development has to be obtained                     before children consistently comply with requests?  What                        cognitive processes are associated with the child's ability to                  show self-regulation?  How do parents modify their behavior to                  take into account child capability?  What particular situations                 or events interfere with children's ability to regulate their                   own behavior.                                                                                                                                                   At the conclusion of the research, we will know more about                      how caregivers assist the child's learning of social                            conventions, how children engage in the social tasks and                        demands placed before them and how they regulate their own                      behavior, and which particular situations are particularly                      challenging for young children.",
