 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year project for teacher development is offered at Southern            Illinois University at Carbondale for the purpose of enhancing                  mathematics education in the southern half of the state of Illinois.            Sixty teachers, elementary and secondary, broken into appropriate grade         level groupings, will be given the opportunity to receive on-campus             instruction in Mathematics, problem-solving, the use of microcomputers          in teaching, and to integrate the training received into classroom              teaching.  This project is based on a successful pilot program recently         completed at SIU-Carbondale.  In addition to the above objectives, a            \"community of scholars\" will be created among these competent,                  enthusiastic teachers to continue the collegiality established and to           maintain the impetus for improved mathematics education.                                                                                                        A four-week program is planned for the first summer with a follow-up            during the school year of twelve Saturday meetings, for the purposes of         sharing experiences with each other and meeting with project staff and          guest instructors of mathematics.  Local school districts, the Renewal          Institute for Practicing Teachers and the Education Service Centers are         lending their support, financial as well as programmatic.  This                 collaborative effort will result in teachers having the opportunity of          earning sixteen credits from the University and benefiting from a good          support system for the improvement of their classroom teaching.                                                                                                 Dr. Jerry P. Becker is Professor of Mathematical Education at SIU-              Carbondale and has had extensive experience in working with teachers            through National Science Foundation funded programs and institutes in           the United States and India.  His responsibilities at the University            include working with preservice teachers of mathematics.  His Co-PI,            Dr. Neal Foland has excellent credentials in Mathematics.  They have            assembled a very creditable staff of mathematicians and educators.                                                                                              This project offers a wide range of approaches aimed at the improvement         of mathematics education throughout the K-12 grades through a                   collaborative project which involves important elements of the Southern         Illinois educational community.",
