It is scheduled to be held March               18-20, 1987, at Incline Village, Nevada.  The meeting will solicit              invited and contributed original papers on the subjects of devices and          architectures suitable for switching, multiplexing, or routing optical          signals.  The purpose of the meeting is to foster interactions between          two groups exploring possible applications of photonic switching                technology:  those working on optical switching devices, and on future          switching systems and networks.  Serving as meeting cochairs are Dr.            P.W. Smith, Bell Communications Research, and Dr. T.K. Gustafson, NSF;          program cochairs are Dr. J.E. Midwinter, University College London, and         Dr. S.D. Personick, Bell Communications Research.  The organizers of            the meeting are acknowledged leaders in the field, and the topic area           is central to long term research directions within the QEWB program.",
