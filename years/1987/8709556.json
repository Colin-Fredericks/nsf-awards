 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Dr. Bass and his collegues to continue                       excavation of a shipwreck lying at a depth of 145 to 170 feet                   off Ulu Burun, Turkey.  The wreck, found as the result of a                     systematic survey, dates to the Late Bronze Age (14th century                   B.C.) and sank after being driven onto the Ulu Burun cliffs.                    Because it sank upright, its rich contents remained in place and                were not significantly disturbed when the ship settled to the                   bottom. Preliminary excavation has revealed copper and glass                    ingots, ceramic vessels and numerous personal belongings of crew                members.                                                                                                                                                        The teams plans to continue mapping and excavation of the ship.                 All artifacts will be photographed \u001ain situ\u001a and after removal,                 necessary conservation will be carried out.  Copper and glass                   samples will be analyzed to determine the sources of these                      materials.  Neutron analysis of ceramics will also be conducted                 for the same goal.  With these data, it should be possible to                   determine the possibly multiple points of origin of the cargo                   and through this means help to reconstruct the patterns of trade                in the Bronze Age Mediterranean.  Historians and anthropologists                have argued about the role which Greece played at this time and                 whether or not it controlled, and was the origin for many                       products, such as bronze, which spread across this area.  Dr.                   Bass has argued that the focus was along the Eastern shore of                   the Mediterranean.  This research will help to answer this                      question.                                                                                                                                                       Anthropologists want to learn how complex widespread cultural                   systems develop.  The Bronze Age saw the emergence of just such                 a network and it is important to undersstand how it functioned,                 and the effect it had on the particular societies involved.  It                 is unclear what role such long distance trade played in the                     development of early states.  This research will help to resolve                this question.",
