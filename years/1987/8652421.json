 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Quantitative Literacy Project, sponsored by the American Statistical        Association will promote the teaching of statistics in the K-12                 mathematics curriculum by providing detailed curriculum frameworks; by          training 240 middle school and high school teachers to implement these          frameworks using carefully planned strategies which are supported at the        local level; and by using materials and methods collected and tested by         the participants.                                                                                                                                               Advice will be obtained from a group of mathematics supervisors,                district mathematics coordinators and experienced teachers of                   statistics.  This group will meet at a Supervisors Conference for three         days in order to define the scope and sequence of topics and address the        related needs of materials development for teacher training.                                                                                                    With the framework in place a five-day model teaching program will be           developed in one contiguous geographic region in which a support network        can be developed.  This network, supported by the state supervisor will         include 20 \"master\" teachers of middle school mathematics, 20 \"master\"          teachers of high-school mathematics, local statisticians from                   universities and industries, and mathematics education professors.  Each        teacher will be selected from a school which will assure that a unit on         statistics can be taught in the fall term, and will allow the master            teacher to attend six follow-up two hour discussion groups every two            weeks.                                                                                                                                                          In the second year of the project five additional institutes of 40              teachers will be hosted by resource statisticians.  At the end of the           third year, when the follow-up and evaluation are completed, the project        should produce:  A list of resource persons, including teachers of              statistics, statisticians at universities and in industry, and                  mathematics educators; materials to conduct in-service training in              statistics; a manual on how to teach basic topics in statistics;                computer software for all basic topics; references for topics not               covered by Quantitative Literacy materials; curriculum materials that           cover all basic topics; a detailed scope and sequence document for              teaching statistics, grade K through 12.",
