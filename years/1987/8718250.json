The workshop will include: industry          practitioners engaged in fluid mechanics R&D to provide information about       the problems of their industry;                                                 academics who are fluid mechanists whose interest in industrial-                oriented problems is already known or can be stimulated; managers               receptive to new approaches; and government representatives from                national laboratories.  The workshop will primarily address                     technical issues, but will also discuss institutional problems,                 the leadership role and support role of government, and the                     education of management in the materials processing community as                to the contributions that can be made via fluid mechanics                       research.",
