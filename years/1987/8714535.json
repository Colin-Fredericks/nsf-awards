 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the cooperatively                       organized Third Pan American Symposium on \"Perspectives for                     Pan American Collaboration in Experimental Physics\" to be                       held in Rio de Janeiro in October, 1987.  The Symposium is                      being organized by Dr. Leon M. Lederman of the Fermi National                   Accelerator Laboratory in cooperation with Dr. Alberto P.S.                     Santoro of the Laboratory of High Energy Experimental Physics                   of the Brazilian Center for Physics Research, Rio de                            Janeiro.  During the Symposium a review of the status of high                   energy particle physics and a survey of other physics fields                    will be presented.  The aims of the Symposium are to increase                   Latin American participation in high energy physics and in                      its associated technology and to explore opportunities for                      intra-Hemispheric cooperation in this scientific area.                                                                                                          High energy physics, while of itself a vital field of modern                    scientific exploration, also provides training for diverse                      types of scientific endeavors, and therefore aids in the                        development of a general scientific infrastructure.  Until                      such time as Latin American countries can afford to build                       more of their own accelerators, this Symposium can stimulate                    and assist in the formation of high-energy physics groups                       which can use U.S. facilities.  The two previous symposia in                    this field, in 1982 and 1983, were quite successful in                          stimulating important collaborative efforts in which Latin                      Americans made substantial contributions to collaborative                       experiments conducted in the U.S., and benefited greatly from                   their experience here.  In addition, the effect of the                          leverage of these collaborative efforts can be great in terms                   of physics education, with each Latin American teacher or                       researcher affecting in turn perhaps hundreds of students or                    colleagues.  Overall, both the scientific and educational                       benefits of this Symposium can be expected to be large.",
