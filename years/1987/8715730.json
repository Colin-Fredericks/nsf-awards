 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most lakes and reservoirs of the southeastern and central               United States differ from upper-midwestern lakes by having very                 turbid water and the presence of open-water fish species which                  feed predominantly on zooplankton (e.g., gizzard and threadfin                  shad).  These two factors have profound effects on the production               of invertebrates and fishes in lakes.  This study will examine                  how the presence of shad affects fish species interactions, as                  well as studying the impact of shad on other aspects of the lake                system (e.g., algae and zooplankton).  It seeks to extend the                   substantial understanding gained from studies of northern fish                  communities to a geographically broader portion of the country.                 Because species interactions in fishes are often complex due to                 changes in their diet and habitat use as they grow, (e.g., many                 large predatory fish begin their lives feeding on small                         zooplankton), the impact of shad and turbidity can only be                      understood by considering how each factor influences all points                 in a fish's life history.                                                               The project will utilize a series of laboratory, pond, and              whole-lake experiments designed to examine the effect of shad on                the larvae, juveniles and adults of three important sport fishes;               bluegill, largemouth bass, and white crappie.  This work                        capitalizes on a unique opportunity to study fish, zooplankton                  and phytoplankton in two Ohio reservoirs before and after the                   whole-lake introduction of threadfin shad.  The study will                      provide much needed insight into the effects of introduced                      planktivores on the resident fish fauna and their potential role                in lake management.  Ohio Department of Natural Resources is                    funding additional research on the study reservoirs which will                  add generality and depth to the total information base being                    generated.",
