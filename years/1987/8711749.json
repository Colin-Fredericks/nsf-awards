 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research is in progress along two lines.  The first line of research            concerns a two-person pebble game model of synchronous parallel                 computation and some of its applications.  This game extends the two-           person pebble game defined previously by Dymond and Tompa, and provides         a combinatorial framework for the study of issues in parallel                   computation.  The extensions are being used to abstract the control             structure of parallel algorithms.  This game has motivated the                  discovery of a key property, semi unboundedness of computations in the          parallel complexity class LOGCFL.  The second line of research deals            with some interesting theoretical questions raised by this property.            One of these questions involves a study of Boolean circuit models in            which fan-in is considered as a resource in addition to the traditional         resources such as size and depth.  Among other applications, these              models are providing a framework in which to address the question of            closure under complementation of complexity classes such as LOGCFL.                                                                                             The P.I. is a 1986 Ph.D whose proposal contains fresh ideas for                 approaching important questions in the complexity of parallel                   computation.  The proposal and the P.I.'s initial research demonstrate          that he knows the appropriate background material and has the                   capability of successfully attacking the problems proposed.",
