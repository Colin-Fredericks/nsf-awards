 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of stereoselectivity in electron transfer reactions between           metal ion complexes in solution has significance, in that it may yield          valuable information about the binding and the selectivity of proteins          with various degrees of specificity.  Potential utilization of the              results of this research is in the such areas as design and                     manufacture of pharmaceuticals, in agricultural, and in food                    chemistry.                                                                                                                                                      Asymmetric induction in electron transfer processes is an important             probe of mechanism, giving information on the interactions between              reactant molecules.  In previous work a variety of factors which                influence the extent and nature of this stereoselectivity have been             discovered.  This work, will be extended, both in breadth and depth,            by detailed kinetic and mechanistic studies designed to increase                understanding of the fundamental processes involved in the chiral               induction.  A number of new areas are specifically targeted for study:          outer-sphere reactions between similarily charged complexes where the           interactions are weak, reactions involving metalloproteins where                stereoselectivity ought to be substantial, and inner-sphere electron            transfer reactions where stereoselectivity should be enhanced.  In              addition, investigations of stereoselectivity in redox reactions                between metal ion complexes and nonmetallic substrates will be carried          out.  The results of these studies will be applied to the design of             novel optically active metal ion complex oxidants and reductants which          show enhanced stereoselectivity.  Emphasis is placed on the synthesis           of chiral ligand systems which bind stereospecifically to metal ions,           preventing racemization even in labile oxidation states.                        The resolution of the problems involved requires a combination of               reagent synthesis and the use of a variety of physical techniques;              stopped-flow kinetics, circular dichroism, chromatography and N.M.R.",
