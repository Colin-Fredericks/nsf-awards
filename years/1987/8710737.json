 "awd_abstract_narration": "An automated rapid prototyping environment for software systems has             three major components:  an (existing) prototyping language, a software         base, and an (existing) prototyping method.  The research objectives of         the project are to enable the construction of a software base with              capabilities for retrieving reusable software based on formalized               component specifications and to develop implementation techniques for           the prototyping language.                                                                                                                                       The approach will be to enhance the component specification aspect of           the prototyping language to allow reduction to a normal form, which will        alleviate inexact match problems in retrieving components from the              software base.  The use of generalization per category for structuring          the software base to aid component retrieval will also be investigated.         The relation between the specification language and the software base           operators will be established.  Efficient interpretive techniques for           implementing the prototyping language will be sought, and evaluated with        the aid of an attribute grammar based translation tool.                         Justification and Recommendation                                                                                                                                The research will enable automated prototyping based on reusable                software, which will make it practical to validate software requirements        via rapid prototyping.",
