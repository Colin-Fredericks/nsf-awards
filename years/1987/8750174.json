 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is enhancing the science education of students enrolled in         Economics by introducing computer-assisted experiments that supplement          traditionally presented materials in such courses as Principles of              Economics, Micro and Macroeconomic Theory, and Econometrics.  The               computers also add great flexibility to the treatment of topics studied         in the Senior Seminars.  The mix of technologies now available takes            advantage of the computational and graphic capabilities of each machine,        allows programming flexibility for the future, and fully utilizes the           developing computer expertise of the faculty.                                                                                                                   Economics instruction is greatly improved by bringing the computer into         the classroom, thus allowing students to run regressions, to make               forecasts, and to simulate policy outcomes with the instructor nearby.          Selected software includes Formodel 1000 for both the Macroeconomics and        the Money and Banking labs, and SHAZAM for Econometrics.  Moreover, this        new laboratory approach to teaching Economics makes students intensely          aware of integral part that computers and scientific experimentation            play in the professional lives of present day economists.  With its new         suite of computing equipment, the laboratory is able to accommodate             sections of up to thirty students.",
