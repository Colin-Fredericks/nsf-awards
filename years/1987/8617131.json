Nonetheless,                 a few researchers have kept active in the field, and have                       periodically produced results which have had a major impact on                  general concerns of linguistic theory, such as the demon-                       stration that the generative power of transformational                          grammars, without special constraints, is greater than                          supposed, and the proof of the basic learnability theorem.                                                                                                           The Principal Investigator of this proposal is one of                      those researchers who have continued to explore the mathe-                      matical properties of grammatical systems.  He is a leading                     authority on the theory of computational complexity as it                       applies to formal grammars and parsing systems.  He has now                     formulated the outlines of a new approach to the formal des-                    cription of syntactic structures, which incorporates as key                     elements a novel notation which combines the expressions of                     first-order logic with the the expressions of conventional                      phrase-structure grammars, and a view of languages as families                  of finite approximations, in place of the conventional mathe-                   matical view of a language as an infinite set of finite                         strings.                                                                                                                                                             The aim of the project is to develop the investigator's                    approach into a formal system which can be used as a tool for                   linguistic description, and which can be studied for its                        mathematical properties in new and potentially revealing ways.                  The investigator is being assisted in this endeavor by a                        collaborator who is an accomplished descriptive and theoretical                 linguist.                                                                                                                                                            The project has the potential to make significant new                      contributions to linguistic theory and also to computational                    linguistics.",
