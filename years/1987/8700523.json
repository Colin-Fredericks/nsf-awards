 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on one of the largest families of                  marine gastropod molluscs, the Conidae.  This family of mainly                  tropical marine snails is important because of its very high                    diversity, the broad geographic range of many of its species, its               ecological role as a dominant predatory group, primarily in                     shallow tropical seas of the Indo-West Pacific region, and its                  unusual danger to man.  Its neurotoxic venom, normally used to                  overpower prey organisms, has claimed at least 30 human lives;                  the venom peptides are becoming increasingly significant in                     neurobiological studies of cell membrane proteins that regulate                 ion transport.  The family also serves as a model of a type of                  evolutionary adaptive radiation characteristic of many groups of                marine organisms in the Indo-West Pacific.  These radiations have               contributed importantly to the richness of the shallow-water                    marine biota of this vast region, in contrast to other marine                   environments.  The Conidae originated at or just preceding the                  Cenozoic era.  Fossils occur throughout the Tertiary and                        Quaternary geologic record; the major expansions occurred in the                Eocene and Miocene epochs.                                                              The overall goal of this long-term project is to elucidate              important evolutionary trends in species diversity, morphological               adaptations to different environments, distribution, and ecology                in the Conidae.  For the proposed grant period the main goal is                 to improve the taxonomy and identification system of species in                 this complex and taxonomically very difficult family.  Objective,               quantitative taxonomic methods will be applied, a chronological                 study of type specimens and identity of species described through               1840 will be completed, and a revisionary study of one important                subgroup will be made.  The project will integrate study of                     fossils with continuing taxonomic, comparative biological, and                  biogeographic studies of recent species.  The results may                       increase understanding of the evolutionary processes that lead to               high biotic diversity in tropical regions and of the impact of                  these patterns of evolutionary radiations on the organization of                communities of marine organisms.",
