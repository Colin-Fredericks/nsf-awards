 "awd_abstract_narration": "Regulatory Enzymes of Amino Acid Metabolism in Maize:  The                 functional properties and biosynthesis of two isozymes of L-                    homoserine dehydrogenase from corn will be studied.  One of the                 isozymes, located in the chloroplast, is regulated and the other,               located in the cytoplasm is apparently unregulated.  DNA probes                 will be developed in order to analyze enzyme regulation at the                  level of gene expression.  Antibodies to the chloroplast enzyme                 will be developed to establish whether the two isozymes share                   antigenic determinants, to facilitate use of an expression vector               and to provide information on the nature of in vitro translation                products.                                                                                                                                                            Successful completion of these studies will contribute to an               understanding of the regulation of biosynthesis of nutritionally                essential amino acids by higher plants.  This information is                    essential for genetically engineering plants to produce high                    quality proteins.  It will provide insights into differences                    between eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms in the molecular                   mechanisms used to regulated similar metabolic pathways.",
