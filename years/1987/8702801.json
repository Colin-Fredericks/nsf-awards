 "awd_abstract_narration": "This application seeks partial funding for a FASEB Summer Research              Conference on Somatic Cell Genetics to be held July 6-10 in                     Saxtons River, Vermont.  The goal of this conference is to bring                together somatic cell geneticists and molecular, developmental and              cell biologists who utilize somatic cell genetics in their work.                Recent progress on a broad range of central questions in biology                has involved the use of somatic cell genetics.  The FASEB Summer                Research Conference has been the only meeting of its type                       explicitly focused on somatic cell genetics.                                                                                                                    The organization of the conference is intended to draw together                 investigators from the broad range of disciplines which are                     directly touched by somatic cell genetics.  Thus, many areas of                 biology will be covered and scientists who would not normally be                at the same meeting will have a chance to communicate.",
