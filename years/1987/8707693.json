 "awd_abstract_narration": "A novel approach is being used for the study of interfaces                      between small metal crystallites and oxides.  The metal                         crystallites are supported on submicron oxide particles of simple               geometric shape.  Using nonporous oxides limits the location of                 the metal to the exterior of the oxide; therefore, profile and                  projected views of the metal crystallites can be readily obtained               in a transmission electron microscope.  These views permit                      determination of technologically important parameters, such as                  contact angles, wetting and spreading of the metal, and forces of               attraction between the metal and oxide.   Registry of the atomic                planes at the interface and nucleation site identification can                  also be observed.  The relatively high surface area permits                     reactivity studies to be performed on these catalysts at standard               reaction pressures.  Thus, the information obtained has                         considerable impact on the study of metal-support interactions in               heterogeneous catalysis and in the study of metal-oxide bonding                 in ceramic science.                                                                                                                                             This fundamental information has great value in a number of                     important technologies including protective coatings, brazing                   fluxes, composite materials, metal-semiconductor contacts in                    integrated circuits, corrosion of metals, sintering of composites               and catalysts, and support effects on heterogeneous catalysts.",
