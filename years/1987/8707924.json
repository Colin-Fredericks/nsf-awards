 "awd_abstract_narration": "The needs of engineers in their interaction with engineering                    databases are very different from those of their counterparts in the            business world.  Business database management system interfaces                 typically provide only a single mode of textual communication,                  usually a structured query language.  However, in an ideal                      engineering database interface, an engineer would be able to define             constraints, give examples, point at parts of pictures, and                     (sometimes) use several modes of communication simultaneously.  This            research develops a plan for exploring the needs of engineers with              respect to database access and developing a conceptual design for a             multi-modal engineering database interface to satisfy those needs.              The conceptual design will include the formal definition of an                  engineering query language and will describe the methodology for                representing database requests in multiple modes (e.g., graphics,               engineering query language, natural language, examples, etc.).  A               prototype system will be implemented on an engineering workstation              computer (DEC MicroVAX II) to demonstrate the feasibility of the                conceptual design using a sample database of structural engineering             information.",
