 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the nineteenth century, science and engineering were becoming                significantly interconnected for the first time.  The history of the            development of modern long span wire suspension bridges affords                 advances in understanding the way in which analytical and experimental          techniques have been exploited in tandem in technological development           in Europe and North America.  Dr. Kemp, trained as an engineer and              hence bringing solid technical knowledge to his subject, proposes that          Marc Seguin played a key role in the refinement and spread of wire              suspension bridges.  Yet Seguin falls in the category of bridge-                designers--a nomadic group about whom information, even concerning              those most successful, is scarce.  In this study, Dr. Kemp examines             collections of private papers of Seguin's which he has found in France          and which he will mine in order to add an important piece to the                historical puzzle.  He argues that Seguin's approach was more practical         than Navier's rather theoretical approach and helped to set the stage           for the golden age of suspension bridges in America.",
