 "awd_abstract_narration": "Industrial machine vision, using cameras and computers to                  automate industrial inspection tasks, has proven to be harder to                introduce into factories than was anticipated.  The major reason is             that the underlying principles for extracting industrially useful               information from images are not well understood.  The objective of              this research is to construct a new research tool for studying the              information content in industrial machine vision images: a computer             simulation of image capture systems.  This simulation will combine              numerical models of lighting, surface reflection, optics, cameras,              and video electronics to synthesize images with highly accurate                 surface luminances.  Using the simulator to replace a vision                    system's camera, image processing algorithms can be tested by                   applying them to images with known information and noise                        characteristics.  When these images are compared with the outputs of            cameras, insight into the nature of camera defects will also result.            In short, this simulator provides the first tool that can look into             all areas of an image capture system, even those that are normally              inaccessible.  The principal investigator expects this to lead to new           ideas about the design of image capture systems and image processing            algorithms.  In addition, the simulator has a practical use.                    Because it can simulate images of parts that have not yet been                  built, it can be used as a tool to design industrial vision                     applications or as part of a system that automatically programs                 vision systems.",
