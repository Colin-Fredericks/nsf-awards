 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is in the control of plasma instabilities and the         study of instability driven anomalous transport.  Specifically, the             multimode feedback stabilization of plasma instabilities utilizing a new        concept of 'normal mode states' will be studied.  A state feedback              scheme in conjunction with either a state reconstructor or a Kalman             filter will be devised.  A remote suppressor appropriate for high               temperature plasma will also be developed.  Furthermore, instability            driven anomalous diffusion will be experimentally studied including its         relationship with instability parameters.  The experimental work will           utilize the redesigned Columbia Linear Machine.                                         This research effort is in the feedback control of plasma               instabilities and on the anomalous plasma transport induced by them.            Instabilities afflict all plasmas irrespective of the type of devices           they are part of and their intended applications.  These include basic          experimental devices, plasma sources for neutral, electron and ion              beams, plasma etching devices for solid state fabrication and fusion            machines. The instabilities cause non-uniformities in plasma, increased         transport and, if violent enough, can cause macroscopic break up.  The          elimination of these instabilities is sometimes necessary, but their            suppression is always desirable for better performance.  As redesigning         increasingly better equilibria has often failed to eliminate these              instabilities completely, feedback control appears to be a very                 attractive but neglected area of researach.",
