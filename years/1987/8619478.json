 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a major earthquake, damage to and in buildings can seriously disrupt         the economy while causing losses to their contents, personal injury and         death, and damage to surrounding areas.  Liability is one of several            mechanisms society relies upon to stimulate response to hazards such as         earthquakes.  This project will build on earlier research conducted by          this organization on the liability of local governments and the private         sector for earthquake hazards and losses.                                                                                                                       Since the research on local government liability was performed in 1978,         much has occurred that may have clarified or modified conclusions on the        probability of liability being imposed.  The first objective of this            project is to update the findings of that legal research using an               analysis of statutory law, regulations and case precedents.  A second           objective is to determine the impact of increases of risk management            programs and self-insurance on awareness of liability and earthquake            hazard mitigation programs.  A final objective is to disseminate the            findings to increase understanding of liability.",
