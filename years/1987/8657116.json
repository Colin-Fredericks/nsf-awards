 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research by this newly-funded Presidential Young              Investigator will explore the automation of decision-making for                 engineering design and manufacturing tasks, at a level above that of            the conventional  computer-based automation of Numerically                      Controlled (NC) machines and robots.  The main goal is to achieve a             computer environment in which engineers can acquire, represent, and             utilize domain knowledge in their decision-making processes.  This              will involve research in integrating different types of                         problem-solving methods, modeling approaches, and domain knowledge.             The resulting computer-aided engineering environment will encompass             deterministic, observational, and heuristic knowledge, and should               support engineers in both the analysis and synthesis aspects of                 decision-making.  The research activities will be conducted in close            cooperation with industry sponsors, and will include creation of an             intelligent decision-making framework, development of a cooperative             decision-making paradigm, and investigation of fundamental links                between decisions and actions.  Funding will be shared with the                 Computational Engineering Program, which is interested in the aspect            of the research addressing parallel computations.",
