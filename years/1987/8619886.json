 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Clouds Project at Georgia Tech is a research effort directed toward         the development of a distributed object-based computer system.  This            award will aid in the establishment of an experimental computer                 research facility to support work to evolve the Clouds system from its          current status as a research tool to a more robust system that will             support a wide variety of computing research.  This will involve                further development of the connection between Clouds and Unix so as to          provide the features of Clouds within a familiar environment; develop-          ment of a distributed object filing system to support named, permanent          objects; porting the Clouds kernel to more modern machines; and,                eventually, providing a distributed operating system on top of the              kernel, supporting such features as object migration for load                   balancing, a fault-tolerant job scheduler, global system monitoring             systems, support for multi-cluster structuring, transparent replication         of objects, and others.  The Clouds system will also serve as a testbed         for ongoing research in several areas including environments, software          engineering and fault tolerance.  The project will utilize a new                shared-memory multiprocessor system and a number of new workstations to         be acquired under the grant as well as equipment previously available           at Georgia Tech.  Under this award, the Clouds project will be                  substantially expanded and other research areas strengthened as well.           It is also expected that the graduate program will continue to expand           thereby providing additional needed doctoral level computer science             graduates.",
