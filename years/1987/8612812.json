 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although scientific knowledge of tropical forests is still                 incomplete, understanding of the organisms living in tropical                   rivers is even more meager.  Tropical waters provide large                      amounts of protein to the world's population, yet our ability to                rationally utilize this important resource is hampered by our                   ignorance of such basic facts as the species present in these                   habitats.  This project provides partial publication costs for a                systematic monograph that will help to rectify this state of                    affairs.                                                                             The monograph on the freshwater fishes of western Borneo is                based on the extensive collections made during Dr. Tyson Roberts'               NSF-funded ichthyological survey of the Kapuas River basin in                   1976, as well as on material from earlier collections deposited                 in European museums.  The ichthyofauna includes about 290 species               belonging to 120 genera and 40 families.  One new family of                     catfishes, three new genera and 25 new species are described.",
