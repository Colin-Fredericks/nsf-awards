 "awd_abstract_narration": "The equipment provided through this award is improving the undergraduate        laboratory for students enrolled in the intermediate-level Genetics             course.  One set of experiments is based on recombinant DNA technology          (especially as it is applied to the sequencing of DNA), while a second          set emphasizes gene product isolation and the genetic control of                development.  The work on recombinant DNA technology includes a number          of steps which can be carried out conveniently in the structured                laboratory setting.  The essential simplicity of the experiments                provides an experience which clarifies the section of the lecture               program which emphasizes molecular genetics.  These steps also introduce        the students to several widely used physical methods (e.g., agarose and         acrylamide gel electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation) and incorporate            such standard biological techniques as transformation and replica               plating in relevant ways.  Gene product isolation from Drosophila               melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans introduces students to the              biology of these widely studied organisms and to the characterization of        proteins.                                                                                                                                                       The additional equipment secured through this award (electrophoresis            units, high voltage power supply, microcentrifuge, sonicator, shaker            bath, gel slab dryers, ultracentrifuge and rotor) permits students to           perform these experiments in their logical order (rather than having the        order imposed by equipment availability), in this way gaining an                understanding of the many applications of molecular techniques to               solving basic questions in Genetics.",
