 "awd_abstract_narration": "Roots and associated mycorrhizae are unevenly distributed in            the soil.  Some three-dimensional spaces in the soil can be                     envisioned as \"hot spots\" or \"islands\" of root and mycorrhizal                  activity.  These islands affect soil structure, soil micro-                     organisms, and soil processes - forming an interconnected matrix.               The central thesis of this project is that rhizosphere islands                  are formed in soils, that islands are dependent upon above-ground               energy supply for their continuation, that mycorrhizae affect                   islands size and stability, and that islands change when                        vegetation changes.                                                                     Primary research objectives are: to develop methods to                  measure patterns of rhizosphere islands in a forest soil over a                 range of scales and to develop spatial statistical methods to                   detect patterns of islands in soils against a background of                     pattern created by above-ground (allogenic) inputs.  The below-                 ground (autogenic) inputs will be characterized using both                      conventional measures (e.g., soil pH) and newer, non-invasive                   methods of nuclear magnetic resonance.   NMR will be used                       characterize soil organic carbon (c-13 NMR) and soil organic and                inorganic phosphorus (p-31 NMR).  Proton NMR imaging (MRI) will                 be used characterize spatial 2-dimensional patterns in soils                    nondestructively.                                                                       The significance of this research lies in the quantification            of spatial patterns of physiological activity in soils.  By                     measuring this essential property one can understand how                        interacting processes in soils function to support plant growth.                        The scientists involved in this collaboration are excellent.            Institutional support is quite good.  The introduction of these                 new methodologies into ecological research could have a major                   positive effect.                                                                        The Ecosystems Studies Program recommends that this award be            made.",
