 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to study the cooling systems used in hot steel            mills with the goal of improving productivity of the steel rolling              process by increasing roll life and by reducing coolant consumption.            The research consists of an experimental portion to obtain reliable             heat transfer coefficient values and a modeling portion to simulate             the heating, cooling and mechanical response of rolls during the                rolling process.  An instrumented apparatus has been developed which            resembles the cooling systems used in steel mills and will be                   employed to accurately measure the heat transfer characteristics of             various roll-cooling designs.  This experimentally determined heat              transfer coefficient data will be utilized for input to the                     numerical simulation portion of this research.  The proposed study              will provide a basic understanding of the influence of roll cooling             on the resulting thermal and mechanical responses of the rolls and              seek alternative cooling designs which reduce roll wear or spalling             caused by the thermal fatigue stress.  The results could be used to             develop cooling design guidelines to increase roll life and to                  reduce coolant consumption.                                                          Results of this research could lead to improved productivity in            steel rolling processes and should contribute fundamental                       information on the basic heat transfer mechanisms.  The investigator            is well qualified to perform this work successfully, having worked              extensively in this research area.",
