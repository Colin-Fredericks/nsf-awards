 "awd_abstract_narration": "Narrative: During the 5 years of this Presidential Investigator                 Award, the following areas wil be investigated:                                                                                                                     (i) The lubricating effect of small particles on large particle                     fluidized beds.                                                                                                                                         The addition of a very small amount of fine particle solid lubricant            such as graphite or molybdenum sulfide can significantly reduce the             amount of attrition that occurs when larger brittle particles are               fluidized.  Examples of such particles are zeolites with low                    proportions of binder material.  By utilizing greater amounts of                binder some zeolite catalysts can be used in moving bed operations,             e.g., fluid bed catalytic cracking.  However, by using more binder,             intraparticle diffusion is affected and this may be undesirable.  If            the erosion of low binder content zeolite catalysts can be                      significantly reduced, then a whole family of fixed bed processes               could be implemented in fluidized bed reactors.                                                                                                                     (ii) The characterization of gas-solid heat transfer and                             particle mixing using changes in magnetic properties of                         tracer particles.                                                                                                                                      When solids are fed to a fluidized bed, either in batch or                      continuous operations, it is important to know how quickly these                solids mix and obtain thermal equilibrium with the bed.  For small              particle systems this information is difficult to obtain since the              processes occur quickly and the particles are too small for                     temperature sensing probes to be inserted in them.  A technique has             been developed to measure these processes by using the change in                magnetic properties of a tracer material and this technique will                allow detailed information about the heating and mixing of particles            to be obtained.                                                                                                                                                     (iii) Modeling large particle fluidized systems.                                                                                                            The widespread use of fluidized bed waste incinerators and                      combustors in the last 15 years has given rise to a renewed interest            in large particle fluidized systems.  Considerable experimental                 information is available on these systems but as yet there are few              reliable flow models to predict the behavior of such systems.                                                                                                   There are several similarities between solid-gas turbulent churning             fluidization and liquid-gas churning flow.  The latter has been                 modeled quite successfully using a phenomenological approach and it             is believed that a similar approach to gas-solid systems could be               fruitful.",
