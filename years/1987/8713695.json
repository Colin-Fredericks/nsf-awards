 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program was                  established in FY 1987 to provide substantial resources to upgrade the          research capabilities of the strongest and most productive                      predominantly minority institutions.  This planning grant project lays          the foundation for a plan that will increase the institution's quality          of research and research-related training.  Specifically, support for           this project will permit the establishment of an MRCE advisory                  committee of scientists and engineers, local leaders, and industrial            representatives who will assist the institution in evaluating its               current and future potential for performing meritorious research                during the next five years.  Alabama State University will develop              strategies to strengthen its mathematical sciences research program.            The institution will also implement summer institutes and other                 activities to involve college and high school teachers, and minority            undergraduate and high school students in selected areas of                     improvement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    This institution has the facilities and personnel to make an impact on          improving research and related educational activities in the                    mathematical sciences.  The Foundation has supported this project               because the proposed work will increase the participation of                    minorities in mathematics at several levels in the educational                  pipeline.",
