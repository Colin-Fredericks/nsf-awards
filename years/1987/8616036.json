 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Drs. Kenneth D. Willmert,                Professor, and M. Sathyamoorthy, Associate Professor, Department of             Mechanical Engineering, Clarkson University, to pursue with Dr. Yong            San Yoon, Associate Professor and Principal Research Scientist,                 Department of Mechanical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of               Science and Technology (KAIST), for a period of 24 months, a program of         research to develop a joint clearance model for mechanical devices and          to apply it in the vibrational analysis of linkages undergoing                  deformations due to high speeds and large loads.  This research also            will seek to determine the optimal design of counterweights to reduce,          as much as possible, the joint forces.  The research adds an                    international cooperative dimension to domestic research grants                 supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant No. DMC8500627) and         Air Force Office of Scientific Research (Grant No. AFOSR-84-0076) on            use of the supercomputer for non-linear analysis and optimal design of          dynamic mechanical systems.                                                                                                                                     Dr. Yoon will continue the development of the joint clearance model and         verify its accuracy.  He also will apply the Gauss constrained                  optimization method, developed by Willmert and Sathyamoorthy, to the            counterweight design problem.  Drs. Willmert and Sathyamoothy will              apply the joint clearance model to mechanisms with flexible members             using small deformation linear analysis, and they will analyze large            deformations of mechanisms with clearances.  Together these                     collaborators will optimally design mechanisms whose links are                  undergoing large deformations and whose joints have clearances.  This           project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative             Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation                between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange           of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through            collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  The U.S. and Korean               collaborators are highly respected scientists who have extensive                research experience and productive publication records in the field of          the proposal.",
