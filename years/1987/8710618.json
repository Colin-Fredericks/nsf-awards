 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fertilization self-incompatibility is an important                         characteristic of plants and, at least in a commercial sense, a                 desirable characteristic.  In its simplest form, the                            specificity of self-incompatibility is determined by a single                   genetic locus, the S locus.  The male and female parts of the                   plant must carry the same allele of the S-locus for self-                       incompatibility to occur.  In Nicotiana alata, the protein                      encoded by the S-locus has been shown to be a glycoprotein and                  evidence suggests that the glycosyl moity may play an                           important role in the self-incompatibility event.  Dr. Paul                     Ebert, in the laboratory of Dr. A. Clarke at the University of                  Melbourne will study this biological phenomenon with the goal of                understanding the molecular events which occur and the resulting                consequences.  He will do a biochemical characterization of the                 glycoproteins and a cytological study to determine their site(s)                and mode of action.                                                                  This is a biological problem of significant fundamental                    interest and one which is poorly understood at the molecular                    level.  Moreover, the economic ramifications of understanding the               basis of self-incompatibility of plants are immense since optimal               production of many economically important plants depends upon                   this phenomonum.",
