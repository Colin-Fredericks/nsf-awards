 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, students will be introduced to some of the instruments,        techniques, and concepts of modern Cellular and Molecular Biology               through a series of experiments performed with primary cultures of              skeletal muscle cells prepared from chick embryos.  The new equipment           provided through this project consists of a biological safety cabinet           and controlled-atmosphere incubator for the preparation, maintenance,           and incubation of cell cultures of skeletal muscle (a cell type that            differentiates in vitro and lends itself to a variety of cell biology           experiments), an ultra-low-temperature freezer for the storage of               perishable materials needed for cell culture, a liquid scintillation            counter, micro-computer and associated software for the quantification,         analysis, and presentation of the results of radiobiological experiments        designed to investigate the rates of synthesis, degradation, transport,         and secretion of muscle proteins, and three gel electrophoresis units           for the determination of the molecular weight and identity of muscle-           specific proteins.                                                                                                                                              These experiments will allow students to use a variety of techniques            from modern Cellular and Molecular Biology to explore some of the               fundamental properties of living cells.",
