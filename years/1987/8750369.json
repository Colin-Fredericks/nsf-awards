 "awd_abstract_narration": "The efficient preparation of undergraduate students to benefit from             participation in scientific research is a growing concern at the                institution.  The project is enhancing undergraduate readiness for              participation in research by providing more efficient, comprehensive,           and modern instruction in research methods.  Using a network system of          nine microcomputer lab stations, students are working with instructional        programs and statistical software covering the areas of research design,        statistics, and computer interfacing.  By providing direct statistical          analysis, both fundamental and advanced concepts in research methods can        be taught more efficiently and thoroughly than is possible in more              traditional research programs.  In addition, the project is covering the        uses of computers in research settings, providing students with both            conceptual and practical knowledge relevant to contemporary research            methodology.  The program should provide a model for other institutions         committed to undergraduate research.",
