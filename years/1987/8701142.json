 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal for partial support of a 4 day meeting on Eukaryotic         Chromosome Replication to be held in September, 1987 as part of an              annual series of symposia on cancer at the Cold Spring Harbor                   Laboratory.  The topics to be covered include: replication of viral             genomes, chromosome replication and gene amplification, replication             proteins, structure and function of telomeres and centomeres, control of        cell cycle progression, and related subjects.                                   Drs. Stillman and Kelly are well known for pioneering studies of the in         vitro replication of SV40 and adenovirus DNAs.  They propose to hold a          conference which will cover a wide variety of basic research in the             areas of DNA replication (in vivo and in vitro), chromosome structure,          and the regulation of the number of copies of particular genes that are         in the chromosome (gene amplification).  These are important problems of        current interest to many investigators.  The Cold Spring Harbor                 Laboratory provides an efficient but informal environment that                  stimulates discussion.  The meeting should be timely and successful.",
