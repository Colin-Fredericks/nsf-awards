 "awd_abstract_narration": "The flow quality around the circuit of the boundary layer wind tunnel           being built at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory will be               investigated using static and stagnation pressure tubes, hot-wire               anemometry, pressure transducers, and flow visualization equipment.             Distributions of mean velocity and turbulence intensity will be obtained        at a number of cross-sections so that the performance of the                    contraction, the first diffuser, the first and second corner turning            vanes, the wide-angle diffuser, the fan system, and the turbulence              management devices can be quantitatively ascertained.  Flow patterns and        causes of flow unsteadiness and separation will be studied using the            flow visualization equipment and pressure fluctuation measurements              together with hot-wire measurements.  The supercomputer facilities at           the University of Minnesota will be used for flow calculations for the          contraction and vaned bents, and the results will be compared with the          experimentally measured performance.                                                                                                                            The P.I. is highly qualified to carry out this project.  A Standard             Grant is recommended for one year only in the amount of $80,514.",
