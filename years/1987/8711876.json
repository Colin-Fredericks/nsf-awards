 "awd_abstract_narration": "Joseph Harris works in algebraic geometry.  More                           specifically he will work on problems connected with moduli                     spaces of curves, K3 surfaces, polarized varieties and n-tuples                 of points including their cohomology and line bundles.  In                      addition he will address problems concerning limits of linear                   series and curves on general surfaces and three-folds.  Finally                 he will look at problems concerning rational points on varieties                of general type.                                                                     Algebraic geometry is the study of the geometric objects                   arising from the sets of zeros of systems of polynomial                         equations.  This is one of the oldest and currently one of the                  most active branches of mathematics with widespread applications                through out mathematics and reaching into physics, computer                     science etc.  Harris is one of the very best practitioners of                   this subject with his constant flow of very deep contributions.                 This proposal will undoubtedly lead to many more exciting                       results.",
