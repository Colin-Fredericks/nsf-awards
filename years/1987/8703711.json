 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funds to allow 30 radiocarbon determinations                to be made on organic materials from the archaeological site of                 Mitoc Malu Galben which is located in Northeast Romania. This                   site, which contains at least 10 meters of stratified deposit,                  rich in both cultural and faunal remains, spans the transition                  from \"Neandertals\" to modern humans. It contains cultural                       materials from the Mousterian period (associated with                           Neanderthals) through the Gravettian and Aurignacian cultures.                  Both of the latter are associated with modern humans. Although                  some radiocarbon dates have already been obtained these are too                 few in number to properly date the entire sequence and this grant               will remedy that situation.                                                                                                                                     While archaeologists have worked for over 100 yers in Western                   Europe, the Central European sequence is very poorly known. To                  get a broader picture of what happened in Europe over this long                 span of time, this latter data is crucial and the Romanian site,                because it is so deeply stratified and so rich in cultural                      remains is extremely important. Therefore these dates are                       justified.                                                                                                                                                      Anthropologists want to know where and when modern humans                       appeared and the process which led to this. Thus sites which span               the Neanderthal . modern human transition are extremely important               and justify focussed research. The new dates, together with                     continued excavation at the site should yield extremely valuable                data.",
