 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ten undergraduates will be selected to participate in research                  projects on the Juneau Icefield, Alaska.  For 40 years, research                in the earth sciences, emphasizing geology, glaciology,                         geophysics, glaciometeorology, geobotany and surveying, has been                conducted on this icefield.  With cooperation between the                       University of Idaho's Glaciological and Arctic Environmental                    Sciences Institute and the Foundation for Glacier and Environ-                  mental Research, this research/educational activity aims at a                   total systems study of one of North America's largest icefields.                Under supervision of professors of unique experience, drawn from                the University of Idaho and other universities, each undergraduate              will select a research project and be encouraged to exercise as                 much independent judgment and initiative as possible in its                     development.  Undergraduates selected will be earth science                     students who demonstrate scholarly aptitude, motivation, and                    research potential.  Because the research experience will involve               field work in rugged glacier terrain, physical stamina will be                  necessary.  The staff will be available throughout the season for               advice and help, including lectures, seminars and site specific                 instructions in methodologies to insure an effective research                   experience.",
