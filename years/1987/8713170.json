The Conference brings               together researchers of varied disciplines from the academy,                    research institutes, industry and public-interest organizations                 with government policy-makers in a setting conducive to open and                fruitful exchange of information and ideas.  The Conference is                  designed to facilitate the rational development of coherent                     telecommunications policy by presenting the results of the best                 available current research on a wide range of key                               telecommunications policy issues, by clarifying the policy                      research agenda, and by stimulating future policy-relevant                      research.  Conference proceedings will be edited and published.                         The topics addressed at the Conference reflect the broad                range of key policy issues that confront the nation in its                      transition to a services-based information economy.  The                        dissemination of significant current research relevant to these                 issues is highly valuable to both the policy making and research                communities.",
