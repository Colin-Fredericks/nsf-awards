 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor James Glimm and a group of U.S. researchers will conduct              cooperative research with a group of Brazilian researchers under the            leadership of Professor Dan Marchesin of the Pontificia Universidade            Catolica of Rio de Janeiro.  The investigators plan to pursue two basic         scientific goals:  to understand the nature of the fundamental                  solutions for the nonlinear partial differential equations representing         conservation laws; and to devise an algorithm for the construction of           these fundamental solutions and implement it as a computer program for          systems with two dependent variables.  This program will be used to             perform highly accurate simulations of fluid flow in enhanced oil               recovery.                                                                                                                                                       To optimize the recovery of hydrocarbons under several exploitation             schemes, oil reservoir engineers use computer simulation to model the           recovery process.  The reservoir flow is described by a system of               partial differential equations governing flow through a porous medium.          Different phases or components of the fluid lead to discontinuities and         numerical simulation of these flows often involves the solution of a            system of conservation laws.  At present there does not exist a body of         theory or of numerical methods for solutions of these so-called Riemann         problems in the large, and it is this need that the investigators plan          to address.  The collaborators have made substantial contributions to           solving the Riemann problem for many systems of conservation laws and           utilizing the solutions in applications.  The theory and the computer           programs to be developed in this joint work have broad potential                application to gas dynamics, to combustion theory, to elastic and               visco-elastic solids, and to high energy physics and astrophysics -- in         fact, to any physical situation described by nonlinear conservation             laws.",
