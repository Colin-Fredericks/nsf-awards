 "awd_abstract_narration": "A broad set of research projects concerning galaxies, quasars,                  gravitational lenses, clusters of galaxies, and globular star                   clusters will be carried out.  Although substantial theoretical                 research will be done, the primary thrust is observational.  The                theoretical programs are attempts to understand, model, or                      predictbasic observational results.  Some instrumental                          enhancements uniting all of these programs have improved our                    understanding of the nature, origin, and evolution of the                       fundamental classes of extragalactic objects above.  It is hoped                and believed that such an improved understanding will provide                   critical insights into the properties of the Universe as a whole,               that is the cosmology of the Universe.                                                                                                                          The specific projects are intended to provide 1) a detailed model               for infall dominated galaxy formation, 2) a direct determination                of the nature of galaxy evolution in faint clusters, 3) a                       statistically useful sample of gravitational lenses, 4) detailed                observational studies of known lens systems, 5) a detailed study                of the properties of distant clusters of galaxies, 6) a                         determination of the quasar luminosity-redshift distribution near               the cutoff, 7) a clear determination of the nature of the                       remarkable quasar pair 1146+111B, C 8) detailed dynamical and                   population models for several well studied globular clusters, 9)                a  sample of faint variable objects located by an automated                     survey, 10) an elucidation of several detailed aspects of the                   internal dynamics and interactions of galaxies, and 11) a model                 of the effects of Malmquist biases on the extragalactic distance                scale and determinations of peculiar velocity fields.",
