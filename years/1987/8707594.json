 "awd_abstract_narration": "Little is known of the depositional histories or tectonic               settings of Cretaceous-early Tertiary sedimentary basins which                  formed in the hinterland of the Sevier orogenic belt.  Numerous                 structural studies suggest that the hinterland was influenced                   by Mesozoic-early Tertiary compression and thrust faulting.                     Others suggest periods of extension and normal fault                            development.  In addition, preserved hinterland basin                           sedimentary sequences are extremely rare.  Very little detailed                 stratigraphic, sedimentologic, or provenance analysis has been                  conducted on hinterland basin deposits.  The goal of this                       research is to better the understanding of the sedimentary-                     tectonic history of these hinterland basins.   For this                         project, Cretaceous-early Tertiary hinterland basin-fill                        in east-central Nevada will be subjected to detailed                            lithostratigraphic, biostratigraphic, and petrographic analysis.                Classical field methods involving detailed section measurement,                 description, and facies mapping, biostratigraphic and lithologic                sample collection, paleocurrent measurement, and conglomerate                   clast counts will be combined with standard laboratory                          petrographic procedures.  Synthesis of the data collected will                  be used to discern as completely as possible the following                      parameters concerning such basins: 1) types of depositional                     environments and their geographic and temporal distributions,                   2) location and composition of sediment source areas as inferred                from provenance of terrigeneous clastic units, 3) age                           relationships within the basin-fill, 4) possible changes in                     rates of basin subsidence as indicated by changes in fluvial                    style and architecture, 5) styles of tectonism in the source                    areas as reflected by vertical and lateral changes in sediment                  composition and depositional environments, and 6) geographic                    extent and temporal duration of individual basins.",
