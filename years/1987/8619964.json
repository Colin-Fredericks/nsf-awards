Klein, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, and Mr. Christian          Bay, Greenland Fisheries and Environmental Research Institute,                  Copenhagen, Denmark.  They will study the foraging strategy of muskoxen                                                               o                         in Peary Land, North Greenland.  The study area, at 83 N contains the           muskoxen, which are the northernmost population of ungulates in the             world.  At this latitude the muskoxen must compensate for limitations           in available forage  by optimizing their intake of high quality forage          in the summer and by slowing their activity in the winter.  During the          summer the muskoxens' movements and the plant species grazed upon will          be directly observed by the researchers.  The movement patterns of the          animals in the winter will be measured through the use of                       activity-monitoring collars transmitting data via satellite.                                                                                                    It is important to study the range and habitat limitations of muskoxen,         because there is a dearth of research on arctic mammals, and because            there is increasing pressure on the muskoxens' normal grazing lands             from energy and mineral explanation and from the return of aboriginal           peoples to lands not recently used by them.  This study will contribute         to an understanding of how to manage the species under restricted               resource conditions.",
