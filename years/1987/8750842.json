The Hunter College faculty has             prepared a revised and expanded one-year Molecular Biology course for           undergraduate majors which includes two updated laboratory courses in           the areas of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics.  The revised and              expanded curriculum (emphasizing basic cloning techniques, analysis of          the plasmids present in recombinant clones, isolation and                       characterization of enzymes, and structural analysis of cell surfaces)          will give students increases hands-on laboratory experience with                molecular procedures and scientific instruments.  In addition, increased        access to the course for students with limited experience in the tools          of scientific investigation will be possible.                                                                                                                   For the experienced students there is opportunity to expand their               existing knowledge by using modern molecular techniques for an                  independent honors research project.  Additional changes in the two             laboratory courses are also projected with the utilization of this same         equipment.  The major items being used to implement these changes               include high speed ultra- and micro-centrifuges, a scintillation                counter, shaker incubator and a speed-vac system.   A large fraction of         the students benefitting from these courses are women and/or members of         minority groups underrepresented in the Nation's pool of scientists.",
