 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will concentrate on three areas:  the                        completion of the proof of the q-MacDonald-Morris constant term                 conjectures, combinatorial proofs of some results related to the                B root system and the q-Selberg polynomials.  The basic theme is                the extension of techniques which are successful for the A root                 system to the other root systems.  Kadell has extended Aomoto's                 proof of Selberg's integral to the q-case and proved the q-                     MacDonald-Morris conjecture for BC root system.  This should                    extend to treat the remaining root systems.  A number of results                for Schur functions related to the A root systems have been                     proven combinatorially.  Kadell will attack some related problems               associated with the B root system.  Finally the q-Selberg                       polynomials extend the Schur functions, the little q-Jacobi                     polynomials and the zonal polynomials and it is hoped that a                    theory of these polynomials, including a combinatorial                          representation, can be based on a conjectured orthogonality                     relation.                                                                            This research focuses on the theory of combinatorial                       identities, an important subject that combines combinatorial                    ideas with deep problems and techniques from algebra and                        analysis.  The subject has recently become even more important                  with the discovery with important ties to physics.  The MacDonald               conjectures and their many variants have been the central focal                 point of this area for years.  Kadell is making significant                     progress on these deep problems and will continue to make                       exciting contributions during this research.",
