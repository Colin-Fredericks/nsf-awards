 "awd_abstract_narration": "The present status of the chemical process industries indicates                 that rather than build many new chemical plants in the near                     future, more attention will be focused on the operation,                        improvement, and modification of existing plants, many of them of               older design and of a multiproduct and/or batch nature.  The                    stimuli for such growing concerns with operational issues are                   numerous and include:                                                                                                                                           1.  heightened international competition for traditional markets                    resulting in increased emphasis on product cost and quality;                2.  the availability of low cost computer technology,                               communications networks, and electronic instrumentation;                    3.  rapid progress in new methodologies such as expert systems,                     robotics, database techniques, and sophisticated man-machine                    interfaces;                                                                 4.  the well-publicized efforts towards automation and                              computerized planning and operation in the discrete parts                       manufacturing industries.                                                   5.  recent international focus on safe operation of manufacturing                   facilities, especially those handling or processing hazardous                   materials.                                                                                                                                                  However, in spite of the rising prominence of plant operations as               a subject for discussion and management concern, computer aided                 plant operation has not yet been given a high level of attention                by the chemical engineering research community, either in                       industry or in academia.  The academic training of chemical                     engineers continues to emphasize design at the almost toatl                     exclusion of operations.  The purpose of this conference is to                  redress this situation by providing a forum for an in-depth                     review of the problems and needs in this new area of chemical                   engineering research and application and to thus stimulate                      research activity and encourage the introduction of operations                  issues in academic programs.                                                                                                                                    This conference will be the first research conference focused                   specifically on the applications of computers and computer                      technology to chemical process operations.  The attendees will                  meet for one week to assess the current status and future                       directions of computer integrated process operations.  The                      overall plan is a program arranged into eight themes:  process                  data acquisition and interfaces, process safety, operations                     planning, maintenance planning, process simulation, process                     optimization, plant networks and data bases, and expert systems                 in plant operations.",
