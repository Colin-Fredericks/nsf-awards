 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Summary:  This is an investigation of conditions under                 which mixtures of two surfactants exhibit synergism, i.e., show                 properties that are better than those of the individual                         surfactants by themselves.  There are three foci of the research:               (1) Synergism is dynamic surface tension.  Here the principal                   investigator is investigating the rate at which surface tensions are            reduced.  (2) Negative synergism.  This is a novel phenomenon recently          observed where the mixture demonstrates an interfacial property                 to a smaller extent than the individual surfactants by themselves               under similar conditions.  (3) New equations for calculating the                molecular interaction parameters that are the basis for synergism.              Synergism is investigated by measuring various interfacial properties           (surface and interfacial tension, contact angle, foaming) of the                individual surfactants and their mixtures.  Dynamic surface tension             will be investigated with their new apparatus.                                                                                                                  Significance.  Surfactants, which are used in a vast number of                  industrial processes and consumer items, are generally mixtures                 containing at least two surface-active components.  This research               will provide guidelines for the selection of surfactant pairs that can          optimize their performance in those products and processes. From the            relevant properties of the individual surfactants by themselves and             the value of an easily-measured interaction parameter, this treatment           allows one to predict: (1) whether a synergistic interaction will               occur when two surfactants are mixed and, if so, (2) the ratio                  of the two that will show maximum synergism, and (3) the                        properties of the system at that point.  This means that we now                 have a powerful, new tool for improving performance in a                        multitude of industrial processes and products.",
