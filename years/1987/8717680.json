 "awd_abstract_narration": "The visit to the Soviet Union of the U.S. Working Group 10.04,                  \"Construction in Seismic Areas\", during October 12-22, 1986, resulted in        the signing of a new protocol. Both sides agreed to participate in the          preparation of English-Russian and Russian-English dictionaries for use         in translating technical articles relating to earthquake engineering. At        the same time, the U.S. delegation was presented with a comprehensive           English-Russian dictionary which included terms commonly used in                earthquake engineering.                                                                                                                                         During the return visit of the U.S.S.R. Working Group 10.04 during May          31-June 9, 1987, a new protocol was signed, which contained the                 resolution that \"Both sides agreed to continue to work to generate a            Russian-English as well as an English-Russian dictionaries on earthquake        engineering.\"                                                                                                                                                   This action is to implement this agreement. Professor William Nash will         prepare a Russian-English dictionary containing only those words and            phrases pertinent to earthquake engineering and seismology. The                 completed volume  will be prepared by contemporary desk-top publishing          techniques and will consist of approximately two hundred and fifty              pages. The dictionary will make it possible for a user with only a              limited knowledge of the                                                        Cyrillic alphabet to translate research papers from Russian into                English. Two hundred copies of the dictionary will be  prepared                 and distributed. The dictionary will also be submitted to the                   National Technical Information Service for continued                            availability.                                                                                                                                                   Dr. Nash is eminently qualified to undertake this project. He has               an international reputation in the field of structural mechanics,               as well as through his editorship of the Journal of Nonlinear                   Mechanics. He is an active researcher in the area of earthquake                 engineering, and has for many years translated selected technical               articles from Russian into English. He also has the institutional               facilities available to complete this task.",
