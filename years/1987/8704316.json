 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            established to provide support to strengthen the research environments          and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions or                      institutions that have substantial minority student populations.                Eligible institutions must also have graduate programs in science or            programs in engineering.  Funding is provided for faculty research in           fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and for           the acquisition of research instrumentation.  Jackson State University          will use RIMI support to study senescence (process of becoming old)             and the use of parasexuality as a new tool in the control of insect             pests.  Under the broad heading of genetics and cell biology, the               Jackson State research group will use one study to search for unique            proteins during senescence by using two-dimensional gel                         electrophoresis.  In another project, the group will expose conidia             from fungi isolates to ultraviolet light to obtain mutants.  These              mutants and prototropic somatic diploids will be tested for virulence.                                                                                          This project will further the institution's goal of establishing a              Molecular Biology Research Institute at Jackson State University.  The          principal investigator of this project is a well-trained plant                  pathologist and entomologist who has published extensively in refereed          journals.  The Foundation has supported this project because more               opportunities will be available for minority faculty and students to            participate in meritorious research in molecular biology.",
