 "awd_abstract_narration": "The moss, Funaria hygrometrica, is an excellent model system               in which to study the control of cell division during plant                     development.  Biochemical and ultrastructure studies during bud                 initiation have implicated the membrane associated calcium as a                 second messenger and the involvement of the cytoskeleton in the                 ordered events leading to bud formation. Dr. Mary McCauley will                 continue these studies in Dr. Peter Hepler's laboratory with the                following approaches.                                                                1.  Examination of cytoskeletal organization under both                    normal developmental conditions and experimentally-manipulated                  conditions of Ca-stimulation or inhibition using                                immunofluorescent and fluorescent labelling of tubulin and actin                in situ and, when warranted, a freeze fixation, freeze                          substitution method of electron microscopic preparation;                             2. analysis of membrane distribution and relationships                     during both normal and calcium-modulated development, with                      particular emphasis on the plasma membrane and the                              endoplasmic reticulum and any interconnections between the two;                      3.  ultrastructrual localization of calcium during                         cytokinin-induced bud initiation using an oxalate-                              precipitation, freeze-substitution procedure, followed by                       electron microprobe x-ray analysis;                                                  Cell division during reproduction of a plant must be a                     series of events which lead to the progeny cell.  This work will                help to illuminate those events and the order in which they                     occur.",
