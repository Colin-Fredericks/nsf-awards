 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two of the most pressing and related problems in computer               vision research are motion analysis and the correspondence                      problem.  To date, most of the studies deal with these two                      problems sequentially.  The paradigm of conventional methods is a               three-step model in which motion analysis (e.g., estimation of                  motion parameters and surface structure) rely on the result of                  the correspondence problem but not vice versa.  One is therefore                forced to resolve correspondence based on the properties of                     featured elements in successive image frames, but not on their                  geometric considerations which might allow a motion                             interpretation.  If these two problems are treated on the same                  level simultaneously, then several advantages for understanding                 time-varying imagery could emerge.                                                      This research builds on previous work using this approach.              The particular topics to be investigated include 1)                             correspondence and motion analysis in realistic models; 2) three                or more view problems; 3) the use of line segments for motion                   estimation, and 4) motion analysis from perspective projection                  under restricted assumption.",
