 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flow visualization, hot-wire anemometry and laser-doppler velocimetry           (LDV) are used in a low-turbulence wind tunnel to study experimentally          the flow downstream of a two-dimensional \"momentumless\" body.  This             flow is characteristic of the wakes of self-propelled bodies (such as           aircraft or torpedoes) moving at constant velocity.  The unique                 property of this flow field which distinguishes it from jets, wakes,            and mixing layers is the very rapid decay of turbulent structures due           to lack of production of turbulent energy downstream of the body.               Smoke-wire flow visualization techniques will be employed  to                   qualitatively identify the geometry and scale of turbulent structures           produced at the body.  In addition, the streamwise decay of these               structures will be studied by moving the smoke-wire assembly                    downstream.  Three-dimensional aspects of the flow will be studied as           well.  Hot-wire and LDV measurements will be used to obtain                     quantitative descriptions of the flow field, such as Reynold's                  stresses, velocity fluctuation frequencies, and energy spectra.",
