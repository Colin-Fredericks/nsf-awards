 "awd_abstract_narration": "The computation of transport problems are especially troublesome when           the solution field contains steep gradients such as those of temperature        or concentration.  When solving such problems associated with convection        either wiggly or unstable, solutions generally result when the standard         finite difference of finite element methods are applied.  There are             schemes that add artificial or numerical diffusion to the computation to        dampen numerical instabilities.  However, such non-physical diffusion           often serves to confuse the real damping that exists in the problem.                                                                                            The objective of this Engineering Initiation project is to expand on the        recent developments in higher order schemes which are non-diffusive.  In        particular, the fractional step method will be used to treat a class of         convective dominated problems.  The benefits of this procedure includes         accuracy and a relative increase in computational scheme will be                possible.                                                                                                                                                       The institutional support is adequate and the P.I. has extensive                experience on the NSF-JVNC supercomputer.  I strongly recommend support.",
