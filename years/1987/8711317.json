 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polymerization of clathrin on the cytoplasmic side of                      translocating membranes causes the formation of coated pits and                 coated vesicles which are involved in receptor.mediated                         endocytosis, lysosomal assembly, secretion, transcytosis, and                   membrane recycling events.  The clathrin molecule is composed of                three heavy chains (180 kDa) and three light chains (35kDa) of                  two types.  The goal of the proposed studies is to understand the               molecular basis for the structural and functional differences                   displayed by the different clathrin light chains, and to analyze                their role in the function of the clathrin molecule as a whole.                    The experimental approach involves production of monoclonal                  antibodies reacting with a series of determinants spanning the                  sequence of the known clathrin light chain forms, and correlation               of light chain sequences with known biochemical functions.  The                 monoclonal antibodies will also be used to examine the light                    chain distribution on native, triskelions, coated vesicles and                  within cells and tissues.  These studies will allow correlation                 of the different forms of clathrin with specicalized                            intracellular and tissue.specific functions.",
