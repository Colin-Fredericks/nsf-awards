 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fellows for the Advancement of Mathematics Education, FAME, organized           under the direction of the Institute for the Advancement of Science at          Long Island University, Brooklyn Campus, will train 45 outstanding and          experienced middle school teachers (fellows) over a three year period in        mathematics, mathematics education and leadership, who will then serve          as school building leaders and developers of Mathematics Resource Teams.        Each fellow will train ten novice teachers (inexperienced teachers or           teachers with insufficient mathematical background), one of whom will be        selected to participate in SSET (Scientific Specialization for                  Elementary Teachers), a mathematics and science training program in             Years II and III. More than 450 novices, 75% of whom are minorities, and        15 SSET teachers will receive training. At the successful completion of         FAME, fellows will be qualified to teach at the junior high school level        in New York State and will be provided released time from teaching to           train other teachers. In year II FAME will be disseminated to Florida at        Miami University, to Texas Women's University and to New Jersey at              Trenton State College.                                                                                                                                          The anticipated outcomes of FAME's design will be: 1) A replicable              interdisciplinary mathematics curriculum for middle school teachers;2) A        functioning network of schools, universities and educational agencies;          3) Recruitment of bright youngsters, particularly minorities, for               teaching;4) A model for providing mathematics expertise to middle               schools. An evaluation is built into the project in order that the              replicability of the model may be validated.                                                                                                                    Long Island University has already established the Institute for the            Advancement of Mathematics and Science which is directed by P.I.                Madeleine Long. Because of SSET (TEI-8316798; $381,686), whose science          courses have been institutionalized, the Science Division (including            mathematics) is now actively involved in teacher training and offers            content courses especially designed for teachers and other adult                learners. LIU will fund the fourth year of SSET. Evaluation information         indicates that this program for 105 teachers has already had effect in          the classroom in improving students attitudes and scores.                                                                                                       FAME is directed at a significant problem--the critical need for                qualified mathematics teachers. Fifteen of these teachers work in a             region where 70% of the mathematics and science teachers are out of             license. Groundwork has been laid in the currently NSF funded SSET              program which involves the same pool of teachers who have been involved         in the planning of FAME. The goals are clear, the selection process and         pedagogical approach are appropriate, the staff is qualified and                experienced, the math resource team is a creative approach, the course          content is excellent, the participants are rewarded for excellence,             positive aggresive attention has been paid to women and minorities, and         tutors will help attract minorities.                                                                                                                            LIU has made a commitment of $551,863 to the project including the              directors salary after year one. At the end of the funding period the           program will be institutionalized. The school districts have committed          $424,875.  The Universities which will be used for dissemination have           commited $122,100.  Businesses have made commitments for mini-grants to         be awarded to participants to fund proposals.",
