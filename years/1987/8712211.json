 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is to provide partial support for the Third                    Conference on the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory.  This                    conference is being organized by the Center for the                             Neurobiology of Learning and Memory and will offer                              presentations and discussion by leading investigators from                      around the world.  The topic of the conference will be the                      relationship between the design of cortical and cortico-                        subcortical circuitries and the emergence of particular aspects                 or types of memory, including those involved in cognition.                      Three issues related to this topic will be discussed on                         successive days.                                                                                                                                                     First, the question of the forms of memory will be                         explored; speakers on the first day of the meeting will address                 the question of how many types of memory systems co-exist in                    brain as well as the neurobiological and psychological                          relationships existing between them.  Descriptions of the                       substrates of memory, either in terms of cellular chemistries                   or neural networks, very often fail to specify what is meant by                 \"memory\".  This practice has generated considerable an                          unnecessary confusion.  Accordingly, the conference will begin                  with an extended analysis of the characteristics of a wide                      range of learning paradigms and preparations (from conditioning                 in invertebrates to episodic memory in humans) and seek to                      identify commonalities and differences.                                                                                                                                 Nearly all learning theorists assume that most of the                   storage and processing of memory by humans and other big-                       brained mammals is accomplished by networks which run through                   the neocortex and connect it with specific subcortical regions                  such as the amygdala and hippocampus.  The second day of the                    conference will be concerned with the organized of cortical                     circuitries, what we know of their plasticity, and how their                    specialized features might be utilized for memorial operations.                 Surprisingly enough, there have been very few attempts to link                  the neurobiology of neocortex with higher psychological                         functions such as integration and partitioning of memory; in                    many senses, the second session, which will be directed at this                 issue, will be breaking new ground.                                                                                                                                     The third and last day of the meeting will explore                      cortical memory systems using computer models.  A spectrum of                   network models will be discussed, ranging from those grounded                   in physiology to more purely theoretical constructions.                                                                                                                 In summary, the conference is designed to explore in                    sequence three related questions:  1) How many forms of memory                  are there? 2) How do these forms relate to the specialized                      circuitry that characterizes cortex? and 3) What types of                       computational operations must these circuits perform in order                   to produce memory?",
