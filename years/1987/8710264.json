 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will use a method that has been developed to permit               the direct observation of a child's strategies of attention.                    Children select which information to look at by deciding which                  small doors covering drawings to open.  For example, when there                 are 12 doors covering 12 drawings, and the locations of only 6 of               the drawings are to be memorized, the most efficient strategy is                to open only the 6 relevant doors.  Preschoolers have trouble                   ignoring irrelevant information.  They tend to open all the doors               and thus recall poorly.                                                                                                                                         Three developmental steps are predicted.  First, children either                do not use a strategy or use an inappropriate strategy.  Second,                they use an appropriate strategy, but it does not help them                     learn.  Third, they use an appropriate strategy, and it helps                   them.  Much of the research will examine whether the second step                is caused by the considerable effort required for a young child                 to use the strategy.  That is, if children must put a great deal                of effort into deciding which strategy to use, actually carrying                out the strategy, and monitoring whether they are using it                      correctly, they may not have enough mental capacity left to                     rehearse verbally or concentrate on the information to which they               have attended.                                                                                                                                                  One way the research will test the effort hypothesis is by                      essentially eliminating the effort of producing the appropriate                 strategy by having the experimenter produce it (i.e., open the                  relevant doors for the child).  Children who usually can produce                the strategy but are not helped by it (stage 2 above) should now                be able to recall the relevant items well, because the needed                   mental capacity is freed by the experimenter's help.  A second                  way to test the effort hypothesis will take the opposite                        approach:  Increasing effort, by adding a second task to be                     performed simultaneously, should cause a deterioration in the use               of a strategy.  Children who normally produce, and are helped by,               the strategy should no longer be helped by the strategy.  These                 two approaches will clarify the causes of, and ways to eliminate,               the poor use of attentional strategies in young children which                  often results in learning or behavior problems.",
