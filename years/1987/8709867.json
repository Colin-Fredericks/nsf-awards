 "awd_abstract_narration": "Avirulence (avr) genes occur in plant pathogenic                           microorganisms and modulate recognitional specificities which                   permit plant hosts to detect the pathogen and invoke an active                  defense mechanism.  The long range goal of the research is to                   understand the molecular basis underlying this recognition system               and the plant defense mechanism that it modulates.  Dr. Keen has                cloned and sequenced several avr genes from members of the                      \u001aPseudomonas\u001a \u001asyringae\u001a group of pathogens and recently observed               that one of them is inducibly expressed when bacteria are                       inoculated into soybean plants.  This plant inducible expression                of a bacterial avirulence gene constitutes an important lead in                 the as yet unanswered question of the biochemical function of the               avirulence gene protein products.  Dr. Keen will further                        investigate the bacterial avr genes and how they are involved in                plant recognition of the pathogen.  He will complete the                        sequencing and expression of several additional avr genes.  He                  will study inducibility of the \u001aavrC\u001a and other avirulence genes,               and the relationship of avr genes to bacterial elicitors which                  initiate the plant defense reaction.",
