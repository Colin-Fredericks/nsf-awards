 "awd_abstract_narration": "With equipment procured through this project, modern techniques of              tissue culture are being incorporated into the Biology curriculum.  In          the sophomore course required of majors and in the five upper division          courses, these techniques are being used, e.g., to carry out experiments        in viral infection, plant and animal organ/tissue explantation, the             formation of hybridomas, and plant and animal morphogenesis.  The plant         growth cabinet and the growth chambers provide environments for                 controlled experiments and for the propagation of living material used          in the various labs.                                                                                                                                            Controlled environmental conditions are essential for many of the               experiments.  A contamination-free environment also is required to              protect both the aseptic culture material and the students.  A sterile          and safe environment is being provided by the laminar flow hood.                Finally, undergraduates now have modern phase contrast, inverted and            fluorescence microscopes for use in their studies in Cell Biology and           tissue culture.",
