 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the research is to use mathematical programming techniques          to obtain a better understanding of the general problem of separation           of several multicomponent sources into several multicomponent product           streams which may (or may not) have all the components of the feed              streams.  The approach is to generate a superstructure that contains            all possible separation sequences imbedded into, formulating the                resulting optimization problem as a nonlinear programming problem (NLP)         and solving that NLP by some standard algorithm.  The solution to this          NLP yields the separation tasks to be used, the order in which these            tasks occur and the corresponding flow rates and compositions of the            inter - connecting streams.  Routines will be investigated that will            incorporate heat integration into these algorithms.  Because utility            costs are very high for distillation columns, the economic advantages           of heat integration can substantially affect the cost of the product.           Heat integration of two or more distillation columns is possible                because there exist more than one heat source (overhead vapor and               bottoms product) and heat sink (feed and recycle streams through the            reboiler).",
