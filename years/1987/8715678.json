 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diffusivity is an important property for the design of adsorption               separation systems, gas purification, and catalytic conversion                  processes.  Porous zeolite systems are often used to perform the                transport processes.  The measurement of diffusivities in                       molecular sieve zeolites has resulted in large, unexplained                     differences between values determined by adsorption techniques                  and the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method.  The possible                  explanations for these differences are (1) failure to account for               thermal effects, (2) failure to account for mass transfer                       resistance, (3) failure to account for a surface barrier                        resistance at the crystal surface, (4) differences in the crystal               structure of the adsorbent, and (5) differences in the                          regeneration of the adsorbent.  There is now the unique                         possibility of simultaneously measuring the diffusivities in                    identical systems by three independent methods.  Analysis of the                results will yield significant insights into the dilemma of the                 large differences reported in the literature, and this study may                provide improved design capabilities for mass transfer processes                involving gas diffusion in microporous media.",
