 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for a Biological Facilities Center                             for Developmental Biology.  The University of California                        proposes to establish and/or upgrade its facilities for single.                 cell microinjection, image analaysis, flow cytometry, and                       high.pressure liquid chromatography.  The single.cell                           micro injection facility will be used to mark individual cells                  in order to follow their movements and subsequent fates                         under various experimental conditions; to inject marker dyes to                 investigate gap.junctional cell communication; to inject                        antisense RNA or antibodies to interfere with the synthesis                     orfunction of specific proteins; and to inject DNA for                          genetic transformation experiments.  Two microscopy workstations                with image processing and analysis capabilities will be                         established: one for fluorescence microscopy and one for                        differential interference contrast microscopy.  The fluorescence                microscope will be fitted with a confocal laser scanning device                 that allows the direct collection of digitized fluorescence                     images with virtual elimination of out.of.focus noise as well as                greater contrast and resolution than conventional imaging                       techniques. Both workstations will feed data to a Microvax                      facility for computerized analysis of gels and autoradiograms                   using a video densitometer for overall qualitative analysis and a               soft laser scanning densitometer for detailed quantitative                      studies.  The flow cytometry facility will be upgraded by adding                an additional laser tube and a computerized data management                     system.  A high.pressure liquid chromatography system will also                 be established.",
