 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives and Relevancy;  This project supports cooperative research           between Dr.Gyan Mohan of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpor,            India, and Dr. T.N. Krishnamurti of Florida State University.  The              research would continue work started in 1983 on numerical weather               prediction , and observational and theoretical studies for                      understanding the basic physics of the monsoon dynamics.  The project           will continue work on simple and multi-level grid point models, as well         as the global spectral model.  It will include examination of the               results of the observational analyses, and how they agree with existing         theoretical work in the field on the phenomena of monsoon depressions,          atmospheric waves, orographic effects. The U.S.-India program supports          cooperative projects in areas where capabilities complement each other          and where the research topic is of interest to both countries.  This            project meets these criteria.                                                                                                                                   Merit:  The U.S. and Indian scientists are capable researchers who have         produced significant publications under their previous grants.  They            have accomplished significant scientific results in helping Indian              scientists better model weather conditions on the national scale and            for contribution to the global weather understanding.  This project is          clearly of interest to the Government of India as well as to U.S.               atmospheric scientists.                                                                                                                                         Funding:  This project is being funded under two grants:                           Indian Inst. of Tech. Kanpur, INT-8713957:                                             FY87: $81,250           FY88: $46,094                                    Florida State University, INT-8713958                                                  FY87: $29,688           FY88: $29,687                                 All funds are in Indian currency.",
