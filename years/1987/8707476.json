 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under previous NSF funding we conducted a novel experiment to study the         internal structure of what appears to be the central uplift region of a         fossil meteor crater near Kentland, Indiana.  We request funds to               analyze these data to refine our knowledge of their structure using             three tools.  (1) Analysis of 8 miles of reversed and split refraction          data using conventional methods to resolve structural details around            the edges of 1.5 by 2 mile rectangular study area.  (2) Application of          a new technique called fan shot geotomography that can be used to               invert for lateral velocity variations on a two dimensional slice               through the earth at the depth of the refracting layer.  (3) Development        and application of a new wavefield migration technique for imaging              laterally reflected head waves.  With this technique we hope to image           major lateral discontinuties along a horizontal slice through the earth         with a resolution comparable to normal incidence reflection data images         of subsurface layering.  The later two techniques require some                  additional technical development.  With further development these               techniques may prove valuable for application to future large scale             investigations of lithospheric structure.",
