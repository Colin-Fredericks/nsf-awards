 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continuous circumferential bundles of microtubules, known as                marginal bands (MBs), are prominent cytoskeletal components in                  all non- mammalian vertebrate erythrocytes and a wide range of                  other blood cell types.  In previous work the investigator has                  shown that MBs of mature cells can maintain erythrocyte shape                   against deformation by external forces.                                             However, the function of the MB during erythrocyte                          morphogenesis from sphere to flattened ellipse remains unknown.                 In the proposed work the principal investigator will test a                     working hypothesis for the relationship between the state of MB                 assembly nd stage of cellular morphogenesis, in which pointed                   cells constitute intermediate stages.  The tests include                        recording of the precise morphological sequence by phase                        contrast/video microscopy, immunofluorescence localization of                   microtubules and centriole-containing organizing centers, and                   analysis of microtubule polarity at an early critical stage.  A                 related study on chick bone marrow erythroblasts in culture will                determine whether cells of pointed morphology are a universal                   intermediate stage.  The proposal also includes continued studies               on the structure and composition of marginal bands isolated from                dogfish erythrocytes by improved procedures, and of marginal band               proteins obtained by selective solubilization from cytoskeletons.                     These studies will enhance our understanding of the                       mechanisms involved in the biogenesis and function of microtubule               arrays.  They will also provide insight into cytoskeletal                       function during cell differentiation, a significant issue in cell               biology research.",
