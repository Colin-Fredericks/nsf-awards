 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this research is to develop techniques         for formulating and solving (optimizing) large-scale models of complex          systems and to encourage their application.  The research on                    optimization includes techniques for solving large-scale, multi-stage           (staircase, dynamic) linear-programming models, their extension to              take into account uncertainty, and the solving of certain classes of            nonlinearly constrained (large-scale but sparse) systems such as those          that arise in equilibrium analysis.  The research includes methodology          for complex models used to assess the effects of resource scarcity or           changes technology through modernization, innovation, and                       computerization, and also models used for long-term planning,                   scheduling and control of complex engineering systems such as those             that distribute energy.  The research on modeling includes ways to              formulate models of large complex systems; better ways to express end           condition in dynamic models; ways to reformulate models more                    compactly; ways to use high-speed sampling methods (such as parallel            processors) to simulate random events in order to formulate                     constraints that represent a hedge against uncertainty; and better              ways to understand, maintain and update the extensive data bases and            large number of constraints used to specify models.                                     The overall objective of this research is to develop techniques         for formulating and optimizing large-scale models of complex systems.           The optimization techniques which will be developed will be                     implemented on the computer and the resulting programs will be                  available for use on a wide variety of large optimization problems.",
