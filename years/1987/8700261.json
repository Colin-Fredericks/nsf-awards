 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gordon Research Conference on Physics and Chemistry of Laser                Diagnostics in Combustion is a high quality gathering of experts.               It is held biennially in New Hampshire to review the state of the               art and promising directions.  Although the program is structured               to cover all relevant aspects of the field, considerable                        flexibility is built in so that truly creative discussions can                  take place and new directions emerge.  In the many scientific                   areas covered by the Gordon program, the name has become                        synonymous with quality.                                                                                                                                        A 12-month grant is recommended in the amount of $3,500.",
