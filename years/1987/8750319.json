 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the curriculum currently offers lecture courses in                     Biochemistry, Molecular Genetics, and Cell Physiology, laboratory work          is available only in Cell Physiology.  Given the tremendous advances in         research that are occurring in Biological Chemistry today, this                 situation leaves Biology and Chemistry majors relatively unprepared for         advanced work (including undergraduate research projects) in these              areas.                                                                                                                                                          This project is remedying the situation by supplying equipment for a            Gene Expression Laboratory course in the Biology Department, and for new        laboratory exercises associated with the current Biochemistry course in         the Chemistry Department.  In the former course, students are learning          methods for the study of proteins, RNA and DNA at the molecular level.          In Biochemistry, a new series of experiments involving enzyme functions,        lipid and  carbohydrate analyses, and protein purification are being            added to the lab.  The collective experience of these courses are               allowing students to more fully utilize their talents as they  prepare          for scientific careers.",
