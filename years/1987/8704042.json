 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research develops methods for extending data modeling              capabilities for database systems. The role of a conceptual data                model is to store information in a manner that provides for                     efficient processing by the computer while allowing the human to                access this data in as natural a manner as possible. The approach               taken in this project is to automatically generate data models to               fit the requirements of the application environment. Research                   issues include (1) The formal specification and representation of               a family of semantically rich conceptual data models,  (2) the                  development of a rule-based approach to the generation of of                    database systems, and (3) the characterization of the performance               of systems generated by this approach. The prototype system                     produced is tested against previously defined data models and                   refined based upon the feedback gained.                                                 The significance of this research is that it offers an                  approach to removing the inflexibility of present day database                  systems. Improving database systems is critical to extending                    their use, especially for engineering and manufacturing                         information, enhancing computer assisted systems which are                      rapidly becoming the vital core of design and manufacturing.",
