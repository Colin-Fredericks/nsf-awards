 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will lead to the development of new synthetic reactions           and pathways to some important classes of biologically active                   alkaloids. It will in addition provide new routes to the important              beta-lactams.                                                                                                                                                   The synthesis of several carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring systems              will be studied with the objective of developing new methodology and            applying it to selected targets in the natural product domain.  A               photochemically mediated cyclization of beta-ketoester enolates will            be extended to a system designed to test the feasibility of this                reaction in a nine-membered ring, where annulation would afford a               tricyclic precursor to the adenylatecyclase inhibitor forskolin.  A             stannic chloride-mediated cyclization of olefinic beta-ketoesters will          also be examined for asymmetric induction where the ester is derived            from a chiral alcohol.  Application of this technology to synthesis of          diterpenes of the stemodane, stemarane, and aphidicolane group is               projected.  Finally, the cyclization of beta-ketoesters in the                  presence of manganese acetate will be investigated as a means for               elaborating novel bridged frameworks.  A route to the taxane family of          diterpenoids, specifically taxusin, has been planned around this                construct.  In the heterocyclic area, a new synthesis of beta.lactams           will be pursued that hinges on extrusion of nitrogen from the                   sulfoximine of a N-aminopyrazolinone with concomitant ring                      contraction.  This methodology will be incorporated into a chiral               synthesis of penicillins and other beta-lactam antibiotics.  In an              extension of work originally carried out by Ghosez, the use of                  hydrazones of alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehydes in the Diels-Adler              reaction will be examined as a device for preparing                             perhydroisoquinolines.  A chiral entry to the gelsemine class of                alkaloids, specifically koumine, would be explored by this means.",
