 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator's research in geometric               modeling focuses on four areas: surface patch intersections, cubic              algebraic surface patches, local surface implicitization, and                   approximate parametrization of algebraic curves.  For surface patch             intersections, he plans to continue work on computing the curve of              intersection of two parametric surface patches.  He has already                 found a method to determine if there are any closed loops in an                 intersection curve and plans to develop a general intersection                  algorithm which takes advantage of this loop test.                                   In cubic algebraic surface patches, he plans to investigate                methods of modelling with third order algebraic surface patches.                Previous work proves that they can be pieced together with C1                   continuity and that a rational parametrization can be imposed on                them.  He is working on creating the computer environment for                   modelling them.                                                                      The problem of local surface implicitization involves finding              how closely a parametric surface patch can be approximated by an                implicit surface of low degree and developing an algorithm for                  computing such surfaces.  For example, a bicubic patch generally has            an implicit equation of degree 18, but it is hoped that most bicubic            patches can be approximated with a degree four or five surface.                     Finally, an exact implicit equation can be found for any                    parametric curve, but the reverse is not true.  Professor Sederberg             is working on developing an algorithm for fitting a piecewise                   rational cubic curve to an algebraic curve.",
