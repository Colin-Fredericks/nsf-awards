 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this Engineering Initiation Award is              to develop a general methodology by which an optimized design for a             particular application can be generated autonomously by a computer              based on basic principles, experts' knowledge, and practical                    performance evaluation criteria.  The underlying hypothesis of this             research is that some aspects of the design process can be recast               into an efficient, systematic, and automated search process. The                basic mechanism is the proposed THINK-SEEK-EXAMINE scheme.  To                  accomplish this objective requires that an expert system be                     developed to test the methodology.  The domain of the expert design             system will be DC/AC electronic circuits.  The proposed design                  systems has the potential to produce innovative designs that may be             contrary to human intuition.  This methodology will also enable the             development of designs that require knowledge in more than one field            and will allow for the evaluation of new technologies.  The                     methodology may also be extended for the development of innovative              analytical techniques.",
