 "awd_abstract_narration": "The advent of super computers has brought us closer to effective                numerical models of three-dimensional reacting flows.  However,                 we are not there yet, especially in those realistic situations                  where the chemical kinetics are complex, and the grid size                      requirements are many.  Only simplified flows (especially those                 reducing kinetics to one reaction) have been calculated.                                                                                                        The originality of the asymptotic method developed by Williams                  is that he considers those special flame flows where some terms                 in the representative equations can be eliminated or linearized,                thus lending themselves to closed form solutions.  These                        solutions serve two purposes:                                                                                                                                        a.   They give a physical insight into those flows where the                         chemical constants happen to be in the range required                           for asymptotic representation.                                                                                                                             b.   They give a reliable check for the more general                                 numerical programs which will be eventually used for                            more complicated cases by the larger computers of the                           future:  by entering the same properties in the                                 numerical program as were considered for the asymptotic                         solution, the results should be identical.  This form                           of check has proved to be essential in current large                            fluid dynamics numerical programs.",
