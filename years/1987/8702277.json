 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Formal Functional Programming (FFP) machine is a novel computer             architecture that has the potential of combining high performance with          programming ease and flexibility.  It is a direct implementation of a           reduction model of computation.  Program decomposition, task                    allocation, synchronization and scheduling are efficiently automated in         the FFP machine, and therefore are removed from the programmer's                concern.                                                                                                                                                        The objective of this research is to demonstrate that such a functional         programming machine can be implemented in practical logic by designing          and constructing an advanced prototype.  The prototype will be a small-         grain highly parallel computer that is built primarily from many copies         of two building blocks: L-cells and T-cells.  System software will be           developed and the completed prototype will be evaluated.  To help               accomplish this objective, the resources of the Microelectronic Systems         Laboratory will be utilized.                                                                                                                                    This is a collaborative effort with Charles Molnar of Washington                University.                                                                     The program director considers the FFP machine to be a truly novel              computer.  Professor Mago is a leading authority in functional                  programming, and consequently is highly qualified to design and                 evaluate this machine.  Co-principal investigator Vernon Chi has an             excellent record in hardware-construction projects.  Collaborator               Charles Molnar at Washington University is well known for his expertise         in asynchronous logic; hence, his efforts on a parallel grant from NSF          will be supportive to this research.  The program director strongly             recommends funding this proposal.",
