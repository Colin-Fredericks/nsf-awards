 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clams and mussels living in environments where hydrogen sulfide                 and oxygen coexist in disequilibrium frequently lack (or                        essentially lack) both mouth and guts and rely for their carbon                 nutrition on symbiotic bacteria housed in the modified gill.  The               bacteria derive energy by oxidizing hydrogen sulfide and fixing                 carbon dioxide into organic compounds which serve as food for                   the clam.  The prototype of these symbiont-dependent animals is                 the giant white clam collected by the deep submersible Alvin,                   from the Galapagos hydrothermal vents on the floor of the Pacific               Ocean.  Similar but accessible species living in the mud of                     mangrove swamps are being studied in this project.  Specialized                 cells (bacteriocytes) in the gills of these clams house the                     symbiotic bacteria and also contain hemoglobin at great                         concentration.  It is being determined how the hemoglobin                       carries both oxygen and hydrogen sulfide from the sea water                     across the cytoplasm of the cell to the symbiotic bacteria.  The                primary aim is to reconstruct the molecular mechanism of                        hemoglobin-mediated oxygen delivery to the intracellular                        symbiont.                                                                                                                                                       It is proposed that the same molecular mechanism which delivers                 oxygen to bacteria in the clam gill serves also in the                          economically important root modules of soybeans and other                       legumes, and in the human heart.  In the soybean root nodule,                   leghemoglobin delivers oxygen to intracelluar bacteria,                         Rhizobium, which fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and supply it                 the plant.  These plants do not require nitrogen fertilizer.                    Myglobin in the human heart delivers oxygen to intracellular                    mitochondria, enabling them to make ATP, the fuel of muscle                     contraction, rapidly enough to meet the work load of the heart.",
