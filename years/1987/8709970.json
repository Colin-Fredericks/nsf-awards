The                     French creole of St. Barthelemy (St. Barth) in the French West                  Indies is an exception.  There was never a plantation economy                   (the climate and terrain of the island would not support it),                   and never a significant black population.  Nonetheless, the                     inhabitants of St. Barth speak, according to the small amount                   of linguistic investigation that has been done there, several                   distinct creole varieties, a surprising phenomenon in view of                   the history and very small size of the island.                                                                                                                       The Principal Investigator proposes to undertake a                         systematic examination of the linguistic situation on St.                       Barth, initiated with a summer field trip to gather data.  She                  is well prepared to carry out this project, by virtue of the                    dissertation research she has recently completed on language                    variation in the language enclave situation.                                                                                                                         In addition to the project's potential for increasing our                  understanding of the dynamics of creole languages, the                          Principal Investigator's participation in the project will                      enhance the teaching of undergraduate students interested in                    linguistics at the undergraduate institution which is the                       project's home.",
