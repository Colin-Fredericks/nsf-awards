 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding is provided to the Dept. of Biology at the Woods Hole                   Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) for the acquisition of equipment               to establish a facility for high resolution video analysis of                   biological systems.  The equipment consists of an inverted light                microscope with attachments for making video images, and a                      computerized motion analysis system for quantifying cell movement,              ciliary feeding mechanisms, and predator-prey interactions in a                 variety of marine organisms.  Recent studies have underscored the               fact that the flow of energy in marine ecosystems is greatly                    influenced by cell-to-cell interactions of plankton, and that                   several \"classical concepts\" regarding the role of plankton in the              marine food chain are being reevaluated as are methods of studying              plankton.  Traditional methods of working with preserved specimens              are no longer considered adequate to assess the complex                         interactions of organisms within a population.  Aquisition of the               proposed video equipment will assist WHOI investigators study and               better understand the physiological, behavioral, and ecological                 principles that affect trophic interaction in the marine food                   chain.",
