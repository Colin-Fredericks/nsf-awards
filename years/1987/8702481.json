 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of Prof. Henri E. Gaudette                and colleagues of the University of New Hampshire in a program of               cooperative research with Prof. Jader Onofre de Morais and others               of the Laboratory of Marine Sciences of the Federal University of               Ceara.  They are collaborating in an analysis of nutrient and metal             dynamics in the estuarine systems near the city of Fortaleza,                   Brazil.  While the data will be of immediate benefit in the                     management of the biogeochemistry of this rapidly growing area of               Brazil, the results of this project will also contribute to a                   broader understanding of the chemical dynamics of tropical                      estuarine systems in general.                                                                                                                                   The river estuaries to be studied--those of the Coco, Ceara, and                Pacoti rivers in the state of Ceara--are the major sources of                   land-based influence, both natural and human-produced, on the                   near-shore environment in the most heavily populated part of the                State.   The investigations to be conducted will determine the                  levels of anthropogenic impact on the three estuarine systems and               the near shore environment, and will provide a data base useful for             understanding and regulating possible long-term biological                      effects.  The investigators have already been working together on               some of these problems, with support from NSF, and this project is              an extension of that effort.  Overall, the project will utilize the             analytical expertise of the U.S. investigators with the                         experimental experience of their Brazilian counterparts, and will               help to delineate the role of estuaries in the coastal ecology of               this and similar regions, and add to our knowledge of the                       biogeochemical dynamics of tropical estuaries.",
