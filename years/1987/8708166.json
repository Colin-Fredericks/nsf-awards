 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Early Proterozoic orogenic belt in Arizona is a wide complex zone of        deformed continental crust that was accreted to North America between           1800 and 1600 Ma.  Prior work has identified several major crustal              blocks, bounded by shear zones, that underwent different structural             histories prior to their juxtaposition sometime after 1695 Ma.  These           new data strongly suggests that the Proterozoic of central Arizona              evolved by a process of accretionary tectonics analogous to accretionary        collages in Phanerozoic orogens.  This renewal project, in collaboration        with workers at the University of Northern Arizona, will extend mapping         coverage and structural analysis to a larger area, including several            terranes and possible suture zones.  Precise U-Pb geochronology will be         applied to constrain the sequence and timing of deformation and                 metamorphic events. Results will address the problem of evolution of the        Proterozoic plate margin along the southern edge of the North American          continent, and mechanisms of continental growth.",
