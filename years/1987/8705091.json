 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of reliable design procedures for the design of                 earthquake resistant structures requires an understanding of the manner         in which the surrounding earth material at the site of a structure              responds to seismic loading.  However, due to the infrequent nature of          earthquakes, and to the variability in the geology and physical                 properties of the soil at different locations, it is virtually                  impossible to provide such records for every proposed site.                                                                                                     This action is to provide equipment to measure the long period                  microtremors in the entire Los Angeles basin. Microtremors, or                  microseisms, are small tremors or vibrations of the earth that are              generated by natural occurrences such as the pounding of surf on the            shore, or road traffic. They are not associated with earthquakes, but           may be used, as is proposed here, to understand better the process of           ground shaking due to earthquakes.                                                                                                                              The measured microtremors in the Los Angeles basin will be compared with        existing strong ground motion measurements in the basin. Previous               studies of microtremor data in Japan strongly suggests that microtremor         data can be used to understand the strong motion response at a                  particular site to a damaging earthquake.                                                                                                                       The principal investigators are recognized for their expertise in               earthquake engineering studies, and have the institutional                      resources to use effectively the equipment to be purchased.",
