 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Description:  This project provides support for 15 U.S.                 scientists to participate in an international conference on gravitation         and cosmology to be held in Goa, India, 14-19 December 1987.  The               meeting is sponsored by the Indian Association for General Relativity           and Gravitation, in cooperation with the International Centre for               Theoretical Physics, Trieste, and with major scientific institutions in         India engaged in research in this area.  Topics to be covered include           spacetime structure, exact solutions, relativistic astrophysics,                gravitational experiments, gravitational radiation, cosmology, the              early universe, quantum fields in curved spacetimes, quantum gravity            and new directions in gravitation theory.                                                                                                                       Project Significance:  The conference deals with an area of science             where major developments have taken place recently.  These developments         have made interactions with Indian scientists important since India has         a distinguished tradition in the area of general relativity and there           are a number of first rate scientists in this area working there now.           The speakers are very distinguished scientists from the U.S. and from           India on the subjects of general relativity, cosmology, particle                physics and astrophysics.  The exchange of information is timely and            useful for the U.S. and Indian participants and could lead to                   cooperation in research.",
