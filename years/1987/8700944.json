 "awd_abstract_narration": "R.A. Fisher first proposed that there is a mechanism of                    selection for the evolution of a sex ratio of 1/2 males and 1/2                 females in populations in which there is equal investment in                    males of females.  Although the principles suggested by Fisher                  are widely accepted, no one has provided test results supporting                them.  Experimental testing of this theory is important to basic                scientific research, but it requires an animal system with                      genetic variation in sex ratio.  Variation of this type is found                in the platyfish, Xiphophorus maculatus, a tropical freshwater                  fish which has three sex chromosomes (W,X,Y).  This experiment                  will investigate sex ratio changes from one generation to the                   next in populations of platyfish which are initiated with sex                   ratios other than 1/2.  The results will be compared to those                   predicted by computer simulations.  This project will provide                   quantifiable results supporting a generally accepted theory of                  sex ratio evolution.                                                                 This research is important not only to basic science, but                  also has potential applications to aquaculture.  A thorough                     understanding of sex ratio evolution is necessary if sex ratio                  manipulation techniques are to be applied as a means to increase                production.  Manipulation of population sex ratios could greatly                increase production by increasing the number of offspring                       produced in the following generation.",
