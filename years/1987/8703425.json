 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whereas the positions all other atoms in chemical structures can                be determined unambiguously by the technique of X-ray                           diffraction, hydrogen atoms do not have sufficient mass to                      diffract X-rays efficiently.  Consequently, the technique of                    neutron diffraction must be used to locate hydrogen atoms, and                  this technique requires neutron sources which are available at                  only a few sites in the United States.  This research project                   involves a collaboration between the University of Southern                     California and Brookhaven National Laboratory, where the neutron                source is located.  The structures of metal hydrides are of                     considerable academic interest because they provide examples of                 unique chemical bonds, such as structures in which a single                     hydrogen atom is bonded to three metal atoms, and compounds                     containing dihydrogen molecules bound to metals.  Structural                    studies on metal hydrides and related compounds are important                   also to a clearer understanding of catalysis of reactions of                    hydrogen, of hydrogen storage in metal hydrides and of hydrogen                 embrittlement of metals.                                                                                                                                        It is proposed to determine the crystal structure of transition                 metal hydride complexes using a combination of X-ray and neutron                diffraction techniques, in collaboration with Dr. Thomas F.                     Koetzle of Brookhaven National Laboratory.  Emphasis will be                    placed on compounds having hyrogen-bridge and metal hydride                     cluster complexes.  Of special interest are complexes involving                 dihydrogen ligands, compounds containing hydrogen atoms at the                  center of a trigonal plane of three metal atoms, and compounds                  illustrating C-H-metal agostic interactions.  Structures                        containing hydrogen in the cavities of metal clusters will be                   examined in a search for examples of 5-coordinate and 8-                        coordinate hydrogen.",
