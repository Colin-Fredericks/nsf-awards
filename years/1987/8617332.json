 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamic fracture behavior of rock materials which includes crack                initiation, and propagation, is fundamental to understanding excavation         of hard rock in construction, mining, quarrying and nuclear waste sites.        In most cases excavation is accomplished with explosive loadings where          it depends on initial bore hole pressure, crack extension, stress wave          induced fractures and longer term gas pressurization in the bore hole.          The research issues in fracture and fragmentation of rock are many and          they have attracted the attention of the internaitonal research                 community.                                                                                                                                                      This award is to sponsor a workshop on Dynamic Fracture and                     Fragmentation of Geologic Materials which is to be held immediately             following the 2nd International Symposium on Fragmentation by Blasting          at Keystone, Colorado in August of 1987, and prior to the meeting of the        International Society of Rock Mechanics to be held in Montreal, Canada.         The Workshop is timed to attract the best researchers in rock fracture          and fragmentation from the international community.  The two main               objectives of the workshop are 1) to review the status of research on           rock fracture and fragmentation concerning analytical, experimental and         computational viewpoints, and 2) to establish research priorities from          both the researchers and users viewpoint.                                                                                                                       The organizing committee has been selected from well respected                  researchers in the U.S. and a tentative attendance list has been                prepared.  We anticipate that the workshop will be successful and will          provide needed direction to ensure that the NSF program in this                 important area yields productive and uniformly high quality research.",
