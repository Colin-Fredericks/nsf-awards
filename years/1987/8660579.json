 "awd_abstract_narration": "In development of coal-based energy systems, there is an acute                  need for instrumentation capable of measuring flow rates of                     solids and gas in gas-solid suspensions under high temperature                  (up to 1700oF) and high pressure (up to 100 atm) conditions.                    Several instrumentation concepts have been or are currently under               study (i.e., sonic Doppler meters, correlation meters, capacitive               transducers, Coriolis-effect meters, and laser-based devices).                  Many show some promise, although they are quite complex, and                    others require considerably more development or will be                         restricted to use only in limited flow conditions.  This proposal               represents a plan for investigation and development of an                       innovative gas-solids flow meter currently under development at                 Energy International, Inc., in cooperation with Washington State                University.                                                                                                                                                     Preliminary technical and system studies conducted have shown                   that extending the throat of a typical venturimeter will improve                the sensitivity of the device.  Further experiments and analysis                have shown that the extended-throat venturimeter will be capable                of measuring flow rates for both the solids and gas phases                      without requiring particle size information.                                                                                                                    The principal investigators are well qualified to conduct this                  research, and a grant is highly recommended.  This is for Phase I               of the Small Business Innovation Program Solicitation, NSF 86-19.",
