 "awd_abstract_narration": "Copepod feeding on the suspended phytoplankton in marine                   systems are very important links in the food web.  'recent research             on copepod feeding has shown that the process is a very active one,             achieved via the production of feeding currents, the detection of               particles of food in the water column and active capturing of                   particles.  The actual mechanisms employed in these feeding                     processes are not understood. The focus of this research will be on             the relative importance of chemoreception and mechanoreception in               feeding and the role of learning.  A unique micro-cinematography/3-D            video system has been developed to allow fine-scale observation and             experimentation with the behavior of these animals in near natural              conditions.  This system will be further developed during the award             period.                                                                              Dr. Strickler has been unique in his approach to the study of              zooplankton behavior.  He is widely regarded for the development of             sophisticated observations systems that other researchers have easy             access to.  His fundamental research contributions are equally                  regarded.  Support is strongly recommended.",
