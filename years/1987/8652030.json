 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish a working relationship between high/middle          school mathematics teachers and university research mathematical                scientists, in the Houston area, by establishing a research                     mentor/master teacher program.  There will be intensive summer                  institutes and academic year programs taught by the master teachers,            mathematical scientists and educators.  The Houston Independent School          District is the fifth largest school district in the nation with 60% of         the students and 50% of the teachers from minority groups.  The goals           are to develop a school system/university model in which the                    participating teachers' mathematical scholarship and teaching strategies        are enhanced and sustained by their interactions with research                  mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, and mathematics             educators.                                                                                                                                                      The mathematical content will include current topics in linear algebra,         probability, statistics, numerical methods, number theory, algorithms,          geometry, logic and computers.  The impact of mathematics and computer          science on contemporary science, technology and society will also be            explored.  The project will develop and publish pre-college level               teaching units, videos of demonstration lessons and related material,           and a mathematics newsletter.                                                                                                                                   For three successive summers (1987,1988,1989), 48 teachers will                 participate on Rice University's campus in six intensive weeks of               lecture/problem solving workshops, seminars, colloquia, group study,            peer group presentations and preparation of secondary level teaching            units.  The instructors of the workshops will be six master high school         teachers, who developed the content/teaching strategies with six mentor         university mathematical researchers and educators during the Spring of          1987.  At the start of the project, participants will be instructors who        teach in a gifted/talented program.  In the second and third phases,            teachers of regular classes will also be selected.                              During the academic year there will be monthly workshops, seminars and a        yearly conference on Rice University's campus.                                                                                                                  This project will be a high quality mathematical model for a long term          school system/university researcher partnership to improve pre-college          mathematical instruction.",
