 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed studies seek to elucidate the mechanisms by                   which bidirectional organelle movements are mediated and                        regulated in fish melanophore cells.  The principal investigator                has recently demonstrated that pigment granule dispersion and                   aggregation are regulated by protein phosphorylation and                        dephosphorylation, respectively.  Moreover, these studies                       suggested either that pigment granule dispersion is mediated by                 protein phosphorylation alone or that dispersion is mediated by a               unique force generating ATPase that can utilize ATP-gamma-S for                 motility.  In the proposed studies, experiments are designed to                 reveal if an ATPase is involved in dispersion.  Additional                      experiments will be conducted to determine if exogenous cAMP                    protein kinases can rescue dispersion in cells treated with 8-                  azido-ATP, which inhibits endogenous protein kinases                            and ATPases.  Studies will also be done to identify the protein                 whose phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are responsible for                 controlling the direction of pigment transport, to determine                    whether it is localized on pigment granules or in the                           cytoskeleton, and to determine if its interaction with these                    organelles differs during granule aggregation and dispersion. The               ability of isolated granules to move along purified                             microtubules or melanophore cytoskeletons will be assessed, and                 the transport proteins will be identified and isolated.                             Cell biologists have long recognized that particles,                        molecules and organelles are transported in a highly regulated                  fashion within the cell.  Recently, progress has been made in                   identifying the molecular basis of particle transport.  The                     results of the experiment proposed here will contribute                         materially to our understanding of the transporter system and the               proteins that constitute it.",
