 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is to explore, adapt, and demonstrate the use of                   mathematical programming techniques for structural system                       reliability assessment - involving kinematic model search techniques,           generalized multiparameter loading, extensions of basic approach, and           characterization of polyhedral hypersurfaces.                                                                                                                   This project utilizes the analogy between structural analysis and               mathematical programming in computing structural system reliability.            Primary consideration is given to ductile frames with plastic collapse          mechanisms, allowing extensive use of linear programming techniques.            The kinematic approach to structural limit analysis has been shown              previously to be expressible in a linear programming format, a feature          that has been ueed for identifying the critical mode of failure.  This          research extends these concepts through the application of powerful             mathematical programming techniques to the system reliabilities, and the        combined system safety.  The primal/dual linear programming analogy is          applied to analyze structural systems by the static, or kinematic               duality approach.  Multiobjective programming is also investigated for          generalized multiparameter loading.                                                                                                                             This research opens a new direction in the reliability analysis of              seletively large structural systems.  It can provide a practical tool           for the probabilistic analysis of complex structures and the development        of probability-based design criteria.                                                                                                                           Results of the work will be of importance in all branches of structural         design includig buildings, bridges, offshore platforms, reactors and            ships.",
