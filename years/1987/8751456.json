The materials to be developed will provide preservice              participants with information to assess student misconceptions and to           interpret student performance errors in order to plan and conduct               instruction aimed at correcting student difficulties.                                                                                                                   Faculty in mathematics and mathematics education from seven teacher     preparation colleges will collaborate on the conceptualization, writing,        testing, and refining of materials.  At the University of Maryland a new        course to be required of preservice secondary mathematics teachers will         be developed in which the materials will be featured and evaluated.",
