 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of Prof. William C. Conner,               Jr.,  of the University of Massachusetts, in a program of cooperative           research with Prof. Mario G. Chiovetta of the Institute of                      Technological Development for the Chemical Industry (INTEC),                    Universidad Nacional del Litoral, Santa Fe, Argentina,  aimed at                experimentally determining the changes in the morphology of catalysts           used for olefin polymerization, and at developing models for the                energy and mass transport processes that occur during                           polymerization.  The physical understanding and the capability for              process quantification that will result from this study will be used            as a basis for representing the polymerization reaction and                     calculating the dependence of polymer production and properties on              the process conditions and the changing catalysts morphology.                   Ultimately, this knowledge should lead to improvement of production             efficiency and yield.                                                                                                                                           The production of such polyolefins as polypropylene, polyethylene,              and elastomers and copolymers of ethylene-propylene is of great                 commercial interest. The slurry, bulk, or gas-phase processes by                which different polyolefins are produced depend on the catalysts used           as well as process conditions, in particular those conditions which             determine the dynamics of the catalyst breakdown.  In order to                  improve yield of polyolefins in such newer processes as that using              the gas phase, the investigators seek to obtain a detailed                      understanding of the breakdown mechanism by developing an                       experimental data base as required to define the sequence of events             occurring in the breakdown of initial catalyst particles.  They will            use the data base to develop a definition of the fragmentation                  process in terms of the sequence of events generating the changes in            the morphology of the solid particles and, finally, they will develop           a mathematical model to represent the phenomena taking place during             the entire process.  In this work, University of Massachusetts'                 experience in performing polymerization experiments will be combined            with expertise at INTEC in the modeling and simulation of                       heterogeneous polymerization processes, and overall benefit should be           realized by the polymer industries of both countries.",
