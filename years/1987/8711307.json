 "awd_abstract_narration": "The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for                   the determination of the molecular structure of compounds as                    diverse as small polypeptides and complex metal clusters.  When                 combined with the latest computer software, the technique is                    becoming remarkably easy to put into practice.  The acquisition                 of X-ray crystallographic instrumentation markedly improves the                 ability of chemists to carry out frontier research.                                                                                                             The Department of Chemistry at New York University will                         purchase an X-ray Diffractometer with support from the                          Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program.  The instrumentation                  will be used to enhance research in the following areas of                      chemistry:                                                                                                                                                         1) Synthesis of natural products; computer assisted design                         of new biologically active molecules                                         2) Application of organometallic reagents in synthesis and                         catalysis; modeling of heterogeneous processes                               3) Molecular characterization of the receptor sites of                             pharmacologically important molecules                                        4) Modeling of the active site of metalloenzymes; synthesis                        of novel cluster compounds containing sulfur and carbonyl                       ligands",
