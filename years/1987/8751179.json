 "awd_abstract_narration": "Demographic studies show a severe shortage of qualified mathematics and         science teachers throughout the United States.  At the same time there          are relatively untapped pools of prospective teachers particularly among        scientifically competent individuals who will make a career change at           mid life either because they wish to do so or because their employment          must be terminated.  This project will develop an innovative and                important model for the preparation of science teachers for middle              school teaching especially in urban areas where the need is especially          great.  The California State University System has already begun such a         program in San Francisco.  Under this grant the program will be improved        and evaluated.  The programmatic model will also be moved to one or to          Cal. State institutions in the Los Angeles area.                                                                                                                The mid-life prospective teachers will receive single subject                   credentials for middle school teaching in California.  Their programs           will involve varying amounts of cooperation from former employers and           from urban school districts.  Some will undergo most of the program             while still employed by their long term employer.  The various forms of         the program model will be carefully evaluated.                                                                                                                  Highly competent and professional science and mathematics teachers are          especially needed in the middle grades (5-9).  It is during these years         that students form important and fundamental attitudes toward                   mathematics and science and skills in those fields that strongly                influence subsequent careers and literacy.  Unfortunately, many middle          school students receive very poor experiences in math and science and           negative attitudes develop early that influence many individuals                throughout their entire lives.  This is especially true for urban               children whose culture, language, and failure orientation are special           barriers to growth and development in science.  This project is one             attempt to respond to these very important needs.",
