 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will be done by four investigators.  The first               investigator will study the consistency, rates of convergence,                  distribution theory and finite-sample properties of a class of                  nonparametric change-point estimators.  He will also investigate                the asymptotic distribution theory of degenerate U-statistics                   computed from dependent data and compare three nonparametric                    confidence interval techniques which are based upon subseries                   values of a general statistics from a stationary sequence.                           The second investigator will study aspects of smoothing                    methods, location dependent smoothing, smoothing techniques                     applied to model selection, classification, bandwidth and kernel                selection and hazard functions.                                                      The third investigator will study several estimators of data               transformation to normality or to symmetry and homoscedasticity,                generation of efficient nonlinear experimental design by                        stochastic approximation and jointly with the fourth                            investigator, he will look at nonparametric sequential age                      replacement policies.                                                                The last investigator will study the strategic implecations                of using the Ascombe-Colton model for sequential clinical trials,               as apposed to the standard Neyman-Pearson model.  He will also                  continue to study approximation methods for optimal stopping                    problemsand distributional questions for some functionals of                    Brownian motion, of statistical interest.",
