 "awd_abstract_narration": "The construction industry is America's largest industry.  Currently it          performs more than $300 million of work per year ard employs 5.5 million        workers.  These workers combined with the suppliers of materials,               machinery, insurance, and designs account for 17 percent of the work            force.  Construction has comprised 55 to 65 percent of the nation's             capital investment.                                                                                                                                             The U.S. construction industry has suffered setbacks abroad.                    International construction markets have shrunk and U.S. share in those          smaller markets has decreased.  At the same time the U.S. construction          industry suffers from severe under investment in research and technology        development, with an estimated investment of only .39% of gross                 receipts, much below those of other U.S. industries, and substantially          less than the construction industry of those countries with which we            might be expected to compete.                                                                                                                                   In discussion with the NationaI Academy of Engineering (NAE) there has          developed a suggestion that the Building Research Board (BRB) organize          and conduct a study of science and technology opportunities for the U.S.        construction industry to meet the challenge of foreign competition at           home and abroad.  In the spirit of the NAE Technological Leadership             Program, the proposed study will parallel a number of previous studies          organized by the NAE on U.S. industry competition--involving                    automobiles, electronics, steel, textiles, machine                              tools, pharmaceuticals, civil aviation manufacturing.                                                                                                           A committee of approximately 15 leaders in the construction field will          be established, representing academic, industry and government                  participants in decision-making positions.  The committee, which will           meet four times in the course fo the first year will be supported by BRB        staff and consultants in preparation of their report, which will include        recommendations for industrial response, and for university research            activity.  Funds are also provided for by the U.S. Army Corps of                Engineers, the International Development Cooperation Agency, the                National Academy of Engineering and the BRB Advanced Building Technology        Council.                                                                                                                                                        An award for partial support is recommended.",
