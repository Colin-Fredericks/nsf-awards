 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are provided to support an investigation of the phenomena that            take place when fluids are injected into a high vacuum an area in which         there have been very few quantitative studies which is surprising since         there are a large number of scientific and commercial applications of           these phenomena.  The study proposed here is directed at developing a           quantitative understanding of the interactions between the fluid                mechanics, cavitation and surface characteristics of liquid streams             injected into a high vacuum.  The work involves experiments in unique           facilities that have been designed for this type of study, along with           sufficient analyses and modelling to accomplish the purposes of                 developing a quantitative understanding of the phenomena.",
