 "awd_abstract_narration": "Questions concerning self knowledge have intrigued theologians                  and philosophers for much of recorded history.  Psychologists                   are now investigating the manner in which memory structures                     about the self influence human information processing.  In                      previous research, the self has been demonstrated to be a                       powerful encoding aid for adjective recall.  This self-                         reference effect has been most often interpreted in terms of                    either effecive encoding processes (elaborative associations)                   or effective use of existing cognitive structures (use of                       internal retrieval cues).                                                                                                                                       In this research, the mnemonic potential of the self-reference                  effect will be explored for the educationally relevent task of                  recalling prose material.  Although preliminary data indicate                   that the self-refernce effect found with adjective recall does                  generalize to connected discourse, the operative components and                                                                                                 theoretical underpinnings of this effect are not well                           understood.  In a series of studies, a number of important                      issues will be addresed.  In past research, self-reference                      instructions have often been confounded with active decision                    making.  In the research to be conducted with this grant the                    relative contribution of both of these processing activities to                                                                                                 the robustness of the self-reference effect will be assessed.                   Moreover, the degree to which similarity of the prose to the                    reader's own experiences influences the effectiveness of self-                  reference instructions will be evaluated.  The relationship of                  this concept of \"similarity\" to the \"typicality\" variable                       investigated by other researchers will also be determined.                      Finally a theoretical model of the self-reference effect will                   be tested.  This model focuses on the associability and                         constructibility of the internal cues generated by subjects at                  the time new information is encoded.  This model extends other                  models by suggesting that the property of associability is                      composed of at least two aspects -- relatedness and                             distinctiveness of the internal cues.  The explanatory power of                                                                                                 this three factor model (relatedness, distinctiveness, and                      constructibility) will be assessed in this research.",
