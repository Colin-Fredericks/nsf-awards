 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will investigate a new method for grinding the outside    (OD) and inside diameters (ID) of rolling contact bearing rings at a single     clamping of the bearing ring.  Currently, two grinding machines are             necessary; one for the OD, and one for the ID.  This proposal seeks a new       method to hold the rings without distorting them while leaving the OD and       ID accessible to the grinding wheels and thereby eliminating the machine        set-up time, tooling cost, and capital investment in one machine.  The          research work in this Phase 1 will conduct bench testing of a prototype         fixture.  This phase will also develop a computer round-up simulation           program for the grinding round-up process, incorporating the sources of         out-of-roundness.  Both of these research objectives should lead to             improved bearing accuracy and reduced manufacturing cost.  If successful,       the basis for developing a ID/OD bearing grinder will be established.           Follow-on phases are planned which involve grinding bearing rings held in a     prototype fixture and determining the actual capabilities of the ID/OD          grinding concept, followed by commercial development of a ID/OD bearing         grinder.                                                                             This research should lead to a new grinder that will produce higher        quality bearings at lower cost, which should be of significant benefit to       rolling contact bearing manufacturers as well as users of these bearings.",
