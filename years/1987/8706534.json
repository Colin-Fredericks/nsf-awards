 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mountain Research Station of the University of Colorado                is one of the nation's outstanding biological stations.  The                    facility is a national and international resource used                          extensively by researchers from a variety of institutions and                   agencies.  Research at the site, begun in 1914, has added                       significantly to our understanding of biological and physical                   processes, especially at high altitudes.  The station served as a               major site for the International Biological Programme and is now                a Long-Term Ecological site.  An extensive data base has been                   developed as a result of these and other programs, including the                Mountain Climate Program which the station has operated since                   1952.                                                                                This project will provide partial funding for renovation of                the John Marr Alpine Laboratory, the principal research building                at the station.  Specifically, NSF funding will be used for                     elimination of hazardous asbestos materials and for the provision               of handicap access to the buidling.  The University's commitment                to providing improved facilities for the conduct of field-based                 biological research is demonstrated by a substantial matching                   contribution.",
