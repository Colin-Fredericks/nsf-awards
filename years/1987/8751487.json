 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year teacher preparation project will develop and evaluate a         model for recruiting and preparing midcareer persons to teach secondary         school science and mathematics.  Mills College and the Lawrence Hall of         Science (University of California, Berkeley) faculties will address the         issues of the critical shortage of well-qualified secondary science and         mathematics teachers through an innovative two-year graduate Midcareer          Mathematics and Science Program (MCMS).                                                                                                                         The aims of the program are to:  (1) attract midcareer persons with             strong academic and applied backgrounds in mathematics and science; (2)         develop model subject update and methods courses for the midcareer              population; (3) implement a preservice teacher education program                specifically tailored to these midcareer candidates.  The new model             courses will emphasize recent developments and applications in the              fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology and their                relationships to the high school curriculum; the integration of concepts        within and across fields; and hands-on, interactive teaching strategies         developed in subject-specific methods classes and in school-based               experiences.  Course development, implementation of the model program,          and evaluation of program effects will lead to a self-sufficient                component of the Mills College credential program, to technical reports         of program development and effect, and to instructional materials which         can be implemented at other sites.",
