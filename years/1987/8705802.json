 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            established to provide support to strengthen the research environments          and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions or                      institutions that have substantial minority student populations.                Eligible institutions must also have graduate programs in science or            programs in engineering.  Funding is provided for faculty research in           fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and for           the acquisition of research instrumentation.  The Medical Sciences              Campus of the University of Puerto Rico will use RIMI support for the           acquisition of research instrumentation in neurobiology.  The                   instrumentation will broaden and strengthen the institution's                   Institute of Neurobiology as a center for meritorious research in the           Caribbean region.                                                                                                                                               The research capability of the Institute will be especially enhanced            in electrophysical and anatomical procedures.  The facility will serve          the needs of local, regional, and visiting scientists from around the           world.  The principal investigators has a commendable record of                 publications in neurophysiology.  The Foundation has supported this             project because the research and training needs of minority faculty             and students will be increased at the Institute of Neurobiology.",
