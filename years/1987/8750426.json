Using a 37 ft.              research vessel, smaller boats and a field station on 3.5 acres of land         at the mouth of Lake Erie a group of faculty from the Biology and               Geoscience, Physics and Interdisciplinary Science (GPIS) Departments are        teaching undergraduates how to conduct modern scientific research on            freshwater aquatic systems.  Both formal course work and independent            student research projects are involved.  Scientific equipment acquired          is being used for quantitative experiments in aquatic ecology,                  microbiology and sedimentology.  Unique research and instructional              opportunities are being provided for undergraduates and high school             teachers.  Major items of equipment include a portable photosynthesis           system for measuring primary productivity of emergent aquatic plants, an        epifluorescence microscope for enumerating aquatic microorganisms, and a        SediGraph 5000ET for textural analysis of fine grained sediments.",
