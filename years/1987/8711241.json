 "awd_abstract_narration": "The pineal gland is a small organ in the brain which releases a                 chemical (hormone) into the blood which in turn influences the                  reproductive system, i.e., sperm production in males and                        ovulation in females.  The amount of hormones the pineal gland                  produces depends on the day/night cycle; more darkness an animal                or human witnesses the larger quantity of the pineal hormone                    produced.  The pineal hormone of special interest in these                      studies is melatonin.  Besides the light/dark cycle,                            environmental temperature may also change either the quantity of                pineal melatonin.  The purpose of the current studies is to                     examine how light (and darkness) and temperature control                        melatonin actions on the reproductive system.                                                                                                                   The experiments will utilize an animal, the Syrian hamster, whose               pineal is very sensitive to light/dark and temperature changes.                 Male and female hamsters will be examined.  Also, the pineal                    hormone melatonin will be injected into hamsters kept under                     different environmental conditions and its actions will be                      measured.  Finally, the amount of melatonin produced in the                     pineal gland and released into the blood will be determined.  The               results of these studies will provide information on how the                    environment influences reproduction biological rhythms and other                functions in mammals including man.",
