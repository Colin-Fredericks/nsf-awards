 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            established to provide support to strengthen the research environments          and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions or                      institutions that have substantial minority student populations.                Eligible institutions must also have graduate programs in science or            programs in engineering.  Funding is provided for faculty research in           fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and for           the acquisition of research instrumentation.  Alabama A&M University            will use RIMI support to strengthen its poultry meat irradiation                technology.  Research will be conducted on the effect of combining              radurization (low dose irradiation) with other treatments (lactic               acid, whey fermented by streptococcus thermophilus) on the                      nutritional, microbiological and sensory qualities of chicken meat.             In addition, the effectiveness of using the threshold dose of Cs-137            (cobalt 60) for an identifiable irradiation flavor in the whole                 carcasses will be assessed.                                                                                                                                     Past and present work at the institution with whole lactic cultures             and extracts prepared from thermophilus milk and thermophilis whey              indicate that lactic cultures can be used to extend the shelf life of           certain meats.  The principal investigator is well-trained in                   physiology and animal nutrition and has published widely in these               fields in refereed journals.  The Foundation has supported this                 project because more minorities will participate in meritorious                 research on the irradiation of meat.",
