Organized by Eric Cross,             Penn State University at University Park, and Van Donsheng, Chemistry           Division, Chinese Academy of Sciences, this joint symposium will                support the objectives of the U.S. China Program in Cooperative Science         by promoting opportunities for cooperation in basic science between             scientists of China and the U.S. on projects of mutual interest and             benefit to both countries.                                                                                                                                      Merit of Proposal:                                                                                                                                              This symposium will bring together leading experts in the field of              cermics and will focus on topics at the forefront of research in                ceramic materials.  As scientists in both China and the U.S. achieve            breakthroughs in oxide ceramic materials with dramatic improvements in          high temperature superconductivity, and in recognition of China's               leading efforts in oxide growth, it is timely and important to bring            together scientists in these two countries to define joint projects             which reflect activity at the cutting edge of ceramics research.                                                                                                Funding:                                                                                                                                                        This is a new eight-month award under the terms of the cooperative              program.  The U.S. will be responsible for per diem costs of the                Chinese participants while in the U.S.  All costs incurred in China             will be the responsibility of the Chinese side.",
