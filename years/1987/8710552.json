 "awd_abstract_narration": "The area of superconductivity is receiving considerable attention               because of the development of the recent high-Tc ceramic                        materials.  While much work needs to be done to exploit these for               electronic applications (for example the production of good                     quality amosphous films, high quality Josephson junctions, and                  other basic circuit elements) other materials of high quality and               reasonable Tc, such as niobium oxide, have already been exploited               to demonstrate various electronic circuits.  The future of the                  superconducting electronics area looks exceptionally bright                     because of the future potential offered by these recent materials               developments.                                                                                                                                                   The present proposal deals with an investigation of the microwave               and optical properties of combined semiconductor and                            superconductor circuits.                                                                                                                                        Although the panel felt it was out-dated by the recent                          developments, it recommended funding it with the realization that               the perspective PI would have kept abreast of these and would be                sensitive to their potential in the device areas he wished to                   pursue.                                                                                                                                                         Funding is recommended with $49,840 from lightwave technology and               $20,000 from SSME.",
