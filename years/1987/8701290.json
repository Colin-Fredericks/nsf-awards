 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past 10-15 years atmospheric chemistry has evolved from            a young research discipline devoted primarily to local problems of              urban pollution and air quality to a mature science concerned with              the hemispheric to global scale cycling of a wide variety of chemical           species.  To a large extent this change has resulted from an                    increasing realization that human activities can cause chemical                 disturbances to the natural troposphere on scales far beyond local              concerns.  Well-known examples include changes in the                           regional-to-global concentrations of certain nitrogen compounds, lead           and other heavy metals, artificial radionuclides, a number of                   synthetic organic substances, certain acid-forming species, carbon              dioxide and methane.  These chemical changes in the atmosphere can              often extend to the earth's soils, oceans, and biota far from the               original source region.  They can result in alterations in the                  earth's climate, changes in vital nutrient cycles, and impact                   significantly on the public health and quality of life on earth.                    The Atmosphere/Ocean Chemistry Experiment (AEROCE) will be a                coordinated multi-institutional atmospheric and marine chemistry                research project centered in the North Atlantic region.  The ultimate           goal of the AEROCE project will be the development of a predictive              capability for the continentally derived species observed in the                marine troposphere over the North Atlantic.  The selection of sites             and the measurement protocol in AEROCE has been developed jointly by            modelers and field experimentalists.                                                This project provides installation and operational support for              AEROCE.  A network of four aerosol, gas and precipitation sampling              stations will be established in the North Atlantic Ocean at the                 following locations: Barbados, West Indies; Bermuda on the west end;            Mace Head, Ireland, on the west coast; Tenerife, Canary Islands, at             the obervatory at Izania at 2600 meters.  Each station will have a              three-pump aerosol filter sampling system and a triplet rain                    collector.  The network will be completely operational by early                 1988.  During the first year all stations will collect aerosol and              precipitation samples on a weekly basis, thereafter, on a daily                 basis.  When the four station network is in full operation, it will             yield about 6000 discrete filter and precipitation samples each                 year.  The Secondary Network Operations Group will construct all                equipment, install the stations on site, manage operations at the               site through a local cooperative, and support and maintain the                  network stations.  This group will also receive the samples and data            from secondary network stations and redistribute the materials as               required by AEROCE investigators.",
