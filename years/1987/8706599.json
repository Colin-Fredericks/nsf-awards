 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the thermal structure of continental                 crations.  The investigations will comprise (i) the measurement                 of terrestrial heat flow in both cratonic and rifted areas of                   central and southern Africa, (ii) comparative studies of the                    heat flow in and around the cratonic regions of Africa, North                   Amierica, Australia, and India, and (iii) numerical model                       studies of the effect of cratonic structure on regional heat                    transfer.  African heat flow measurement program, previously                    focussed in Botswana and Namibia, will be extended into Zimbabwe,               Tanzania, and Zaire.  These countries collectively comprise both                stable Archean cratonic terrains and rifted Proterozoic mobile                  belts of the East African Rift system.  The new measurements                    will provide additional observations with which to test the                     hypothesis that thick cratonic roots devert mantle heat away                    from Archean terrains into younger surrounding mobile belts.                    Heat flow data from the Archean terrains of North America,                      Australia, and India will also be examined in the context of the                cratonic diversion model.  numerical models of heat transfer                    beneath and within cratonic and surrounding terrains will                       examine (a) the range of parameters that yield conditions                       consistent with observations of surface heat flow and mantle                    temperatures determined from thermobarometry, (b) the effects of                cratonic scale on the diversion mechanism, and (c) the comparison               of present day conditions to those in the Archean when heat                     production was 2-3 time greater, but temperatures in the cratonic               root were similar to present-day values.",
