 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reaction engineering is an interactive discipline encompassing                  the scientific principles of chemistry, transport phenomena,                    applied mathematics, control, economics, etc.  Traditionally, its               applications were confined to the petroleum and chemical industry               but are currently spreading to biotechnology, specialty chemicals               and production of new materials.  Two major changes that occurred               during the present decade demand further evolution of reaction                  engineering:                                                                         1.  a slowdown in plant construction for large scale                          commodity chemicals and petrochemicals                                                                                                                            2.  a variety of novel processes are being developed in                         specialty chemicals, biotechnology and new materials                            (ceramics, metals, polymers, optical fibers,                                    semiconductors, etc.).                                                                                                                                     Introduction of reacton engineering principles and expansion of                 the discipline into these latter fields is needed.  This                        represents an unprecedented opportunity for significant impact of               reaction engineering on development of numerous new technologies.               How to prepare for and what should be done to meet these                        challenges of the future, are the underlying themes of this                     conference.                                                                                                                                                     The Second Engineering Foundation Conference on Chemical Reaction               Engineering (EFCRE2) will gather a group of experts from academia               and industry to assess the new trends and developments in                       reaction engineering and to critically evaluate the most                        promising future research directions.  The proposed conference                  will concentrate on two areas:                                                                                                                                       a.  Reaction engineering of new materials and batch                             processing.                                                                                                                                                     b.  The current state-of-the-art and needed new approaches                      in direct reactor design (with minimal scale-up effort)                         for large scale processes via implementation of modern                          computer technology.                                                                                                                                       Participation will be limited to 100 people, it will be held in a               secluded location, with everyone required to eat their meals                    together.  This format should encourage better exchange of ideas                than at large less structured meetings.  The PI is emerging as a                leader in reaction engineering and is well qualified to organize                the conference.                                                                                                                                                 A $20,800 grant out of FY 1987 funds is recommended to cover                    expenses of keynote speakers from the universities in the U.S.                  and to provide funds for six graduate students to attend the                    meeting.",
