 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long range objective of this program is to develop mass                     culture procedures that can be readily applied to improve the                   efficiency of producing monoclonal antibodies (MAb's).  This                    proposal focuses on using engineering approaches to describe cells at           the metabolic level so that the ways they utilize energy to proliferate         and produce MAb's can be better understood and                                  utilized to gain effective control.                                                                                                                             In Phase I, reactor systems will be tested to compare their                     performances, and they will be characterized with respect to their mass         transfer coefficients, cell densities, and MAb production rates.                                                                                                In Phase II, attention will be directed to more fundamental                     aspects such as the mathematical modeling of cellular growth and                metabolism.  Essential to this effort will be representation of                 complex biological nonlinearities within a structured mathematical              formalism.  Using these mathematical formulas, models of cellular               subsystems will be developed and then integrated to give the cell growth        model and MAb production kinetics.  The kinetic information will then be        incorporated into a reactor model to determine the most effective               production strategies and control methods.                                                                                                                      This grant application is an excellent example of the type of                   crossdisciplinary proposal we wish to see in the Engineering                    Directorate's Biotechnology Program.  It was rated very good by                 the cross-disciplinary Panel reviewing this proposal and the                    Principal Investigators are considered well qualified to carry out the          proposed research.  I recommend funding of this proposal for three years        in accordance with the revised budget.",
