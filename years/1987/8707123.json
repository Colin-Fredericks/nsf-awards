 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support will involve travel costs of speakers to a Penrose                 conference on the paleoenvironmental interpretation of paleosols.               Penrose Conferences are approved after review of the Geological                 Society of America, and operate under strict guidelines.  Their                 purpose is to foster free discussion among a carefully chosen group of          experts in the field, with the aim of identifying new directions in             Earth sciences.  This meeting will effect a reconciliation of two               separate scientific traditions:  agriculturally-oriented soil science           and geologically-oriented sedimentology.  Each research tradition has           much to offer in the exploration of what has become known as                    paleopedology.  The fossil record of soils can be viewed as a long term         natural experiement in pedogenesis in which there were fundamental              changes in soil-forming factors.  It also can be viewed as a new line           of evidence for the interpretation of major events and environments             on land in the geological past.  Ten keynote speakers and twenty                discussants have been invited.  Airfares and expenses for 6 foreign             speakers, and airfares for 24 speakers from North America are                   requested.",
