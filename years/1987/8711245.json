 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research is to characterize the proliferation and           differentiation behaviour of stem cells during embryogenesis using              monoclonal antibodies.  The research will utilize the interstitial cell         system of hydrozoan planulae, the larval form of the phylum Cnidaria, in        efforts to elucidate at the cellular level controlling factors which            regulate stem cell commitment and differentiation during embryogenesis.         Moloclonal antibodies specific for planular interstitial cells, their           differentiative intermediates and their progeny will be identified.  Dr.        Hans Bode has a library of monoclonals specific for adult hydra cells,          some of which label all the interstitial cells of hydra while others            label specific I-cell lineages.  Dr. Bode has agreed to supply these            monoclonals to determine if they can serve as cell type specific markers        for embryonic cells.  If hydra monoclonals do not work, Dr. Martin will         generate a library of planular monoclonals.                                         Very little is known about how the spatial pattern of differentiated        cells is established during embryogenesis and consequently maintained in        the adult state.  An important question in developmental biology is how         cells become restricted to a specific pathway of differentiation.  This         research is part of a continuing plan to examine the processes involved         in the commitment and differentiation of stem cells during                      embryogenesis.",
