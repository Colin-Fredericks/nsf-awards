 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates the automatic generation of                  inference rules to support intelligent data processing. For                     example, in knowledge-based systems, production rules encode                    knowledge used for expert reasoning. In database systems,                       inference rules encode integrity constraints used for semantic                  query optimization. Such rule-based systems now depend on human                 experts to supply the rules. This proposal focuses on a database                application, developing a semantic query optimization system that               automatically derives and maintains rules, based on database                    usage patterns and changes to the database state. The automatic                 derivation of rules is a promising self-adaptive database                       optimization technique that combines areas of research from both                database theory and artificial intelligence.                                            The importance of this research is that it will lead to                 improvements in the performance of many kinds of rule-based                     computer programs. System-derived rules can be more flexible and                efficient than a set developed by a human expert.  In addition,                 the criteria developed for automatic evaluation of various rule                 sets may be of use to human experts as well.",
