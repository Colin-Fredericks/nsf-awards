 "awd_abstract_narration": "Agenda politics have to do with the emergence and shaping of issues             decided by a polity.  Agenda politics are especially problematic if             issues are redistributive, i.e. threaten to redistribute existing               status, power, or rewards.  They are problematic because, some                  observers argue, access to agendas is biased against them.  In almost           any view, an agenda is a kind of gate:  except in the smallest and              simplest systems, not all issues can be decided all at once; some               selection and ordering will occur.  In the case of redistributive               issues, both the structure of the process and the behavior of agenda            gatekeepers may operate to select and order in ways that delay or               prevent such issues being decided.  Especially controversial is the             effect of legitimacy in increasing or decreasing this bias.  In this            research, five experiments will be carried out to test ten hypotheses           that bear on the bias of, and constraints on, use of the agenda power.          The variables with which the research is concerned include:  the gains          to the gatekeeper from the existing distribution of status, power, and          rewards; the threat to the gatekeeper of retaliation for use of the             agenda power; and various aspects of the legitimacy of the use of the           agenda power and of the existing distribution of status, power, and             rewards.",
