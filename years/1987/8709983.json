 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives and Relevancy: This project supports participation by U.S.           scientists, and chemical engineering educators, in a binational                 workshop with their Indian counterparts to evaluate current chemical            engineering curricula in the context of the major changes facing the            process industries.  Changes in career oppportunities for graduating            chemical engineers from the retrenching old industries to the emerging          industries of biotechnology processing, microelectronics, and materials         science and engineering, and the necessary changes in curricula will be         discussed.  The experiences in India and the U.S. are different but are         likely to be of benefit to both countries.  Proceedings and                     recommendations  resulting from the workshop will be published.  The            U.S.-India program supports such workshops where the participants from          the two countries can contribute to a useful exchange of information            based on separate and independent experiences.                                                                                                                  Merit:  The U.S. and Indian coordinators of this workshop are very well         quallified to manage it by virtue of their past research and teaching           experiences in chemical engineering.  The meeting is clearly of                 interest to the Indian Government and to a large number of educators in         the U.S.                                                                                                                                                        Funding:  None other than this action.",
