 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will focus on the determination of the            microscopic structure and lattice dynamics of physisorbed,                      incommensurate monolayers.  An important part of this study will                be the calculation of the detailed shape of the static and                      dynamic structure factors.  Calculations will be done for both                  quantum and classical solids, and will examine both finite                      temperature effects and quasi-two-dimensional behavior.  The                    importance of various energy terms will be explored, and the                    sensitivity of the results to reasonable variations in the                      interatomic potential funtions will be investigated.  The                       theoretical approach to be used in this study is a variation of                 and an extension to a nonlinear coupled-harmonics theory which                  has been successfully applied to the zero temperature classical                 solid.  This theory can be used both far from and near to the                   commensurate-incommensurate transition.  The modifications to the               original theory include the use of a self-consistent phonon to                  treat the dynamics of the solid monolayer.  Some computer                       simulations of solid phases and phase transitions will also be                  done.",
