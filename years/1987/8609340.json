 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neutral non-glyceride lipids - waxes in the broadest sense - are                major components of many marine animals from a single celled                    organisns, through higher invertebrates, to fishes and the                      mammalian toothed whales. It is estimated that the annual                       production of wax esters in just one group of organisms, the                    calanoid copepods, may approach three hundred million metric                    tons.  These same organisms are the principal food of such                      commercially important fish as herrings, sardines, anchovies, and               young salmon, as well as most of the major seabird species.                     Hence wax eters indirectly are of considerable importance to man,               from both nutritional and economic standpoints.  We have little                 knowledge on how wax eters are assimilated.  The work proposed                  will elucidate the biomedical and physiological mechanisms                      responsible for this unique capacity to assimilate an otherwise                 refractory food source.  The studies described here include both                in vivo and in vitro (enzymatic) experimental approaches with                   both wild sea birds and domestic birds (ducks, chickens, turkeys,               etc.).",
