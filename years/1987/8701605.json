 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI has recently found that virus-like shells can be                         assembled in vitro, using 14S pentameric subunits obtained                      from naturally-occuring empty capsids (i.e. procapsids).                        This system provides a basis for designing an in vitro                          reaction mixture capable of forming poliovirions.  The main                     objective of this proposal is to establish such a reaction                      mixture and to use it as an assay to purify and isolate the                     viral-specific \"morphopoietic\" factor(s) present in Hela                        cells which is responsible for forming procapsids (and virus                    particles) from 14S material in vivo.  Experiments will be                      conducted to:  1) identify its nature  2)  ascertain                            its mode of action, and 3)  quantitate the amount needed to                     support the in vitro virus assembly system.                                                                                                                     Two series of other experiments are also planned.  The first                    is aimed at characterizing the nature of the interactions                       between the virions and monoclonal antibodies to different                      viral capsid epitopes.  The second deals with the                               significance of the \"internal\" initiation site in polioviral                    RNA.  The project as a whole will contribute substantially to                   our understanding of the way proteins of poliovirus and other                   picornaviruses are synthesized and processed.",
