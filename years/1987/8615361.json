 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research addresses a key issue in damage mechanics of brittle solids        and plans to develop a new approach utilizing micromechanics concepts to        understand the fracture and damage characteristics of brittle materials         including granular solids and concrete.  The research plan includes             experimental and theoretical investigations of inelastic response and           failure mechanisms of materials which contain specific microdefects.            Controlled model experiments will be conducted where the geometry and           other characteristics of the defects that produce micro cracking and            inelastic flow are prescribed.  This procedure will allow the                   observation of the evolution of the microstructure in the course of             deformation.  This will provide quantitative estimates of the                   macroscopic parameters which characterize stresses and strains.  Model          analyses will be performed utilizing rigoroud mechanics.  Theoretical           models will be developed and verified by experimental observations.                                                                                             The Principal Investigator is in intetnationally recognized expert in           fracture mechanism of brittle and granular solids.  The institution has         an excellent laboratory facility to conduct this research.
