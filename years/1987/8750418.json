All biology majors learn to            operate the new Hitachi H-600-3 in their Junior year as part of an              intensive laboratory course in cell and molecular biology.  The                 technical and analytical skills gained in this course form the                  foundation for further work in independent Senior research courses,             which regularly result in scholarly publications co-authored by                 students.  Five faculty members in addition to the Principal                    Investigator will sponsor undergraduate investigations employing this           sophisticated instrument.",
