 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 3-year teacher preparation project will develop and evaluate               materials and strategies for preparing elementary school teachers in            mathematics.  As a joint effort of the Mathematics and Mathematics              Education departments of Indiana University and the Dyer Elementary             School of Monroe County, this project will interface with an overall            revision of the university's elementary teacher education program.  The         new program will require that each student must complete an 18-24               semester hour concentration (one choice is mathematics) and a three-            semester sequence of school -based field experiences prior to student           teaching.  Specifically, this project will address the revision of two          mathematics courses required of all preservice elementary teachers in           order to upgrade and modernize the content and to integrate problem-            solving emphases with computers and calculators.  In addition two new           courses for the mathematics specialists will be developed featuring             instruction and internships in problem-solving approaches to the                teaching of elementary school mathematics.                                                                                                                      A Vital feature of this model will be the development of a local                elementary school faculty to offer an exemplary mathematics program.            The in-service teachers of the Dyer Elementary School will cooperate in         all phases of the field experiences of the preservice teachers.  The            will receive intensive but sustained assistance to improve their own            teaching of mathematics to reflect the problem-solving goals and                emphases of the teacher education program.  They will develop their             capacities to serve as significant teaching models and as clinical              adjuncts to the campus-based components of the teacher preparation              program.  They will collaborate with project staff in the planning and          evaluating of all phases of the school-based activities.                                                                                                        Project evaluation will include systematic formative and summative              assessments of project strategies, accomplishments, and consequences.           It is expected that university course materials, including print, video         and computer/calculator components, will result.  Further, plans for            disseminating the model and materials throughout the Indiana University         system, as well as nationally, have been made.",
