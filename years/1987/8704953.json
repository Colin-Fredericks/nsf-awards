 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S. Yugoslav cooperative research                project between Krunoslav Pisk of the Rudjer Boskovic Institute's               Department of Physics in Zagreb and Richard H. Pratt of the                     University of Pittsburgh's Department of Physics is to investigate              higher order photon-electron interaction in external electromagnetic            fields.  The two groups interests and abilities are well matched and            through this joint collaboration a new method for describing                    photon-electron interactions will be developed.                                                                                                                 This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is funded through a joint             fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav            governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the                 Department of State and no NSF funds are involved.  The grants are              composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal               Yugoslav institute.  Funds include travel for U.S. scientists to                Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists'               living expenses in the U.S.",
