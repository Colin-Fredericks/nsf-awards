A project was supported by NSF and                      conducted by the American College of Radiology to study                         Engineering Research in Visual Perception:  Man-Machine                         Optimization.  This project was considered Phase A of a planning                and assessment task.  The project report contains the reference                 material for a Workshop to be conducted as Phase B of the task.                 This Workshop will expand the subject matter of the Phase A                     report to encompass the research needs of a broad technical                     audience interested in subjects that include basic research of                  visual perception to the systems and design levels of computer                  visualization.  A multidisciplinary approach will be stressed.",
