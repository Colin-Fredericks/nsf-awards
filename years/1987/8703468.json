 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific study of the judicial process in the United  States             began several decades ago with the pioneering work of such scholars like        J. Willard Hurst (the University of Wisconsin), Karl Llewellyn (the             University of Chicago), and E. Adamson Hoebel (the University of                Minnesota).  In the early days of this  movement, scholars were quite           concerned about focusing their attention on the law-in-action in                addition to the traditional interest in law-on-the-books.  The key              characteristic of this approach was its belief in examining theories,           abstract concepts, and hypotheses about the role of law, courts, and            legal processes in everyday life in terms of their actual operations.                This commitment to scientific inquiry on law is being pursued              through the U.S. Supreme Court Judicial Data Base Project.  The project         is designed to provide systematic, reliable, and standardized data on           the operations of the Supreme Court.  Beginning with the decisions of           the Warren and Burger Courts, the data base contains extensive                  information on the kinds of cases that come before the Court, the types         of decisions being made by the Court, the voting behavior and opinions          of individual justices, and the nature of the parties engaged in                litigation before the Court.  This data set is intended as a resource           for a wide-ranging group of scientists and legal scholars interested in         analyzing a variety of questions about the public's use of law and the          workings of the Court. In other fields, scholars often have a wealth of         readily accessible and standardized data on which to draw.  Until the           development of this data set, judicial scholars painstakingly compiled          their own data de novo from court records.  Not only was this expensive,        but it meant that there was little sustained attention to developing            comparable measures of theoretical and practical significance.                       Phase I of this work is being conducted by Dr. Harold J. Spaeth at         Michigan State University.  The Phase II project, under the direction of        Dr. Gibson, involves the expansion of this data set, an extensive               reliability study, and data preparation and documentation to insure the         usability of this resource.  A Board of Overseers of active scholars in         the research community continues to advise on the execution of this             project.  With this funding, NSF will have supported the creation of a          data base that is unique, heretofore unavailable, intended to reduce the        cost and redundancy of research, and compatible with the highest                standards of reliability in science.",
