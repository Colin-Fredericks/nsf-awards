Two,             four-day, seminars will be held (each seminar will consist of two days          at NSF and two days at NSB).                                                                                                                                    The meetings will provide an opportunity for NSF of acquaint                    approximately 60 faculty members from 30-40 minority institutions with          relevant NSF programs and NSF in general.  It also provides an                  opportunity for NSF program officers to meet key people at minority             institutions who can facilitate the identification of potential                 reviewers and who can identify minority researchers and encourage their         participation in NSF programs.                                                                                                                                  The strengths of the proposal are that (1) evaluations of prior meetings        have judged them useful and the evaluation of the recent joint seminar          found that the opportunity to learn about NSF programs was judged very          important to the faculty who attended, (2) joint sponsorship will               significantly reduce the costs for both sponsoring agencies, (3) this           form of activity moves beyond passive approaches of individual programs         and acts as a catalyst for personnel at both the Foundation and the             participating institutions.",
