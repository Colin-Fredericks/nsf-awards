 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will concern three areas of ecology               and population biology: food webs, infectious diseases, and age-                structured populations.                                                                 Food webs describe which species eat which other species in             a community of species.  Many food webs observed in real                        communities have led to a mathematical model that appears to                    unify and explain (for the first time) a number of these                        empirical generalizations.                                                              The proposed research will test this mathematical model                 against further empirical observations and attempt to incorporate               and explain other regularities about the roles of body size and                 distribution of biomass in communities.  The goal of this basic                 research is to establish a better understanding of the structure                of ecological communities.  The hope is that good scientific                    tools will eventually become available to help solve applied                    problems, such as the accidental or intentional introduction of                 new species, the design of nature reserves and closed ecological                life support systems, and the concentration of toxins and                       pollutants by ecological processes.                                                     Infectious diseases are a classical problem of public                   health, and a scientifically rewarding area in which study                      fundamental problems of population biology.  One specific problem               to be investigated is how to predict the effect of malaria                      control programs on death rates in developing countries.  A                     mathematical model will be developed and calibrated against a                   real malaria control program in Africa.  Another specific problem               to be investigated is why hosts and parasites have so many                      strategies of defense (e.g., antibody clones) and attack (e.g.,                 antigenic variants or strains).                                                         Age-structured populations include human populations, many              other animal populations and many plant populations.  A common                  problem is to estimate future numbers of individuals in each age                class.  The goal of the proposed work is to develop improved                    techniques for preparing projections, and estimates of the                      uncertainty of projections, that take account of random variation               in the birth and death rates that the population has experienced                and will experience.",
