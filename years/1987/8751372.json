 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of            linking computer conferencing and workshops as a strategy to reinforce          and motivate teachers to put to use in their classrooms and laboratories        what they learn in workshops, to encourage teachers to develop                  modifications of ideas and methods they have been exposed to in                 workshops, and to stimulate the creation and sharing of new ideas among         teachers.                                                                                                                                                       Those participating in the study are science teachers in the Merrimack          Valley of Massachusetts teaching in public schools, private schools, and        colleges.  This mix of participants, collaborating as equals and                colleagues is a special feature of this study.                                                                                                                  The outcome of this project will be useful information both for those           who give workshops and for those seeking to foster the use of computer          conferencing among teachers.  The project's successful conclusion will          have broad application as a useful model for the collaboration of               science teachers.",
