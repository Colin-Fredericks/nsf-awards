 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry               Program is designed to provide deeper understanding of molecular                structure and reactivity in organic compounds.  This new                        knowledge is to be gained through preparation and study of new                  molecules representative of polyfunctional and topological types                not encountered among natural products.                                                                                                                         Several projects will be undertaken in the areas of non-natural                 products organic chemistry.  Emphasis will be given to the                      completion of ongoing work involving cyclooctatetraenes, relay                  orbital systems, and highly unsaturated propellanes.  New studies               to be initiated will involve the development of a route to                      truncated tetrahedrane and its triene isomer, together with                     thermochemical assessment of homoaromaticity in the latter.                     Another aspect of the investigation is to focus on the                          preparation of the first known sigma-allyl cation and a detailed                analysis of the new structural framework involved.  Other work                  will be aimed at the first preparation of an organic \"belt\".                    Access to this new type of molecular host will likewise require a               major synthetic effort.  Once the prototype approach is                         successfully realized, avenues to larger beltenes will hopefully                be opened.  Detailed investigation will also be made of alpha-                  silyl carbanions, where preservation of configurational stability               has been observed in preliminary studies.",
