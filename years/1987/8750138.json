 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Biology Department is implementing a curricular change which is            designed to provide Biology majors and other Science students with              experience in using a modern, quantitative approach in their laboratory         studies rather than the more descriptive approach of former years.  Most        changes involve the Molecular-Cellular Biology course which is being            expanded into a two-semester format.  There is a parallel upgrading of          its laboratories under way.                                                                                                                                     New, significantly improved laboratory exercises are being made possible        through the acquisition of a gas chromatograph, a UV-visible                    spectrophotometer and a liquid scintillation counter.  Further                  improvements in the program are being made by extending the Department's        new analytical capabilities to other courses, and by supplementing such         work in the introductory laboratories for Science majors.",
