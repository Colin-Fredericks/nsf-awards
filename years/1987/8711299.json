 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will continue modeling studies of coupled                    estuary-shelf subtidal frequency circulation, both density-and                  wind driven.  Five particular objectives are posed: 1. A                        critical evaluation of plume models developed during previous                   work in comparison with observations of the Chesapeake plume                    obtained during the MECCAS program; 2. development of a                         simplified version of the estuary plume model that can be used                  to model plumes in ambient, inner shelf waters that have more                   complicated dynamics than the uniform longshore current how                     assumed; 3. Improvement of the existing steady-state plume                      model to include the effects of interfacial friction, mass                      entrainment, and buoyancy loss by vertical mixing beneath the                   plume; 4. Development of diagnostic models of density- and wind                 driven shelf circulation offshore of a major estuary; and, 5.                   Use of the results of the fourth for the inner shelf                            circulation description of estuary plume model of the second to                 provide a description of estuary plume dynamics on the inner                    continental shelf to include all major physical mechanisms for                  both the density and the wind-driven parts.",
