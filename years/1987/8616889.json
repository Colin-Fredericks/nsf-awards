 "awd_abstract_narration": "Operating procedures for chemical, nuclear, and petroleum                  processing  systems are important for safe, reliable, and efficient             operation.   Synthesizing high-quality procedures is a demanding task           that requires  the ability to combine knowledge of the goals of the             processing system with knowledge of the constraints on the operating            range of the process equipment, on instrumentation, and on human                operations.                                                                          The principal investigator proposes to create a methodology for            partially automating the synthesis of operating procedures.  To achieve         this goal requires research along two separate, but parallel avenues.           Research is needed both to identify the important parameters and models         for a particular processing system and also to create a methodology for         generating operating procedures that deals with constraint formulation,         constraint propagation, and constraint satisfaction.  The research will         draw on prior work in computer science and engineering design on                planning and on constraint propagation.  The principal investigator will        use an exothermic recycle reactor system to test the methodology.",
