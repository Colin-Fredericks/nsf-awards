 "awd_abstract_narration": "At the start of the twentieth century, Americans entered what                   historians have identified as the Progressive period, so named                  for its characteristic optimism about the chances for building a                better society in this country.  A crucial element in the                       reformers' belief that they could defeat corruption as well as                  resolve stubborn economic and social problems was an enthusiasm                 for harnessing scientific experts as unbiased problem solvers.                  The establishment of the first engineering experiment stations on               land-grant college campuses is one implementation of the idea of                research as the key to a better society.  According to such early               promoters of the concept as Dean Anson Marston of the Iowa State                Agricultural and Mechanical College, the stations would provide                 unbiased answers to the questions faced by municipal and state                  government and interested citizens as a result of rapid                         urbanization and industrialization.  Dr. Seely's novel and timely               study shows that the influx of federal funding marks the gradual                movement of American engineering education away from an emphasis                on hands-on, practical instruction in the use of tools and                      machinery toward a curriculum stressing calculus, physics and                   other science courses which undergirds basic research.                                                                                                          Specifically, Dr. Seely examines the leading engineering                        experiment stations.  His study traces the history and                          development of an important element of engineering education in                 land-grant colleges.  It also adds to our understanding of the                  history of R & D by examining the interaction of universities                   with the other major sponsors of scientific research in this                    country. And, what is particularly interesting in view of                       currently increasing federal funding of research in engineering,                he shows how shifts in the sources of funds affected both the                   types and goals of station research.                                                                                                                            Dr. Seely is highly qualified to undertake this study which flows               naturally from the solid work that he did for his dissertation on               the Texas A & M University engineering experiment station.  In                  addition, he has already done in-depth work on a number of the                  leading stations which provides him with a foundation for                       excellence in his future work in this area.",
