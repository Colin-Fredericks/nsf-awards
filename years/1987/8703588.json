 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is designed to study aging in rural               China.  The researcher will focus on the impact of China's new                  economic system on the lives of the elderly and their families in               two villages which have proposered differently under                            modernization programs.                                                                 This project offers a rare opportunity to test current                  gerontological theories by examining aging in a non.Western                     society in the first phase of a massive program of economic                     modernization.  It will provide base line data for future studies               in Asia and information on the rural elderly who are often                      overlooked in scholarly studies.                                                        Population pressures in Asia are a world.wide concern.  Asia            will be the next area of the world to have large populations of                 elderly.  China's political remedies of limiting family size will               have unexpected and far.reaching side effects.  This research                   will investigate one such effect by helping us gage whether a new               underclass of impoverished elderly is being created.  This                      research will provide information necessary to determing China's                success in addressing the needs of its rapidly expanding elderly                population.",
