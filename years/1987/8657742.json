Dr. Robert Sapolsky has already embarked on a                    brilliant career in neuroendocrinology research.  His work                      focuses on three basic questions: 1) What are the                               neuroendocrine abnormalities that underly syndromes of                          glucocorticoid hypersecretion; 2) What are the consequences                     of excessive exposure to glucocorticoids, in particular,                        what role do glucocorticoids play in mediating neuron death                     during aging and following neuropathologic insults; and 3)                      What are the cellular mechanisms by which glucocorticoids                       are neurotoxic?                                                                                                                                                         Dr. Sapolsky has already studied negative-feedback                      regulation of glucocorticoid secretion, focusing on the role                    of the hippocampus as an inhibitory negative-feedback brake                     upon adrenocorticoid activity, its role in terminating                          glucocorticoid secretion at the end of stress and the                           failure of this type of regulation in aged rats.  He has                        refined and originated methods for quantitative measures for                    steroid receptors in the brain in order to examine the                          relationship between occupancy of hippocampal glucocorticoid                    receptors and the initiation of inhibitory hippocampal                          signals to the hypothalamus.",
