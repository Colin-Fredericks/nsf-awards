 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology of New York State will be a well illustrated,                           two-partpublication designed to lead the precollege student into                the world of natural science through geology, an approach that                  capitalizes on the fascinating natural laboratory that is just                  outside every classroom.  A sixty-page booklet will give an                     up-to-date synopsis of the State's remarkably varied geology.  A                large, full-color sheet, with a number of maps on both sides,                   will present the essence of the subject through graphics.  It                   will  feature a geologic highway map of New York and a                          space-satellite photomap printed a the same scale.  This pair                   will display  dramatically the control of geology on                            physiography, thus  reinforcing the connection between the                      students' science courses and the familiar world.                                                                                                               This publication will enhance precollege science learning by                    (1) piquing the students' curiosity about natural phenomena and                 providing a practical guide to accessible examples; (2) helping                 elementary and secondary earth science teachers prepare a more                  interesting course by providing them with insights into the local               geology; and (3) creating a cadre of teachers to hold workshops                 for their colleagues throughout the State.                                                                                                                      The project has potential for significant impact in a number                    of areas.  These include: raising the awareness of future voters                about their geological environs and the impact of technologies                  upon these.  The use of the publication by interested adults will               improve the public's awareness and appreciation of science - a                  condition necessary for science to flourish in the schools.                     Further, the project will provide a high quality model for other                states to produce similar materials.",
