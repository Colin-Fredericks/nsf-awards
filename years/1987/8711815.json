They, together with collaborators from other                 institutions in the United States and abroad, are performing an                 experiment with the 15 foot bubble chamber at Fermilab.  They                   will study the interactions of neutrinos in the bubble chamber.                 The group from Illinois Institute of Technology is responsible                  for replay system for the holographic photography.  With                        holography very short lived particles can be tagged efficiently.                        The bubble chamber (E632 at Fermilab) is scheduled to                   operate for about six months beginning June 1987 and expected to                accumulate a sample of about 45,000 events.  The objectives are:                1) to search for rare phenomena; 2) to study like-spin dimuon                   production; 3 to study gluon and quark fragmentation functions                  and structure functions; and 4) to study coherent single pion and               rho production and apply the results to coherent production of                  heavy flavor mesons.",
