 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project involves analysis of the process of                   cell-type determination in the ovary.  The approach is to be                    genetic: ask the organism what functions it considers important                 by identifying mutations that are defective in the process,                     analyze the defect in the mutants, and then deduce the role of                  the wild-type allele in insuring the normal process.  Analysis                  will involve both light microscopy and serial section                           reconstruction electron microscopy.  Mutations that are excellent               candidates for defects in this process are already in hand, and                 analysis of one locus has been completed (egalitarian, a defect                 in oocyte-nurse cell determination); analysis of additional loci                has begun.  The process is complex, so for each locus a range of                morphic types of alleles (as defined relative to a deficiency)                  will be studied to define the primary defect and the range of                   secondary defects; additional mutant alleles will be induced as                 needed after the \"type\" allele has been examined.  The level of                 residual function that will make analysis of a given locus                      possible will be a function of the locus itself.  Once several                  different loci are known, pathway analysis will begin:                          double-mutant combinations will be examined by both light and EM.               At this point, there will be predictions of the types of                        interactions (dependent, independent, or interactive pathways),                 but the actual phenotype of the double-mutant combinations will                 both guide assessment of the kinds of pathways present in the                   process and further refine the deductions of function of the                    specific wild-type alleles.  Moreover, once several mutations                   have been identified that appear to be in the same or interacting               pathways, additional recessive mutations in those pathways may be               isolatable as dominant enhancers of multiple heterozygotes of                   existing mutants.  Suppressors (second-site \"revertants\") will                  also be sought.  These additional loci will then be studied,                    first as independent mutants and then in interactions.                                                                                                          In the process of development, the original single cell, the                    zygote, is totipotent but as cell division occurs, cells                        differentiate to form specific cell types.  How this process is                 regulated at the molecular level is not understood for any cell                 types.  Dr. Carpenter has chosen to use ovarian cell types for                  this study, but the information obtained will be insightful and                 add to our generalized concept of differentiation.",
