 "awd_abstract_narration": "Design and manufacture are often treated as independent                    activities, resulting in designs that are difficult or expensive to             manufacture.  The goal of designing for manufacturability is to                 ensure that the final design is satisfactory not only in                        performance, but also in producibility.                                              To account for manufacturing considerations in the design                  stage, techniques are being developed that are semi-automatic that              still demand considerable user interaction.  Consequently,                      implementation requires an effective graphical interface to permit              the user to communicate with the program.  Therefore, the                       implementation is best done on a CAD/CAM workstation with advanced              graphics capabilities.  This grant provides a CAD/CAM workstation to            be used for research in the field of design for manufacturability.",
