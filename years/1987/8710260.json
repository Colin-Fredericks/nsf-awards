 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this theoretical physics project is to                 elucidate the influence of fermionic degrees of freedom in a                    nonperturbative study of the theory of quantum chromodynamics.                  The method of investigation is the lattice gauge theory approach.               Four interrelated numerical studies will be carried out.                                1) A study of two-dimensional QCD in which the flavor                   degeneracy inherent in the staggered fermion formulation is                     removed by the introduction of nonlocal mass terms.  This project               is important for contemplating physically realistic studies in                  four dimensions.                                                                        2) A high statistics study of quenched QCD on a 83x16                   lattice.  The aim of this work will be a determination of the                   hadron mass spectrum as well as quark-antiquark charge                          distributions.                                                                          3) An initial investigation of the hadron mass spectrum of              the fully interacting theory, including fermion loop effects, on                an 83x 16 lattice.  This project is a subset of a larger goal to                understand the influence of fermion polarization effects on                     strong interaction dynamics.                                                            4) Quenched and unquenched calculations of hadron mass                  spectrum on larger and larger lattices, as increased computer                   power becomes available.                                                                Projects 2 and 3 are to be carried out on a dedicated, and              currently operating, special purpose parallel processor at                      Columbia University with computing power comparable to a CRAY-1.                Project 4 will make use of the second and third generation                      special purpose machines currently under construction at                        Columbia.                                                                               The research, to be conducted by a highly-regarded                      physicist, is important to our exploration of the consequences of               quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the strong nuclear force.",
