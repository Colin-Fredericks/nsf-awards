 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project plans to conduct a combined symposium-workshop as part of           the annual meeting of Arctic Division, American Association for the             Advancement of Science, Anchorage, Alaska, September 23-26, 1987.  The          subject of the symposium-workshop relates to the needs and opportunities        for long-term research and monitoring on the federally reserved and             managed lands in northwestern Alaska.  The Alaska National Interest             Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA, P.L. 96-487) established                extensive tracts of federally-reserved lands, large areas of which are          considered to be in the Arctic as defined by the Arctic Research and            Policy Act of 1984 (ARPA, P.L. 98-373).  The existence of these                 federally administrated lands offer the opportunity to collectively plan        and conduct research related to the assessment and understanding of             global change and resource utilization and conservation, and to provide         educational and training opportunities for and involvement of local             residents.  The meetings will involve invited participants representing         agencies, universities, residents, private and public interest groups,          and draw upon the participants at this AAAS Conference.  Topics to be           discussed include the physical and biological environments, approaches          to environmental monitoring and views of research from local, public,           and agencies perspectives.  A publication synthesizing the results of           both the symposium presentations and discussions and workshop analyses          will result.                                                                                                                                                    This project is directly related to the planning and implementation             phases of the Arctic Research and Policy Act, and particularly on               questions of resource utilization and development and the use of the            Arctic as a natural laboratory.",
