 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to increase the comfort levels of elementary           teachers on science and technology topics in a four week residential            setting followed by an academic year program which will include weekend         retreats and networking and technology up-date conferences.  Fifty-seven        teachers and twenty-eight school administrators from Southern California        will participate in the workshop each year during the two year project.                                                                                         Teachers selected to attend the workshop will be mentor or outstanding          general subject teachers with little or no formal training of science.          The school administrators will accompany their teachers and participate         two days during the summer session followed by one day during the school        year and attendance at the up-date conference.  Their instructions will         be based on the California State Department of Education, Science Unit          model.                                                                                                                                                          The program's goals to implement and give direction to this project will        be: (1) Strengthen the content background and teaching of selected              elementary teachers in science and technology and (2) Strengthen the            background of elementary school administrators relative to science              planning, instructional strategies and program evaluation.  The                 objectives to obtain these goals will use a variety of effective                teaching strategies and techniques to accomodate a number of different          learning modalities.                                                                                                                                            The staff is highly qualified with a broad range of experiences in              teacher education and in the science disciplines.  The program will be          enhanced by the utilization of the resources of the Jet Propulsion              Laboratory and the California State Polytechnic University of Pomona.                                                                                           \"Comfortable Approach to Teaching Science\" follows the Guidelines of            Teacher Preparation and Enhancement and should further its aims by              providing appropriate continuing educational developement opportunities         for elementary teachers who lack science backgrounds for the courses            they teach.",
