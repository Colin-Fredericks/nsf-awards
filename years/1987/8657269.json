 "awd_abstract_narration": "David D. Myrold's research interests are defined by the                    intersection of forestry, soil science and microbiology.  A                     Presidential Young Investigator award will afford him the chance to             pursue these interests with greater freedom during the next five years          than might otherwise have been the case.  In his previous work, he has          found that microbial denitrification (conversion of nitrates to                 bimolecular nitrogen) capacity is limited largely by the availability           of carbon, rather than by availability of nitrates.  Use of                     radiotracers and mathematical modeling of the nitrogen cycle enabled            the simultaneous estimation of mineralization, immobilization,                  nitrification, and denitrification components in the laboratory.                Dr. Myrold will continue studies of nitrogen cycling in forest                  ecosystems and, in addition, will initiate research dealing with                actinomycete (Frankia) strains using immunological and genetic                  techniques, and also the role of microbial biomass as a sink and source         of nutrients (mainly nitrogen) in forest systems.  The latter studies           are especially important with respect to questions that concern the             ultimate fate of nutrients in systems subject to forest management              practices such as burning and fertilization.  Laboratory analyses will          be conducted at Oregon State University, while the field portions of            research are to be done among the various forest types found in the             state of Oregon.",
