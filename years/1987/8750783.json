 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research course is being taught jointly by members of the Biology and         Chemistry Departments, that introduces students to the theoretical              implications and practical applications of various techniques at the            interface of chemistry, biochemistry and molecular biology.  This is            particularly important in light of the current and continued emphasis on        biotechnology.  A work station approach, utilizing spectrophotometric,          chromatographic and electrophoretic equipment in an inter-related               fashion is the primary focus of the course.  Students are being required        to isolate, purify and characterize specific proteins and nucleic acids         using the equipment.  The students are being exposed to a variety of            scientific perspectives and techniques as they are actually being               carried out in laboratories.  The students are being given the                  opportunity and the training necessary to apply these techniques to the         problems encountered in their own research endeavors.",
