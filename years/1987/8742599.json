 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fish are a major component of the antarctic marine community.                   Knowledge of their age and growth is essential to the understanding of          the structure and functions of the ecosystem.  This supplemental award          to Dr. Targett presents a unique opportunity to increase information            on one aspect of growth:  the relationship among feeding activity,              temperature, and photoperiod.  Thirty fish collected in the antarctic           were transported to Delaware, where growth experiments have been                carried out for sixteen months.  These are the first fish successfully          transported to a U.S. laboratory.  The precision of temperature                 control during laboratory experimentation available in Delaware is              superior to that available in the antarctic.  Research will focus on            the variation in feeding rate, feeding magnitude and changes in growth          efficiency observed between winter and summer.  Support is                      recommended.",
