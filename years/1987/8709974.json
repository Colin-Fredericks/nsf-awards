 "awd_abstract_narration": "Narrative: Unsteady stratified motions have been observed in dense              gas-solid suspensions at moderate and low velocities, but means for             prediction are lacking.  This flow range is significant because it              is energy efficient for processing and transport of solids and                  because it tends to minimize attrition of solids and erosion of                 equipment.  With test loop systems of 2-inch and 5-inch pipe                    diameters capable of continuous recycling of solids, a minimum                  investment of solid material is needed for prolonged test runs.                 The large pipe especially makes possible detailed observation and               measurements.                                                                                                                                                   A preliminary study showed that wave motion and phase interactions              at a low velocity can be directly observed, and comparison to simple            wave analysis can be made.  At moderate velocities and large                    particle densities, measurement of wave motion in terms of a                    spectrum based on autocorrelation of probe current or local mass                flow was feasible.                                                                                                                                              The proposed research includes further work on basic formulation and            transport properties, and definitive measurements over a range of               unsteady horizontal pipe flow at first.  Both auto and cross-                   correlations will be determined at various positions in the pipe                over a range of flow conditions and particles.  The aim is toward               prediciton of flow conditions and scale-up of designs.",
