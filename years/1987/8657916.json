 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI is a Presidential Young Investigator who describes his           research as follows:  The goals of this research are to obtain increased        understanding of the detrimental random fluctuations in amplitude of            frequency and polarization from semiconductor laser diodes and to design        lasers in which these dynamics can be controlled.  It is well known that        light-matter interactions that involve intense optical fields give rise         to nonlinear mixing of optical waves and parametric generation of new           components in the optical spectrum.  These same interactions occur              inside all laser cavities and crucially effect the dynamics of the laser        and the spectral properties of the light it emits.  These nonlinear             interactions can cause the laser to be highly unstable.  Small changes          in feedback, pumping, or temperature can trigger drastic changes in the         spectral characteristics of the light.  Only over the last few years            have detailed studies been made on the physical origins of these                instabilities in simple laser systems.  Modeling has been limited to            dilute materials in which the optical gain results from an ensemble of          isolated individual atoms or molecules, such as in laser diodes.  In            addition, we will be measuring and characterizing the spectral and noise        properties of laser diodes under various environmental and feedback             conditions.                                                                             Semiconductor laser diodes are used in image scanning systems,          fiber optic communication links, optical radar, and optical disk                read/write memories.  All these systems require a highly reliable source        of coherent light.  Unfortunately, the light emitted from diode lasers          is corrupted by seemingly random fluctuations in amplitude, frequency,          and polarization.  The goals of this research are to obtain increased           understanding of these detrimental fluctuations and to design lasers in         which these dynamics can be controlled.",
