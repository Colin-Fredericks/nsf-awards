 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general subject of the research supported by this grant             over the past five years has been the basic physics of magnetic                 field line reconnection.  This is an important yet unsolved                     problem in magnetospheric physics, solar physics and                            astrophysics.  The approach has been to attack the problem from                 the most accessible side, i.e., laboratory experiments.                                 In the process of understanding reconnection several related            phenomena have been investigated.  These include waves and                      instabilities and beam-plasma interactions.  Major new results                  have been obtained including magnetic field topologies, plasma                  properties, particle acceleration, anomalous resistivity, plasma                turbulence and disruptive instabilities.  Novel diagnostics and                 state-of-the-art digital data processing have been developed.                           In this renewal grant the same equipment with some additions            will be used in new ventures.  Specifically, the topics of                      electric currents in various solar terrestrial simulations will                 be studied; e.g., plasmoids, magnetic flux ropes, moving plasmas                and beams.  All of these are relevant to the solar-terrestrial                  environment where electric currents control the energetics of                   magnetospheric dynamics.",
