 "awd_abstract_narration": "Narrative: Micoorganisms found in aquatic volcanic environments have            been isolated and shown to grow at temperatures exceeding l00 C.                The characteristic to withstand high temperatures presents                      interesting possibilities from a biotechnological perspective, such             as the production of highly thermostable proteins, unusual                      metabolic behavior, and new genetic material.  A road block to                  commercialization has been the difficulty in growing and                        manipulating these organisms on a large scale.                                                                                                                  This work is focused on the development of protocols and associated             bioreactors that can be used for the growth and study of extremely              thermophilic archaebacteria.  Particular emphasis has been placed on            those archaebacteria that are classified as sulfur-dependent extreme            thermophiles, and include both the Sulfolobus and Pyrodictium                   genera.  This choice was made because of the potential industrial               importance of microorganisms for industrial application.",
