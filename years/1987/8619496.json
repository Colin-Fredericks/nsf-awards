 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been a significane growth in recent years toward the                  development of a fundamental understanding of the physical                      processes which control transport through polymeric membranes,                  composites and packaging materials.  Advances  in these areas                   are critical to a number of separation processes, in                            conventional inorganic processing, in biotechnology and in                      medicine, among others.  Correspondingly, the success or the                    failure of membrane processes is quite predictably related to                   the material from which the membrane is made and the manner in                  which the membrane structures are made.  This funding is                        provided as a partial support for an international conference                   to discuss the recent advances in these areas and to project                    the long-range research needs.  Among other things, the                         following issues will be addressed:                                                                                                                                o  Fundamentals of transport phenomena in membrane                                 materials,                                                                   o  Molecular criteria for the preparation of improved                              membranes and barrier structures,                                            o  New membrane separation processes and barrier film                              applications, and                                                            o  Membranes in Biotechnology and Biomedicine                                                                                                                Funding at the level of $15,000 ($6,000 from Separation and                     Purification Processes, $6,000 from Biotechnology, $3,000 from                  the Division of International Programs) is recommended.",
