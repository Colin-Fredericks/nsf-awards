 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal objectives of the research program are to produce a               large, complete, well defined, and carefully controlled sample of               bright quasars; to obtain slit spectrophotometry and imaging                    observations for purposes of statistical investigations as well as              studies of physical and chemical gas properties; and to carry out               detailed theoretical analyses of the emitting and absorbing                     clouds between us and the quasars.  The new quasars are to be                   detected by means of their optical spectral line characteristics.               A fully automated object selection procedure and provisions for                 obtaining more detailed observations of selected objects at                     available telescopes are important improvements over previous                   surveys.  Major contirbutions to astronomy can be expected through              increased understanding of: 1) the brightness and other                         relationships for various types of active galaxies, 2) the broad-               absorption-lines in quasar spectra, 3) the quasar redshift and                  brightness distribution, and 4) possible correlations in the                    redshifts of close quasar pairs.  This survey of quasars and                    emission-line galaxies will complement observations being carried               out by other groups of astronomers.",
