 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polymeric membranes currently in use in hydrogen separation                     technology have limited selectivity (i.e., they do not retain                   certain impurities) and, in addition, are heat-sensitive.  The                  latter restriction implies that hot streams of gas must be cooled               sufficiently before the separation step.  Metallic membranes                    overcome these difficulties, but the ones used currently are                    expensive since they are made of palladium-silver alloys.  This                 proposal outlines an investigation of the technical feasibility                 of using a less expensive titanium alloy that is highly permeable               to hydrogen.  This Phase I research under the Small Business                    Innovation Research Program will focus on methods to clean and                  coat titanium alloy membranes with thin layers of palladium or                  nickel to avoid oxidation effects.  The coated membranes will                   then be tested for hydrogen permeation rates and for selectivity,               under typical industrial conditions.                                                                                                                            The PI, Dr. Dwayne T. Friesen, and his employer, Bend Research,                 Inc., have established an excellent record of productive research               and are very well qualified for support.                                                                                                                        Funding at the requested level of $39,866 for six months is                     recommended.",
