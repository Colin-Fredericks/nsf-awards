 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Objectives:  The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary                cooperative research project between Dr. Anthony Martonosi of the State         University of New York Health Sciences Center and Dr. Janos Somogyi of          Semmelweis University Medical School is to characterize the structure of        a crystalline protein, Ca-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum.  The                researchers intend to obtain better resolution from two dimensional             crystals and also obtain, for the first time, tri-dimensional crystals          in order to better understand the molecular mechanism of this membrane          protein which is essential to cell function.                                                                                                                    Relevance to Program Objectives:  This project fulfills the program             objective of advancing scientific knowledge in biophysics by enabling           leading experts in the U.S. and Hungary to combine their complementary          talents, pool resources, and share research facilities in areas of              strong mutual interest and competence.                                                                                                                          Merit:  The proposal ranks in the Excellent/Very Good category.  Its            technical merit therefore warrants NSF support.  The U.S. and Hungarian         researchers' professional credentials, resources, and facilities are            well-regarded and the rationale for international cooperation is clearly        articulated.  Significant research results are expected as an outcome of        this international cooperation.  In particular, success in the solution         of the three dimensional structure of the described protein would be a          signal advance in the field.                                                                                                                                    Interrelated Projects:  Dr. Martonosi currently receives support for            related domestic research from the NSF Biophysics Program under grant           PCM-8403679.                                                                                                                                                    Funding:  The requested budget covers the incremental costs to the U.S.         of international cooperation associated with the research in accordance         with program guidelines.",
