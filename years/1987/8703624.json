The mechanisms will be                          investigated using patch clamp electrode techniques on isolated                 protoplasts and vacuoles.  A special technique devised by Dr.                   Lucas that uses fluorescent probes incorporated into                            lipsomesliposomes will be applied to study whether transport is                 symplastic via plasmodesmata or apoplastic.                                                                                                                          The growth and productivity of plants depends on the                       movement of carbohydrate photosynthesized in the leaf from the                  leaf via the phloem to the stem, root, flower or seed where it                  will be used or stored.  Knowledge of how phloem is loaded and                  unloaded, how these processes are regulated, and the nature of                  the signal from sink to source is basic to the planned scientific               development of more efficient plants.",
