 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to identify and                       characterize cis-acting genetic elements that respond to signals                regulating cell-specific gene expression in tissues.  Dr. Mets                  will study the differentiation of bundle sheath and mesophyll                   cells within the leaves of plants of the genus Flaveria                         (Compositae) with Ca pathway of photosynthesis.  He will                        characterize the relative levels and patterns of expression of                  members of the ribulose-1,5-bisphospate carboxylase small subunit               multigene family (rbcS genes), expressed only in bundle sheath                  cells.  Agrobacterium mediated transformation will be used to                   transfer rbcS genes from Ca species (Petunia and Ca or                          physiologically intermediate species of Flaveria) into Ca plants.               Since the rbcS genes from the Ca sources are ordinarily expressed               in all of the mesophyll cells of the leaf, he will be interested                in seeing if the introduced genes can respond to the cell-                      specific control signals present in the Ca leaves.  This will be                studied by separating bundle sheath and mesophyll cells to                      determine their respective message contents.                                                                                                                    The board objective of the proposed experiments is to contribute                to an understanding of mechanisms that regulate cellular                        differentiation.  The two cell types examined here (bundle sheath               and mesophyll cells of the leaves) show numerous qualitative as                 well as quantitative differences in expression of both nuclear                  and organellar genes.",
