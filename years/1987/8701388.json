 "awd_abstract_narration": "The region of the ocean called the mesopelagic, of                      midwaters, lies in the depths between -200 and -1000 meters.  It                covers virtually the entire extent of the world's ocean excepting               the continental shelves and small areas around ocean islands;                   therefore it represents one of the world's largest types of                     environments.  The mesopelagic is characterized by cold, dark                   waters with ususual life forms but, in general, our knowledge                   of this huge region is minimal,  We know of the accounts of                     strange fishes and the prevalence of bioluminescent organisms,                  but little of the distribution, abundance, and behavior of the                  living things that occupy these depths.  Now, with the advent                   of some extremely sophisticated submersibles that make open                     water observations very sucessful, our understanding of this                    ocean region is starting to expand greatly.                                             Dr. Harbison and colleagues have contributed greatly to our             initial progress studying the ecology and behavior of animals in                the mesopelagic world.  They have proposed to conduct some                      preliminary investigations into the responses of mesopelagic                    fishes to environmental stimuli (visual and acoustic); they                     will also make comparisons of traditional vs. submersible                       sampling techniques using comparisons of traditional vs.                        submersible sampling techniques used in the midwaters.  These                   studies will provide exciting new findings from this poorly                     known region and will yield some important information about                    how effective our past sampling efforts have been in this                       environment.  The Biological Oceanography Program recommends a                  one-year award at $54,736.",
