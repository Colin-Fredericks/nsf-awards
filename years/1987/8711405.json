 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is aimed at continuation of a study on                    3-dimensional (3D) motion analysis with current emphasis on                     performance analysis and evaluation.  Two new problems with                     regard to motion will be pursued.  The first problem is the                     matching of corresponding regions in consecutive images and the                 generation of a 3D object model from the image sequence.  The                   model and the matching will take into consideration occlusion,                  hidden faces and shape changes of object faces caused by 3D                     rotation.  The second problem is the computation of velocity                    field (optical flow) using linear or nonlinear shape change                     constraints instead of the conventional smoothness constaints.                          On a more practical level, rule-based system for 3D shape               recovery and orientation determination from a single perspective                view will be developed.  The system is expected to have possibly                100 heuristic rules dealing with parallel lines, perpendicular                  lines, right corners, junction interpretations, geometric                       configurations, skewed symmetry, etc.  Certainty factors will be                assigned to the rules and evidences, control strategies will be                 devised, and the rule-based system will be implemented and tested               on fairly complex 3D objects.",
