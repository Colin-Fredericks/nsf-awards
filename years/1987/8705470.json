 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Summary:  An equation of state model which successfully                correlates vapor liquid equilibria behavior of weak electrolyte                 systems containing ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon dioxide                has recently been developed by the principal investigators.                     This earlier work was focused primarily on the vapor phase, so that             the vapor phase behavior for a given overall liquid phase composition           was successfully characterized.  In this project, work will focus on            the liquid phase.  Specifically, several proposed modifications to the          existing model will be examined so that concentrations of                       individual species in the liquid phase will be successfully                     characterized.  In addition, the feasibility of replacing the                   perturbed hard chain equation, which is presently in the model,                 with a cubic equation of state, will be examined.  Finally, an                  experimental program will be undertaken whereby total pressure,                 temperature, and the density and conductivity of both phases will               be measured in situ.  These results, along with the theoretical                 model, will then be used to calculate phase compositions.  The                  program will eliminate the two features which have given                        traditional methods so much trouble--overly complex theoretical                 models and removing and analyzing samples from equilibrium cells.                                                                                               Innovation:  The proposed work will lead to two scientific                      innovations.  First, it will continue to develop the application                of equations of state to weak electrolyte systems.  The equation                of state development will lead to a model which will be simpler                 than those models currently used to represent weak electrolyte                  behavior.  The proposed methods will possess the many advantages                which have made equations of state so popular for representing                  non-electrolyte vapor liquid equilibria.  The second innovation                 is that an experimental technique will be developed which will                  eliminate the need to remove and analyze samples from the                       equilibrium cell.  With current techniques, this is the most                    difficult step, so its elimination will indeed be a major                       development in the methods used to study these systems.                                                                                                         Significance:  The proposed research will have considerable                     practical impact in the area of sour water processing, water                    purification, natural gas processing, and heavy oil refining.                   The reason this work is applicable in so many areas is that                     techniques for the CO2-NH3-H2O and H2S-NH3-H2O systems can be                   easily extended to systems in which the ammonia is replaced by                  amines, glycols, or alcohols.  Thus, much industrial interest                   results because of the importance of H2S removal from natural gas               by amine treating.  At this point, the problems associated with                 weak electrolyte VLE have not been solved satisfactorily.  The                  proposed techniques couple new approaches in the experimental                   procedure with new approaches to modelling the behavior in a                    manner that may solve the problem.",
