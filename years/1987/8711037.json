 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the \"active minority\" of citizens who will             participate in the presidential nomination and general election                 campaigns of 1988.  The investigators are interested in the factors             that explain participants' support for candidates as well as the                relationship between their activity in the preconvention campaigns              and their willingness to work for their party's nominee in the fall             campaign.  The design of the project specifically recognizes the                dynamic character of the process and permits monitoring of changing             attitudes and behavior throughout the campaign.                                                                                                                 Based on their prior research, the investigators will test an                   explanation of candidate support that includes activists' judgments             about how likely each candidate is to win his or her party's                    nomination, the candidate's chances against the opposition party in             the fall, the issue and ideological preferences of the activist, and            the personal characteristics of the contenders.  Assessing the relative         importance of these factors is crucial to understanding the                     implications of nomination campaigns for the health of the American             political parties.  For example, activists who emphasize issues and             ideology interests in choosing a candidate contribute to the                    divisiveness of the preconvention campaign and may be less likely to            work for the party in the fall should their preferred candidate not             receive the nomination.  Activists more concerned with nominating a             winner, in contrast, may be more likely to work in the fall campaign            even if the party fails to nominate their preferred candidate.                                                                                                  The research design involves surveys of activists in three states:              Iowa, Michigan, and Virginia.  These states were selected due to their          diversity in political culture, and because precinct caucuses will be           held in them at different times during the nomination campaign.                 Moreover, the investigators have data from these same states from               surveys they conducted during the 1984 campaign.  The investigators             will draw comparisons with their results from 1984 as well as                   re-contacting the 1984 respondents in order to follow them through the          1988 campaign.                                                                                                                                                  The investigators will contact their 1984 samples of caucus-attenders           three times during 1988:  first in January, then in June after the              primary season but before the summer conventions, and finally just              after the November election.  In order to facilitate comparisons with           their 1984 data on caucus-attenders, they will also draw new samples of         1988 caucus-attenders in both parties in each state.  These respondents         will be contacted twice:  once immediately after the caucuses in their          state, and again following the fall election.  Finally, the                     investigators will survey samples of state and local party leaders in           the three states, who will be contacted at exactly the same times as            the caucus attenders in their states.  The goal is to collect data on           those who are more or less permanently active in the state parties in           order to assess the relationship between the state party organizations          and the presidential selection process.",
