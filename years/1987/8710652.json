 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants grown in soil are often faced with surviving                        under conditions of flooding or water logged soil.  Oxygen                      becomes limiting and oxidative metabolism is inhibited.  Some                   plants respond to this condition by initiating changes in                       protein synthesis as well as carbon metabolism.  This stress                    response has been particularly well studied in corn.                            Dr. M. Freeling of the University of California, Berkeley has                   found and characterized over twenty corn mutants that show                      varying degrees of survival under anerobic conditions.  Dr.                     Winkler will study the various biochemical alterations                          demonstrated by the various classes of mutants and relate                       them to the level of survival of that particular mutant under                   conditions of water stress.  Other mutants will be isolated.                         An understanding of how plants respond to environmental                    stress at a biochemical level is fundamentally important but                    will also have significant economic ramifications since the                     flooding of crop fields or the use of waterlogged soil as a                                                                                                     field are important commercial problems.",
