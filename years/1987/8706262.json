 "awd_abstract_narration": "The release of various gases at volcanoes is complex and                        dependent on a large number of variables.  Most studies have used               only a few techniques of measuring and sampling.  This research                 will increase the number of techniques used at a few active                     volcanoes where a background of other data exist. Long-range                    goals of this project are to: 1) Test and perfect forecasting                   tools based on gas studies, 2) Evaluate and improve constraints                 on the conditions prevailing in shallow magma bodies which lead                 to eruptions, and 3) Make a better assesment of volatiles and                   particles released to the atmosphere by volcanoes.  This is a                   continuing project, but in the next two years emphasis will be on               the development of a thermodynamic model which includes hundreds                of trace species in volcanic gases.  Both homogeneous and                       heterogeneous equilibrium modelling will be done, and applied to                field data of both the PIs and other workers.  Results are                      expected to clarify the speciation of trace components in gases                 and the reaction processes in gas plumes and at fumarolic vents,                as well as what variables control the concentrations of trace components        volatilizing from magmas.  Collection, analysis and geologic                    interpretation will be done by Rose and collegues at Michigan                   Tech.  Modelling will be done primarily by Reed and collegues at                Oregon.  Results are expected to have applicability beyond the                  immediate geologic concerns.",
