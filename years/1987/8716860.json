 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information about neighbor recognition is basic to an understanding of          the behavioral interactions that occur within a social unit.  Most              studies on the role of familiarity in mammalian social organizations,           however, have been done on social mammals.  Little attention has been           given to solitary species, although most mammals live as solitary               individuals during most of their lives.                                                                                                                         Dr. Randall's research will examine the role of familiarity in                  spacing, mate selection, and kin recognition in the social                      organization of two species of solitary, desert rodent:  the                    bannertail (\u001b-\u0001Dipodomys spectabilis\u001b-) and Merriam's (\u001b-\u0001D. merriami\u001b-)        kangaroo rat.  Animals of known age, sex, and relationships will be             paired in a large portable enclosure in the field, and their                    interactions will be documented and compared.  Dr. Randall will also            track animals with radio-transmitters to determine their spacing                relationships before and during mating, and will continue detailed              observations of both species' mating behavior.  In addition, a number           of studies in the laboratory are planned to examine whether the                 kangaroo rats could recognize each other from odors deposited during            scent-marking.                                                                                                                                                  The information obtained from this project should help in promoting a           basic understanding of the steps that lead to the development of                sociality as it has evolved in mammalian communities.",
