 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Millman and Smith are using a case study of a sustained episode            of reasoning in the construction of a new scientific theory to                  develop a philosophical account of the deployment and organization of           various reasoning strategies in theory generation.  The case study              focuses on Darwin's reasoning to the formulation of a first sketch of           his theory of natural selection between 1837 and 1842.                          Their project is organized around several questions: (1) What is the            best way to characterize or represent Darwin's early views in the B             Notebook?  (2)  What heuristic strategies or principles of inquiry              are useful in theory construction?  Are there any significant                   differences between reasoning in the generation of new theories and             reasoning in later phases theory development?  (3)  What are the main           types of change that occur during the process of theory construction?           The Darwin case which Drs. Smith and Millman are examining suggests             several ideas about theory construction:  (1)  Commitment to a                  primary concept cluster (along with other features of a problem                 situation) may precede and help guide the first formulation of a                theory.  (2)  Organized inquiry may include such reasoning strategies           as (a) play with opposite hypotheses relating concepts in a cluster,            (b) use of interacting multiple analogies, (c) work on component                units of theory, and (d) use and reasoned violation of methodological           principles.  (3)  Drs. Millman and Smith also will discuss a number             of types of change within developing conceptual systems, with                   particular attention to the role of conceptual differentiation.  The            ultimate goal of this project is not, however, a simple, albeit                 extraordinarily rich case study.  Using their expertise in both                 philosophy and cognitive psychology, they will examine features                 identified in the Darwin case for their applicability to other cases            of theory construction.  This study thus promises significant                   contributions to the history, philosophy and psychology of scientific           theory development.",
