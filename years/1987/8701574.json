 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will use a variety of theoretical            techniques to analyse certain problems in the field of modeling and             control of dynamical systems.                                                           The two areas considered are the analysis and control of                mechanical systems which contain rigid and flexible components, and the         identification of static and dynamic systems from sets of data.                 The class of mechanical systems to be analyzed can be modeled as                Lagrangian or Hamiltonian systems evolving on finite-or infinite-               dimensional manifolds.  Using the theory that has been developed for            analysing systems of this mathematical type, the principal                      investigator will investigate properties such as the existence of               equilibria, stability, and the existence of conserved integrals and             symmetries for these mechanical systems.  Further, he will generalize           aspects of the theory of control of nonlinear finite-dimensional                systems to encompass control of these more complex infinite-                    dimensional systems.                                                                    In the area of identification, the principal investigator will          analyse systems where all variables are subject to error- the \"errors-          in-variables\" systems.  His aim is to build on recent work in this area         to develop a satisfactory theory of dynamic error-in variables systems.           Frequency domain techniques as well as techniques from stochastic             realization theory will be used.                                                        The problems analysed here from a theoretical perspective are           also of great importance for many practical applications in aeronautics,        robotics and other areas.",
