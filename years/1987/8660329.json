 "awd_abstract_narration": "Weld inspection procedures are of major importance in pipe line                 construction where weld quality is essential to insure public safety and        to eliminate environmentally harmful leaks.  Current practicve is to x-         ray each weld, process the film and assess the weld integrity.  This            process is slow and often delays construction when inadequate welds are         discovered long after the weld is completed.  Real time inspection of           welds with x-rays is possible providing the x-ray image is recorded             electronically rather than photographically.  The electronically                recorded image can be processed rapidly to ascertain weld quality during        the welding operation and data on weld integrity can be used to adjust          the welding process.                                                                                                                                            This research program involves the initial design of a real time weld           inspection system.  Specific tasks will include:  determination of              radiographic performance requirements for pipelines, development of             electronic detection methods and system requirements, determination of          heat shield methods for the detector and system analysis to establish           the time required for inspection.                                                                                                                               Sigma Research is an R&D firm which has expertise in advanced NDE               methods.  They are involved in developing piping inspection methods for         other sponsors which entail real time radiography systems.  This                research can draw on results of previous developments.  The principal           investigator has ten years experience in radiographic methods of NDE and        is capable of successfully completing the proposed program.                                                                                                     An award is recommended.",
