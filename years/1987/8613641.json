 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a field and laboratory study of the geologic                    history, tectonics and structure of the oldest part of the                      Pacific seafloor.  The field program in the west central                        Pacific Ocean is using multichannel seismic techniques to                       determine the depth and nature of the deep crustal layers.  The                 relationship of the original bedrock to an overlying sequence                   of Cretaceous volcanic strata is being resolved.  The                           Cretaceous volcanic strata have masked the deep layers in                       previous studies, however, this project will use a powerful                     tuned source array and a 96-channel seismic streamer to                         penetrate to the basement.  Modern data processing techniques                   will reveal the stratigraphic and structural relationships in                   the Nauru, Central-Pacific and Mariana Basins.  The nature and                  extent of the deep-water Cretaceous volcanic complexes and the                  relationship to the surrounding island, atolls and guyots of                    similar age will be determined.                                                                                                                                 The study is providing regional data for a potential ODP                        drilling leg in the early 1990's and is being coordinated with                  a second field program by French scientists.  The two projects                  will meet all requirements for the drilling program to evaluate                 specific drilling locations.                                                                                                                                    Dr. T. Shipley (Univ. Texas) and Dr. R. Larson (Univ. Rhode                     Island) are collaborating on this study.  Together they form a                  very strong research team with expertise in all aspects of the                  work.  This includes field operations, seismic data analysis                    and regional geologic interpretations.",
