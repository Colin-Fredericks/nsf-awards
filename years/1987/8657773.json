 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is to recommend an award for a Presidential                 Young Investigator.  Dr. Laurel A. Fisher is studying two areas                 of research.  Firstly, she is trying to elucidate mechanisms in                 the central nervous system involved in governing autonomic                      nervous activity, endocrine secretions and cardiovascular                       function.  Secondly, she is studying the role of peptides in                    neural transmission.  By combining these two interests she                      expects to be able to characterize the CNS actions and underlying               mechanisms of the neuropeptides on cardiovascular function.  She                is well trained to carryout the proposed line of work.  This work               is important because it is well recognized that the brain plays a               dominant role in controlling the organism's visceral, hormonal                  and behavioral reactions to acute and chronic environmental                     demands.  However, the CNS mechanisms and transmitters involved                 in generating these responses remain largely undefined.  The work               which Dr. Fisher is undertaking will lead to the role of specific               neuropeptides and the CNS mechanisms involved in coordinating                   homeostatic responses to the environment.",
