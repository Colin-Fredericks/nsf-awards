 "awd_abstract_narration": "A six-month program is planned for the summer faculty internship award          in tribology.  The major objective of the training/research program is          to acquire in-depth knowledge of the experimental and computational             research in tribology, particularly in the areas of fluid inertia and           viscoelasticity, thermal effects, such as instability and property              variation, thermal interaction between the fluid film and surrounding           environment, and high-resolution computational techniques.  The                 Institute for Wear Control and Tribology at Rensselaer Polytechnic              Institute will act as the host institution for the training and                 research.  A long-term computational and experimental research strategy         will be developed for complex thermohydrodynamic problems of greater            concern and immediate attention.",
