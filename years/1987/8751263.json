 "awd_abstract_narration": "The availability of computers, calculators, and manipulatives has raised        various questions about the impact of these technologies on the                 mathematical content and instructional methodology that are related to          the mathematics curricula at the elementary school level. The purpose of        this project is to extend the work of the proposer and her colleagues           who have, with previous support from the National Science Foundation,           developed a future-oriented mathematics curriculum for grades K-6 along         with a teacher inservice outline.                                                                                                                               The work in this project is to conduct intensive inservice workshops for        about forty teachers at the middle school level who have been designated        as master teachers by their school districts. The teachers work within          the framework of their present teaching situation, including use of             curriculum guides and textbooks, to infuse as appropriate the                   instructional materials and methods of the project. The workshops will          be videotaped and analyzed by the teachers and the project staff. The           master teachers will work with the project staff to develop inservice           models that are appropriate to their districts. During the year the             master teachers will experiment with the instructional methods in their         classrooms and prepare to conduct their own workshops for about twenty          teachers each in their districts during the year and the following              summer, thereby effecting upwards of 800 teachers with this effort.                                                                                             Products to come from this project are videotapes of the inservice              workshops on the use of computers, calculators and manipulatives in the         teaching of mathematics at the middle school level; evaluations and             reports by master teachers on how to modernize an existing curriculum;          and documentation on how the materials that were developed under a              previous project were implemented in this experiment.                                                                                                           The proposer has a long and distinguised record in mathematics                  curriculum development, preservice and inservice teacher education. In          addition, she has established a model and highly functional mathematics         laboratory that has serviced the schools and colleges in her region. She        has a reputation for accomplishing excellent results from cost effective        projects.",
