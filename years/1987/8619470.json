 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award would allow Drs. R. Jeffrey Wilkes, Thompson H. Burnett, and         Jere J. Lord, University of Washington, Seattle, to collaborate with            Dr. K.N. Ingvar Otterlund and his research group at the University of           Lund, Sweden.  They will study high energy heavy ion interactions.  The         purpose will be to search for the new state of nuclear matter, the              quark-gluon plasma, which is predicted to be created in heavy ion               collisions.  Their research will be done at the heavy ion facility at           the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva,                Switzerland and at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the United             States.  The heavy ions 16O and 32S will be accelerated to energies of          13-200 GEV/nucleon and then directed into emulsion chamber detectors,           which are arrays of nuclear emulsion plates.  The procedure will permit         precise observations of the produced particle tracks.  This experiment          is possible because the new CERN heavy ion beam became available in             late 1986.  The research is strengthened because the U.S. group is              expert in the design and construction of emulsion chambers, and their           Swedish counterparts are strong in exposure arrangements and analysis           of data, and they are well-known for their theoretical interpretation           of multiparticle production.  The proposed cooperation presents the             U.S. investigators with an opportunity to work with one of the world's          leading research groups and to use highly specialized facilities abroad         that are not easily available to them in the U.S.",
