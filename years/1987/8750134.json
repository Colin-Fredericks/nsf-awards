HPLC is recognized as an instrumental technique of major importance in          both biology and chemistry.  The project director, who has been actively        involved in the development of HPLC instrumentation and software, along         with his colleagues, is revising the curriculum in both the biology and         chemistry programs so as to provide students with practical, hands-on           experience with this fundamental instrumental technique.  Seven courses         in the two departments are being affected by the project, as well as the        independent study and undergraduate research programs.  The HPLC system         is complementing existing laboratory instrumentation and computer               equipment, opening up new learning opportunities.",
