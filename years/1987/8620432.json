 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biologists have long argued that individuals avoid extreme              inbreeding in order to reduce the probability of producing                      genetically inferior offspring through inbreeding depression.                   Support for this argument is scarce, since only for humans and                  certain plants is there unequivocal evidence from the same                      species for both the avoidance of extreme inbreeding and                        inbreeding depression.  Black-tailed prairie dogs living under                  natural conditions in South Dakota avoid extreme inbreeding by                  four different mechanisms, but preliminary evidence from 19                     inbred litters indicates that there is no inbreeding depression.                Research to further investigate the apparent lack of inbreeding                 depression among wild prairie dogs is proposed.  Infanticide as                 well as communal nursing has been observed nearly simultaneously                in this species.  Similar communal nursing has been observed in                 only a handful of mammalian species, and never before in a rodent               living under natural conditions.  Research to further investigate               the shift from attempted infanticide to communal nursing in                     prairie dogs is proposed.",
