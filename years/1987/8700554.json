 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some commercially important chemicals are produced in trickle                   bed reactors where gaseous and liquid reactants flow                            cocurrently down through a fixed catalyst bed.  An important                    feature of such three-phase system is that the catalyst pellet                  may exposed to an extremely nonuniform environment because the                  flowing liquid may only partially contact (wet) the pellet                      surface.  Partial wetting can enhance or retard the rate of a                   reaction depending on whether the reaction is gas reactant                      limiting or liquid reactant limiting.  The purpose of the                       proposed work is to devise a meachanism which will enable                       reactor designers to predict how the intrinsic catalytic                        selectivity is altered by the multiphase transport associated                   with partial wetting.                                                                                                                                           The PIs plan to do both experimental as well as modelling work                  for this system.  Initially, a single pellet reactor is to be                   constructed and reaction rates will be measured.  Then four                     spherical pellets will be put together to simulate packing                      conditions in a large fuel scale reactor.  In this setup liquid                 pockets can be created and their effect on the reaction rate                    evaluated.  Facilities will thus exist to measure directly the                  relationship between the overall reaction rates (selectivity)                   and the wetting efficiency.",
