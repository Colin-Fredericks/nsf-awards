 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is now possible to make microelectrode arrays capable of                     stimulating and recording from many neurons at intervals                        approaching the dimensions of the neurons themselves.  The arrays               proposed offer an order of magnitude increase in observational                  power over conventional techniques, with the promise of                         hundredfold improvement in the future.  The technology is basic                 to the study of neural populations just as the microelectrode is                basic to the study of single cells, and will provide                            neurobiological systems.  Similarly, these tools are critical to                the development of human neural protheses which must have                       multidimensional interaction with various neural subsystems.                                                                                                    The primary goal of this research is to develop the planar                      electrode array as a stimulation and recording tool for research                with the brain slice preparation.  Dr. Bruce Wheeler has                        successfully applied a planar microelectrode array to the                       hippocampal brain slice preparation demonstrating that the array                makes it possible to record from and stimulate a significant                    fraction of the slice at 200 micro meter intervals simultaneously               or in an arbitrary pattern in time and space.  Many experiments                 currently done with one or two electrodes can be repeated with                  much greater observational power to survey the possible the state               of the different slice subregions.  The number of channels is                   vastly greater than that possible with microdrives or                           manipulators.  The efficiency of the experiment is multiplied b                 the increase in recorded data and the increase in the number of                 stimulus points, while the experimenter's efficiency is aided by                the fact that all electrodes ate positioned merely by placing the               slice on top of the array.  A technical advantage of the array                  does not occupy any of the restricted space above the slice, this               leaving room for additional electrodes and probes to stimulate,                 record, measure ion concentrations, and administer drugs.  Still,               the power of the array lies in its ability to give the                          experimenter a two dimensional image of slice activity and the                  ability to control or stimulate it as a system.",
