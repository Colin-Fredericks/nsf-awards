The program is designed to enable U.S.                  scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research              institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well          as Japan, Australia and New Zealand.  Exchange awards provide                   opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of          unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental                  conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                                                Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to             his/her field of science, the prospective potential of the applicants           for professional growth, as well as criteria relevant to the furthering         of international cooperation in science and engineering.  The program           is particularly directed to scientists and engineers who are embarking          on their research careers.                                                                                                                                      This research project will investigate human abilities to perceive,             organize and remember auditory sequences varying in pitch, duration,            and timbre.  The perceptual capacities for processing these dimensions          of auditory stimulation, and the interaction between them, will be              assessed in three sets of experiments using a variety of stimuli and            music-like patterns.                                                                                                                                            The project is under the direction of Dr. Carol L. Krumhansl, Associate         Professor, Department of Psychology, Cornell University, Ithaca NY              14853, U.S.A., and Dr. Stephen McAdams, Director of Pedagogy, IRCAM,            Centre Georges Pompidou, 31 rue Saint-Merri, F 75004, Paris, France.                                                                                            This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,              international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents                  allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat            administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
