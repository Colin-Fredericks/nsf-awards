 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sedimentary records of particle.associated pollutants contain                   valuable informatin on the history of pollution.  However, these                records are often distorted reflections of past fluxes because of               a variety of processes in the sediments such as mixing,                         biodegradation (organics), radioactive decay (radionuclides), and               compaction.                                                                                                                                                     This project is aimed at further development of methods for                     recovery of the historical input record of pollutants from the                  sedimentary profile.  Conveyor.belt transfer, molecular                         diffusion, and biodegradation of pollutants will be considered,                 when appropriate.  The time domain deconvolution method will be                 further investigated with regard to uniqueness, optimal choice of               time and space intervals, and error measures for deconvolved                    records.  It is also planned to examine an alternative                          deconvolution method based on inversion in the frequency domain.                                                                                                The developed methods will be applied to literature data and to                 experimental data for cores from Green Bay and Lake Michigan.                   Pollutants of interest include lead, zinc, cadmium,                             polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.",
