 "awd_abstract_narration": "Meteorologic and hydrologic instrumentation will be used to improve             field laboratories and computer studies in Geology and Biology courses          at Williams College.  The instruments will be used at a weather station         in Hopkins Memorial Forest, an experimental forest managed by Williams          College, and the focus of field classes and independent research in the         environmental sciences.  The sensors and data loggers will be installed         at the existing weather station, and three portable meteorologic and            hydrologic stations will be assembled for use at remote sites.  Use of          state-of-the-art instruments which encode data in digital format will           permit easy transfer of weather and hydrologic data to computer files.          Portable instrumentation will significantly improve the quantity and            quality of data collected in the field and used in required courses such        as Geomorphology, Environmental Biology, and Communities and Ecosystems.        Computer  files of weather and hydrologic data will also be used to             develop new  field and computer labs in elective courses such as Weather        and Climate and Computers in Geology.  Biology and Geology majors most          likely to  go to graduate school, those students involved in field              studies for senior honors theses, will gain invaluable experience using         modern instrumentation and computer reduction of data from their field          sites.",
