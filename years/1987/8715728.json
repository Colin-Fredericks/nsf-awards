 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator proposes to design and implement             linear algebra library for a wide range of currently used                       supercomputers.  The library is intended to provide a uniform set               of subroutines to solve the most common linear algebra problems                 and to run efficiently on a range of architectures.  This                       library, which will be freely accessible via computer network,                  not only will ease code development, make codes more portable                   among machines of different architectures, and increase                         efficiency, but also will provide tools for evaluating                          supercomputer performance.  The library will be based on the                    well-known and widely used LINPACK and EISPACK packages for                     linear equation solving, eigenvalue problems, and linear least                  squares.  LINPACK and EISPACK have provided an important                        infrastructure for scientific computing on serial machines, but                 they are not designed to exploit the profusion of parallel and                  vector architectures now becoming available.  We propose to                     rewrite the algorithms in terms of calls to a small number of                   Extended Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines each of which                         implements a basic operation such as matrix multiplication,                     rank-k matrix updates, and solving triangular systems.  These                   operations can be optimized for each architecture, but the                      underlying numerical algorithms will be the same for all                        machines.",
