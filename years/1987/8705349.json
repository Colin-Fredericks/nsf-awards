 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introduction:  The transient structure and property changes that                occur in glassy polymers during chemical and physical aging                     and/or annealing below  the glass-transition temperature Tg are                 of great current research interest.  This time-dependent                        behavior, also referred to as volume or enthalpy relaxation (or                 recovery), originates from the nonequilibrium nature of the                     glassy state.  From an application point of view, it is apparent                that this phenomenon is the controlling factor in predicting the                \"initial\" behavior as well as the practical performance of glassy               or partially glassy polymeric materials during their useful                     lifetimes.                                                                                                                                                      Research Summary:  In this research, the PIs probe the effects of               controlled (and accelerated) chemical and physical aging and/or                 rejuvenation on achievable barrier property levels in a carefully               selected glassy polymer of major commercial significance                        (polyethylene terephthalate).  This will be accomplished by                     conditioning the polymer over a range of temperatures below Tg                  with small molecule penetrants (at high chemical potentials)                    which are interactive with small segment regions.  Most                         importantly, the microstructural changes which specifically                     control the behavior of transport parameters in sorption and                    diffusion will be directly measured and identified for the first                time, via monitoring of the kinetics of the isomerization                       reaction which governs the distribution of polymer segmental                    conformers.  The research will be accomplished through combined                 experiments utilizing gas transmission and Fourier Transform I.R.               Spectroscopy, together with enthalpy relaxation studies.                                                                                                        Significance:  The results of this work will contribute strongly                to the development of a comprehensive molecular theory which may                lead to the design of a variety of new and/or improved processes                for the production of glassy polymers with superior properties in               packaging applications, as protective coatings, and for use as                  permselective membranes in energy-efficient separations of                      gaseous mixtures, to cite only a few examples.  Also, knowledge                 of both transport and mechanical property variations (which can                 be interrelated through free volume and its distribution) will be               acquired in this research.  It is anticipated that novel polymer                microstructural states with significantly enhanced property                     levels and application lifetimes will be discovered.",
