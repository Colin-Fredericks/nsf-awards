 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polar regions characteristically have marked seasonal variation in the          availability of food due to great reduction or elimination of primary           production during the winter.  It is hypothesized that the evolution            of large body size in high-latitude planktonic organisms is a response          to this extreme seasonality of food supply and permits winter survival          by increasing the store of body tissues and lipids available for                metabolism.  Yen proposes to further examine the ecology and lipid              metabolism of Euchaeta antarctica, a predaceous copepod and the                 largest species in this worldwide genus, to test the above hypothesis.          She will also examine the role of this species in the marine food web,          and determine how its life history and physiological specializations            adapt it for survival in a polar regime.  Data from this project in             combination with other information on Euchaeta antarctica will advance          present understanding of why this species is a major component of               Antarctic zooplankton and a dominant planktonic carnivore.  This project        will examine lipid content and composition of female Euchaeta                   antarctica, their eggs and their food.  Rate of lipogenesis will be             determined by carbon-14 labeling.  The project also will examine changes        in lipid metabolism with ontogeny and reproductive state, and as a              function of environmental temperature.  Field work will be done at              Palmer Station, Antarctica.",
