 "awd_abstract_narration": "Visual acuity is a measure of how well the eye can resolve very                 tiny targets, and is limited by the size and distribution                       of the photoreceoptor cells in the eye.  However, a slight                      sideways displacement break in an otherwise straight line can be                detected when the displacement is as much as five times less                    than the normal acuity would predict.  This discriminability is                 known as hyperacuity, and can be demonstrated by this stimulus                  called vernier displacement, or by displacement of a grating                    pattern or by bisection of a pattern.  Understanding hyperacuity                is important for understanding visual information processing                    because hyperacuity reveals the ultimate precision of visual                    localization in space.                                                                                                                                          This project will study how spatial and temporal properties of                  information channels in the eye and brain determine the                         limits of hyperacuity.  Single neurons (nerve cells) in the                     visual system have particular response properties that                          preferentially filter particular frequencies in time                            (cycles/sec) or space (cycles/degree, of a grating, for example).                                                                                               Hyperacuity targets or vernier and grating displacement will be                 presented to human observers, and then these targets will be                    \"masked\" by the presence of flickering illumination, or                         superimposed gratings, or spatiotemporal noise.  The                            discriminations will be compared for these different cases.  To                 determine the dynamic characteristics of the neural mechanisms                  involved will require measurement of displacement thresholds as                 a function of luminance contrast, color contrast, mean                          luminance, and temporal frequency.  Finally, a comparison will be               attempted between human hyperacuity performance and the                         hyperacute capabilities of single neurons in the macaque                        monkey's visual pathway.                                                                                                                                        The goal of this work is a comprehensive understanding of the                   neural basis for hyperacuity.  The approach combining                           psychophysics, physiology and mathematical modelling is rare and                powerful.  Understanding this wonderful performance in terms of                 neural mechanisms will lead to a better theoretical basis for                   understanding the ultimate limits of visual performance.",
