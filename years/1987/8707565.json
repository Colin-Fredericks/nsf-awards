Research will be conducted                   in the Rio Mora uplift, northern New Mexico, an area that                       affords outcrops of rocks of widely varying permeabilities and,                 correspondingly, different responses to fluid infiltration.                     The topographic and structural relief of the area, 900-3500 m.,                 will be utilized to map infiltration pathways in three                          dimensions.                                                                             Fluid migration pathways will be monitored using a multi-               disciplinary methodology:  (1) the composition of coexisting                    ilmenite, rutile (or magnetite), and graphite will be determined                to track changing fluid compositions during metamorphism; and                   (2) oxygen isotope analyses of minerals will be used to trace                   fluid sources.  Dynamics of the infiltration process will be                    examined by using mineral inclusions in porphyroblasts to                       follow changes in composition of metamorphic fluids.  Results                   of the research should contribute to understanding mechanisms                   that control the permeabilities of metamorphic rocks and to                     developing a three-dimensional pattern of fluid infiltration                    pathways.",
