 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            established to provide support to strengthen the research environments          and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions or                      institutions that have substantial minority student enrollments.                Eligible institutions must also have graduate programs in science or            programs in engineering.  Funding is provided for faculty research in           fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and for           the acquisition of research instrumentation.  City College will                 utilize RIMI support to purchase equipment that will expose their               students to state-of-the-art laser, minicomputer, and spectroscopic             techniques.  Researchers at City College will use cyanine dyes as               spectral sensitizers to inject mobile electrons into seminconductor             substrates.  The resultant mobile electrons can lead to reactions at            the surface of semiconductors that have wide scientific and commerical          implications.                                                                                                                                                   This project on photodynamics will meet the research needs of a first           rate urban institution that educates minorities at the leading edge of          the physical sciences.  The principal investigator, who is a minority,          is an expert in Raman surface scattering and has experience in the              academic and industrial sectors.  The Foundation has supported this             project because minority faculty and students will have their research          capabilities enhanced by their participation in meritorious                     experimental and theoretical activities.",
