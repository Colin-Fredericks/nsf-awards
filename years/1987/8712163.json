 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American steel industry is going through a critical period in which         production and profitability have greatly declined.  For the U.S. to be         internationally competitive, it must develop new technologies which are         less capital and labor intensive and more effective in the use of               available resources.  The National Science Foundation as a supporter of         basic research can provide the incentive to investigate the fundamental         principles of high risk, high pay-off concepts.  In addition, the               Foundation is a viable source for training of highly skilled personnel -        a prerequisite for technological innovations.                                                                                                                   The purpose of this one day workshop is to bring together the research          leaders of the steel industry and selected faculty members for a                thorough evaluation of current state of research and limitations of             present technology.  The workshop will define the long term research and        educational needs of the industry.  A report will be produced describing        the research opportunities and a list of recommendations.                                                                                                       The principal investigator has 36 years of research experience in the           iron and steel industry.  The guarantee organization is a small                 business.",
