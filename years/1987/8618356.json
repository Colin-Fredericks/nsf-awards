 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue the development of a master                  curve of geomagnetic secular variation for western North America                during the last 12,000 years.  The curve is derived from the                    paleomagnetic study of suites of overlapping cores from small                   lakes in the western United States.  The records from each lake                 are correlated on the basis of ash layers from various Cascade                  volcanoes.  The research will involve the measurement and                       analysis of samples already collected from five lakes as well as                the collection of samples from several additional sites.  These                 samples will be used to verify and refine a proposed master                     curve of secular variation as well as to develop a curve of                     geomagnetic intensity variation.  These curves will be compared                 to those developed from lava flows and archaeological features                  as well as from lakes in other parts of North America.  As the                  curves are being developed, they will be used to solve geologic                 problems relating to the distribution of volcanic ash layers,                   the assessment of volcanic hazards, and the dating of archae\u001aological           sites.  In  addition, the relationship between rock magnetic properties         and various palynological and sedimen\u001atological indicators o f climate          and environment will be studies.  The PI is at the forefront of this            important area of paleo\u001amagnetism.  Funding at the revised level is             recommended.",
