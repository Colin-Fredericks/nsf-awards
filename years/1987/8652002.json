 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the expressed needs of local teachers of                 mathematics at the Grades 5-9 level in an area of California where              opportunities for enhancing their teaching skills and content updating          are not readily available.  The program is set up to run during the             spring, winter and summer semesters at times that were indicated as             being preferable by the teachers who were polled for this information.          A second level local effort has been constructed to guarantee that the          concepts identified and learned in these courses get to other teachers          and students.  Two to four teachers per school comprise a \"team\" from           each of fifteen participating schools for a total of 45 participants.           These teachers will act as \"mentor teachers\" for their colleagues.              Instruction for these mentor teachers will include leadership strategies        as well as discipline course content.  Two Cooperating Teachers, chosen         by the first group of participants, will work along with their                  colleagues in their schools.  The follow-up program at each school,             subsidized by the Teacher Education and Computer (TEC)Centers and the           school districts, centers on participant-given workshops for their              peers.  Project instructional staff will attend and provide resources           for these workshops.  Mentor teachers will conduct at least two                 workshops and work closely with their two Cooperating teachers.                                                                                                 Credit will be awarded for participation in this program, and women and         minority applicants who will be good role models for their colleagues           and students will be identified and selected.  An Advisory Council made         up of two participants, one staff member and one school administrator           will provide on-going feedback and information to the Project Director,         faculty and participants.                                                                                                                                       Dr. Stannard has thirty-three years of experience with Mathematics              Education which includes Directorship and Co-Directorship of eight NSF          grants in Mathematics and/or Computer Education.  He has assembled a            very impressive staff for this project.                                                                                                                         This project has the potential of impacting on a substantial number of          schools in a rural area of California whose teachers have expressed             strong needs in Mathematics.  Therefore, a grant award in the amount of         $117,628 for the requested period of one year is recommended.",
