 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water distribution systems are greatly in need of evaluation, repair,           retrofitting and rehabilitation in order to continue to be serviceable          to the communities.                                                                                                                                             Reliable engineering methods are needed to determine the existing               conditions and to predict the remaining useful life of the systems.  In         order to evaluate the distribution systems this project will develop            hydraulic analysis models to determine the design characteristics based         on the various pressures and flow requirements.  The mathematical model         will enable a decision maker to select and evaluate various                     modifications to the existing systems.                                                                                                                          Parameters to be evaluated are:  pipe sizes, storage facilities, and            pumping requirements.  With this data base an engineer will be able to          evaluate the best method for rehabilitation or repair.                                                                                                          The researcher is qualified to perform this investigation.                                                                                                      The project is recommended for an award.                                                                                                                        This is the first year of a three year award with an increment of               $54,953.",
