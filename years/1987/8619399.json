 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs propose to use a flow cytometer to gather information on                the feeding, growth, and reproduction patterns of ciliated                      protozoa in varying environments.  The information thus generated               could have ultimate use in wastewater treatment facilities as                   well as serve as a model system for other similar microorganisms                in various ecological systems.                                                                                                                                  Protozoa are unicellular, eucaryotic microorganisms that ingest                 and digest bacteria.  Flow cytometry can not only provide large                 scale statistical information but also information on the                       internal structure of single cells.  The specific objectives of                 the project include:                                                                                                                                                 (1)  Development of an index or measure of the physiological                         state of a single cell in a constant environment                                                                                                           (2)  Extension of (1) above for changing environments                                                                                                           (3)  Development of a model of suspension feeding by cells                           of different physiological states that will be                                  applicable to situations where the number density as                            well as the composition of the population of particles                          fed upon vary.                                                                                                                                             (4)  Development of a mathematical model that will allow the                         prediction of the joint distributions of cellular                               properties in a ciliate population and how these                                distributions change in response to changes in                                  environmental conditions.                                                                                                                             Both PIs are well respected by their peers and the facilities are               ideal for this work.",
