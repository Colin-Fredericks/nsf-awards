 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for research in geometry at             the University of Oklahoma.  It is aimed primarily at introducing               graduate students to research in geometry through research in                   finitely starlike sets.                                                                 The goal of the research is to obtain Krasnosel'skii numbers            for finitely starlike sets, both in the plane and in higher                     dimensions.  There are two basic problems to be considered, each                motivated by existing results for starshaped sets.  The first                   concerns the development of Krasnosel'skii - type (Helly - type)                theorems which determine whether a set S is finitely starlike,                  while the second concerns the development of theorems which                     reveal the measures of the F - stars in S for F any finite subset               of S.                                                                                   This is a very basic area of geometric research.  It is                 expected that graduate students working in this area will be                    prepared for work in many other areas of research as well,                      building on the fine program in geometry already in place at                    Oklahoma.",
