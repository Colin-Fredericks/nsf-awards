 "awd_abstract_narration": "Narrative: Enzymes are proteins contained within cells that serve as            biological catalysts of specific biochemical reactions.  Production             of a myriad of enzymes for both analytical, diagnostic, or                      therapeutic uses is a major concern of the biochemical industry.                Enzymes are produced by cultivating microorganisms under optimum                growth conditions, collecting the microbe, and extracting and                   purifying the desired protein.                                                                                                                                  Currently, two classes of enzymes, alcohol- and glucose-oxidizing               enzymes, are produced commercially using the yeast, Hansenula                   polymorpha, grown in continuous culture using a single carbon energy            substrate; either methanol or glucose.  Results of past work                    indicate levels of both enzymes can be doubled or tripled if a                  mixture of glucose and methanol is used at low growth rate.                                                                                                     This research intends to extend the above steady-state work to                  investigate effects of prescribed shifts in both system growth rate             and substrate carbon mixtures on enzymes productivity.  Results will            increase our understanding of microbial regulatory processes under              transient conditions.",
