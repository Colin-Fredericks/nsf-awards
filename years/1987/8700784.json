 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is the third bridge workshop under the auspices of the UJNR        Panel on Seismic and Wind Effects.                                                                                                                              The objective of the Workshop is to continue the cooperation between            Japan and the United States on the general topic of research pertaining         to bridge structures.                                                                                                                                           The major considerations to be discussed at this Workshop are the               evaluation of performance and strengthening of bridges of various types,        in order to arrive at a coordinated program of research.                                                                                                        The researcher is qualified to perform this project by past experiences         on conducting previous Workshops and by his highly regarded technical           competence.                                                                                                                                                     The project is recommended for an award.  This is a one time award for          12 months.",
