 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of mass spectrometry. The                         objectives of this research are the development of new                          instrumentation and methodologies with which the peptide                        sequences of biopolymers at the picomole level can be determined.               By combining fast atom and ion bombardment techniques for sample                ionization with tandem quadrupole Fourier transform detection of                fragment ions, Professor Hunt has, during the tenure of NSF grant               CHE-8319728, developed a prototype mass spectrometer with which                 the high resolution characterization of polymeric ions with                     masses ranging up to 13,000 Daltons has been demonstrated.  The                 current project renews those efforts and has as its primary                     target the optimization of this new instrument which should                     enable the sequence analysis of biopolymers of up to 50,000                     Daltons.                                                                                                                                                        New concepts in mass spectrometer instrumentation are expected to               ensue from this research project.  These advances in instrument                 and technique development could provide unprecedented analytical                capability for the characterization of trace quantities of                      polymeric materials and impact broadly and positively in                        biotechnology and materials chemistry.",
