 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most promising area to detect long range forces and the             Casimir effect lies in electromagnetic interactions.  However,                  the hope of observing this interaction between a pair of atoms is               extremely small.  Recent precision experiments on the fine                      structure of helium Rydberg states has given rise to the hope of                observing the Casimir interaction between the highly excited                    electron and the core atom even though for the states studied                   experimentally, the Rydberg electron is not quite in the                        asymptotic region where the Casimer effect manifests itself in a                pronounced way.  A thorough relativistic quantum field theoretic                evaluation of the two photon exchange potential in the electron-                ion interaction for all distances beyond a few Bohr radii has                   been carried out recently, and a variety of corrections                         comparable to the Casimir effect have been estimated.  An                       accurate verification of the Casimir effect seems to be within                  reach of both theory and experiment.  In this proposal, The                     principal investigator describes recent progress made and plans                 to improve on the calculations and extend the investigation to a                variety of systems of interest.",
