 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the arrival of people for the first time on the island            of Madagascar at about 500 A.D., there have been a startling                    series of environmental changes: all of the island's largest                    native animal species -- primates, birds, land tortoises and a                  pygmy hippopotamus -- have become extinct, forests have been                    reduced in extent, other areas of natural vegetation degraded and               there have been massive increases in erosion and water run-off.                 This interdisciplinary project is an attempt to understand the                  causes of this long history of environmental degradation, and in                particular to find out which precise human actions may be                       responsible.  The research is of relevance to other studies of                  the past -- paleoecological, paleontological, and archaeological,               but it is also important as a guide to future action. The results               will be of critical value to those analysts seeking to halt the                 ecological degradation in Madagascar and other areas of Africa                  and the tropics, who need a solid base from which to prepare                    effective environmental policies and programs.",
