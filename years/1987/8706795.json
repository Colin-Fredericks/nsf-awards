 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the project is to develop models in which the                        information which is salient for problems of political philosophy               can be represented and incorporated into a formal theory.                       Various axiomatic approaches in bargaining theory, cooperative                  game theory, and non-cooperative game theory are adapted and                    used to rigorously derive implications for economic policy of                   different political philosophies.  The project develops new                     tools for modelling problems of distributive justice.  These                    tools do a better job of capturing our intuitions about                         distributive justice and related ethical questions because they                 include information about property rights and about the                         distribution of physical objects which fulfill various needs and                desires.  Past models of social choice focus only on the                        distribution of utilities and abstract from the characteristics                 of economic environments.                                                                                                                                       This formal theory is developed and applied to actual resource                  allocation problems.  For example, suppose an international                     organization such as the World Health Organization takes as its                 objective to distribute its limited resources in such a way as to               equalize the opportunities that all countries have to achieve an                improvement in their rates of infant mortality.  The distribution               of resources across countries consistent with fundamental                       principles of justice can be rigorously derived from this theory.",
