 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two campaigns to measure transient tracers in the Atlantic              Ocean (TTO/NAS and TTO/Equatorial) were funded by NSF during the                period from 1980 to 1985.  A complete data base for modelling                   this ocean basin would include a South Atlantic Study to:                               1.Determine CO2 transports and their influence on world                 climate,                                                                        2.Constrain models of major ocean currents in this area,                        and                                                                             3.Confirm an observed 5-fold increase in the addition                           rate of new carbon to the thermocline.                                                  Eight components of such a study will be performed by                   investigators from LDGO, Princeton, University of Washington,                   WHOI, and SIO.  The track record of these scientists is well                    established by successful completion of previous studies in the                 Equatorial and North Atlantic.  They will provide physical and                  chemical expertise which will be directed toward a cooperative                  effort to reach the goals of the geochemical study.                                     This component is aimed at improving our understanding of               the dynamic transport of CO2 by Antarctic water masses formed in                zones of different climates.  Previous investigations showed that               a prominent circumpolar CO2 sink zone is located in a latitudinal               range of 40 degrees S - 50 degrees S, and that it is closely                    associated with the zone of confluence of the warm Subtropical                  water with the cold Subantarctic water. This zone accounts for                  about 40% of the global oceanic uptake flux for CO2.  The low                   pCO2 values in the surface water of this zone are attributed                    mainly to the effect of cooling of the warm Subtropical gyre                    waters and to the mixing of the cooled water with the high-pCO.                 and high-nutrient Antarctic waters.  Photosynthetic utilization                 of CO2 further reduces the surface water pCO2 value.  In the                    vicinity of this confluence zone, an effective overturning of the               water column down to about 500 meters is induced mainly by                      cooling of the high-salinity Subtropical waters.  This process                  would transport the CO2 taken up by the surface water of this CO2               sink zone into the South Atlantic thermocline.  One of the major                objectives of the proposed investigation is to estimate the rate                of this transport using the tracer and CO2 data obtained during                 the experiment.",
