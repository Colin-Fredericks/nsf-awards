 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an important project which requests time on the Cornell                 supercomputer to study the relative computational efficiencies of               parallel and serial processors in solving very large economic                   optimization problems.  The supercomputer is becoming a very important          research tool in economic analysis.  Many economic models which are             realistic from a behavioral standpoint are not computationally                  tractable on standard mainframe computers.  They are, however,                  solvable with the aid of a supercomputer.  This project develops                efficient vector algorithms for the solution of large economic                  optimization models.                                                                                                                                            Technically, the research models large-scale equilibrium economies as           variational inequality problems.  This general set of problems                  encompasses a wide variety of economic frameworks, such as                      oligopolistic markets, inventory and investment optimization for                firms, allocation and management of non-renewable resources, and                traffic networks.  Professor Nagurney is an experienced researcher in           the areas of mathematical programming and economic optimization.",
