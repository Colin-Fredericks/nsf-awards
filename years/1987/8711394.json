 "awd_abstract_narration": "Yau will continue his investigations of geometric questions                which relate to problems in physics. His investigations of Kahler               metrics on low dimensional manifolds are of importance in                       superstring theory. The latter is currently being studied in the                context of the search for a complete unified field theory.                           The existence of complete Kahler-Einstein metrics on Kahler                manifolds has recently been related to the positivity of the                    first Chern class. This result, together with its implications                  for algebraic geometry, will be further investigated. In                        particular, for non-compact manifolds, the construction of such                 metrics with either negative or zero scalar curvature will be                   studied. Yau will also attempt to find a clear understanding of                 complete Kahler-Einstein metrics with zero Ricci curvature. These               are extensively studied by particle physicists who are interested               in superstring theory.",
