 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides a research experienc for eight                         undergraduates for an eight week period during the summer.                      Throughout this period the students will attend a seminar given                 by various experts in the field.  They will also participate in a               computer laboratory.  Toward the end of the program they will be                required to give reports on the work that they have done.  One of               the goals of the program is to have each student write a short                  manuscript suitable for publication.  They will have access to                  the considerable computing power at the University of Colorado to               carry out their projects.                                                            The focus of this grant is on developing parallel algorithms               for problems in nonlinear dynamics.  These are two rapidly                      growing, highly exciting fields of applied mathematics which are                quite accessible to undergraduates.  One of the areas of research               will be in polynomial root finding.  The other area comes from                  the theory of odinary differential equations which exhibit                      strange attractors and chaotic dynamics.  These both are areas                  for which parallel processing has a nice potential to increase                  the efficiency of the algorithms and for which there is a great                 deal left to be explored.                                                            This program will bring the students into an interesting                   area of mathematics and computation.  With the close association                of the various faculty members the experience should be a very                  valuable one for the students.  This proposal is being funded                   through the Research Experiences for Undergraduate program (REU)                and represents a good example of the goals of the program.",
