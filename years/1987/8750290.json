 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will improve six upper level courses of the computer science        program.  The improvement will be made possible by the purchase of four         workstations and one file server that are Unix based and feature high           resolution graphics displays.  The availability of Unix and C will allow        students to attack more significant software projects in Operating              Systems, Programming Languages and Compiler Construction.  Students in          Computer Graphics will be able to perform more sophisticated graphics           modeling and access standard graphics libraries in their software               projects.  Students in the computer Science Senior Research Courses will        be able to perform experiments on system parameters and performance             because a given student will be able to have exclusive control at a             workstation for blocks of time.  Experience with Unix is becoming               crucial because of its dominance as an operating system used in graduate        programs.  Furthermore, experience with Unix, C, high performance               graphics workstations and networked systems is very advantageous to             graduates entering professional computer science careers today.",
