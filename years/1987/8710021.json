 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Harold Papkoff plans to continue his important studies on the               isolation and characterization of pituitary hormones from the pituitary         glands of a number of lower vertebrates (birds, reptiles, amphibians            and chickens).  These hormones are the factors that regulate growth,            development and the reproductive cycle in these organisms.  Over the            past few years, Dr. Papkoff has developed procedures for the                    purification of these important hormones and has supplied them to               comparative endocrinologists working on reproduction and growth in              these animals.  In this proposal, he plans to characterize the pure             hormones in terms of their amino acid sequences, the nature of any              carbohydrate side chains that may be part of the molecules and the              physical nature of the hormone molecules in terms of their shape and            steric orientations.  These latter studies are particularly important           because they may lead to a better understanding of the differential             biological potency or reactivity of these hormones in the different             biological systems.  This information is critical to understanding              hormone action at the molecular and cellular level and in the design of         drugs or hormones that could be used to regulate growth and                     reproductive process in all vertebrates.",
