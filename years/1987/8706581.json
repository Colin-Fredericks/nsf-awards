 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many ecological communities are structured in ways                      considerably more subtle and complex than can be expressed in the               standard trophic hierarchy, with its superimposed layers of                     predators, potentially cross-linked by competition.  Drawing upon               nine years of research on the littoral biota of Bays Mountain                   Lake (Kingsport, TN), this project will identify and measure the                critical biotic interactions among the dominant vertebrate                      predator (redear sunfish, Lepomis microlophus), the dominant                    invertebrate predator (larvae of the dragonfly Tetragoneuria                    cynosura), and their prey community.                                                    The three component experiments examining these interactions            will be conducted: (1) large-enclosure experiment manipulating                  two size-classes of fish; (2) a small-enclosure experiment                      manipulating small fish and two-year classes of dragonflies; and                (3) laboratory experiments designed to identify the behavioral                  mechanisms underlying the field results and strengthen their                    interpretation.  Concepts emerging from each component will be                  integrated by the research team to provide a realistic model of                 forces structuring littoral communities.                                                These studies are designed to measure the direct effects of             predation, which may result in either increased mortality or                    reduced growth or both.  Indirect effects of predation will also                be assessed and may be either stimulatory or inhibitory to                      particular prey.  Interference and exploitation competition is                  the final aspect which may be either within or between species.                 The results will help change our fundamental assumptions about                  community organization, and will provide a comprehensive                        understanding of one community's structure, including how that                  structure arises from underlying behavioral and ecological                      mechanism.  Understanding gained through this collaborative                     effort will provide a valuable information base for fisheries                   biologists and lake managers.",
