 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to a Project Solicitation, the Consortium for                       Scientific Computing, representing the John von Neumann Center,                 submitted a proposal to conduct a Supercomputer Summer Institute                in 1987.  This proposal and eight others were evaluated by a                    review panel.  CSC proposes a three-week Institute for 25 senior                researchers during the period July 27 to August 14.  Attendees will             provide some of their own support and will be given an early account            on the JVNC Cyber 205 supercomputers for familiarization.  Terminals                                                                                            and high-power workstations of various kinds will be available as               well as consulting help and office space.  Lectures in various                  aspects of advanced computing will be given, with special                       emphasis on fluid and plasma dynamics, computational chemistry,                 and computer science and supercomputing.  25 additional                         researchers located near the JVNC will attend at no extra cost.                                                                                                 Reviewers found both good and bad aspects to this proposal.                     Students will be expected to have a degree of expertise on                      supercomputing prior to attending; the focus will be more on the                scientific aspects of computational science than on the nuts and                bolts of supercomputer usage.  With the right attendees, this                   could be an exciting intellectual forum.  The panel was concerned               with the high cost of the proposal, and the need for support                    personnel and terminals for so many (50) attendees.                                                                                                             The Principle Investigator has agreed that the 25 local attendees               will attend lectures only, with no supercomputer access or                      some machines to the JVNC.  Finally, the PI's salary will not be                charged to the grant.  These savings have reduced the cost from                 $163,000 to a more reasonable $63,000.  In addition, an undergraduate           component of $7000 has been proposed.                                                                                                                           The Centers Program recommends support of a Supercomputer Summer                Institute at the John von Neumann Center in the amount of $70,000.",
