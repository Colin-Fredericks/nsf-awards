 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is intense competition between three religious groups                in urban Brazil:  Progressive Catholics, evangelical Protestants,               and folk Catholics.  The former two groups have attracted so many               adherents that Brazilian politicians are trying to tap them as                  potential supporters.  This research will focus on the social                   bases of these three religious groups in a working-class                        community of Rio de Janeiro.  Using a variety of anthropological                methods, the student will see who joins which group, discover the               reasons for the choice, and see how this affects politics in                    Brazil.                                                                              This project is one of the first in-depth studies of                       Brazilian religion that focuses on the political and social                     aspects of membership.  It will contribute to understanding the                 social bases of social and religious movements that have major                  implications for politics not only in Brazil but also throughout                the developing world.",
