 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is focused on improving database system                           performance, particularly for distributed databases, distributed                transaction management and real-time database applications. The                 performance of concurrency control algorithms, distributed join                 algorithms and load balancing techniques for distributed database               systems are all investigated, in addition to techniques such as                 main memory databases for achieving high performance.  Another                  major aspect of the research is the development of extensible                   database systems, including the necessary storage management                    facilities and programming tools.  The EXODUS system, under                     development with this research, is intended to support the rapid                implementation of database management facilities for database                   applications that are poorly served by current relational                       database systems.  The EXODUS group is building \"database system                generator\" software, including a set of versatile kernel database               facilities and software tools to simplify the construction of                   customized database management systems.                                                                                                                         Research on distributed database systems and their performance is               vital for guiding the designers of future database systems. While               relational database systems are now a commercial reality, and                   their distributed counterparts are starting to become available,                significant challenges remain for understanding and improving                   their performance.  Extensible database systems such as those                   investigated here are essential to go beyond relational databases               and support a wide range of emerging database applications:                     computer assisted design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM),                           computer-aided software engineering, scientific data management,                image/voice data management, and data-intensive AI applications.                The success of large-scale efforts in these areas will depend on                flexible, high-performance data management facilities such as                   those developed in EXODUS project.",
