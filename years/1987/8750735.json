 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of recent developments make it highly desirable for this               institution to develop its capability to exploit the Fox River as a             convenient outdoor laboratory for coursework and independent student            research.  Included among these are the approval of a new Environmental         Science major, increased emphasis on aquatic research by faculty in the         Biological Sciences, improvement in water quality and biotic diversity          in the Fox River, and the relative inaccessibility of traditional               terrestrial and small aquatic sites. (Although limited shore-based              sampling was possible before the acquisition of the equipment provided          in part through this grant, a lack of sampling gear appropriate for             large riverine habitats prevented thorough use of the river.)                                                                                                   Acquisition of a versatile new boat-contained aquatic sampling system           with capabilities for electrofishing and for making standard                    limnological measurements in large aquatic habitats effectively removes         that barrier, making possible sound field-based laboratory experiences          for undergraduates in this program.",
