 "awd_abstract_narration": "Konza Prairie is a 3487 hectare tallgrass prairie                          laboratory located about 10 km south of Kansas State University.                This site is a Man and the Biosphere preserve, an Ecological                    Experimental Reserve and a Long-Term Ecological Research                        facility.  Konza rairie was also selected as the site of the                    first field experiment for the NASA-sponsored International                     Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project.                                          A large and increasing portion of current and pending                      research at the Prairie is focused on roots, on soil microbes and               chemistry, on the growth, demography and life histories of                      underground plant parts, and on buried seed and rhizome pool                    dynamics.  Samples of soils and vegetation presently must be                    transported and processed at Kansas State University because                    adequate on-site laboratory facilities are not available at the                 Prairie.                                                                             This project will provide funds to remodel a building at                   Konza Prairie to house a modern and much-needed belowground                     studies laboratory.  This addition will greatly facilitate                      research on belowground processes, will provide on-site                         laboratory facilities for visiting scientists, will expand the                  site's ability to sample and process large quantities of soil,                  soil fauna and underground plant parts, and will allow the                      sampling and processing of prairie soil during periods when                     climatic conditions otherwise would prohibit field-processing of                such samples.",
