 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to provide a better                         understanding of the Lagrangian residual flow generated in                      shallow estuaries.  Particles and solutes are carried with the                  Lagrandain velocity.  Therefore, knowledge of the controlling                   mechanisms of the Lagrandain velocity is esstenial for the                      prediction of salinity and pollutant distributions.  Both                       stratification and topography have strong effects on the                        Lagrangian residual flow.  Because the two-layer flow in a                      strongly forced estuary is in a nearly critical (flood) or                      partially supercritical (ebb) internal hydraulic state, local                   topographic features (e.g., bends, bars and holes) with wave                    lengths of less than one tidal excursion have a strong effect                   on isopycnal displacement and vertical mixing, and therefore on                 Lagrangian drifts.  Thus, the salinity and Lagrangian flow                      distribution, vertical exchange processes and esturine                          topography are all closely related.  This three-year research                   project combines accurate, small-scale field measurements of                    flow over typical topographic features with computer modeling                   to determine the essential interactions.  The models include                    turbulent mixing effects caused by stratified boundary layers                   and free shear layers.",
