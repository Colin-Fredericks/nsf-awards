 "awd_abstract_narration": "The technique of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) is                    used in radio astronomy to observe fine-scale structure in                      radio sources.  Observations are made simultaneously from radio                 telescopes separated by thousands of miles.  The data is                        recorded on magnetic tapes and sent to a single location to                     reduce the data.  One can thus observe structures                               one-thousandth of a second of arc in angular separation.  This                  is more than a hundred times better than one can observe with                   physically connected or single telescopes.  The same techniques                 can be used to measure crustal motions on the Earth.  The VLBI                  observations are important to our understanding of the physical                 processes taking place in radio sources such as quasars.                                                                                                        The Principal Investigator will carry out radio astronomical                    observations using VLBI techniques.  There is support of                        continued operation of the North Liberty Radio Observatory                      (NLRO) as part of the U.S. VLBI Network.  The NLRO is 1 of 6                    institutions in the U.S. which are full members of the U.S.                     Network.  The NLRO is an important participant in VLBI                          observations (using  MkII) recording at frequencies of 5 GHz                    and below.  The NLRO was used for more than 1200 hours for 62                   separate experiments during the last 2 years.  The use of NLRO                  for Network VLBI experiments is steadily increasing as the use                  of global fringe fitting and self calibration techniques (which                 work best with a large number of telescopes) become more                        common.  The \"Iowa\" element of the Array should be completed in                 the next 2 years  and will supplant the present telescope.                                                                                                      This award will support Dr. Mutel's VLBI research. Observations                 will be made of structures in the radio source BL Lacertae,                     whose parts seem to be expanding at speeds exceeding the speed                  of light.  Other observations will be made of selected compact                  double radio sources.  A search will be made for a central                      component.  Radio emissions from certain binary stars will be                   observed to look for coherent radio bursts.  Interstellar                       scattering of compact radio sources near the galactic plane                     will be studied.                                                                                                                                                Dr. Mutel is a competent and well-experienced radio astronomer                  and the results of his research will be important to our                        understanding of radio sources.",
