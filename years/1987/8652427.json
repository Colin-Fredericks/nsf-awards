 "awd_abstract_narration": "This statewide urban partnership project will provide two intensive             residential summer workshops followed by two academic year programs for         the mathematical and scientific development of forty elementary and             middle school teachers in Connecticut's five largest urban school               systems - Hartford, New Haven, Bridgeport, Waterbury and Stanford. The          goals are to:                                                                                                                                                   - Enhance the teachers' content knowledge, teaching skills, and                   leadership talents; and                                                                                                                                       - Effect long term improvements in minority student access to                     science and mathematics instruction.                                                                                                                          The targeted urban school districts enroll 61% (approximately 60,000) of        all minority students attending Connecticut's public schools.                                                                                                   For two successive summers (1987 and 1988) the same forty teachers will         attend three and a half week institutes either in mathematics or science        on Wesleyan University's campus. From the perspective of the urban              student, the curriculum, teaching techniques, use of manipulatives, and         use of calculators-computers will be explored. The science institutes           will focus on the basic ideas of earth science, biology, chemistry and          physics. The mathematics institutes will focus on concepts of number,           measurement, estimation, geometry and computers.  During each of the            following two academic years, program staff will hold five one day              workshops at Wesleyan, and conduct five special programs in                     participating school districts.                                                                                                                                 The Project Director will be Robert Rosenbaum, University Professor of          Mathematics at Wesleyan and Director of PIMMS (Project to Increase              Mastery of Mathematics and Science). The Project Team will consist of           Betsy Carter, mathematics consultant for the State Department of                Education; Jorge Pezo, mathematics teacher in Bridgeport; Ralph Yulo of         Eastern Connecticut State University; and Wilma Toney, science teacher          in Hartford. They represent a diverse cultural and ethnic background.           PIMMS, with cooperation of the State Department of Education, will              evaluate attitude and performance of targeted students.                                                                                                         This project has the organization and logistical plans in place to              establish a long term public and private partnership for strengthened           mathematics and science instruction in the urban cities.",
