 "awd_abstract_narration": "Five highly versatile microcomputer-assisted laboratory stations being          used in nine different courses within three academic departments to             modernize undergraduate instruction in physiology.  The instrumentation         includes Apple II GS microcomputers, Apple Imagewriter II printers,             Harvard/SRI stimulators, and six different physiological data                   acquisition systems for each station.  Stations thus equipped collect,          display and print the data from a variety of physiological experiments          including those in spirometry, cardiography, muscle contraction, reflex         function, skin responses, and biofeedback.  The use of these                    microcomputer-aided instruments permits a wide range of laboratory              activities at approximately 60% of the cost of traditional recording            devices.  In addition, relatively inexpensive programs can be added for         simulations and autotutorials dealing with such specific processes as           intermediary metabolism, cardiovascular fitness, nutrition and renal            function.  The completed stations providing the students with a unique          opportunity to further their understanding of the methods of obtaining          experimental data.  It also allows them to develop skills involved in           the analysis and interpretation of such data.  Finally, it exposes them         to wide variety of experiences at a reasonable cost.",
