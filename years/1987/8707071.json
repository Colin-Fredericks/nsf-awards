 "awd_abstract_narration": "Novel interactions between the transposable elements of the Ac-Ds               system in maize will be investigated.  Preliminary studies                      indicate interaction or some form of information transfer between               Ds elements and Ac-w derivatives on homologous chromosomes.  The                presence of the highly methylated wx-m9Ds-cy element on one                     chromosome leads to the paramutation-like inactivation and                      methylation of an Ac-w element at a distant position on the                     homologue.  The Ds elements in wx-m6, wx-m9 and the State I Ds in               standard position on chromosome II 9 do not inactivate but, in                  every heterozygote, cause Ac-w to move along its chromosome and                 be reinserted at the site occupied by the Ds element on the                     homologue.  The small Ds I element in the wx-m1 allele does not                 act in trans and must be on the same chromosome to effect the                   migration of Ac-w.  Molecular evidence indicates that Ac-w is                   reinserted in the wx-m1 gene.  These interactions are limited to                elements on homologous chromosomes.  These studies will be                      extended and the interactions by genetic and molecular analyses                 wil be investigated.                                                                                                                                            While much is known about transposable elements on the molecular                level, this study is the first to suggest that directed                         transposition and site-specific insertion can and does occur.                   The continuation of this project will allow further information                 to be gathered on what could be a potential breakthrough on                     attempts to understand what, if any, function is performed by                   transposable elements in the normal, non-stressed genome of corn.",
