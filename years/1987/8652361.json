 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leadership Activities project will develop teams of science                educators in 20 school districts in central Connecticut which will              provide instructional leadership and inservice activities for teachers          in the districts' elementary and middle schools.  The inservice                 activities will focus on physical science and address those areas in the        science curriculum which are being taught minimally or not at all.  The         teams in each district will consist of three elementary or middle school        teachers, a high school physical science teacher and a science                  coordinator or curriculum specialist.                                                                                                                           The members of the team will prepare for their work in the district in          several meetings during the spring of the year followed by a three-week         workshop in the summer.  College science and science education staff,           industrial scientists, and a computer specialist will work with the             teams as they prepare curriculum modifications and evolve plans for the         inservice activities to be held during the academic year. Both formal           and informal follow-up sessions will be held in the schools during the          academic year with the college staff continuing to serve as a support           for the district teams.  A summer internship program in area scientific         businesses for selected secondary science teachers on the teams is an           auxiliary part of the program.  Science Resource Centers will be                established in the school districts to assist all teachers in the               implementation of the new curriculum units.                                                                                                                     The school districts involved have participated in the planning of the          proposal and have made a commitment to sustain the program once NSF             funding ceases.",
