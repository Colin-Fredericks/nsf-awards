 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Dr. Price to establish a laboratory of                       archaeological chemistry at the Madison campus of the University                of Wisconsin. Central to this facility is the purchase of a Model               3520 Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrometer System manufactured                by Applied Research Laboratories Inc. This, together with a mass                spectrometer already present in the department of geology and                   geophysics will allow the analyses of the elemental and isotopic                composition of archaeological materials such as bone, ceramics                  and soil. These analyses will provide information on past human                 diet, economy and behavior.                                                                                                                                     The proposed research will be conducted in collaboration with a                 number of investigators and will pursue a number of goals. These                include studies of: maize utilization in prehistoric eastern                    North America; diagenetic changes in bone composition; stature,                 status and diet in the European iron age; woodland ceramics in                  Wisconsin; neolithic ceramics in Denmark; soils from prehistoric                houses in Wisconsin; and effects of the transition to                           agriculture.                                                                                                                                                    Through the use of archaeometric (chemical and physical)                        techniques archaeologists have increased enormously the amount of               information which can be gleaned from objects such as human bone                and potsherds. For example, through the chemical analysis of                    pottery it is possible to match clay source with finished pot and               to reconstuct prehistoric trade networks. Since diet is partially               reflected in bone, it is possible to analyze human skeletons to                 determine the importance of different kinds of foods. This helps                archaeologists to reconstruct patterns of human subsistence. No                 laboratories in the United States are dedicated to answering such               problems and therefore the establishment of a facility at the                   University of Wisconsin will prove of great benefit to the                      discipline.",
