 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tissue-Specific and Developmental Expression of Lectin Genes               in Cereals and Rice:  Molecular genetics and immuno cytochemical                approaches will be used to study processes that control tissue-                 specific gene expression of lectin synthesis.  The approach will                consist of the following stages; a) characterization of genomic                 sequences of wheat germ agglutinin and rice lectins; b) analysis                and mutagenesis of promoter sequences of these genes, c)                        transformation experiments to examine how specific gene                         constructs are expressed.                                                                                                                                            The differential localization of lectins among different                   cells of closely related species of crop grasses provides a model               system for studying cell-and tissue-specific expression of                      closely related proteins.  It provides a unique opportunity to                  answer questions important to the genetic engineering of plants                 e.g.  How will wheat germ agglutinin genes be expressed when                    introduced into rice?  Will the pattern be similar to that found                in wheat or in rice?  What are the gene sequences responsible for               determining the pattern of expression of similar proteins in                    different tissues?  Finally the potential creation of lectin-                   deficient plants could possibly answer the perplexing riddle of                 lectin function in organisms.",
