 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will study the probability questions related                 to the sample re-use procedure called the bootstraping.  The                    investigator has already proved a number of results in this area.               Now he proposes to extend the results to the cases when the                     variance is infinite.  It will also investigate the behavior of                 the bootstrap distribution of the mean when a smoothed and                      trimmed version of the empirical cummulative distribution                       function is used for resampling.                                                     For the second part of the research, critical simple                       branching processes are studied.  The investigator will find the                limiting behavior of the mean of the maximum up to the n-th                     generation when the variance in the branching process is                        infinite.                                                                            The investigator, who has been the originator of the idea of               almost regenerative processes, will continue his study of the                   same.",
