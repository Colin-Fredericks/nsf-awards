 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is aimed at the ultimate development of a high               accuracy, miniature probe capable of inspecting manufactured parts with         complex geometries.  A novel laser based, non-contact inspection                technique will be employed and the device is called a non-contact pencil        probe because of its planned shape and size.  The optical system is             divided into two subsystems; these are illumination and viewing                 subsystems.  A triangulation method will be used.  Conventional optical         components are not well suited for the pencil probe because of their            large relative size.  Radically different optical techniques are                required to reach the proposed goals.  The use of graded index (GRIN)           lenses is planned.  The GRIN lenses behave optically like conventional          lenses but have constant thickness with varied index of refraction              instead of the conventional constant index of refraction with varied            thickness.  GRIN lenses can be obtained in small diameter sizes.  The           illumination and viewing optics of the proposed device will consist of          long narrow GRIN rod lenses.  A laser diode will be used as the                 illumination source and a detector array or a lateral effect photodiode         as the detector.  The Phase I research plan is to design and build a            prototype device and                                                            experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of the non-contact pencil            probe.  A Phase II is planned which will modify and optimize the pencil         probe to meet the largest number of inspection needs.  If this research         is successful, Phase III will obtain funding to commercialize this              device.                                                                              The pencil probe should increase inspection capabilities and lead          to improved quality.  Application would be to inspection of complex             geometries, such as profiling turbine blades, detailing piston ring             grooves, viewing parts hidden from external view, and looking at threads        within a hole.",
