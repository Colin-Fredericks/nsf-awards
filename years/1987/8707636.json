 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to study the use of a magnetically stabilized                   fluidized bed (MSFB) to alleviate problems associated with the                  separation and purification of biochemicals obtained from                       fermentation broths and similar feed streams.  To develop this                  continuous separation process, the PI plans to focus on two major               objectives:                                                                                                                                                          -    To gain an understanding of the behavior of a mixture                           of magnetic and nonmagnetic support materials in a                              liquid fluidized bed under an applied magnetic field.                                                                                                      -    To develop a new mode of using these liquid MSFBs as a                          counter-current contractor for protein purification.                                                                                                  By using two materials in a MSFB, one can possibly eliminate the                need to develop a new magnetic support material for each new                    biochemical separation to be performed.                                                                                                                         This proposal was considered by the Review Panel to be highly                   innovative and recommended funding for one year in accordance                   with the first year budget submitted with the proposal.  The PI                 is considered to be well qualified to carry out the proposed                    research and I recommend funding in accordance with the Panel                   recommendation.",
