 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurate reference pole information from stable cratonic areas are              critical in paleomagnetic interpretations of rotation and translation.          The fact that the Colorado Plateau has rotated with respect to the North        American craton affects the reliability of one-third of the paleopoles          used to define the apparent polar wander curve.  The amount of rotation         is not well defined, and recently acquired evidence suggests that two           rotations, rather than one, occurred; both of these factors limit the           accuracy with which the Colorado Plateau paleopoles can be corrected to         be representative of North America.  Omission of these one third of             North American paleopoles leaves uncertainties and gaps in the apparent         polar wander curve.  This project will sample three formations from             which important poles can be acquired with relative ease and minimal            uncertainty.  These are the Early Permian Cutler Formation of the               Colorado Palateau and the Late Jurassic Morrison and Middle Triassic            Santa Rosa Formations of the craton.  Acquisition of these poles                addresses the amount and number of rotations of the plateau and the lack        of data from certain time periods.",
