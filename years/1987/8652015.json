 "awd_abstract_narration": "How to effectively teach computer programming is a national problem             facing many schools today.  Considerable progress has been made in              recent years in developing integrated programming environments that             combine under a single uniform user interface the functionality of              traditionally separate tools for the editing, translation, testing and          execution of high level code.  Both the integrated nature of such               environments and their \"knowledge\" of high level language rules relieve         students from needless attention to what fundamentally are extraneous           details.  Hence the students are freed to concentrate on the essentials         of problem decomposition and program structure and better understand the        fundamentals of programming.                                                                                                                                    Previous work has produced the necessary mechanisms for several key             features of a state-of-the-art structure editing environment.  The              current aim of this project is to develop a powerful, integrated system         that will significantly improve the quality of computer science                 instruction and make it widely available at minimal cost.  The system           will include the innovative use of flexible program visualizations to           aid the programmer in mapping visual representation to code.  It will           include an Intelligent Computer-Assisted-Instruction (ICAI) system              capable of individualized tutoring on high level aspects of procedural          and data abstraction.  An integral part of this project will be the             systematic evaluation of the system in a variety of middle school and           high school settings.",
