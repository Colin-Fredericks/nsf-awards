 "awd_abstract_narration": "Programming supercomputers is currently difficult and time              consuming.  Scientists and engineers who use these machines have                an urgent need for a programming environment that is portable,                  interactive, flexible, and convenient.  There is a prototype that               serves as an existence proof for the feasibility of constructing                a useful environment for scientific computing.  This software                   tool, called CLAMth (the Computatinal Linear Algebra Machine),                  currently exists as a prototype version written in Fortran 77.                  Although CLAM is successful, we view it as a \"first generation\"                 programming environment for supercomputers.  Using a modern                     programming language (T), we propose to build a \"second                         generation\" environment that will:                                                      oAccept the programmer's preferred language, be it T, CLAM,             or Fortran.                                                                             oHave an interpretive debugger that will promote fast                   prototyping.                                                                            oBe fully portable from workstation to mainframe to                     supercomputer.                                                                          oUtilize state-of-the-art algorithms for large scale                    numerical analysis tasks.  It will handle vector and matrix data                structures automatically and also contain an \"expert\" capability                to select appropriate algorithms from its own internal library to               match the solution techniques to the problem size and                           characteristics.                                                                        In short, this environment will provide the applications-               oriented engineer or scientists with the fastest possible                       solution for any particular computation, without requiring the                  user to make decisions about the appropriate algorithms and data                structures to be employed.                                                      ----------------------------------------------------------------                        This proposal focuses on the development of programming                 tools for scientists and engineers.  Specifically the proposal                  refines the programming language associated with CLAM, a                        previously developed software package, for improved programming                 environments.  This new version of CLAM will have several                       improvements such a portability, automatic parallelization, etc.                and can be easily incorporated into code generated by other                     languages.   Thus 36 month proposal will be funded all at one                   time as follows:                                                                        $150.0k CSE (CISE)                                                              $ 50.0k Comp.
