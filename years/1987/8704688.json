 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is aimed at understanding the failure of                      ceramic materials as a result of applied mechanical loads over a                wide range of ambient temperature.  Failure in the low to                       moderate temperature range is typically the result of slow crack                growth where mechanical creep alters the driving forces for the                 crack growth.  Failure in the intermediate temperature region                   results from slow crack growth, but the major effect of the                     mechanical creep is to alter the microstructure of the material                 in the vicinity of the crack tip.  The high temperature range is                characterized by failure which is dominated by mechanical creep,                e.g., creep-induced microcrack nucleation, coalescence, and                     finally rupture.  Digital Image Correlation will be used to map                 the creep deformations in crack tip regions, and to identify                    possible inhomogeneities in the overall deformation and damage.                                                                                                      The research will build upon the advances made during the                  last three years of support by the National Science Foundation                  under grant number DMR-8311699.  The results will be used to                    develop models which predict reliability and lifetime for                       ceramics in high temperature applications.",
