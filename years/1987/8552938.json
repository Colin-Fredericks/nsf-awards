 "awd_abstract_narration": "The P.I. is involved with a wide range of problems fundamental to the           developing understanding of the nature of computation.  He is extending         the range of application of the algebraic methods and the randomization         procedures he and his coauthors have developed for obtaining efficient          algorithms.  Two examples of algorithms sought are:  (1) a                      deterministic parallel algorithm for the maximum matching problem, and          (2) a randomized algorithm for approximating the permanent of a matrix.         He is also continuing his investigation of the complexity of                    computational problems that have received previous attention.  Two              examples of such problems are:  (1) determining whether a directed              graph has an even length cycle, and   (2) the shortest vector problem.          The use of randomized reducibilities is being explored as a tool for            dealing with this second problem.                                                                                                                               The P.I. has been judged to be an outstanding computer scientist by the         Presidential Young Investigator Panel.",
