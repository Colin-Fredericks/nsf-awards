 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research involves studies on the development and              structure of leaves of selected C3 and C4 plants, utilizing                     bright.field, phase and electron microscopy.  The developmental and             structural studies are complemented by experimental studies aimed at            determining: 1) the pathways followed by photoassimilates in immature           (sink) and mature (source) leaves; 2) the sites of phloem unloading in          sink leaves and of phloem loading in source leaves; and 3) the pathways         followed by water and solutes entering the leaf apoplast in the                 transpiration stream in leaves at different stages of development.  The         experimental studies include:  plasmolytic studies aimed at determining         the solute concentrations of various cells of the leaf;                         microautoradiographic studies aimed at determining pathways followed by         .1.4C.sucrose and .1.4C.assimi lates in leaves; ATPase localization             studies aimed at determining the sites of active phloem unloading or            loading; free.space marker studies aimed at determining the pathways            followed by water and solutes entering the leaf apoplast in the                 transpiration stream; and whole leaf autoradiographic studies aimed at          following patterns of sink.to.source conversion and water movement in           developing leaves.                                                                   These studies will provide a greater understanding of the                  structural changes of leaf development related to sink.to.source                transition in leaves, and of the way in which substances manufactured in        the leaf are loaded into the food conducting cells of the leaf veins for        export from the plant.",
