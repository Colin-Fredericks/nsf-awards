 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this project is to increase basic                  understanding of several important mesoscale features of the lower              troposphere of western North America that are produced by the complex           terrain of the region.  The greater emphasis will be given to                   low-level phenomena that are trapped by the coastal topography such             as the coastal southerlies and along shore surges that are observed             within a few hundred kilometers of the coast from Baja, California to           British Columbia. Closely connected with the coastal southerly                  currents re mesoscale coastal eddies, such as those observed off                California (e.g. the Catalina eddy). A second project will be to                examine the diurnal and semi diurnal surface pressure variations over           the United States both to create a valuable diagnostic tool and to              better understand the mesoscale variations and physical mechanisms of           diurnal pressure change. The final component of the proposed research           will be the examination of the mesoscale troughing. Such troughing is           associated with the Puget Sound convergence zone and contributed to             the destruction of the Hood Canal Bridge in 1979.",
