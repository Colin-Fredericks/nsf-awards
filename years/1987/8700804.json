 "awd_abstract_narration": "An accretionary prism is formed in an island arc by the                 accumulation of sediments scraped off from the downgoing plate                  where two plates converge.  Structurally, such prisms are very                  complex and their evolution is not fully understood.  In a                      previously NSF funded research project, Dr. Ladd and his                        coworkers successfully surveyed and imaged the Barbados                         accretionary wedge by using modern and sophisticated seismic                    methods utilizing two ships.                                                            In this award, Dr. Ladd and his colleagues will continue                seismic interpretation of this excellent data set and will                      perform detailed analysis to obtain more information about                      seismic velocities in the accretionary prism.                                           The seismic velocities will provide information on density              and porosity of the prism which, in turn, will reveal lithologies               of the sediments composing the prism and the direction of the                   fluid flow within the accreted prism.  These are some of the                    fundamental questions in the evolution of an accretionary prism                 and answering these questions will help us in understanding the                 plate tectonic processes.  The project will be supported at                     $100,018 for 12 months in FY87.",
