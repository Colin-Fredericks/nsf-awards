 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives and Relevance to Program Objectives:  This recommended award         would allow Dr. Roy B. Torbert, University of Alabama in Huntsville, to         collaborate with Dr. Gerhard Haerendel, Max Planck Institute for Physics        and Astrophysics, Munich, Federal Republic of Germany.  They will               attempt to resolve some of the problems in interpreting the experimental        results on the critical velocity effect in space plasmas.  These two            researchers have produced conflicting results and they propose to make          definitive tests of the problems by working together.  The resolution of        the issues they define should lead to a better understanding of the             physics of plasma-neutral gas interactions and their applications to            solar system astrophysics and neutral beam interactions.  Each of the           researchers proposes new diagnostic instruments for electric field and          current measurements that should benefit the experiments.  They wish to         explore possibilities for cooperation in developing the equipment and           for doing future studies.  The project thus contributes to an important         objective of NSF's cooperative science programs with Western Europe,            which is to stimulate scientific progress by bringing together                  scientists from the U.S. and Europe who have similar research interests         and who wish to engage in mutually beneficial research cooperation.             Funds from this award would support salary, necessary transportation,           and partial subsistence expenses for the U.S. principal investigator, as        well as other minor costs directly related to the collaboration.                                                                                                Merit of Proposal:  The prospect is very good for a significant                 contribution to scientific knowledge from this proposed research.  The          U.S. principal investigator is a highly respected, productive scientist.        The foreign researcher with whom he will cooperate in the project is            also an internationally known expert in this field.  The work plan has          been carefully prepared and the budget is reasonable.  The cooperating          scientists will have the opportunity to make significant advances in            their research efforts by sharing specialized knowledge and insights            gained previously from their separate, individual studies.  Both                researchers will contribute to the project and will benefit                     significantly from the cooperation.  The Max-Planck-Gesellschaft is             providing German counterpart support for the project.                                                                                                           Funding:  This award will not duplicate other funding.  The principal           investigator receives support for the domestic aspects of this research         from NASA.  The Solar Terrestrial Program of NSF will fund $14,300 of           this award from its 1988 budget.  That amount and $5,950 from                   International Programs in FY 1988 will supplement the last 24 months of         this award.",
