 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research to be continued will include continued effort              on measuring the fine structure splitting of triplet helium, as                 well as Stark and Rydberg spectroscopy of helium excited states.                The second major part of the work involves further study of the                 Stark effect in alkalis including experiments and calculations on               radiative decay, electric field calibration, and the use of                     laser-slowed beams to enhance measurements on long-lived states.                The third area of proposed work is in laser development,                        particularly diode lasers and LNA or YAP for the helium                         metastable line.  The fourth part is continued theory and                       experimental work on the effects of spectrally broadened light on               atomic coherence, particularly the Hanle effect.  The fifth part                is an extension of previous work in other laboratories of laser                 deceleration.  Slow and cold atoms will be used as a tool for                   further research in atomic physics.  The last major component of                the research is the study of traps for neutral atoms, including                 both magnetic and optical.                                                              This award will include the consequential involvement of one            or more promising undergraduates in a leading research group.                   The assignment of meaningful tasks to these students, and their                 participation in an active research environment will aid greatly                in their career development.",
