 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a very interesting and important research project in the study          of the U.S. labor market.  It addresses several questions about the             way workers perceive the number of hours they would like to work                versus the amount of time they actually spend at work.  Intuitively             one might think that for a given wage, most people would prefer more            leisure time than they have.  However, past empirical work by                   Professor Kahn and Professor Lang has provided strong evidence that             just the opposite is true.  Using questions from the Panel Study of             Income Dynamics they estimate that almost 75% of the people                     interviewed have constraints on the amount of time they spend at work.                                                                                          One half of those workers would prefer to work a different number of            hours than they actually work, and surprisingly, nearly 90% of them             would spend more time at work if they were able.  The project is                important in that such a result provides strong indications of                  significant hours of work constraints and underemployment in the U.S.           This project examines the constraints inherent in the labor market              which keep people from making the tradeoff between leisure time and             work time which they perceive to be best for them.                                                                                                              Specifically Professor Kahn and Professor Lang examine two analytical           models of labor force participation.  Both models incorporate                   contracts which are implicitly understood between firms and workers,            and both can be tested by seeing how hours constraints vary with                worker tenure.  Cross sectional data from the Panel Study of Income             Dynamics include questions that allow researchers to ascertain whether          for a particular worker that person had more work available, wanted to          work more, or wanted to work less.  A series of studies have shown a            correlation between job tenure and the constraints on hours of work.            Low tenure jobs typically have a constraint wherein workers spend more          time at work than they wish, while in high tenure jobs people are               constrained from working as much as they would like.  This project              also tests the correspondence between job tenure and time at work, as           well as the relationship between hours of work and union                        participation.  Professor Kahn and Professor Lang verify their results          by comparing them with similar studies using different data sets, and           by conducting their own in-depth survey of the respondents in the               Panel Study of Income Dynamics.",
