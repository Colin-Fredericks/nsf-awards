 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics faculty members at Southwest Misssouri State University             (SMSU) will conduct a four week summer workshop in the teaching of              problem solving, as applied to most scientific disciplines, for 30              junior high school teachers from southwest Missouri.  Four key                  personnel, called \"helping teachers,\" selected during the workshop, will        receive additional leadership development and be actively involved in           the further planning and implementation of this project.  All                   participants will assist fellow teachers, to implement strategies in            problem solving throughout their curricula during the academic year.                                                                                            Participants will construct lessons and teaching aids which demonstrate         application problems in the fields of physics, astronomy, computer              science, chemistry, biology, and/or geoscience.  After implementing the         problem solving materials developed in the workshop and evaluating them,        a monograph of the activities considered effective will be produced and         distributed to each middle and junior high school principal in the 24           county service area of Southwest Missouri State University.                                                                                                     This project will become self-sufficient in 1988 when SMSU                      institutionalizes a course based on the workshop which will be made             available and attractive to teachers under the State reimbursement law.         The monograph and teacher developed materials will be available at the          Problem Solving Materials Center at the University.  A network of               \"helping teachers\" and former participants will work together to conduct        in-service workshops for fellow teachers.                                                                                                                       \"Strategies for Problem Solving\" clearly and comprehensively addresses          the dire need for more creative and innovative strategies for                   mathematical problem solving.  It acknowledges and seeks to address             science and mathematics instruction in rural, minority and economically         disadvantaged school districts.",
