 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is centered around 2 three-week summer workshops for 30            participants each selected from among physics teachers in the                   uppermidwest.  The workshops will stress use of PRISMS--Physics                 Resources and Instructional Strategies for Motivating Students.  This           teacher's guide has been developed and field tested by the Iowa Physics         Task Force.  Conference telephone calls and videotaped lessons will be          part of follow-up activities.                                                                                                                                   Each of the 2 three-week sessions will include instruction in mechanics,        thermodynamics, optics, electricity and magnetism, and atomic and               nuclear physics.  Participants will also study and apply learning models        and integrate the PRISMS learning cycles with the texts that they use in        their classrooms.                                                                                                                                               During the academic year following the summer's activities, participants        will be linked in small groups via telephone conference calls.  In              addition, each participating teacher will be required to supply one             videotaped classroom lesson during each 12-week period.  These will be          evaluated by project staff.                                                                                                                                     Requirements for selection include an assignment to teach physics in            1987-88, less than 18 semester hours of credit in physics, and a                commitment to use PRISMS materials in their teaching.  Statements of            support from the school administrator must accompany the application.           This includes the availability of certain video and telephone equipment.        Participants will be housed at the University of Northern Iowa, the             location of instruction, and their expenses will be borne by the grant.         Each will receive a stipend of $200 per month.  Three semester hours of         graduate credit will be awarded for the summer workshop and another hour        of credit will be awarded on completion of the academic year outreach           activities.                                                                                                                                                     The primary administrative and instructional responsibility for the             program will be lodged with Professor Unruh of the UNI physics                  department and Professor Cooney of the education department.  Content           lectures will also be given to seven physicists from the host                   institution.  Six master teachers have been identified, and two will be         in residence at all times during the summer workshops.  In addition,            they will assist in the evaluation of the videotaped lessons produced by        participants during the academic year.                                                                                                                          This is a promising project which builds on demonstrated effectiveness.",
