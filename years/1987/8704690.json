 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues a line of research in the area of general                equilibrium macroeconomics.  The investigator has already offered a             number of interesting solutions to various puzzles in the                       macroeconomics-labor area, and has developed techniques that greatly            enhance the usefulness of representative agent models.  This continued          research has two main goals.  The first is to extend the analysis of            the labor market models with nonconvexities, and the second is to study         models of the labor market which explicitly allow for heterogeneity .           With regard to the first goal, the extensions include a comparison of           different types of nonconvexities, decentralization of optimal resource         allocations with particular attention paid to involuntary unemployment,         incorporation of labor market flows, and a careful analysis of the              dynamics relationships implied by nonconvexities.  With respect to the          second goal, the emphasis will be on introducing heterogeneity into             aggregate models of the labor market.  The forms of heterogeneity               considered are skilled and unskilled labor, married males and married           females, and adults and youths.  The aim is to study models which will          account for the large differences in cyclical employment fluctuations           experienced by these groups.  The analysis will focus on to what                extent different specifications of technology and preferences can               produce the observed phenomena.",
