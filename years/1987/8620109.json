 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds for continued support of                   investigations into the magnetic and electrical properties of                   uncompensated magnetic garnet films.  It has been observed that                 thin films of the magnetic garnets, of which the prototype is                   yttrium iron garnet can be grown in which the divalent calcium                  ion will substitute for the trivalent yttrium ion forming a                     charge uncompensated material.  Preliminary measurements show                   encouraging potential for the development of new magnetic                       semiconductor materials.  In particular, at low temperatures a                  photo-electrical effect has been observed that enhances the                     conductivity by six orders of magnitude and a photomemory effect                is also observed.  The magnetic properties are also unusual in                  that a strong decrease of the magnetic moment is observed at                    temperatures below 150 K.  At this same temperature the                         ferrromagnetic resonance indicates a significant increase in the                internal fields of the materials.  A model has been proposed in                 which the population of the quadruvalent iron ion varies                        exponentially with temperature having a characteristic energy of                150 K.                                                                                                                                                                  The second area involves an investigation into the magneto-             optical properties of bismuth-thullium: yttrium iron garnet.  The               thullium ion with it's large angular orbital momentum produces a                significant shift from the g=2 resonance condition normally                     observed in the yttrium iron garnet like materials.  It is                      proposed that trivalent iron ion might be an excellent probe to                 further investigate the role of the angular momentum of the                     higher order states of iron to investigate the origin of the                    Faraday rotation observed in bismuth magnetic garnets.",
