The Colloquy brings together, every two years at various international          locations, specialists involved in locating, cataloging, and                    disseminating data and information on all topics of interest to                 northern Nations and users, with particular emphasis on the Arctic.             This Colloquy has as its theme \"International Networking of Northern            Information\".  Most northern countries are developing approaches to             data and information retrieval, storage, and dissemination.  This               meeting, through a carefully structured program, will result in an              analysis of the international potentials, problems, and solutions for           international networking of this diverse body of ever increasing data           and information.  Sessions on non-bibliographic data banks, end users,          archiving, and policy issues are among topics to be addressed.  A               formal proceedings volume will be produced and be available widely.                                                                                             The Colloquy comes at an extremely advantageous time, as it will                address man;y of the data and information requirements contained in             the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984.  Both the U.S. Arctic               Research Commission and the Interagency Arctic Research Policy                  Committee are addressing these needs and the results of this Colloquy           will provide invaluable insight and information required to fulfill             the intent of the Act.",
