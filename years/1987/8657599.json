 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigator was nominated for a Presidential Young                   Investigator award.  His research involves a new theory of hybrid               control for robotics, which will be tested for effectiveness in                 assembly and other manufacturing processes.  The basic  theory will             also be extended to the robust control of robots near singularity               configurations, and the active control of multiple robots in                    contact.  Further theoretical work will also be done on path                    planning for obstacle avoidance, extensions of screw theory and the             application of Clifford algebras to problems in robotics.  The                  program of research will integrate experimental and analytical work.            The PI is interested in working closely with industry on important              problems which have the potential for making a significantly                    contribution towards increasing manufacturing productivity.  In the             first year, this award will be supplemented for support of two                  undergraduate students who will participate in the research.  Their             role will involve the design of six-degree-of-freedom joysticks for             robot control.",
