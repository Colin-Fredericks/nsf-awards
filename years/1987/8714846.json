 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives and Relevancy: This action provides support for participation        of U.S. scientists in the third U.S.-Pakistan Binational Workshop on            Advances in Natural Products Chemistry.  The Pakistani organizer of the         workshop is Dr. Atta-Ur-Rahman, codirector of the HEJ Postgraduate              Institute of Chemistry at the University of Karachi. The meeting will           build on the accomplishments of the previous workshops held in 1984 and         1986, including the significant interaction between scientists of the           two countries, and the internationally published proceedings. Specific          topics to be discussed include physiologically active compounds from            Pakistani natural sources and traditional medicinal preparations, new           methods of isolation and separation of secondary metabolites and their          natural functional role in pakistani plants,  advances in the                   methodology of structure determination, and synthons for new medicinal          agents from Pakistani natural products.  The U.S.-Pakistan program              supports workshops between scientists of the two countries in areas             where there is active research in both countries and when collaboration         can be enhanced.  The project meets these criteria.                                                                                                             Merit: The U.S. P.I. is a well regarded scientist in his field, and the         Pakistani organizer of the workshop is internationally known and                respected for his extensive research accomplishments.  The meeting is           likely to bring together the best of Pakistan's scientists in natural           product chemistry and many active scientists from the U.S., as well as          some experts from Europe.  It is expected that the proceedings will be          published worldwide and contribute to the dissemination of new knowledge        in this field.                                                                                                                                                  Funding: In addition to this action, the workshop is expected to receive        financial support from the Governments of Pakistan and of the Federal           Republic of Germany.",
