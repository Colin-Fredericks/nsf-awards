 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to demonstrate that standard           vapor phase epitaxial growth techniques can be extended into                    time/temperature regimes to allow fabrication of sub 100 A layers with          abrupt and/or quasi abrupt interfaces, with fewer defects and at much           lower cost than with MBE.  The material to be used for this study will          be silicon, due to the high growth rates of silicon VPE, the difficulty         of silicon MBE, and the lack of any alternate growth technique.  Wafers         will be heated rapidly while in a gas flow using DC arc and flash lamps.        Cooling will be done using direct contact with a \"cool\" plate.  Two             growth chemistries will be explored:  pyrolysis of silane which can be          done at temperatures close to 800 C for very abrupt junction formation,         and reduction of chlorosilanes for the highest quality material and             potentially, completely selective growth.  Films will be characterized          chemically, electrically, and microscopically.  As final proof of               material quality transistors will be fabricated and characterized with          attention being paid to a ballistic bipolar device.",
