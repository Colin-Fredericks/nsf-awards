 "awd_abstract_narration": "Railroad cars are large, heavy structures which are generally                   designed  with very large safety factors.  It is difficult, using               classical  analysis techniques, to obtain accurate estimates of                 the loads  experienced by the car and of the stress levels and                  fatigue life of the  various components of the car. However, it                 is now possible to overcome  these difficulties with the use of                 modern computer-aided engineering  techniques such as finite                    element analysis and rigid body-based vehicle  dynamic response                 analysis.  If the loads and stress levels are more  accurately                  known, it would be possible to design railroad cars with  lower                 safety factors.  This would result in lighter weight cars which                 are more economical to build and operate.  This research                        addresses the issues of (1) obtaining the loads on the railcar                  body from the dynamic response of the vehicle assembly to the                   random irregularities in the track, (2) developing finite element               analysis techniques to accurately model and analyze the railroad                car, incorporating the dynamic loads on the car, and (3)                        developing methods to utilize the results of the finite element                 analysis to more accurately estimate the fatigue life of the                    railroad car.",
