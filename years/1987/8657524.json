 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI describes his work under the Presidential Young                  Investigators award as follows:  In formulating electromagnetic                 scattering problems, one is often forced to choose between tow                  conflicting requirements: rigorous analysis vs. realistic modelling.  In        the past, much emphasis has been placed on the rigorous analysis at the         expense of realistic modelling.  More recently, several classes of              problems have arisen in which the effect of the geometry on the                 scattering characteristics is of prime importance.  Two such problems           will be addressed in this study: (1) Radar cross section analysis of            partially open cavities.  Minimizing radar returns from jet engine              intakes is one of the major challenges in stealth technology.  A novel          ray launching technique will be applied to analyze the effect of shaping        or coating the intake interior.  (2) Characterization of microstrip             discontinuities.  Accurate electromagnetic characterization of                  microstrip transmission structures is essential in the design of                monolithic microwave integrated circuits.  A time-domain finite-                difference approach will be applied to various discontinuities in order         to extract scattering parameters/circuit models crucial to the                  development of CAD tools.                                                               This PYI award will study theoretical modelling problems in             electromagnetic scattering.  The emphasis will be on realistic modelling        approaches in which the geometry of the scatterer is of prime                   importance. Areas of emphasis will be on analysis of (1) radar cross            sections for partially open cavities such as in jet engine intakes, and         (2) characterizations of microstrip discontinuities which are of                importance in developing computer aided design tools for monolithic             microwave integrated circuits.",
