 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project intends to investigate uses of computers in mathematics            classrooms and to develop research capabilities of teachers for the             purpose of improving their leadership skills. There are four goals to           the proposed project:                                                           1. To implement in algebra and geometry classrooms computer software by         introducing teachers to research methods and developing instructional           stategies for the transition of the software to traditional curricular          materials and methods;                                                          2. To conduct formative evaluation research and empower teachers as             leaders to investigate the  effectiveness of the software                       implementation;                                                                 3. To develop peer training activities that enable the teachers as              researchers to share their findings and instructional methods with their        peers;                                                                          4. To disseminate the results of the research.                                          The plan consists of having four faculty members from North             Carolina State University work collaboratively with high school                 mathematics teachers who have been identified locally as expert                 teachers. The team meets for two weeks during the summer for initial            investigations and this is followed by monthly meetings throughout the          year. The work at first is to focus on the potentials that the tool             software offers to the existing curriculum. Seven of the lead teachers          were involved in an initial pilot study and they have experience with           the software. They will serve as resource teachers for the other                teachers in the study, for a total of 27 initial participants. The team         will develop materials to provide the interface between the computer            software and the traditional textual materials and then share the               results of the project activities with other teachers in their                  districts. The research methods will be used to evaluate the results as         well as to analyze learning styles in light of the infusion of                  technology.",
