The Board is the principal vehicle of the National Research                     Council for addressing issues specific to biochemistry,                         chemistry, chemical engineering and related disciplines.                        Chaired by Drs. George M. Whitesides and Leo J. Thomas, with 22                 members broadly knowledgeable in chemistry, chemical                            engineering, related sciences, and the administration of                        research in academic, industrial, and government laboratories,                  the BCST has organized and provided oversight to a number of                    important study committees.  These activities produce reports                   of considerable importance to the Foundation and may be made                    available to the public without restrictions.",
