 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Klein is the leader of a strong group of                         mathematical physicists at University of California at Irvine.                  His recent work has been in the study of disordered systems.                    This is the study of properties of materials in the presence of                 impurities.  For example, the motion of electrons in a crystal                  with impurities is described quantum mechanically by a random                   potential.  The most striking and exceedingly important                         development with wide technological implications, is the                        remarkable change in conductivity of the material due to                        impurities.  The science of composite materials, especially                     semiconductors, is undergoing a major evolution in this regard.                 The mathematical study of disordered systems, from many                         perspectives, is especially important, as instabilities often                   interfere with the natural physical intuition.  In this proposal,               Professor Klein will continue his productive study of random                    Schrodinger operators and spin glasses, with particular emphasis                on the weak disorder limit and the properties of the density of                 states for random Schrodinger operators.",
