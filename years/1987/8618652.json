 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economic considerations pervade decisions to sue, to go to court,          or to settle.  The monetary and nonmonetary costs, offset by estimates          of the magnitude and probability of gain, may be expected to shape the          contours of litigation and decisions to litigate.  Dr. Rubinfeld seeks          to examine the influence of economic factors through theoretical and            empirical study.  First, given extant research, writing, and conjecture         on these issues, he plans to undertake a critical and synthetic                 assessment of the literature on the economics of litigation, (a)                focusing on the uses and misuses of economic tools and ideas and (b)            developing an agenda for future inquiry.  Second, he plans a series of          theoretical efforts aimed at (a) incorporating settlements and                  litigation into the current theory of optimal public enforcement and (b)        exploring the benefits of trial rather than settlement.  Third, using a         data set of antitrust cases filed in six Federal District Courts over a         thirteen-year period (supplemented by survey data of attorneys and              participants), he plans rigorous econometric analysis of the economic           underpinnings of the litigation process.  In this empirical work, Dr.           Rubinfeld will focus on the estimation of a set of settlement and trial         outcome equations incorporating such issues as selection bias (in the           kinds of cases that go to trial), the influence of reputational factors         associated with the defendant and plaintiff, and the effect of                  perceptions prior to trial on trial outcome.  Bringing substantial              theoretical and econometric expertise, Dr. Rubinfeld is especially well         situated to add to the scientific discourse regarding litigation and            when, why, and how it is used.",
