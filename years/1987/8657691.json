 "awd_abstract_narration": "A longstanding aim of radiologic research has been the development of           accurate noninvasive angiographic techniques.  Nuclear magnetic resonance       imaging (MRI) is sensitive to flowing protons and may achieve this goal.        The research project plans to assess the capabilities of new,                   commercially available magnetic resonance imagers to detect simple and          complex flow fields.  It is planned to construct a general, MRI-                compatible flow phantom system capable of creating steady and pulsatile         flow in models of the cardiovascular system such as straight and curved         tubes with stenoses, the aorta, and the pulmonary artery.  The specific         goals of this study are to:  a. develop a general flow system capable of        accommodating a range of simple and complex models (phantoms) which is          compatible with the high magnetic fields utilized in MRI, b.  test flows        through established models of the cardiovascular system by MRI and              laboratory flow visualization using hydrogen bubbles and dye injection,         and c.  correlate the MRI images with the fluid mechanic physics to             define the limits and capabilities of existing MRI techniques.  The             results of this study should allow new MRI pulse sequences to be                developed to improve the accuracy and range of flow measurements by MRI         and further the development of non-invasive arteriography.",
