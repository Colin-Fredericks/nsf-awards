 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Kenneth W. Cummins and Dr.           Margaret A. Wilzbach, University of Maryland Center for Environmental           and Estuarine Studies, to pursue with Dr. Lauren Yameogo, Head                  Hydrobiologist, Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP) in the Volta             River Basin Area (a World Health Organization project), Guinea, for a           period of 12 months, a program of cooperative research on the                   functional analysis of invertebrate communities in streams and rivers           of the West African OCP area.  These scientists will develop sensitive          techniques which will allow for continuing evaluation of the                    environmental status of the running waters of the area.  Their                  functional analysis of invertebrates will be used as an indication of           ecological conditions of streams and rivers, especially those in areas          not yet under pesticide treatment.  Invertebrates will be categorized           according to mechanisms they use in acquiring food.                                                                                                             It is of great interest to researchers concerned with comparative               stream ecosystem studies that systems in other regions, such as                 Sub-Saharan Africa, be investigated using tools and insights gained             from other work in North America and Europe.  The data collected in             this project should be of great value to such researchers.  The                 collaborators are highly respected scientists with a record of                  successful research in the region to be studied.  Dr. Cummins has               served as member and chairman of the Ecological Group, a special                advisory panel for OCP, and Dr. Wilzbach has served as expert observer          for the Ecological Group, in Mali.  Dr. Yameogo is recognized as an             expert on the identification and ecology of stream and river                    invertebrates in West Africa.  This project is relevant to the                  objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program which seeks           to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. scientists and                engineers and their counterparts in developing countries through the            exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and           through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.",
