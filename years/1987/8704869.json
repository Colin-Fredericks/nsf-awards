This research equipment grant will provide two 110-kip servo-controlled         electro-hydraulic actuators to meet the current and pending research            needs in the structural engineering laboratory of the University of             Colorado, which is currently engaged in several  NSF-supported research         projects on the experimental investigation of the seismic load-                 resistance mechanisms of reinforced-masonry structural components.  In          particular, tests of full-scale story-height reinforced-masonry wall            panels will be tested.  Furthermore, the actuators will be needed in            several new research projects that involve the evaluation of the                inelastic seismic performance of masonry-in-filled reinforced-concrete          frames, as well as the verification of a computer-controlled                    pseudodynamic test facility that is being developed in the laboratory           for seismic performance testing.  The new actuators will not only               enlarge the scope of the current research activities, but will also open        new opportunities for future earthquake engineering research.",
