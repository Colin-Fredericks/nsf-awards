 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is in the area of algebraic combinatorics.  It                   includes association schemes ((P andQ)-polynomial association                   schemes and more general association schemes), distance-regular                 graphs, tight designs, perfect codes and spherical designs.                     Emphasis will be put on the interplay of algebraic combinatorics                with the theory of orthogonal polynomials and with the                          representation theory of groups.  It will start the general                     classification problem for general commutative association                      schemes of large class number.  More precisely, it will collect                 many examples and calculate their character tables and find as                  many necessary conditions for the character table as needed for                 the classification.  It will also study distance-regular graphs                 with fixed (small) valency and generalize such results to general               commutative association schemes with small valency.  It will also               study extremal configurations of (finite) sets in association                   schemes and also in the sphere and other (nice) metric spaces.                       This research will concentrate on combinatorial aspect of                  algebraic problems.  The combination of algebraic, number                       theoretic and analytic tools necessary to perform this research                 makes the subject very attractive.  Bannai is one of the top                    leaders in this subject.  Result of very great importance will                  surely result from this project.",
