 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, WALKING ON WATER, chronicals the success of Jaime                 Escalante's nationally acclaimed mathematics program at Garfield                High School in Los Angeles.  Overcoming crime, poverty and a 50%                drop-out rate, Mr. Escalante transformed Hispanic students with                 deficient scholastic backgrounds into the top calculus students                 in the country.  As a result of this success, Garfield High                     School is now a magnet school for math and science in the Los                   Angeles School District.                                                                                                                                        Mr. Escalante's story will be told in a 90 minute film docudrama                which will air nationally on public television's American                       Playhouse series, the 14th most popular program on PBS reaching                 1.2 million homes.  The film is designed for general theatrical                 release, for educational distribution on cable, for videocassette               release and will be dubbed into Spanish for airing in Spanish                   theaters.  In addition, Eddie Olmas, the Emmy award winning star                of Miami Vice who portrays Mr. Escalanate in the film, will use                 the film in personal appearances.                                                                                                                               Reviewers all agree that this story will inspire and motivate                   students and teachers alike.  They also agreed that it is equally               important to reach other significant audiences such as parents,                 school administrators and opinion leaders so that they will                     understand and support these types of education efforts.",
