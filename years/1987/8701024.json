 "awd_abstract_narration": "Perturbation experiments have become an important tool of                  community ecologists trying to understand what factors determine                the distribution and abundance of species.  Biotic perturbations,               such as the introduction of new species into communities, are of                particular interest.  How a community responds to a new species                 and how that species integrates itself into the existing                        framework of interactions are especially useful in inferring                    mechanisms of community organization.                                                Predation and competition are important interactions within                streamside salamander communities.  These commnunities are                      partially sympatric with a large predatory fish, the brook trout,               providing a biotic perturbation relevant to natural                             distributions.  Predation and competition are important                         interactions within this salamander community.  Impact of trout                 likely involves both predation and competition and may affect the               community via direct and indirect effects.  Community                           organization, species interactions and responses to brook trout                 will be studied using three approaches. Natural experiments will                provide data on the effects of long-term co-occurrence.                         Replicated field experiments allow rigorous testing of the                      hypothesis that brook trout affect community organization in                    streamside salamanders.  Factorial experiments in an array of                   artificial streams will determine the nature and relative                       importance of interactions.",
