 "awd_abstract_narration": "Potable water disinfection is accomplished primarily through various            chlorination processes.  Several problems such as the production of             toxic byproducts, lack of stability toxic gas leaks, and corrosion of           distribution systems can result from these procedures.  Recent research         has indicated the potential for using organic N-halamines as general            purpose disinfectants.  These compounds are formed by the addition of           chlorine, bromine, or chlorine and bromine to either oxazolidinone or           imidazolidinone rings.  As a group these compounds exhibit numerous             characteristics desirable in a disinfectant including stability in solid        and aqueous forms; limited reactivity with organic impurities in water;         and effectiveness against a variety of bacteria, protozoans, fungi, and         viruses.  They are noncorrosive and nontoxic.  The organic N-halamines          have the potential to be more effective disinfectants than many of the          chlorination procedures currently used.                                                                                                                         The proposed project will test the disinfectant potential of three              organic N-halamines; a chlorinated compound (agent A), a brominated             compound (agent AB), and a chloro-brominated compound (agent ABC).              Following synthesis of the compounds, aqueous solutions will be tested          for bactericidal activity under different concentrations, pHs,                  temperatures, and organic loads.  The compounds will be tested against          Escherichia coli,                                                               Pseudomonos aeruginosa, and Streptococcus faecalis.  These                      organisms were chosen based on their resistance to antimicrobial                agents, their potential health hazards, and/or as indicators of                 fecal pollution.                                                                                                                                                Award is recommended as a standard grant for two years in the                   amount of $82,018 to be in two increments, the initial one of                   which will be $11,812 (FY 87).  The remainder is recommended to                 be made as a unilateral action by NSF in FY 1988.//",
