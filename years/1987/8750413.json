 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Department is purchasing several pieces of equipment to:  (a)          support recent curricular changes, (b) replace antiquated existing              equipment and (c) allow majors access to research experiences that are          difficult or impossible to obtain with current holdings.  There are four        basic types of equipment:  (1) audio equipment -- a 6W speech analysis          system and Ensonique sound synthesis system to allow students to modify         and analyze human speech, environmental, musical, and animal sounds in a        wide variety of course and independent research settings; (2) video             equipment -- the Gerbrand presentation system and Coreco Image processor        to allow students to create, flexibly present, and analyze visual images        for the study of human cognition and perception; (3) the Biocomp 2001 to        allow students to measure the physiological indices of arousal relevant         to both biological psychology and social-personality; (4) artificial            intelligence -- a Hero 2000 robot and NEXPERT expert system shell to            allow students research experience with two of the most burgeoning areas        of inquiry in science today -- robotics and artificial intelligence.            The Department has already had considerable success with its research-          oriented approach.  The proposed equipment allows the Department to             fully implement this approach.",
