 "awd_abstract_narration": "Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) is               a baculovirus that is useful both as an expression vector and as                a biological pesticide.  Optimal performance of this virus in                   both applications depends upon our knowledge of host cell factors               involved in viral gene expression and replication.  Available                   data suggests that cytoskeletal elements, especially actin                      microfilaments, are critically involved in viral replication.                   The goal of the proposed research is to learn more about                        cytoskeletal involvement in viral gene expression and replication               and how cytoskeletal elements might be regulated in lepidopteran                cells.  The research involves documenting changes in the                        immunofluorescent staining pattern of microfilaments,                           microtubules, and intermediate filaments throughout the course of               infection, monitoring how infection is affected by substances                   known to interact with cytoskeletal elements and cytoskeletal                   regulatory elements, and determining the role that cell shape                   plays in infection.  Principal research methods are immuno-light                and electron microscopy, cell extractions, protein radiolabelling               and electrophoresis, and dot-blot hybridization. The results of                 these studies will not only shed light on the importance of host-               cell cytoskeleton structure on the reproduction of this virus,                  but aid materially in its development as a biological pesticide                 and potential expression vector.  More generally, these studies                 will be significant in understanding the nature of molecular and                genetic interactions between parasites and their host.",
