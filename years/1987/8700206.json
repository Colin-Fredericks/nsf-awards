 "awd_abstract_narration": "East African pastoralists exploit livestock in a variety of                different environments, all characterized by drastic seasonality.               Pastoralists adjust to seasonality in food supply by temporally                 exploiting different species of livestock, by moving livestock                  and people, and by adjusting human population to available                      resources.  This study is predicted on the hypotheses that (1)                  patterns of pastoral food procurement are aimed at achieving                    energy homeostasis under pressure of environmental variability                  and that (2) this goal of energy homeostasis requires different                 strategies in different ecosystems.  These propositions will be                 tested by comparing food procurement patterns among three groups,               the Rendille and Turkana of northern Kenya and the Borana of                    southern Ethiopia.  The Rendille herd camels in a dry area, the                 Borana exploit cattle in mesic mountains, while the Turkana (in                 an intermediate environment) exploit five species of livestock.                      Dr. Kathleen A. Galvin will use field data and literature                  sources to assess the success of these human groups in                          maintaining energy balances on a seasonal basis despite                         fluctuations in food supply.  A simulation model will be used to                compare and integrate energetics data from these pastoral                       populations.  The project will elucidate interactions between                   environment, human strategies and ecosystem energetics within the               framework of systems ecology and ecological anthropology.  The                  host institution for the one-year postdoctoral fellowship                       activity is Colorado State University.",
