 "awd_abstract_narration": "A symposium on \"Catastrophic Flooding\" will be held on September 26-28,         1987, at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio.  The purpose of this meeting is        to present results of ongoing research to discuss the limitations of it,        and to determine what future research is needed in this area.  The              national and international speakers presenting papers represent a               diverse perspective on extreme and rare flood events and include                engineers, climatologists, geomorphologists and hydrologists.  A half-          day workshop which will take place during the conference, will provide          the attendees with an opportunity to discuss in depth these hydrologic          and geomorphic problems, the type of data needed to assess the risks of         catastrophic floods, the suitability of current models, and the most            promising new areas of research.  Proceedings will be published and             distributed to the participants and other interested parties.  A summary        of the proceedings will be submitted to the American Geophysical Union          for publication.                                                                                                                                                The P.I. is capable to conduct the symposium and workshop and has               submitted a revised budget that is judged suitable.  An award is                recommended.",
