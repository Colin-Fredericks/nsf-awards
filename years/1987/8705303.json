 "awd_abstract_narration": "The survival and growth of all nerve cells including those              in the brain is thought to be controlled by special growth                      regulatory proteins, called neuronotrophic factors (NTF).  At                   this time only one NTF has been identified, nerve growth factor,                and it only affects a very small proportion of the neurons in the               brain.  From studies using cell cultures of highly purified nerve               cells from fetal rat brains, Dr. Walicke and her collaborators                  have recently obtained evidence suggesting that two proteins long               known to stimulate growth of connective tissue, the fibroblast                  growth factors (FGF), might also improve neuronal survival and                  growth.                                                                                                                                                                 This research will try to determine whether the FGF's are               really NTF's for brain neurons.  A combination of biochemical and               histological techniques will be used to determine whether the                   FGF's stimulate neurons directly by acting on specific cell                     receptors.  These studies will first use isolated cells in                      culture, then intact brain tissue.  Whether FGF is produced by                  constituents of brain tissue such as neurons or their support                   cells (glia) will be studied.  Neurons from different regions of                the brain will be examined in tissue culture to determine what                  types of CNS neurons might be stimulated by FGF.  Finally,                      whether application of FGF into a wound in the brain can                        influence neuronal survival or process growth will be examined.                                                                                                         Dr. Walicke has an excellent reputation in the                          neuronotrophic factor field and is highly qualified to conduct                  this important research.  In addition to determining whether FGF                is a NTF, these studies should indicate whether FGF is a                        reasonable candidate for use in treating brain injuries or                      diseases.",
