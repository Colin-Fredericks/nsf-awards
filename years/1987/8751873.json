 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal concerns support for printing of a National Academy               of Science book about chemistry, and distribution for teachers                  and students in conjunction with \"Chemistry Day\".  The schedule                 of this event is very short, and a principal virtue of the                      activity is its role in encouraging participation of practicing                 research chemists in the problems of science education.  So the                 proposal was given special ad hoc review by SEE staff members.                                                                                                  The subject matter disparate judgments are infact quite                         consistent, and the views of the proposal's strengths and                       weaknesses are both clear and consistent.  The subject matter is                a well recognized study of the state of chemistry research.  The                audience and impact are worthwhile though limited.  Without NSF                 support, it is doubtful that the volume is viable.  The support                 requested is nominal and the funding is largely supplied by other               sources:  NAS and private corporations.                                                                                                                         Responding to suggestions from the scientific community, the NAS                is seeking to expand dissemination of the report, OPPORTUNITIES                 IN CHEMISTRY, to the high school level.  A special edition of the               report, suitable for high school chemistry teachers and advanced                placement students is being prepared to be available nationally.                The bulk of the costs..fees to the authors, printing, and                       distribution..are being borne by the NAS and by non.federal                     organizations dedicated to the welfare of chemistry, including                  the American Chemical Society, and the Council for Chemical                     Research.                                                                                                                                                       This proposal requests $25,000 from NSF as partial support for                  supplemental printing and distribution of the report, in an                     overall budget of $95,000.//",
