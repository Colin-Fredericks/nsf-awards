 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Ken Feldman is a new awardee under the Presidential Young                   Investigators Program, with interests in synthetic organic                      chemistry.  Dr. Feldman's experience was enriched with a stay in                industry before joining the staff at the Pennsylvania State                     University.  The emphasis of the research is on the development                 of novel bond-forming processes useful for the synthesis of                     complex natural products.                                                                                                                                       The research involves two projects, both of which are designed to               effect a multicomponent condensation of a finite and                            predetermined number of small \"monomer\" units.  By this                         methodology, one can efficiently construct a complex organic                    structure from simple precursors.                                                                                                                               Both projects utilize reaction sequences which include                          initiation, propagation, and termination stages.  By precisely                  controlling the timing of these three events, one can control the               length of the propagation portion of the sequence and hence                     control the overall number of \"monomer\" units which are                         incorporated in the product molecule.  Ultimately, these                        \"oligomeric\" segments will be useful in the synthesis of natural                products which themselves have small segments of repeating                      molecular units, such as the polyacetate-derived polyene                        antibiotics.",
