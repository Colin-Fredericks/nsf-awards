 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arabidopsis thaliana is a weed, a member of the mustard family.                 In contrast to other plants which have been characterized at the                molecular level, Arabidopsis has a small genome, very little                    repetitive DNA, primarily single copy genes and a relatively                    short life cycle.  Thus, for a plant, it is ideally suited for                  genetic and molecular studies.  Two independent projects are                    proposed here, both aimed toward an understanding of the genetic                processes of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  The first               project involves development and use of a genetic selection for                 trans-acting regulatory mutations that reduce or eliminate                      expression from one or both of two different embryo-specific gene               promoters.  When such mutations are obtained they will be studied               both at the genetic and molecular level.  The second project is                 the study of a series of Arabidopsis mutations that cause                       homeotic transformations of floral organs.  These studies involve               the genetic characterization of mutations that are already known,               isolation of new mutations, and molecular cloning of one or more                of the genes responsible for these mutations.                                                                                                                   The goal of the first project is to understand the mechanism of                 tissue specific gene expression and the second to understand                    pattern formation in morphogenesis at a molecular level.  Plants                offer unique advantages for understanding the genetically                       imprinted program of development which leads to a mature organism               but such studies cannot be done in most plants because of genome                complexity and size.  Arabidopsis as are experimental system                    offers the advantages of plants without the disadvantages.  The                 successful completion of these projects by Dr. Meyerowitz and his               associates could not only produce significant information but                   provide an experimental system equalled only by Drosophila                      melanograster for the exploration of developmental genetics.",
