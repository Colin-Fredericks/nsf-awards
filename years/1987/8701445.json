 "awd_abstract_narration": "Narrative: Past and present U.S. and Oriental marine farms have                 been developed essentially by trial and error procedures.  In the               hope of improving sea farm performance it is proposed to apply                  fundamental engineering principles to the development of tuned                  farms for maximum production.  It is intended that this study will              help provide a technical base for a new U.S. mariculture industry.                                                                                              System identification via empirically determined transfer functions             will help quantify farm performance.  The process input is sea                  surface elevation and the output is water velocity over the farm.               Past studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between water               velocity over the farm and growth rate of both sea plants and sea               animals.                                                                                                                                                        Long-line farms will be engineered with three different types of                crop substrates attached: hanging lines, panels, and containers.                Some of the farm features that influence the hydrodynamic                       performance include: main line tension, main line length, substrate             position along farm, farm sites, main line orientation, buoy size,              substrate attachment, and seasites.  Many of these features will be             studied for both average and storm conditions.                                                                                                                  An important test of marine farm improvement will be to compare                 growth of a crop on tuned and untuned farms.  The results of the                hydrodynamic tests already completed and of those proposed in this              effort will be used to design a crop substrate and a storm-                     resistant farm structure for growth of an agarophyte in the ocean.              The results of the crop growth experiments will then be used to                 further refine the applied marine farm engineering methods.",
