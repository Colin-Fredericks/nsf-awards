 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a continuation of research previously supported                    under NSF Grant DMR-8313295.  Several interesting and unusual                   features of sequentially deposited magnetic thin films.  Many                   extrinsic properties of magnets such as coercive field are                      readily controlled by the layering process.  A new type of                      ferrimagnetic behavior is obtained when the compensating electron               spins are not contained within a microscopic unit cell.  The                    study of the changes in magnetic properties during amorphous                    phase transitions leads to new insight into the nature of the                   transitions.  The research under this grant is a detailed study                 of the sharp switching behavior of thin magnetostrictive thin                   layers, the switching behavior of very soft multilayered films,                 the magnetostriction of the pure compounds as well as their                     layered configuration, and the occurrence of spinodal                           decomposition in the amorphous state of some of the magnets.                    The new layered materials show potential for application as                     magnetic recording media for computers and information storage.",
