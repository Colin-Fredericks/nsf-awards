 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Formal Functional Programming (FFP) machine is a novel computer             architecture that has the potential of combining high performance with          programming ease and flexibility.  It is a direct implementation of a           reduction model of computation.  Program decomposition, task                    allocation, synchronization and scheduling are efficiently automated in         the FFP machine, and therefore are removed from the programmer's                concern.                                                                                                                                                        The primary objective of this research is to design the asynchronous T-         cell component of the FFP machine, and to coordinate the specification          and design of parts of the system.  The secondary objectives are to use         the experience of collaborating on the FFP machine design to challenge          the asynchronous methodology as well as to help refine it, and to apply         the FFP machine to scientific problem solving.                                                                                                                  This is a collaborative effort with Gyula Mago of the University of             North Carolina.                                                                 The program director considers the FFP machine to be a truly novel              computer.  Dr. Molnar is a recognized expert in asynchronous logic, and         is uniquely qualified to design and build the T-cells that are                  essential to the success of this combined research effort.  The program         director strongly recommends funding this proposal.",
