The workshop is                        scheduled at the Sixth International Symposium on Offshore                      Mechanics and Arctic Engineering to be held in Houston, Texas,                  March 1-6, 1987.  It is planned to invite several foremost world                leaders in ice mechanics research from the United Kingdom,                      Finland, Japan, Canada, and the United States.  The invitees will               prepare written review papers on the state of research in each                  country and the papers will be published in the Applied Mechanics               Review.  Following the formal presentations, the research needs                 will be discussed.  This workshop is timely and would provide                   future research direction for ice mechanics.                                                                                                                    An award is recommended.",
