 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will allow Drs. Stuart A. Hall and Ian Evans, University of          Houston, University Park, to collaborate with Dr. Nezihi Canitez,               Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey, Kocaeli, Turkey.           Their research will be part of a larger Turkish Geotraverse Project in          a north-south corridor in western Anatolia.  They and other researchers         from Istanbul Technical University will examine the interactions of             large lithospheric plates with smaller, continental fragments to                determine the study basin's original setting and development.  They             will try to determine the size and integrity of the continental block           in the Deresakari region and to learn of the block's relationship to            the \"Sakarya Continent.\"                                                                                                                                        They will use paleomagnetic methods to determine some of the structural         complexities associated with geological movements in the area.  The             remanent magnetism of the samples will be measured using a cryogenic            magnetometer at the University of Houston.  Both Drs. Hall and Evans            have worked extensively in Turkey.  Their Turkish colleagues have been          active in geological research in the study area and they have proposed          a tectonic model for the region.  This cooperative research is a                promising way to test aspects of the model and to contribute to                 goelogical theory.  The proposed cooperation presents the U.S.                  investigators with an opportunity to collect data not easily available          in the U.S.",
