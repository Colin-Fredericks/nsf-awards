 "awd_abstract_narration": "The atmosphere below 100km altitude is in a state of                       continual motion, and the winds and waves in it can be measured                 by radar measurements of the scattering from small scale                        inhomogeneities it contains.  To obtain echoes from below about                 80km an operating frequency of about 40Mhz is used, while from                  the region 80-100km a frequency of 2-3Mhz is optimum.  One of                   each type of radar is to be upgraded and put into operation at                  the Urbana field station of the University of Illinois.                         Scientific issues to be addressed include the statistical                       characteristics of stratospheric and mesospheric gravity waves,                 tropospheric frontal dynamics, and dynamics of narrow turbulent                 layers and momentum deposited in the mesosphere.  Observations                  will be made in conjunction with the Flatland meteorological                    radar and the day/night sodium lidar systems in the immediate                   vicinity.  The PI and his group at the University of Illinois are               well known nationally and internationally for their output of                   high quality work, which has been up to the present mainly                      theoretical, but is now to be rounded out with an experimental                  effort.",
