 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues a line of research focusing on the                       evolution of female participation in the labor force in the                     United State from 1790 to the present.  The investigator has                    produced nine papers under the previous NSF award looking at                    various aspects of women in the work force.  In particular, the                 increased participation of women in the work force over the past                two centuries can be explained, in large measure, by the                        expanding menu of jobs, a decreased cost of acquiring skills, and               a rise in the return to general knowledge.  In addition, a number               of data sets were constructed on female labor-force participation               rates, earnings, occupations, job experience, education, and                    hours worked.                                                                                                                                                   The purpose of this project is to complete a monograph on the                   evolution of women in the labor force, and to continue research                 on four different topics on the subject of gender differences in                the economy.  The four topics are: (1) Develop a long-run data                  series on labor-force participation rates, occupations, and                     hours worked; (2) Analyze and explain the gender earnings-gap;                  (3) Analyze sex discrimination in earnings and occupations,                     including testing directly the Becker model of discrimination;                  (4) Analyze the effects of protective labor legislation on                      female employment.  This research is important because it will                  provide a deeper understanding of the changing role of women in                 the market economy and the origin and causes of gender                          differences in terms of occupations and earnings.",
