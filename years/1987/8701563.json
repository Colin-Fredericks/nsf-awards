 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Fraley has requested partial support for a conference that will             focus on recently developed techniques that allow the production of             transgenic plants.  The sessions will cover: Ti plasmid derived                 vectors, plant gene promoters, transformation of crop plants, plant             genetics (somatic and sexual), crop modification, protein traffic,              novel gene systems, and several other topics.  The tentative list of            speakers is excellent.  The conference will be held in a central                location (Colorado), and will have a size and format similar to that of         the very successful Gordon conferences.                                                                                                                         The proposed conference will center around recent advances in the               development of techniques for the introduction of foreign DNA into              plants and their use in a variety of plant research areas.  Both from           the progress to date with plants and from past experience with other            organisms, it is clear that these techniques will revolutionize the             study of plant physiology, development and genetics.  This is a rapidly         moving research area of fundamental importance, and the conference will         be of great use to the participants and to the study of plants in               general.",
