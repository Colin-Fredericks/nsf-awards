 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insects living on or within the substrate of streams \"drift\"            downstream in substantial numbers and with a pronounced nocturnal               rhythm.  Insect drift is one of the unique properties of running                waters and, despite numerous studies, it remains both a challenge               and a puzzle to lotic ecologists.                                                       Recent developments of concepts and techniques now allow for            a concerted attack on the issues of why organisms drift, to what                degree drift entry is active vs. passive, and the relative                      influence of biotic vs. abiotic causes.  This research is                       directed toward the goal of understanding insect drift within the               context of foraging events and risk of predation.                                       Nocturnality has been satisfactorily explained by the risk              of predation hypothesis.  Two explanations exist for why drift                  occurs:  as the passive and accidental consequence of nocturnal                 foraging activity, or as an active and purposeful process of                    habitat search/dispersal, related to resource depletion.  While                 the passive model is widely accepted, evidence from recent work                 documents weaknesses in the passive mechanism and a significant                 role for an active mechanism.  This research uses a combination                 of field sampling and laboratory and field experiments to address               five objectives that test multiple hypotheses concerning the                    mechanism(s) underlying drift behavior.  Their completion should                lead to an improved understanding of the relative contributions                 of active and passive explanations of downstream drift, which                   remains one of the major, unresolved issues in river ecology.",
