 "awd_abstract_narration": "This MRI Research Planning Grant is for one year to obtain                      pilot data on innervation f the inner ear.  The sensory                         receptor cells in the cochlea of the mammalian ear are of two                   types, the inner hair cells (IHC) and the far more numerous                     outer hair cells (OHC).  These receptor cells are innervated by                 nerve cells (neurons) that have their cell bodies in a                          structure called the spiral ganglion of the ear.  Adult animals                 have two types of spiral ganglion cells, based on their                         contacts with one or the other type of hair cells, the diameter                 of their fibers, and size and shape of their cell bodies.  It                   remains puzzling that the OHC, representing roughly 3/4 of all                  the hair cells, receive contacts from fewer than one-tenth of                   all the ganglion cells.                                                                                                                                         It is not clear how the neurons develop into these two classes.                 In newborn animals, some studies suggest that these cells are                   morphologically different from the adult neurons, and are                       initially a homogeneous population.  This planning grant is a                   preliminary step toward clarifying the anatomy and ultra-                       structure of the spiral ganglion neurons that contact OHCs in                   newborn rodents.  Both light microscopy and electron microscopy                 will be used, in conjunction with dye-filling techniques for                    single cells, and specific antibody staining.  The analysis of                  these data will provide a basis for a later full proposal to                    pursue the development of these neurons.                                                                                                                        This project is on a group of cells important in understanding                  mechanisms of hearing.  The data will provide a needed baseline                 to allow preparation of a full research project on development                  of these cells.",
