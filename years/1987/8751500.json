 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algebra is the core of secondary school mathematics.  It provides               concepts, language, and reasoning methods that are essential tools for          problem solving in science, technology, and every other branch of               mathematics.  Computer graphic, numerical, and symbol manipulation              tools that are now widely available offer powerful new approaches to            algebraic problem solving and to learning algebraic concepts,                   principles, and skills.  Thus computing offers promise of an                    impressive advance in the scope and effectiveness of secondary school           algebra.                                                                                                                                                        This joint University of Maryland and Pennsylvania State University             Project will complete development, field testing, and evaluation of             prototype instructional materials for an elementary algebra strand in           secondary school mathematics that reflects appropriate integration of           computer tools for problem solving, teaching, and learning.  The                primary responsibility for curriculum development will rest with the            University of Maryland and the teacher preparation and evaluation of            the field tests will be done by Pennsylvania State University.                                                                                                  The final products will include model student text materials and                computer software guidelines for teacher preparation, analyses of               student learning, and guidelines for evaluation of achievement in the           coming computer-intensive environments for school algebra.",
