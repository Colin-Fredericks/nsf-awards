 "awd_abstract_narration": "Narrative: The control of biological reactors is complicated by the             fact that microbial or tissue cells are extremely  sensitive to                 small changes in their growth environment.  In addition, there is               little detailed knowledge about biological system process dynamics              thus making the design and implementation of effective control                  strategies a difficult if not impossible task.  Another frustrating             problem is the lack of appropriate sensors to monitor important                 process variables, such as pH, temperature, nutrient concentration,             and by-product concentration.                                                                                                                                   To help overcome these inherent problems this research proposes to              use a hybrid control scheme; incorporating one level of conventional            control and a second superimposed \"expert system\" with factual, as              well as intuitive, uncertain, and judgemental knowledge for extended            control action.  It is proposed that both a model-based and a model-            free expert system be investigated.                                                                                                                             The butanol/acetone fermentation has been chosen as the model system            because of a strong data base in the literature; the system can                 produce various products with variable yields and selectivities                 under different environmental conditions, and the investigators have            had previous experience with this system.  It is intended that                  results from this study will enhance the control of bioprocesses and            therefore, increase their reliability and productivity.",
