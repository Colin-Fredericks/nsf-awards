 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Watts is a pioneer in infrared absorption spectroscopy                of van der Waals molecules.  His past work has included both                    experimental and theoretical studies.  In the current research,                 he will continue and extend these investigations to provide                     information about molecular interactions, potential energy                      surfaces, intramolecular energy transfer, and vibrational                       dynamics.  This information is needed to test calculations of                   collisional and condensed phase properties as well as to describe               how chemical reactions occur.                                                                                                                                   In the near future, Dr. Watts will measure the high resolution                  infrared spectra of both small, weakly bound,van der Waals and                  strongly associated clusters using F-center and carbon dioxide                  lasers, the angular distributions and energetics of infrared                    induced cluster fragmentation by time-of-flight mass                            spectrometry, and theoretical and experimental investigations of                state resolved differential scattering measurements on the He/HF                system.",
