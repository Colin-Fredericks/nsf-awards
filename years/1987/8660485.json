 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building energy use is approximately 38 percent of the total primary            energy consumed in the United States.   Opportunities exist to reduce           energy consumption in existing buildings by 50 percent and in new               buildings by 75 percent or more through the careful application of              conservation and passive solar energy measures.  This level of                  improvement in energy efficiency can be achieved only by taking                 advantage of innovative materials, products and design ccncepts and by          fully integrating energy ccnsiderations into the architectural and              engineering design process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The proposed project will develop a new daylighting design              method based on a \"Lumen-Day\" concept.  The essence of the Lumen-Day            method is a statistical climatic data base, similar in concept to the           heating and cooling degree-day method of energy analysis, generated             through the interrogation and analysis of TMY/TRY weather tapes.  The           Lumen-Day data base would be a statistical summary of the daylight              rescurce and would be used to evaluate the energy implications of               daylighting use in buildings for a given interior light level and               electric lighting control strategy.  Using the proposed method, a               building designer could readily determine the daylighting performance           efficiency as well as the lighting energy use of the building design.           Currently, daylighting design analysis is constrained by the need for           cumbersome hourly simulations or physical model testing.   The proposed         Lumen-Day method provides simple design guidelines and an energy                analysis procedure to efficiently determine the potential and energy            savings of daylighting in commercial buildings.                                                                                                                 The Principal Investigator has excellent qualificaticns to conduct this         project.  There is potential commercial applications of the research:                                                                                           (1)  As a design tool used by architects and engineers,                         (2)  As an analysis tool used by electric utility planners, and                 (3) As one component of an integrated computer-aid design program.                                                                                              An award is recommended for Phase I.",
