 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the continued semi-annual meetings of the                   Universities' Research Conference (URC).  The purpose of these                  conferences is to bring together economists from across the U.S.                for two days of discussions on a specific topic.  Conference topics are         chosen for their relevance to current economic policy discussions as            well as their interest to academic economists.  Recent conferences have         focussed on international aspects of fiscal policies, monetary policy,          government spending programs, and unemployment.  Papers for                     presentation at the conferences are solicited from over 80 economics            departments and 50 business schools.  Conference organizers are careful         to select a mix of established and less well known researchers.                 Discussants and other conference participants are also chosen to                encourage interaction among economists with similar interests at                different universities.  A typical conference includes 8 to 10 papers           and about 80 participants from 25 different universities.                                                                                                       This is a unique and valuable forum for researchers who otherwise               might have little opportunity to interact with other specialists                in their field.  Past conferences have been well run.  The quality of           the papers presented was high.  Participants benefitted from the formal         presentations and the informal interactions.  The conference organizers         have the ability to continue this successful conference series.",
