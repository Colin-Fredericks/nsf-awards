 "awd_abstract_narration": "The understanding of how living systems \"synthesize\" the                        molecules that make them up can provide important information on                the relationships among the parts of the plant and animal                       kingdoms. This can be used in the designing of new plants where                 the intent is the diminishing/elimination (or conversely                        increasing/adding) of a constituent.  This grant is in the                      Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program.                                                                                                                   6-Hydroxyanthranilic acid has been recently identified in this                  laboratory as a new product of the shikimic acid pathway and as a               key intermediate in the biosynthesis of sarubicin A by                          Streptomyces helicus.  6-Hydroxyanthranilic acid seems most                     reasonably formed from the rare isochorismic acid.  Subsequent                  steps are proposed involving novel C-glycosides of a 2,6-dideoxy                sugar and further hydroxylation of the anthranilate moiety.                     Subsequent work in this laboratory on the biosynthesis of                       antibiotic LL-C10037a, with a very different skeleton from                      sarubicin A, clearly points towards anthranilic acid and/or 3-                  hydroxyanthranilic acid as a key intermediate with subsequent                   further hydroxylation at an undetermined stage as well.  Up to                  six putative C-glycoside intermediates will be synthesized with                 stable isotope labels and tested in S. helicus.  Labeled                        anthranilic acid, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, and a series of                    further hydroxylated and/or decarboxylated and/or acetylated                    compounds will be used to determine specific biosynthetic                       incorporations.  Cell-free preparations of S. helicus will be                   generated and examined for the presence of isochorismate synthase               and 6-hydroxyanthranilate synthase, and preliminary studies on                  the mechanism of the former reaction will be initiated with O-18                labels.",
