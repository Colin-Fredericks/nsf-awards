 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important part of the sun's influence on the Earth and                       planets, and on processes throughout interplanetary space, is                   exerted by the solar wind and its embedded magnetic field.                      Although significant progress has been made toward understanding                these effects, wide gaps remain which provide fertile areas for                 theoretical research to complement the many ongoing experimental                programs.  The growing collection of observational data is                      leading to the discovery of new, subtle, and apparently                         fundamental relationships between the terrestrial environment and                                                                                               the state of the interplanetary medium.  For example, possible                  influences of cosmic rays on global electricity have been                       proposed.  A second example is the existence of solar-cycle                     effects on Earth's environment.  It is not yet precisely clear                  just which of the sun's emissions vary over the course of a solar                                                                                               cycle nor is it clear how they vary.  For this reason, continued                investigation of the behavior of the interplanetary medium is                   central to a firm understanding of solar-terrestrial                            relationships.                                                                                                                                                  This grant will support continuation of a program of theoretical                investigations into the properties and behavior of the                          interplanetary medium, with emphasis on solar-terrestrial                       relationships.  Emphasis will be placed on the large-scale                      structure of the solar wind, its magnetic field, and the various                manifestations of its fluctuations and turbulence.  In                          particular, the effect of large scale magnetic field structure on                                                                                               cosmic ray acceleration, propagation and anisotropies will be                   studied.                                                                                                                                                        As part of this effort a Sun workstation will be acquired to                    facilitate supercomputer access and hence large scale numerical                 modelling of particle propagation in the interplanetary medium.                 The investigators are highly qualified in this research area.",
