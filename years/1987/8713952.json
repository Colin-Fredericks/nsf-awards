 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the problem of stability or safety of structures        which is one of the most important design considerations, particularly          for those which are vulnerable to high winds or earthquake excitations.         One primary stability factor is the P-  effect produced by an                   overturning moment dependent on the floor gravity load and the floor            rotation.  One possible approach to this problem is to make use of the          concept of structural control in preventing undesirable, excessive P-           stresses induced by external excitations.                                                                                                                       The research aims at investigating the feasibility of such a stability          control concept and establishing a theoretical base for control systems.        Both passive and active control systems, including mass damper systems          and tendon systems will be studied.  A state vector approach will be            used to provide the mathematical framework of the analysis which will           incorporate the treatment of P-  effects using a plastic hinge                  idealization and a model which allows for a gradual development of              yielding in highly stressed regions of structural members.                                                                                                      This study will contribute to the practical implementation of control           systems in the safe construction of the engineering facility.                                                                                                   This is a research initiation grant under the Research Opportunity for          Women program supported by the Engineering Directorate.",
