 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been well established that gonadal steroids regulate                     reproductive behavior in primates.  The main steroid involved in                this regulation is testosterone which acts at specific sites in                 the brain.  Although it is known that testosterone stimulates                   male behavior by acting on the brain, very little is known about                the neurobiology of the interaction between the endocrine system                and the central nervous system.  The goal of Pomerantz's research               program is to elucidate this relationship in primates.                                                                                                          This research will use state-of-the-art neuroendocrine techniques               to study the role of specific areas of the brain that regulate                  reproductive behavior.  The data generated by this research will                provide a solid foundation for future research aimed at                         understanding hormone-mediated neuroendocrine and neurochemical                 processes that modulate the reproductive behavior of male                       primates.",
