 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Dagdigian, in collaboration with Dr. Millard Alexander of                   the University of Maryland, plans to continue a joint                           theoretical-experimental project involving studies of                           electronically inelastic collision processes in small molecules                 and radicals.  The experiments will involve the use of                          optical-optical double resonance for the determination of                       energy transfer rate constants with initial and final quantum                   state resolution in a flow system.  The following collisional                   processes will be investigated:  (a) transitions between                        low-lying triplet states of nitrogen, (b) transitions among                     low-lying states of CN and carbon monoxide positive ions, (c)                   spin-changing transitions in CS, and (d) transitions between                    excited states of the calcium monohalides.  This experimental                   work is being carried out jointly with the following                            theoretical projects:  (a) the development of the fully quantum                 description of electronically inelastic collisions, in                          particular those involving a change in spin multiplicity of the                 molecular partner, (b) the determination of ab initio potential                 energy surfaces and wavefunctions relevant to collisions of                     electronically excited CN and nitrogen, and (c) the calculation                 of fully state-resolved cross sections based on ab initio                       potential surfaces.  Specific attention is being given to the                   calculation of the electronically nonadiabatic matrix elements                  which describe the coupling between the nuclear motion of the                   collision partners and the motion of their constituent                          electrons.                                                                                                                                                      This research is important because the processes under                          investigation are responsible for quenching of electronically                   excited states of molecules and for the pressure dependence of                  photon yields in many chemiluminescent reactions.  For example,                 there has been a long-standing interest in understanding the                    detailed mechanisms that govern energy flow in systems                          containing electronically excited nitrogen molecules.  Since it                 is the major component of our atmosphere, knowledge about                       collisional processes of nitrogen is crucial for an                             understanding of phenomena such as auroras and airglows.  In                    the laboratory, nitrogen is often present in gas mixtures in                    discharges, including various gas laser media.",
