 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Advanced Computational Methods Center at The University of Georgia          will conduct two one-week Supercomputer Summer Institutes for members           of the PANCOMP consortium, a consortium established to provide                  education and access to high performance computers for historically             black colleges and universities.                                                                                                                                The first Institute on vector programming is designed to introduce              experienced FORTRAN programmers to supercomputers, in particular the            CYBER 205.  Topics covered will include an overview of current                  supercomputer architectures, access methods, vector programming, timing         and optimization techniques, debugging aids, and the use of application         libraries and utilities.                                                                                                                                        The second Institute on advanced vector programming is designed to be a         follow-on to both the NSF-sponsored Supercomputer Summer Institute for          PANCOMP conducted by the ACMC last summer and the proposed introductory         Institute.  The success of the initial Institute generated a request            for additional training from the participants.  This course will begin          with a review of basic CYBER 205 concepts and vector programming and            include topics such as machine language formats, global optimization            techniques, scalar and vector optimization methods, and networking and          data communications.  This Institute is designed to train the                   participants to a depth that will enable them to return to their home           institutions and disseminate information about supercomputers and               assist their users in the use of the CYBER 205.",
