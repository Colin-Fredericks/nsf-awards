 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reticulomyxa is a large, multinucleated, freshwater                        protozoan with striking intracellular transport and cytoskeletal                dynamics. Saltatory movement of individual organelles at a rate                 of up to 25um per second and cytoplasmic streaming are observed                 within the extensive reticulapodial network of fine strands and                 the naked cell body.  In addition, the strands of the peripheral                network are capable of rapid extension, retraction, splaying and                fusion.  The research proposed is aimed at elucidating the                      molecular mechanisms of the movement of organelles and                          reticulopodial strands.  Preliminary studies, including a                       characterization of the structural organization of the network,                 the development of a stable and reproducible permeabilized cell                 model, and the preparation of monoclonal antibodies, have laid                  the groundwork for turning this into a useful model system.  From               these studies, a number of specific projects have emerged.  To                  complete the characterization of the structural prerequisites for               motility, the polarity of microtubules and actin filaments will                 be determined, and their three-dimensional organization will be                 analyzed in the frozen-hydrated state.  The preparation and                     characterization of monoclonal antibodies will be continued.  An                assay for microtubule sliding in lysed reticulopodial strands                   will be developed.  The effect of monoclonal antibodies on                      reactivated organelle movement and microtubule splaying will be                 assessed, and the antigens likely to be involved in organelle                   movements and network dynamics will be localized by                             immunoelectron microscopy.                                                           These studies are significant because they promise to                      improve our understanding of organelle and microtubule dynamics                 in the cell. They will also provide a new approach for analyzing                the molecular basis of particle transport in the living cells.",
