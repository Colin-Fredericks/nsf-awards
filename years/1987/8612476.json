 "awd_abstract_narration": "Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building construction         in the U.S. and the world.  Reinforced masonry construction use is              increasing in moderate to higher seismic zones because of its apparent          features of economy, fire safety, architectural flexibility and ease of         construction.  The present state of masonry structural analysis and             design, and materials and construction technologies does not enable an          accurate prediction of building behavior under lateral loads such as            seismic loads.  In the U.S., masonry buildings are designed and built           with methods, codes and standards that rely upon a mixture of working           stress methods, empirical rules, and questionable methods for                   determining allowable stress values.  Masonry is also a complex building        material because of the large number of design and construction                 variables which influenoe the final product configuration and its               response under seismic loads.  In order to describe the seismic response        of masonry buildings it is necessary to develop the fundamental                 knowledge base to determine basic design methodologies consistent with          safety and economic requirements.                                                                                                                               This research project will investigate the dynamic response of a                reinforced masonry building system with a known force-deflection                hysteresis.  It will focus on the interdependence of the softening of           reinforced concrete masonry structures and the sequence of destructive          earthquake motions.  Three identical test structures will be fabricated         at one-quarter scale, and subjected to static and dynamic lateral               forces.  Numerical procedures will be used to help interpret                    measurements.  The results of this research project will be used to             assess the use of scale models for predicting the behavior of full scale        reinforced masonry structures by making comparisons with previous full          scale research results.  This will influence the design practice.                                                                                               The principal investigator is highly qualified to conduct the work and          the institution provides excellent support facilities.  An award is             recommended for the first year of this two-year complete research               project.",
