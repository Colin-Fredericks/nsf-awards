 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in Experimental Physical Chemistry supports the research of          Professor Richard Bersohn in the field of photodissociation dynamics.           The importance of photodissociation dynamics is that it enables us to           understand how and how fast chemicals react.  The research described is         innovative, well supported theoretically, and may change the way other          researchers think about the evolution of chemical reactions. The                research involves the reaction A+BC=AB+C, which will be studied by              using aligned atoms A to study the extent to which the alignment of an          atom A will be propagated into alignment of the angular momenta of the          products AB and C and the anisotropy of their relative velocity.                                                                                                Examples of A, to be studies include Hg, Cs, H and F. Examples of BC            include hydrogen gas, HCl and iodine gas.  The degree to which the              alignment of the reactants is reflected in the products is a measure of         the symmetry of the transition state and the lifetime of the transition         state complex.  Alignment of reactant atoms (unequal distribution over          magnetic sublevels) is accomplished by excitation with linearly                 polarized light.  This elementary reaction will be studied as well as           its inverse process in which the anisotropic relative velocity of the           reactants produces alignment of the products.",
