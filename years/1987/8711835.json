 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of ribosomes is clear. They are obligatory for                   gene expression, and large numbers are required for even slow                   cell growth.  That ribosomal RNA accounts for half of the                       transcripts in cells has facilitated studies of the                             formation and metabolism of large ribosomal precursors which                    contain up to 20% \"extra\" sequences that are processed away                     as they mature to produce rRNA and form ribosomes.  The                         processing pathway itself has been made clear but three main                    features remain poorly understood.  In this grant, Dr.                          Schlessinger will focus on these features:  the mechanism of                    formation of mature rRNA termini in E. coli; the link, if                       any, between protein synthesis and rRNA processing; and the                     sequences in precursor rRNA required to induce for rRNA                         formation or processing and how they function.  The enzymes                     and factors required to form the mature termini of 16s and                      23s rRNA in vitro will be identified.  The nature of the                        minimal substrate will also be assessed, as will the features                   of protein synthetic conditions required to optomize the                        processing reactions.  Site specific mutagenesis will be                        applied to produce systematic deletions of \"extra\"                              spacer sequences at the ends of 16s mRNA.  The resulting                        mutants will be studied in vivo.  Additionally, the secondary                   structure of the rRNAs will be examined by electron                             microscopy.  The investigator has long been a major                             contributor in this area and this proposal indicates that he                    will continue to be.  Support with a very good priority is                      recommended.",
