 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is undertaken under provisions in AD/ENG Bulletin No. 85-          25 for \"Expedited Awards for Novel Research.\"                                                                                                                   The primary objective of the research is to complete the final                  development of a statistical response spectrum method for multi-degree          of freedom systems.  Currently, such problems can only be handled using         approximations.  The new method to be developed is powerful, accurate,          and has a round theoretical basis following the work by Cartwright and          Longuet-Higgins.                                                                                                                                                The need to estimate the maximum response of multi-degree-of-freedom            structures is evident as many spectrum estimation or superposition              methods have been proposed.  However, very few of them are established          on sound physical basis and utilizing statistical theory which can              account for the uncertainties in the results they produce.  The proposed        method is capable of evaluating the expected and most probable amplitude        of local response peaks for each floor of a multi-story building.               Computer runs will be made to test the numerical accuracy before the            method can be fully documented, published, and introduced into practical        applications.                                                                                                                                                   The work proposed would produce a method far superior to any of the             existing methods.  The expedited award mechanism is used to enable a            uniquely qualified graduate student to complete the work while                  available.                                                                                                                                                      The Principal Investigator is one of the leaders in structural dynamics         and ground motions.  He has pioneered many important subjects in these          areas.
