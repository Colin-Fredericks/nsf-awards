 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental studies of the instabilities and phase                     transitions in light-matter interaction will be continued.  These               experiments are in part an outgrowth of the experiments being                   carried out with NSF support and they build upon experience and                 techniques developed to study fluctuation phenomena in laser-                   matter interactions.  The proposed experiments include                          investigations of the effects of colored multiplicative noise on                various types of laser instabilities.  These experiments would be               very timely in view of the current interest in noise induced                    transitions in nonequilibrium systems.  The fluctuation and                     instabilities in the process of second harmonic generation will                 also be studied as a way of initiating a study of the                           instabilities of nonlinear optical systems.  The proposed                       experiments will provide much needed experimental data in a                     rapidly growing field.",
