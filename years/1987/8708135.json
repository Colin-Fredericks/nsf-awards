 "awd_abstract_narration": "Granites are found at shallow to deep levels of exposure                throughout the Earth's crust whereas migmatites are found                       usually at middle to deep levels.  It has been postulated that                  migmatites are the site of granite melt generation and that                     subsequent magma separation from host rocks and buoyant ascent                  results in the familiar cross-cutting plutons of shallow                        crustal levels.                                                                         It is proposed to test alternative models for the origin                of migmatites and granites.  Preliminary work suggests there is                 a spatial transition from migmatites to granites in southern                    Connecticut and that both rock types are contemporaneous.                       Integrated studies of field, structural, petrological, and                      geochemical characteristics will be conducted to determine 1)                   the relative age of rock units; 2) the thermal history of the                   region; and 3) the degree of chemical consanguinity of spatially                related rock types.  Techniques to be used include electron                     microprobe and inductively coupled plasma analysis. The relative                importance of tectonic thickening vs. magmatic advection in                     heating the region will be determined.  The role of crustal                     reworking in granite formation will be assessed.",
