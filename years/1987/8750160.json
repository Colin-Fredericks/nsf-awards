 "awd_abstract_narration": "Five Colleges, Inc., a consortium comprised of Amherst, Hampshire,         Mount Holyoke, Smith and the University of Massachusetts, will                  strengthen its interdisciplinary program in Coastal and Marine Sciences.        The goal is to enhance the field-research portion of several courses and        independent student projects by improving access to marine habitats and         by removing the restrictions imposed by the lack of essential,                  specialized equipment.  Specifically, the consortium will purchase a            boat which is the laboratory from which students will conduct nearshore         and open water experiments.  Surveying equipment will permit students to        generate accurate, on-site topographic maps of salt marsh and rocky             intertidal habitats; coring equipment will enable students to visualize         the dynamic processes molding the coastline, recorded in underlying peat        and sediment layers.  Other equipment, including trawls, gill net,              plankton nets, field balance, underwater camera, light meter, and oxygen        meter, will provide training in contemporary sampling methodology, and          enable students to design sophisticated field experiments.  Improving           the Coastal and Marine Sciences Program, by taking advantage of the new         teaching opportunities represented in modern, analytical field                  equipment, will make the program more effective in preparing students           for successful professional study in marine sciences.",
