 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Kahn is a new investigator under the Presidential Young                     Investigator program.  Under this will be studied                               conformationally restricted mimetics that should provide novel                  methods of studying the relationship between peptide structure                  and function.  Beyond these fundamental investigations, the                     industrial applications of this research could prove profound.                  The ability to mimic the activity of peptides and proteins with                 synthetic models should prove invaluable in the design of new                   pharmaceutical agents, enzyme inhibitors, and synthetic                         catalysts.                                                                                                                                                      The investigations are focused on the design and synthesis of                   systems which mimic peptide beta-turns.  The surface                            localization of turns in proteins and the predominance of                       potentially reactive functional groups in their side chains has                 led to the suggestion, which is now partially established, that                 turns can function as recognition sites which trigger complex                   immunologic, metabolic, genomic and endocrinologic events.                      Additionally turns have been implicated as sites of nucleation                  of protein folding as well as markers for proteolytic                           degradation and antibody recognition.                                                                                                                           Evidence obtained by the comparison of the endogenous opioid                    peptides and the opiate analgesics suggests that the                            pharmacophoric interactions responsible for the biological                      activity of these peptides, occur between the side chain alpha                  substituents and their target receptors.  Based on this                         assessment, with the aid of computer assisted molecular                         modeling, a nine-membered ring carbocyclic framework has been                   designed as an idealized mimetic of the pseudocyclic                            ten-membered ring of a beta-turn.  Synthetic strategies which                   allow for the placement of any of the amino acid side chain                     functional groups at position R1 through R4 in addition to the                  introduction of both the amino and carboxy termini are under                    investigation.",
