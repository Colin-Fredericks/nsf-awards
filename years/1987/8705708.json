 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. J. McNeil has made major contributions to the field of                 relativistic hadron-nucleus scattering theory, such as the                      development of the relativistic impulse approximation, (RIA)                    and the calculation of magnetic moments.  He plans to continue                  his research in this field by performing a relativistic RPA                     calculation of the response functions of finite nuclei, by                      analyzing meson-nucleus scattering within the RIA and by doing                  a relativistic calculation of subcoulombic radiative capture                    processes.                                                                           Dr. McNeil is a young nuclear theorist who has made                        seminal contributions to the new field of relativistic nuclear                  physics.  His specialty is relativistic hadron-nucleus                          scattering theory.  With his collaborators he has performed                     significant calculations which have greatly contributed to the                  development and advancement of this field.  He plans to                         continue his research in this area.",
