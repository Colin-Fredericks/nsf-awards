 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Luquillo Experimental Forest is a National Forest and a                     Biosphere Reserve and contains several research natural areas                   within its 11,231 ha. area.  The goal of this proposed research                 is to initiate studies of disturbance regime and forest structure               and dynamics in a landscape perspective.  Primary research                      questions address the relative importance of different                          disturbance types within major life zones and the interactions of               the biota in restoring ecosystem productivity after disturbance.                Research components comprise the: examination of pattern,                       frequency, and intensity of disturbance; measurement of                         environmental properties expected to vary with disturbance size,                age, and origin; estimation biological properties expected to                   vary with environmental properties; and assessment of system                    properties that emerge from the effects of disturbance pattern                  and frequency on the interaction of environment and biota.                      Standard measurements (e.g. meteorology and basic research site                 description) will be conducted.  Existing data sets will be                     incorporated into a comprehensive data management system to                     support data reduction and synthesis.                                                                                                                           Strong institutional commitments exist from the University of                   Puerto Rico and the Institute of Tropical Forestry, U.S. Forest                 Service, whose personnel will collaborate in the conduct of the                 work.  Facilities and accommodations provided to the project                    group are first-rate.                                                                                                                                           The Ecosystem Studies Program recommends that this award be made                and expects that excellent results will be achieved.",
