 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives and Relevancy:  This project supports U.S. participation             in the International Symposium on Fibre Reinforced Concrete planned             for December 16-19, 1987 in Madras, India.  The symposium is                    attracting contributed papers from various European countries, the              U.S., Canada, Australia, and Japan as well as from developing                   countries, in addition to invited papers on the state-of-the-art by             eminent speakers.  Specific topics to be included are: failure                  mechanisms and mechanical properties; steel, glass, organic and                 vegetable fibers; methods of fabrication and cast-in-place                      construction; applications;  durability and long term performance;              and design and economic considerations.  This project fits the                  objectives of the U.S.-India program which include supporting U.S.              scientists at major international meetings in India where there are             likely to be scientific benefits to the two countries.                          Merit:  The topic is of considerable importance to scientists and               engineers in the U.S. and in India.  Fiber reinforced concrete is               offering the construction industry many advantages because it makes             possible the variation of concrete properties to meet specific needs,           such as earthquake damage resistance .  These advantages have                   stimulated the increase in usage of these materials.  Indian and U.S.           scientists as well as those from many developed countries have                  pursued research in this area over the last two decades, and are                likely to benefit from the exchange of information in this meeting.             Funding:  None other than this action.",
