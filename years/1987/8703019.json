 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the organization and local costs of a Brazilian-            American workshop on the physical oceanography of Brazil, to be held            at the University of New Hamsphire in August, 1987.  The workshop was           organized by Dr. Wendell S. Brown of the University of New Hampshire            in collaboration with Dr. Affonso Mascarenhas Jr., of the University            of Sao Paulo, Brazil.  In addition to making possible an enhanced               understanding of Brazilian physical oceanography, the workshop will             enable Brazilian and American researchers in this field to become               mutually acquainted and develop a strategy for future collaborative             research.                                                                                                                                                       Improved knowledge of the circulation along the margin of Brazil                would considerably enhance our understanding of the role of the South           Atlantic in the global scheme of interaction between the oceans and             the atmosphere.  Various phenomena of global significance, such as              equatorial dynamics, surface and subsurface boundary currents, deep             water/shelf interaction, Amazon River outflow/shelf flow interaction,           and estuarine dynamics, occur in this area.  However, the task of               understanding the kinematics, dynamics, and thermodynamics of this              crucial portion of the global ocean is so large that international              collaboration is required.  This workshop will be a first step in               stimulating and defining the areas of such collaborative effort, and            therefore is an important step in improving our understanding of the            geosphere as a whole.",
