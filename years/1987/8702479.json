 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of Prof. Clifford A. Bunton               of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Prof. Laurence              S. Romsted, of Rutgers University, in a program of cooperative                  research with Prof. Frank Quina of the University of Sao Paulo and              Prof. Faruk J. Nome of the Federal University of Santa Catarina,                aimed at determining the range of applicability of the Pseudophase              Ion Exchange (PIE) model for certain effects in chemical                        reactions.  Enhanced understanding of this model can be expected to             lead to further advances in the chemistry of surface reactions.                                                                                                 The PIE model, which describes the effect of ionic amphiphiles on               the rates and equilibria of thermal surface reactions, fails in                 some cases probably because of certain assumptions about the                    structures and electrical properties of the surfaces on which the               reaction takes place.  All four research groups involved in this                study are actively exploring surface charge density effects on                  counterion bonding and reactivity, and in various systems.  Their               complementary expertise will be used to study the limits of the PIE             model.  Each investigator will define a set of experiments using                the systems in which he is expert, and test the model in these                  systems.  Based upon the results of these experiments, improved                 models for the effect of aqueous interfaces on reactions and                    equilibria will be developed.  The synergy to be exploited here is              excellent and will result in considerable mutual benefit to the                 Brazilian and U.S. investigators.",
