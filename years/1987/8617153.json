 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract:  By means of this research equipment grant, a               low angle light scattering photometer will help provide needed                  information in a number of research projects.  Some of these                    include:  i) Accurate determination of molecular weight and                     molecular weight distribution of novel photoresist polymers.                    These polymers are used in the production of integrated circuits                on silicon chips and their properties are affected by their                     molecular weight.  Copolymers which undergo chain scission with                 high yields when bombarded by electrons will be optimized with                  regard to their structure, molecular weight, and distribution.                  ii) A study of the compatibility and diffusion in polymer-polymer               mixtures.  The availability of compatible mixtures should wident                the range of the properties and processability of thermoplastics.               The effect of the approach to the phase separation curve (by                    temperature changes) on the interdiffusion of the two polymers is               examined.  iii) Determination of the interaction parameters of                  polymers with solvents.  In a study of the properties of                        microgels underway, the low angle light scattering photometer                   provides information on both molecular weights and interaction                  parameters that play a major role in the swelling properties of                 hydrophilic gels.  iv) Aggregation of colloidal particles and its               relevance to ceramic processing.  It is believed that the solid                 state properties of solution derived materials depend on the                    state of aggregation in the solution phase.  Aggregation                        kinetics, sol-gel transformation, the effect of composition and                 polymer additives can all be indirectly monitored by total                      intensity scattering which complement other techniques being                    presently pursued.                                                                                                                                              Innovation/Creativity:  One of the uses of the photometer is the                characterization of new photoresist systems.  The aim is to                     produce new systems with enhanced sensitivity, resolution, and                  etch resistance without losing the inherent advantages of                       adhesion, durability, reproducibility, and versatility which                    poly(methyl methacrylate) (the standard photoresist) has shown                  over the years.  In the area of compatible polymer-polymer                      mixtures, major efforts are being undertaken in a number of                     laboratories in the measurements of diffusion coefficients.  Very               little or no information is being gathered, however, on the size                of the diffusing polymer molecules.  Complementary total                        intensity measurements to be obtained with the light scattering                 photometer will provide important concentrations between size and               diffusion coefficient hitherto unavailable.  The characterization               of polymer-solvent interaction which plays a crucial role in the                swelling characteristics of gels and microgels can be readily                   determined from a Zimm-plot of total intensity scattering.  This                information is an important ingredient in developing a general                  framework for the classification of the properties of gels and                  microgels.  Finally in the area of colloidal suspensions, total                 scattered light intensity is used to monitor the effect of                      polymer additives on the stability of the suspensions, the                      deposition of a coating (e.g. silica) on alumina and the sol-gel                transformation of alkoxide gels.",
