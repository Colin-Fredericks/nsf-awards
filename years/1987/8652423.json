 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Teacher Enhancement project is designed to improve the quantity and        the quality of elementary physical science education in the Calcasieu           Parish schools of Louisiana.  The project is comprised of two                   components.  The first is a year long workshop in concepts and                  activities designed to broaden and update the knowledge of physical             science for 60 elementary teachers and 12 principals. The workshop will         also foster the teaching of elementary science in an \"inquiry\" mode.            The second component of the program is a series of eight in-service             activities carried out by the teachers and principals in their                  particular schools, whereby they share with colleagues the knowledge and        teaching expertise which the workshop provided to them.  At the end of          two years, there will be a teacher/teacher or teacher/principal team in         each of the thirty six elementary schools in the Parish which will              provide both formal and informal leadership in the teaching of physical         science.  All principals in the Parish will also participate in an              inservice program focused on the role of the principal as an                    instructional leader in the teaching of science.                                                                                                                Participants in the project will have ample opportunities to actively           engage in science activities and develop and plan appropriate science           lessons and units which are consistent with the curriculum in the Parish        schools.   Elementary science supervisors and college staff will assist         the participants in both implementation of inquiry science within their         classrooms and the development of the inservice programs for the staff.         Videotaping facilities will be available to participants for                    self-evaluation of their classroom instruction and their inservice              programs.   The PI has developed a sound evaluation model to assess the         impact of the project.  The school districts, parent-teacher groups and         McNeese State University are supporting the project beyond the funding          provided through the NSF grant.                                                                                                                                 The PI and staff are eminently qualified to conduct this project, having        been involved for some time in teacher enhancement activities in science        education.  An Advisory Committee comprised of representatives of the           constituencies involved will provide direction to the project and assist        in the assessment of its impact.",
