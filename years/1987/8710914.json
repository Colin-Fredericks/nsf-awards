 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop a simple but realistic              three-dimensional model for nonlinear analysis of lowrise wood-framed           buildings subjected to earthquake loading.  The new model will help             understand the seismic performance of such buildings by predicting such         characteristics as strength deformation, ductility and damage potential.        The study will lead to a static analysis model for monotonic or cyclic          loading, providing a starting point for subsequent dynamic analyses.                                                                                            A macro-element developed for representing the inplane behavior of wood         diaphragms will be used to model a majority of lowrise wood-framed              buildings.  Available test results, possibly from James Cook University,        Australia, and elsewhere will be used to verify this model.  Various            building configurations will be analyzed.  The computer program will            help evaluate the previous simple methods of seismic analysis, and also         the designing of various building configurations.                                                                                                               A great majority of the lowrise buildings are light wood-framed                 buildings for which a reliable tool for the prediction of three-                dimensional behavior is nonexistent.  The study will lead to improved           design standards and design methods which in turn will reduce the dollar        loss of this major class of existing buildings in the event of                  earthquakes.                                                                                                                                                    The Principal Investigator is a leader in the field and is expected to          make significant contribution to this important subject.                                                                                                        An award is recommended.",
