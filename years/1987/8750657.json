 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department has undertaken an extensive program of modernization and         extension of its entire laboratory program.  The major theme of the             project is the development of skills related to the acquisition,                display, analysis, and interpretation of measured data.  Instrumentation        and microcomputers typical of modern research and industrial                    laboratories are being introduced.  This project, as the next major             step, involves 1) the installation of microcomputers in the mechanics           laboratories with direct interfacing to photogates for airtrack                 experiments.  A pilot project last years with one set-up proved very            successful.  2) the introduction of modern oscilloscopes for experiments        on sound, AC circuits with reactance, and time-dependent DC circuits.  A        new experiment will be based on the oscilloscope itself.  Now in its            sixth year, the modernization program will be completed in another 4            years.",
