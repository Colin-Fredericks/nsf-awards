 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an expedited award to assist in the Japanese Technology            Evaluation (JTECH) program.  The JTECH program began at NSF about four          years ago, and has the purpose of examining selected areas of                   technology where the Japanese appear to pose a significant threat to            US economic competitiveness.  To date, seven technologies have been             examined, including for example, telecommunications hardware, computer          science, advanced scientific computing, robotics, and biotechnology.            The reports of the JTECH panels have received widespread circulation,           and summaries have been published in a variety of technical magazines.          The JTECH program is now entering a third phase, with funding in                excess of $400,000, from NSF, DARPA, and the Department of Commerce.            The research to be performed by this study is on the process of                 performing studies of the JTECH type.  This study will be done in real          time with feedback that could improve the quality of the product                significantly.  The project is intended to explore a number of issues           that relate to the conduct and dissemination of JTECH-type studies.             Issues to be addressed include the assessment methodology itself, the           process of choosing technologies to study, methods for reducing the             costs of studying each technology, dissemination of results, and                institutionalization of studies of this sort.",
