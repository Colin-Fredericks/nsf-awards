 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most useful results in scheduling theory is the                      minimisation of flowtime on a single machine by the SPT, shortest               processing time first, rule.  Many important problems can be viewed as          direct extensions of this basic model:  These include various                   deterministic and stochastic scheduling problems, as well as problems           in the control of single server, multiple server and networks of                queues.  Most of these problems are very complicated and do not have            \"nice\", algorithmically calculable, optimal solutions.  This research           will investigate a new class of heuristics which provide approximate            solutions for these problems, and new ways to assess their                      effectiveness.  The research is based on two main ideas:  The first is          the calculation of appropriate dynamic priority indices to replace              SPT.  Such indices have the form of average reward per unit time                maximized over stopping times, and generalize the Gittins index used            in bandit problems.  The second idea is a conjecture that SPT or other          priority rules only fail to be optimal because of marginal phenomena            or end effects, and therefore they can be shown to be close to                  optimal.  It is expected that this research will show that these                relatively simple rules have a turnpike property - for most states              they give the optimal action.",
