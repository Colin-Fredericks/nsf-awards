 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds for continuation, for a period of 24               months, the cooperative research by Dr. Bruce W. Nelson, Professor of           Environmental Sciences, University of Virginia, and Dr. Zelina                  Ibrahim, Department of Environmental Sciences, Universiti Pertanian             Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia, on the geochemistry of the Klang River            estuary, begun under NSF Grant No. INT8411319.  Their study will                provide new kinds of information on a tropical estuarine system and             the processes that govern element behavior in estuaries.                                                                                                        The research will include a study of the behavior of silica and trace           metals in the freshwater-saltwater mixing zone.  Previous research              results show that a limited range of pollutants is concentrated in the          sediments of the estuary.  An attempt will be made to determine if              these pollutants are easily incorporated into the food chain, reach             the sea, and are factors in marine pollution.  The role of adsorption           and desorption of silica as a function of salinity in the mixing zone           and transport to the sea also will be studied.  The U.S. and Malaysian          collaborators are highly respected scientists whose past collaboration          has resulted in a number of publications.  This project is relevant to          the objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program which             seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. scientists and          engineers and their counterparts in developing countries through the            exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and           through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.",
