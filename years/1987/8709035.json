 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plasma-surface interactions play an important role in a variety         of industrial applications of plasma physics, including plasma                  deposition and etching, surface modification by plasma ion                      implantation, plasma switching devices, and the use of thermal plasmas          for materials processing and metallurgy, as well as in plasma                   diagnostics using probes.  A fundamental understanding of the                   interaction of the plasma with the surface is required in order to              optimize and develop these techniques to their fullest potential.               This grant will involve a theoretical and numerical investigation of            plasma-surface interactions, sheaths, and pre-sheaths (both steady-             state and time-dependent) using a kinetic description.  In particular,          the role of Coulomb collisions and ion-neutral interactions in                  affecting the flow of plasma to surfaces, the energy distribution of            the ions arriving at the surface, and the establishment of long-range           electric fields in the plasma as well as the electric field in the              sheath itself, will be investigated.  It is planned to utilize a                kinetic description in order to connect to existing collisionless and           fluid models for plasma-flow to the surface.  The work on time                  dependent effects will focus on RF sheaths and pre-sheaths when the             applied frequency is above and below the ion plasma frequency.  This            work will be jointly supported by the Interfacial, Thermodynamics, and          Transport Program within the CBTE Division.",
