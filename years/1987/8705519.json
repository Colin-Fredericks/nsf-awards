 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will allow the PI to do two years of ethnographic fieldwork          in Highland New Guinea.  The research will compare the roles of women           and men in ritual and in exchange and hostilities. The hypothesis to be         tested is that where women have more roles to play in exchange and              ritual, their formal social status is higher relative to the status of          men.  This research will measure gender status variations in behavioral         as well as ideological terms, as compared with gender variations in the         provisioning of exchange.  The groups to be studied are the southern Min        peoples of Western Province, Papua New Guinea, an area where many               comparative studies exist for this research to build upon.  The                 importance of this research lies in the light it will shed on the               sources of gender inequality.  In order to understand why women are             treated differently than men in our own society, we need to understand          how, why, and when they are trearted more and less equally in other             societies.",
