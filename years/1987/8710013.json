 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NBER Summer Institute brings together economists from universities,         government and international organizations for a few days or a few              weeks of seminars, workshops, conferences, and collaborative research.          Last year's Summer Institute included 316 economists from 94                    universities and academic institutions.  Similar numbers are expected           for the 1987 Summer Institute funded by this grant.                                                                                                             The Summer Institute provides a unique opportunity for economists to            work closely with others in their areas of specialty for extended and           generally intense periods of research.  Although numerous conferences           permit researchers a few hours in which to exchange ideas, only NBER's          Summer Institute lasts long enough to allow serious collaboration               among economists from several institutions.  While there are, of                course, presentations of work nearing completion, emphasis is placed on         the \"workshop\" aspects of the program, where new ideas are raised,              preliminary research ideas are developed, and plans for joint or                coordinated research efforts are established.                                                                                                                   The Summer Institute is organized into six programs: economic                   fluctuations, financial markets and monetary economics, international           studies, labor studies, productivity, and taxation.  Each program has           its own group of participants and its own structure.  Although there is         considerable variation among the programs, a typical Summer Institute           program will last for one to three weeks, with seminars each                    morning and afternoon devoted to individual research.  Some programs            conclude with a more formal conference.  Programs may include a variety         of subjects or they may be organized around specific topics.  Workshops         are also planned on supercomputers and data archives.",
