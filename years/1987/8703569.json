 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Pinkham will study the m-regularity of smooth                    varieties in projective space via generic projection, and also                  the equations of canonical curves.  Professor Friedman will                     continue to investigate Donaldson's new invariants for smooth 4-                manifolds, especially elliptic surfaces and their blow-ups.  The                associate Principle Investigator Professor Morrison will study                  the slopes of effective divisors on the moduli space of stable                  curves, the stability of projective varieties via its state                     polytopes and the volume of simplices in spaces of constant                     curvature in terms of its dihedral angles along codimension two                 faces.  The post doctoral assistant Dr. Cutkosky will study the                 birational geometry of threefolds concentrating on the analysis                 of the divisorial contraction of extremal rays.  Finally the post               doctoral assistant Dr. O'Grady will study the Kodaira dimension                 of the moduli space of polarized K3 surfaces of large degree.                        All of these topics are intermingled facets of the subject                 of algebraic geometry, the study of the geometric objects                       obtained as solution sets of systems of polynomial equations.                   The concentration in this proposal is on the geometric and                      topological aspects of these objects.  This is an especially                    important area of modern mathematics with widespread                            applications.  There is a rich mixture of young and mature                      investigators on this grant which will give the research an extra               strength through their communication.  There is a lot of promise                in this research, much of which will surely be realized.",
