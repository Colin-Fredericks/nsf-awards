 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will examine the premise that the decrease in sediment                load in the Colorado River observed during the 1940's was due to                the reduction of grazing and the increased use of conservation                  practices during the 1920's and 30's.                                                                                                                           The project will study the geomorphic changes in tributary                      channels in the Colorado River basin with the idea that once the                stored alluvium has been removed from the tributary valleys the                 sediment and salinity production will decrease.  The protection                 of these sites from future remobilization through channel                       incision and arroyo formation may thus prevent further increases                in sediment and salt loads.                                                                                                                                     Results from this study will greatly benefit federal and state                  agencies with responsibilities in land and natural resources                    management, as well as being of signifcant economic value to the                U.S. Western States.",
