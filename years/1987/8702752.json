 "awd_abstract_narration": "The equivalence problems for various types of finite transducers,               pushdown automata, and pushdown transducers are being investigated.             The research being done on these problems is expected to contribute to          the eventual solution of the famous equivalence problem for                     deterministic pushdown automata.  Two entirely different techniques for         proving the decidability of equivalence problems are being used.  The           first one, called the \"test-set approach\" has already been successfully         applied: the principal investigator in collaboration with J. Karhumaki          used it to solve the (previously open) equivalence problem for two              classes of finite transducers.  The second method based on the                  \"synchronizability conjecture\" is intended for DPDAs and deterministic          pushdown transducers.                                                                                                                                           The PI is also continuing his investigations in cellular automata and           systolic systems.                                                                                                                                               The PI is a leading world figure in the solving of difficult                    decidability questions.  He has recently produced solutions to related          problems and is as likely as anyone to solve the difficult problems             proposed.",
