 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            established to provide support to strengthen the research environments          and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions that have               substantial minority student populations.  Eligible institution must            also have graduate programs in science or programs in engineering.              Funding is provided for faculty research in fields of science and               engineering supported by the Foundation and for the acquisition of              research instrumentation.  Hampton University will use RIMI support to          establish a physics research group to study theoretical intermediate            energy (Nuclear/Particle) on few-body and many-body systems.  The               project will focus on the quark content in the nuclear force, nuclear           physics with antiprotons, and relativistic effects in these systems.            Techniques such as field theory, coupled channels, hybrid models, and           quark exchange diagrams will be employed to explore the long, medium,           and short-range pieces of the Nucleon-Nucleon and Nucleon-Antinucleon           interactions.                                                                                                                                                   Phase shifts and cross sections will be obtained and predictions with           respect to the empirically obtained Nucleon-Nucleon phase shifts and            many-body cross sections will be made.  The principal investigator is           a well trained theoretical physicist who has performed research at              several Federal laboratories.  The Foundation has supported this                project because minorities will have opportunities to participate in            meritorious theoretical physics research at Hampton University and at           the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF).",
