American experts are               required to travel to Turkey to work with their counterpart researchers         to detail the cooperative work plans implementing the recommendations of        the Joint Workshop on Earthquake Engineering and Seismological Network,         held in Istanbul in September 1985.                                                                                                                             The effort would lead to a realization of projects which could benefit          not only the U.S. and Turkey but also the world-wide community of               earthquake engineering.",
