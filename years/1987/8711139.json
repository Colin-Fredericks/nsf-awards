 "awd_abstract_narration": "Initial application of mean-field theory to atomic                      collisions has indicated that it handles well some of the                       difficulties encountered in basis expansion techniques for ion-                 atom scattering.  Some of the strengths of the theory are (i)                   that it provides intuitive pictures for model development and                   mechanism elucidation, (ii) the ease with which continuum                       intermediate states are included, and (iii) the fact that many-                 body effects are included in the transition matrix elements.                            Since the initial results were so encouraging, it is                    proposed to broaden the generality and scope of this technique                  to make it applicable to a wider variety of problems.  A proper                 framework has been developed and tested to provide                              instantaneous coupling from the quantum electronic degrees of                   freedom to the classical nuclear degrees of freedom.  When this                 has been incorporated into the ion-atom collision program, and                  some three-dimensional capability has been developed, it will                   be possible to address a variety of topics such as chemical                     reactions and ion-surface scattering, in addition to problems                   in low-energy (adiabatic) ion-atom charge exchange.                                     This research group will apply its well-established                     techniques for numerical solution of the time-dependent                         Schrodinger equation to obtain a better understanding of the                    interaction between an atom or ion and a metal surface.  The                    objective of the proposed work is to bring together state-of-                   the-art descriptions for the time-dependent behavior of the                     atom (TDHF), the trajectory (CQC) and the surface (jellium) to                  obtain the best available description of atom-surface                           interactions.  The group is uniquely qualified to make                          significant contributions to charge exchange scattering from                    surfaces in a relatively short time.  This research effort                      should provide reliable values for some of the parameters used                  in current models, guidance as to the range of validity of                      certain models, and intuitive pictures for thinking about the                   atom-surface interaction.",
