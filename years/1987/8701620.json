 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evidence from young primates indicates that even a brief period of              separation from the mother or other attachment figure can have a number         of physiological consequences for the infant.  These effects include            increases in sympathetic activity, changes in neurotransmitter levels,          and increased activity of a neuroendocrine system associated with               stress--the pituitary-adrenal system.  In the past, it has been possible        to study such questions only in primates because other commonly studied         species (e.g., laboratory rodents) were not thought to show true                infant-mother attachment.  With the expense of primate research, the            increasing demand for primate subjects, and the dwindling populations of        wild primates, an alternative animal model would be beneficial.  It             appears that guinea pig mothers and infants may display a \"true\"                attachment.  Moreover, both infant and mother guinea pigs exhibit               activation of the pituitary-adrenal system during brief (30 minutes)            separation.  The studies in the current research will further explore           this question.  Several issues will be addressed within this research,          including the ontogeny of the separation response, the effect of                environmental variables in determining responsiveness, and the                  specificity of the mother's response to infant separation.  These               studies will contribute to our understanding of the consequences of             mother-infant separation and the processes of attachment and elucidate          the nature of the stress response in young animals.",
