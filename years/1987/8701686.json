The program is designed to enable U.S.                  scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research              institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well          as Japan, Australia and New Zealand.  Exchange awards provide                   opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of          unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental                  conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                                                Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to             his/her field of science, the prospective potential of the applicants           for professional growth, as well as criteria relevant to the furthering         of international cooperation in science and engineering.  The program           is particularly directed to scientists and engineers who are embarking          on their research careers.                                                                                                                                      This project addresses questions of the fundamental understanding of            the magnetic recording process.  Specifically, the work will entail the         utilization of miniature transducers which include a micro-inductive            sensor (micro-loop) and a magnetoresistive gradiometer (MRG) which were         fabricated using microlithography.  These devices will be applied to            the study of a flexible medium magnetic recording system.                                                                                                       The project is under the direction of Dr. Ronald S. Indeck, Research            Assistant, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of                  Minnesota at St. Paul MN, and Professor Shun-ichi Iwasaki, Director,            Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tokohu University,              Sendai, Japan.                                                                                                                                                  This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,              international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents                  allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat            administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
