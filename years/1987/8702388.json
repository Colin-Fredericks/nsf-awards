 "awd_abstract_narration": "The plan here is to develop an in vivo model to study the                       regulation of synthesis and secretion of hormones by the                        hypothalamus, the interacting region of the brain that regulates                many of the growth and reproductive functions of the pituitary                  gland. The regulation of the hormone (LHRH) controlling the                     release of pituitary luteinizing hormone (regulates many aspects                of gonad function and the reproductive cycle) is the particular                 focus of this research effort. The model will allow examination                 of the neural connections and transmission of neurally derived                  hormones throughout the circulation from the hypothalamus to the                pituitary gland. The experiments involve electron microscopy with               computer-assisted image enhancement and immunological staining                  techniques to identify the secretory neurons in the hypothalamus.               Companion experiments will employ specific pharmacological agents               and electrical stimulations to modify synthesis and secretion. A                most critical set of experiments deal with the regulation of the                hormones involved in the ovulatory surge in female rats. Another                set of studies focuses on the LHRH secreting neurons in normal                  and castrated male and female rats to evaluate acute and chronic                alterations in LHRH synthesis and secretion in androgen and                     estrogen deprived animals.                                                                                                                                      The results of this research should lead to new understandings of               how the brain controls reproductive functions. The techniques to                be used are novel and will be useful to others studying any                     aspect of the neural control of pituitary gland function.",
