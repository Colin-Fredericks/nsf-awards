An award of $2,500 will be given to a teacher recommended             by the NASEA Awards Committee in each of five geographical regions              each year.  NSF will support eight such awards over a period of two             years.                                                                                                                                                          b)Outstanding Awards are made to successful nominees for a Field                Research Expedition.  Six awards of $2,000 each are to be made to               teachers in the Northwest region.                                                                                                                               2)Production of a Promising Practices and Practitioners Publication.            This will be a compilation of successful science lessons that                   teachers in Native American schools have developed.  The grant will             cover the cost of assembling the material, preparing a 174-page                 booklet, and distributing 1000 copies to teachers in Native American            schools.",
