The computer-aided radio telemetry          equipment also is providing advanced  undergraduate research                    opportunities in the disciplines of ethology and ecology, providing             undergraduate access, experience, and familiarity with the equipment.                                                                                           The animal behavior and ecology topics that are being developed for             incorporation into the Department's laboratory course work and                  undergraduate research include home range, territoriality, habitat              preferences and partitioning, cyclic activity patterns (circadian and           seasonal), dispersal patterns, refugia selection, social organization,          and the effects of age, season, and sex on any or all of the above.",
