 "awd_abstract_narration": "Xavier University will upgrade and update the x-ray physics component of        the atomic physics laboratory program taken by physics, applied physics,        and physics concentration education majors.  By replacing an aging and          obsolete x-ray tube power supply with a modern, high-power, highly              stabilized and regulated DC high-voltage power supply for the generation        of x-rays, significant improvements in x-ray diffraction experiments            using cameras and diffractometrers will be achieved.  By adding a timer         and a counter to the data acquisition system and interfacing system to a        computer, students will be able to perform experiments using modern             digital techniques.  The new power supply and new instrumentation will          improve the way students perform existing experiments:  Bragg                   diffraction, back-Laue reflection, and diffractometry.  In addition it          will make possible new experiments, for example the measurement of x-ray        line intensities and intensity ratios and the study of line shapes and          fine structure, as well as the computerizing of data acquisition in all         experiments.  Finally, the new instrumentation will provide a reliable          x-ray system for student research projects.",
