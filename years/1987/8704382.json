 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robinson proposes to continue observations of cataclysmic                       variable stars with the help of post-doctoral associate Allen                   Shafter.  Photometry of eclipse-type light variations will be                   used to learn about accretion disks.  Photometry of rapid light                 variations will probably be interpreted in terms of dynamic                     phenomena at the edges of accretion disks.  Spectroscopy will                   yield radial velocities.  Careful subsidiary measurements will be               needed to establish just what part of the binary system the                     velocities refer to.  Some additional projects are listed.                                                                                                      Many stars occur in pairs, moving around each other in hours or                 days.  As they age, one star may lose mass to the other,                        sometimes in highly dramatic and explosive fashion.  This program               is to observe one category of such binary stars with mass                       transfer, called cataclysmic variables.  They consist of an                     ordinary and an Earth-sized star plus a disk of gas slowly                      swirling toward the latter.  These systems are the most                         observable of the mass-transferring binaries.  Their observation                will lay the groundwork for understanding the more complex and                  more explosive systems.",
