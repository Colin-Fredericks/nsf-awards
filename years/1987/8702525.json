 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal aims at laying a genetic foundation for analysis of the           fidelity of DNA replication in yeast.  The proposed experiments will            begin with the isolation and structural characterization of the mut7            gene.  The gene is defined by one allele (mut7-1) that causes                   temperature-sensitive growth and a five-fold increase in the frequency          of spontaneous mutation.  Preliminary attempts to isolate this gene by          complementation have led to the isolation of another gene, smu-7, which         can suppress the lethal effect of mut7-1 at high temperature.  This             gene will be further characterized, and the regulation of both genes            will be studied.  The genetic alteration in the mut7-1 will also be             determined.  Other mutations with a mutator phenotype will be isolated          using a mutant yeast strain that takes up and incorporates base                 analogues into DNA.  These mutations will be identified by selecting            for (increased) reversion of auxotrophic markers.                               As yet, relatively little is known about the enzymes that replicate             chromosomal DNA in eukaryotic organisms.  Extensive investigation of            DNA synthesis in E. coli and other prokaryotes has shown that the               frequency of errors during replication is remarkably low.  This is due          to \"proof reading\"  by the DNA polymerase and by DNA repair enzymes;            both can detect differences (mis-matches) between the new and old               strands of DNA.  The proposed study will begin a detailed analysis of           genes whose products appear to effect repair of mismatched DNA.                 Because some repair functions in bacteria are intimately involved with          the DNA replication, it is likely that the proposed work will lead to a         better understanding of replication in yeast and in other eukaryotes.",
