 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spillage of gasoline and other petroleum derived hydrocarbons is                a major source of ground water contamination.  One potentially                  effective tool for restoring gasoline contaminated aquifers is                  stimulation of the native microorganisms to use the hydrocarbons                as a food source.  This is typically accomplished by circulating                ground water containing oxygen or hydrogen peroxide and inorganic               nutrients through the formation using injection and production                  wells or infiltration galleries.                                                                                                                                At present there are over a dozen documented cases where                        enhancement of the indigenous population has been attempted to                  clean up aquifers contaminated by hydrocarbons and related                      organic compounds (Lee et al., 1986).  In general subsurface                    biorestoration has been found to be effective although not always               reliable.  The major problem with the technique appears to be in                the design of the physical facilities, particularly in                          heterogeneous, low permeability formations where circulation of                 the oxygen-nutrient mixture is difficult.                                                                                                                       The research described in this proposal is aimed at developing a                numerical model capable of simulating the subsurface                            biorestoration process. Once completed, the model could be used                 by designers to determine the optimum location and spacing of                   wells, flow rates and nutrient mixtures.  The proposed research                 will involve: 1) operation of a series of chemostats to determine               microbial kinetic parameters and identify the optimum nutrient                  mixture; 2) operation of laboratory column microcosms to study                  the dynamics of biorestoration in a one dimensional flow system;                3) development of equations for simulating the biorestoration                   process; and 4) numerical solution and testing of the quations.",
