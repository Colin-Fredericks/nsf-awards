 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support participation by six Latin American                     and Caribbean scientists in the Ninth Biennial International                    Estuarine Research Conference, to be held October 25 - 29,                      1987 in New Orleans.  Among the six keynote theme sessions of                   the conference is \"Subtropical and Tropical Estuaries of                        Latin America and the Gulf of Mexico\"; this session is                          co-organized by Prof. John W. Day, Jr., of Louisiana State                      University, Baton Rouge, and Dr. Alejandro Yanez-Arancibia,                     of the Institute of Marine Sciences and Limnology, National                     University of Mexico.  The six scientists supported by this                     grant will present papers at this session and participate in                    other relevant sessions.                                                                                                                                        The other keynote sessions of the conference are: the                           importance of marshes to estuaries; responses of estuaries to                   atmospheric processes; mechanisms of recruitment of estuarine                   organisms; and comparisons of key processes among major                         estuaries.  In these sessions as well, regional comparisons                     will be highlighted, with particular emphasis on subtropical                    and tropical estuaries in North and South America.  Expanded                    participation of Latin American scientists in the conference                    will contribute significantly to this comparative approach,                     since current research in that region is still not well                         represented in the international literature. The themes                         addressed by the conference are of particular importance to                     the coastal countries of the sponsored scientists, and they                     will also benefit from new contacts with U.S. researchers.                      Papers from this meeting will be published in a special issue                   of the journal Estuaries.  Participating scientists from the                    U.S., Latin America and the Caribbean are expected to benefit                   not only from the knowledge to be exchanged about coastal                       ecosystems, management issues, and aquaculture, but also from                   the stimulation of new professional interactions and the                        strengthening of existing relationships.",
