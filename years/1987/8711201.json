 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Dr. Lambert and his colleagues to study the                  effect of diet on bone composition. They will raise laboratory                  rats on each of several selected test diets and then analyze the                elemental content of their bone. Test diets will include those                  with substantial components of meat, corn, wheat, nuts, dairy                   products, leafy vegetables, starch and fish. Multivariate                       analysis will be performed on the data obtained in order to                     define both food and skeletal profiles for the various types of                 diets used. Through collaboration, analogous data will be                       obtained on both rare earth elements and stable isotopes.                                                                                                       This protocol will allow the reseachers to address three                        questions: How are elemental levels in diet translated to                       elemental levels in bone?; in this context which elements                       interact, either antagonistically or synergistically?; can a                    multielement profile specify several components in the diet?                                                                                                    Archaeologists attempt to reconstruct past lifeways and one key                 aspect of this involves past subsistence techniques. Because many               materials, such as plant remains, are poorly preserved in the                   archaeological record past diet is extremely difficult to                       determine. Human skeletal remains are often recovered in the                    course of archaeological excavation and analysis indicates that                 these bones appear to preserve dietary information. For example                 levels of strontium seem inversely correlated with proportion of                meat in the diet. However it is not understood just what these                  relations are. For this reason Dr. Lambert's research is of great               archaeological significance It may provide researchers with an                  important new tool.",
