The program is designed to enable U.S.                  scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research              institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well          as Japan, Australia and New Zealand.  Exchange awards provide                   opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of          unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental                  conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                                                Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to             his/her field of science, the prospective potential of the applicants           for professional growth, as well as criteria relevant to the furthering         of international cooperation in science and engineering.  The program           is particularly directed to scientists and engineers who are embarking          on their research careers.                                                                                                                                      This research project addresses research related to the measurement and         computation of three-dimensional viscous flow in supersonic and                 transonic turbomachinery rotors, a study of rotor/stator interaction in         high speed turbomachines, and flow field using a laser transit                  anemometer as well as other higher response probes.  The computation            will involve the solution of a set of eleven partial differential               equations governing the flow field in this device.                                                                                                              The project is under the direction of Professor Budugur                         Lakshminarayana, Department of Aerospace Engineering, The Pennsylvania          State University, University Park, PA 16802, U.S.A., and Professor              H. E. Gallus, Director, Institut fuer Strahlantriebe und                        Turboarbeitsmaschinen, Rhein-Westfalische Technische Hochschule,                Templergraben 55, 5100 Aachen, Federal Republic of Germany.                                                                                                     This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,              international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents                  allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat            administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
