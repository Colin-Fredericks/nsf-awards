 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Limnology's Trout Lake Station provides                     access to Wisconsin's Northern Highlands Lake District, a region                with one of the densest concentrations of lakes in the world.                   Aquatic systems within the Highlands include a broad range of                   trophic, hydrologic and edaphic conditions ranging from temporary               forest ponds to large lakes.  Many of these systems lie within                  protected, uninhabited watersheds.  Research at the station has                 an extensive history and in the last two decades has grown and                  diversified dramatically.  Current programs include several                     multi-investigator, ecosystem-level projects focused on long-term               ecological research, lake acidification and cascading trophic                   interactions.  Additional, smaller-scale projects concern                       population, community and behavioral ecology, groundwater                       hydrology and basic limnology.                                                       This project will provide equipment to improve the station's               capacities in three core areas:  capabilities for real-time                     sensing of the land and aquatic environments, basic analytical                  facilities for chemical and biological parameters, and controlled               environmental systems for experimental analyses.  Improvements in               these areas will add significantly to the general utility of the                Trout Lake Station as a center for aquatic research and will                    directly assist several major programs that are currently under                 way at the Station.  Specifically, the funds will be used to                    purchase 1) a land- and water-based climatic station, 2) a                      research-quality spectrophotometer, and 3) a portable, shoreside                aquarium-microcosm facility.",
