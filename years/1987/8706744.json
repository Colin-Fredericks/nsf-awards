 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Y. Kim and his coworkers have been at the                     forefront of research on the few-nucleon problem for twenty                     years.  They have played a major role in the calculation of the                 properties of few-nucleon systems beginning with well-defined                   Hamiltonians.  Professor Kim proposes a large and varied research               program centered around three-nucleon physics, both bound-state                 and scattering calculations.  The trinucleon continuum-state                    calculations are of great interest and importance, both to other                theorists and to experimentalists, regarding the data to be                     obtained from proposed experiments.  Research concerning                        photodisintegration and radiative capture, meson-exchange                       currents and three-nucleon forces, quark degrees of freedom in                  nuclei and relativistic light and heavy-ion collisions is also                  planned.                                                                                Professor Y. Kim has been a leader in the analysis of the               three-nucleon problem and has recently moved to quark-cluster                   models of light nuclei.  He now proposes an extensive research                  program which would refine his previous work on the structure of                the three-nucleon bound state using a baryons only model.  Most                 importantly he plans to perform calculations of the trinucleon                  continuum states.  The results of such calculations are needed                  for comparison with proposed experiments at the major nuclear                   physics accelerator centers.  He also proposes theoretical                      investigations of the effects of quark degrees of freedom                       associated with few-nucleon systems and light nuclei.  Numerous                 important and useful results will come from this research.",
