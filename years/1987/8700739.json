 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insect cell tissue cultures can potentially be used for the production          of viral insecticides and for the production of proteins obtained from          recombinant DNA that can not be made in bacterial or yeast cells.  A            practical large scale insect tissue culture system is not yet available         and if it were, it could have immense economic implications for the             production of the above materials.  This proposal seeks to develop a            novel bioreactor suitable for the cultivation of insect cells that is           also amenable to scale-up while providing a high level of control over          the microenvironment.                                                                                                                                           The proposed work is truly innovative and novel and meets the criteria          for Expedited Awards for Novel Research (see attached AD/ENG Bulletin           No. 85-25).  The PIs are considered to be quite capable of carrying out         the proposed research and I strongly recommend that this proposal be            funded in accordance with the budget submitted with the proposal.",
