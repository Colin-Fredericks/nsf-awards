 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of Professor Michael Saks                 at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey in New Brunswick.                It is a twenty four month standard grant made by the Algebra and                Number Theory Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences                  and the Theoretical Computer Science Program in the Division of                 Computer Research.                                                                   Professor Saks is a young mathematician who has burst onto                 the scene with his very important results which lie on the border               between combinatorics and theoretical computer science.  His work               in the recent past dealt with existence theorems on partially                   ordered sets that were motivated by problems in the theory of                   searching and sorting algorithms.  Some of his results were                     spectacular.  In his current proposal he moves even more toward                 problems in combinatorics whose origin lies in computer science.                He plans to analysize certain questions in distributed computing:               the performance of tasks by a set of individual processors acting               independently and communicating over some network.  A critical                  issue for such distributed systems is reliabililty, that is, to                 design the system so that it still works even when some of the                  computers are faulty.  This important research will undoubtably                 pay rich dividends.",
