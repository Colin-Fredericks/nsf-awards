 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been twenty years between the assessment of the state of                 the fields of science and engineering policy by Skolnikoff and                  that of the AAAS Committee on Science and Public Policy in 1986.                Both science and science policy changed during this period, as                  has the demand for science policy analysts.  New directions may                 be needed in the education of individuals for science and                       engineering policy analysis.                                                    This workshop will bring together the heads of leading academic                 centers in science and engineering policy, along with individuals               from emerging programs, from the \"user\" community, and from the                 community of employers of science policy analysts.  They will                   discuss the extent to which they believe they share a common                    purpose and will, if indicated, develop contact mechanisms among                them.  They will examine curriculum with intent of bringing                     greater substantive coherence to the field.",
