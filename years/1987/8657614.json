 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator award includes three areas                 of research:                                                                                                                                                    1.  Selectivity control with ultramicroporous materials.  This                  effort concentrates on the design, fabrication, and application                 of inorganic-oxide-modified carbon molecular sieves.  These                     composite materials have the molecular sieving properties of                    polymer-derived carbon and the high surface areas and other                     properties of inorganic oxides such as silica, alumina, titania,                or zirconia.  The initial project is to prepare a catalyst system               to produce gasoline-range hydrocarbons from syngas (carbon                      monoxide and hydrogen) by incorporating sites that catalyze                     Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and hydrocracking inside an envelope of               sieve.  A model will be developed to describe the coupled mass                  transfer and chemical kinetics in this system.  The model and the               physical system will then be redesigned iteratively to locate the               optimal system for this purpose.                                                                                                                                2.  Advanced catalytic materials.  The fabrication of porous                    piezoelectric materials is being studied;  these may be useful                  both as catalysts and as catalyst supports for the activation of                saturated hydrocarbons.  Also, the physical and electronic                      structure of the active site on the surface of rhodium-molybdenum               on alumina is under investigation;  this very active                            heterogeneous catalyst appears to chemically mimic homogeneous                  rhodium catalysts.                                                                                                                                              3.  Electronic materials processing.  The kinetics and mechanisms               for pyrolytic, photolytic, and catalytic decompositions of                      organometalloid compounds of groups III and V are being studied;                such reactions are central to CVD processes.  Also, a system is                 under design for production of zinc-oxide films by oxidation of                 alkylzinc precursors;  it is hoped this will lead to a method for               the fabrication of two-dimensional superconducting oxides.",
