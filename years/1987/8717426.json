 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the rabbit, most immunoglobulin (Ig) nominal allotypes                  are presumed to be inherited via codominant allelic segregation.                However, latent or non-allelic gene activation has been                         documented for the Ig kappa light and gamma heavy chain gene                    loci.  Serological and structural analyses have confirmed                       the existence of these latent Ig allotypes.  Molecular                          mechanisms acting at the nucleic acid level which allow the                     expression of latent allotypes have yet to be determined.  A                    major obstacle in studying the expression of latent Ig allotypes                has been the inability reproducibly to induce the expression of                 latent Ig molecules.  This obstacle has been circumvented by                    antigenic stimulation using Trypanosoma brucei to induce the                    expression of latent Ig kappa light and gamma heavy chain                       sequences in the rabbit.  Lymph nodes taken from infected rabbits               have been shown to contain poly (A) positive RNA sequences                      encoding latent kappa light and gamma heavy chain allotypes.                    This represents the first time latent allotypes have been                       detected at the nucleic acid level.  The long term objective of                 this investigation is to elucidate molecular and cellular                       mechanisms which generate the expression of nucleic acid                        sequences encoding latent Ig allotypes.  To achieve this the                    following specific aims will be pursued:  Isolation and                         structural analysis of poly (A)-positive RNA sequences encoding:                1) latent b5 and b6 kappa lightchains, 2) the latent a1-e14                     haplotype, 3) the nominal b6 kappalight chain secreted by the                   rabbit-mouse hybridoma cell line, H158.  Isolation of these RNA                 sequences will be achieved by employing standard duplex cDNA                    cloning technology and novel allotype-specific screening                        methodologies.  Isolation of cDNA sequences encoding latent Ig                  allotypes will verify their existence at the nucleic acid level                 and allow direct structural comparisons to be made with their                   nominal allotypic counterparts. Information obtained will be used               in future studies designed to isolate the actively transcribed Ig               kappa and gamma genes encoding these latent sequences.                               These studies will contribute to our overall understanding                 of the regulation of Ig gene expression.",
