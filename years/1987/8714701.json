 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sample surveys are the dominant mode of collecting                         information about developed societies.  In addition, the                        methodology is one of the most frequently employed techniques in                the disciplines of sociology, political science, economics, and                 psychology.  Recent trends in survey-taking have led to an                      increase in the use of the telephone as the means of contacting                 respondents: the increased cost of face-to-face interviewing, the               rapid development of computer-assisted telephone methodology, the               increased coverage of the household population by telephone, and                the development of statistical modeling techniques with social                  science data requiring the collection of more information                       concerning errors of measurement, in contrast to sampling errors.                    The locus of activity in telephone survey methodology has                  spread from the commercial sector, where it began, to both                      academic and governmental sectors.  Geographically, attention has               spread from the United States to most Western European countries                and Australia.  Replications of methodological experiments are                  now taking place in these different environments, and country-                  level differences in results are sometimes appearing.                                Despite these important social science developments                        throughout the world, there are few opportunities for researchers               in this area to interact, and their work is scattered throughout                scores of different journals, research reports, and office                      memoranda.  No conference devoted to the international scope of                 the problems associated with telephone survey research has                      previously been held, and to remedy that situation such a                       conference is now being organized under the joint sponsorship of                the American Association for Public Opinion Research, the                       American Statistical Association, and the International                         Association of Survey Statisticians.                                                 The conference is designed for a multidisciplinary audience,               with support from multiple sources:  government agencies,                       commercial survey firms, private foundations, and registration                  fees.  The National Science Foundation is one contributor to the                total funding picture, along with the U.S. Bureau of the Census,                which has transferred funds to NSF for this purpose.",
