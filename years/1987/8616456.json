 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators propose to continue their current research            on global ionospheric electrodynamics and on plasma waves in the                high latitude ionosphere, the study of global electrodynamics use               incoherent scatter radar observations.  The main topics of this                 program include (1) studies of the latitudinal and day to day                   variations of the low latitude electric fields, (2) the effect of               magnetospheric and disturbance dynamo electric fields at low                    latitudes, (3) equatorial drift and wind studies using joint                    measurements with the Jicamarca radar and the San Marco                         satellite, (4) the study of F-region dynamo electric fields and                 their latitudinal variation, and (5) development of an empirical                model for the latitude electric fields.  The research on plasma                 waves in the high latitude ionosphere consists of mostly analysis               and interpretation of radar interferometer data from Greenland                  and Sweden.  We also intend to continue working on the                          interpretation of in-situ rocket data, and to carry out                         theoretical studies.  The main aspects of this program include                  (1) studies of E-region waves during periods of very large and                  highly variable auroral currents, (2) experimental and                          theoretical studies of the nonlinear saturation of two stream                   waves, particularly at unfavorable magnetic aspect angles, and                  (3) radar and rocket studies of collisional ion cyclotron waves                 at altitudes of about 150 km during periods of very large field                 aligned currents.                                                                       In general the above studies are concerned with motions of              the ionosphere and the presence of waves and other irregularities               in it, which have importance both from the point of view of                     increasing our fundamental understanding of processes occurring                 in ionized gases (making up 99% of the material of the universe)                and of the effects of the propagation of radio waves for                        communication and of the effective operation of radar systems.",
