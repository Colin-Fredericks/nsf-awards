 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advance Comfort Systems (ACS) are technologies which can dynamically            respond to climate fluctuations and occupant variations with purpose of         providing quantum improvements in environmental qualities, human                productivity, and whole building performance.  Of particular interest           are intelligent envelope systems and task comfort systems including             materials, controls, and technological developments related to advance          comfort systems.  Many researchers from a broad range of disciplines            related to comfort technologies and advanced comfort systems have been          isolated from each other and lack a common data base and a forum for            interchange.  A two day workshop on \"Advanced Comfort Systems for the           Work Enviromment in Buildings\" is proposed.  The workshop is planned for        the Spring of 1988, and its major goal is to provide a forum in which           national and international leaders in advanced comfort systems can              present, demonstrate and discuss these early developments and results,          and also to formulate a comprehensive research agenda.  The specific            objectives are:  (1) To establish a broad understanding of the theories         and practices of advanced comfort systems and their interrelationship;          (2) to further converge these diverse fields of research and fragmented         date base; (3) to develop an inclusive approach to research and the             potential affect of such advanced systems on the construction industry          and the occupants in the work environment; (4) to develop a public              agenda for research issues and priorities in this area; and, (5) to             formulate a strategy for continuum interchange and research                     implementation.                                                                                                                                                 The workshop will be organized by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's            Center for Architectural Research and School of Engineering in                  collaboration with an interdisciplinary group of research and practice-         based professionals actively concerned with major advances and                  innovations in building comfort systems.  Leaders from industry,                universities, and research laboratories from the U.S., Japan, and Europe        will be invited to the workshop.                                                                                                                                A comprehensive workshop report will he prepared for appropriate                distribution.                                                                                                                                                   The Principal Investigator has had direct experience in both the                proposed research area and in organizing and sponsoring conferences.            The institutional support is very appropriate and the budget is modest          for effort.                                                                                                                                                     An award is recommended.",
