 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ocean Studies Board of the National Academy of                      Sciences will continue in 1987 its efforts in support of                        planning, review and evaluation of U.S. ocean science research                  programs and related activities.  The OSB has established three                 sub-groups to address issues of interest to the National                        Science Foundation: Arctic Ocean Research, ocean climate                        research, and international ocean science policy.  The Artic                    Ocean group will advise NSF on possible areas of future                         research in the Arctic Ocean and will serve as the primary U.S.                 interface with the international Arctic Ocean Sciences Board.                   The ocean climate research will provide guidance to NSF and                     other Federal agencies regarding the World Climate Research                     Program (WCRP), especially the WCRP studies of interannual                      variability in the tropical ocean and global climate (TOGA) and                 the world ocean circulation experiment (WOCE).                                                                                                                          The international ocean science policy group will consider              long-term ramifications of the steadily increasing                              implementation by foreign countries of the marine scientific                    research provisions of the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea.                 The OSB will also convene small workshops as required; will                     complete its follow-up of major workshops the Board convened in                 FY 1987, such as the workshop on ridge crest processes; and                     will provide support for Federal long-range planning in                         specific scientific areas upon request from NSF and other                       Federal agencies.",
