 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides partial support for a symposium on Ethics and the           Future of Chemistry, to be held in conjunction with the joint meeting           of the American Chemical Society and the Chemical Institute of Canada           in Toronto in June 1988.  The symposium is composed of two half-day             sessions.  The first, \"Chemical Ethics and Public Perception:  Do               Chemists' Transgressions Warrant Serious Concern?\" will examine the             extent of cheating or error in chemistry and public responses to the            dangers it perceives.  The second half-day, \"Ethics and Chemical                Education: Preparing Students to Resolve Ethical Dilemmas,\" will                discuss implicit and explicit approaches to teaching of values and              ethics to chemistry students.  Speakers will be chemists, philosophers          and journalists.  The sessions will devote time to discussion of case           studies and ethical dilemmas by the speakers and the audience.  NSF             funds will support travel and publicity and taping expenses for the             symposium.  Broader coverage, through Chemical and Engineering News,            science journals and newsletters, and other reports and publications,           is also planned.",
