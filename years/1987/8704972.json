 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental study of deformation characteristics of anisotropic solids         such as rocks, timbers, concretes, and composite materials under three-         dimensional loading has special significance to many engineering                disciplines.  Because of some inherent limitation, conventional                 laboratory devices may be inadequate for determining material constants         for desired constitutive laws.  The main objective of this project is           to design and fabricate a High Capacity (30,000 psig) Cubical Device            for three-dimensional testing of aforementioned and other solids.  The          device will consist of four major components:  (1) a rigid cubical              space frame with six end plates (\"pressure chamber\"), (2) a deformation         measuring system, (3) a (hydraulic) loading system, and (4) a data              acquisition system.  The cubical frame and the end plates will be               fabricated locally, while the other components will be procured from            vendors.  Tests along any desired stress path in the three-dimensional          stress space, with any number of loading, unloading, and reloading              sequences, can be performed by the device.  An electronically                   controlled and fully automated loading mechanism, as well as a                  deformation measuring and data acquisition system, would allow testing          under slow cyclic compressive loading.",
