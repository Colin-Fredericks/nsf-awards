 "awd_abstract_narration": "Individuals in various cultures perceive and respond to pain            differently.  While early studies of acute pain have shown how                  cultural ideas of what is pain and how one should act in response               to it varies, no one has yet discovered how culture influences                  perceptions of the intensity of pain in chronic sufferers.  This                research will analyze how individuals learn to respond to pain                  and how their social experience throughout their lives influences               their attitudes, attention and past and present experience with                 pain.  This in turn should affect how different cultures identify               pain intensity.                                                                         The student will work with 200 chronic pain patients from               several ethnic groups at the Pain Control Center at the                         University of Massachusettes.  She will test models of how                      culture affects the psychological and biological response to pain               in each group.                                                                          Chronic pain constitues a serious national health and                   economic problem.  It is estimated that chronic pain affects                    thirty to forty million Americans and that the annual costs in                  health care, medicine, disability compensation, lost wages and                  other related costs is sixty to seventy billion dollars.  This                  research will help alleviate this problem by increasing                         understanding of the role of culture in pain perception.",
