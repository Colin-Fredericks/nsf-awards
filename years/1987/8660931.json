 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal involves the development of a new technique for         the generation of complex three-dimensional structures directly from a          CAD/CAM database without the need for molds or subsequent machining.            The innovation will use independently targeted particles of molten metal        or composite metal to build structures under computer control in much           the same manner that an ink-jet printer produces images.  The structure         would be constructed by \"writing\" multiple cross sections.  Cohesion            between particles would be provided by cold welding or rapid                    solidification. Cemented carbides, stainless steels and aluminum-based          eutectic alloys appear best suited for use in this method.  The basic           innovation has two major subsections: the material injection system and         the material delivery system.  The Phase I research will study various          means of accomplishing the two major subsections, the appropriate               materials to use, the material properties to be imparted, and the               applications to be addressed.                                                   Mathematical models of the various components will be developed to gain         a quantitative understanding of the process parameters and interaction          between the individual components.  The results should provide                  theoretical groundwork and a clearly defined approach for follow-on             research.  Follow-on research plans include developing a complete               engineering design of the system and construction of a working                  prototype.                                                                           This research should lead to a method to generate net shape parts          with unique properties directly from a CAD/CAM database.  Application           should be to various industries including aerospace, electronics and            machine tools. Method should result in decreased lead time and increased        productivity. ***                                                               8707870                                                                         Tsach                                                                                This proposal will investigate a novel robot hand which utilizes           rubber fingers which bend to grasp an object when their internal                pressure is elevated.  The bending of the fingers is accomplished by            employing non-uniform wall thickness in the fingers, and the bending            mechanism is controlled by a single variable (the internal pressure).           Using rubber actuators (fingers) drastically reduces the number of              control variables of the artificial fingers without restricting its             maneuverability.  The novel robot hand should be capable of gripping            objects of various shapes and sizes, applying various grasping modes,           modifying the compliance of the grip, and performing limited object             manipulations.  Preliminary work has shown this approach to be                  attractive.  The proposed research will investigate a design to enable          the base angle of each finger to                                                be controlled independently which should significantly enhance the              object manipulation capabilities of the hand.  The incorporation of             tactile sensing to control the contact forces and gripping compliance           will also be investigated.  This work is needed to determine the                feasibility of these two tasks, which, if successful, can lead to               development of a versatile, multiple grasping robotic hand.  This novel         robot hand should be a far less complex mechanism than other current            approaches, and hence should contribute to improved production                  efficiency.",
