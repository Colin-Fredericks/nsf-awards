 "awd_abstract_narration": "Almost all equipment replacement models assume that replacement                 technology remains constant over time and that replacement decisions            are driven primarily by deterioration of the current equipment.                 However, in areas such as computer hardware and software, robotics,             automatic control, and other electronic technologies, which are                 undergoing rapid technological change, replacements are made to                 upgrade the current system, as well as replace deteriorating                    equipment.  Hence, it is critical to consider the state of the                  currently available replacement technology and the potential for                technological improvements in the near future to make economic                  replacement decisions.  Current replacement models are not well-suited          to this problem.  The objective of this study is to develop a useful            method for analyzing the equipment replacement problem under                    technological change.  Because technological forecasting is costly and          uncertain, the basic approach will be to characterize conditions for            which it is optimal to replace.  These conditions will help the                 decision-maker determine whether forecasting is necessary and will              indicate how sensitive the optimal \"keep\" or \"replace\" decision is to           the accuracy of the forecast.  Means for computing these conditions             will be based on recent results in planning horizons and sensitivity            analysis in dynamic programming.                                                8714696                                                                         Rode                                                                                    Gallium Arsenide and related compound semiconductors have               progressed from the R&D to the production stage where manufacturing             efforts are being planned and carried out.  The processing of these             materials is very different from the processing of Silicon for                  integrated circuits.  This proposal covers a request for support of             the Second U.S. Conference on GaAs Manufacturing Technology.  A                 substantial group of leaders in the field, representing U.S. industry,          universities and government, will meet at this conference.  This                conference will take place October 12-14 at Portland, OR.  This                 conference represents an attempt to integrate university based                  manufacturing studies with industrial manufacturing engineering                 efforts.  NSF support of this interactive role is extremely important.",
