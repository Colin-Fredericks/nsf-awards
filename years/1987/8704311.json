 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a portion of the work of the Arcadia            project.  Arcadia is a major, joint research effort, the aim of which           is to gain fundamental understandings about desirable architectures for         the integration of software tools into environments and particularly in         support of software testing, analysis and evaluation.  Arcadia is an            experimental research project which aims to gain these understandings           through the creation and experimental evaluation of an actual                   environment prototype--Arcadia-1. A key innovative feature of the               approach being taken by Arcadia is to consider software processes to be         items of software themselves and to view an environment as a mechanism          for specifying, compiling and interpreting these processes, using               software tools and software workers as interpretation primitives.                                                                                               Work at the university of California at Irvine on the Arcadia project           will focus on the interrelated areas of software environment                    architectures, user interface management systems, and techniques for            aiding in the development of reliable concurrent and real-time                  software.  The architecture component is concerned with the                     formalization and automation of software development and                        maintenance activities (supporting both product-oriented and process-           oriented views), principles underlying the management of persistent             data objects, tool activation management (including exploitation of             parallelism), and tool integration.  Work in the user interface                 management systems area is aimed at determining appropriate                     abstractions and designs such that concurrency within the system is             maximized, environment extensibility is effectively supported, and              integration with the environment's object management system is                  achieved.",
