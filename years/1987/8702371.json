 "awd_abstract_narration": "Operator theory is a central discipline in Modern Analysis.             Its origins lie in the study of mathematical physics and partial                differential equations in the early twentieth century.  Thus, it                was seen that numerous physical problems in the theory of                       equilibria, vibration, quantum theory, etc. could be studied                    productively via the integral equations that model the phenomena.               So it has been, that from the fertile minds of Hilbert, von                     Neumann, and other giants that the subject of operator theory has               grown to a central position in such investigations, and in core                 mathematics as well.   Also central to Modern Analysis is the                   related discipline of operator algebras in which one studies                    collections of operators simultaneously.  As the mathematical                   construct which best transfers the concepts of probability,                     measure theory, topology, and more recently geometry to                         noncommutative contexts, operator algebras relate to a rich,                    effective, and important array of applications.                                         Professors Bunce, Paschke, Salinas, and Upmeier are all                 leaders in the areas of operator theory and operator algebras,                  and their research group at Kansas is one of the strongest and                  most versatile at any university in the United States.                          Collectively, this group covers a broad span of these                           disciplines.  Professor Bunce has been a major contributor to the               C*-algebra version of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, to abstract                operator theory proper, and to applications in systems theory.                  Professor Salinas has made important contributions to                           C*-algebraic K-theory applied to single operator theory and                     several complex variables.  Professor Paschke has made                          fundamental contributions to the study of concrete C*-algebras in               the context of noncommutative algebraic topology.  Professor                    Upmeier has a deep and penetrating understanding of bounded                     symmetric domains.  He has been a major figure in the study of                  Toeplitz and Hankel operators on these domains.                                         In the current proposal, Bunce will study dilation problems             in operator theory, Bishop's theorem, and operator means and                    inequalities.  Paschke  will work on C*-algebras associated with                discrete groups and will pursue problems dealing with irrational                rotation C*-algebras.  Salinas will continue his research on the                joint behavior of n-tuples of operaors, gaining insight into the                interplay between the spectral and C*-algebraic properties of the               canonical n-tuple for classes of kernel functions.  Upmeier will                investigate a symbol calculus and index theory for multivariable                Toeplitz operaors on pseudoconvex domains in complex n-space.  He               will also study non-type I Toeplitz C*-algebras related to                      automorphic functions and quantum mechanics.  There are three                   postdoctoral mathematicians working with this group in a                        mentorial relationship.  Their interests spread across Lie group                C*-algebras, symplectic geometry, singular foliations,                          holomorphic curves in the Grassmanian, and noncommutative                       integration.",
