 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general purpose of this project is to conduct a pilot study of the          impact of regular education teachers on the performance of mildly               handicapped children in science, mathematics and computer program               development.  A ten day staff development program will provide twelve           regular education elementary teachers with the skills necessary to              conduct the implementation of instruction in science, mathematics and           computer program usage at two schools.  After training, the regular             classroom teachers, both the project participants and a control group of        teachers, will work with children in both small and large groups under          observation.  Comprehensive evaluation of pupil performance and teacher         performance and activity will be evaluated for both curriculum and              instruction.  The Project Director seeks to improve on the existing             curriculum, rather than create a new one.  The successful outcomes of           this project will be disseminated to help meet the needs of the nearly          3,000,000 mildly handicapped children in regular grades and the school          personnel who serve them.",
