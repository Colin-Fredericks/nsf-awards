 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project focusses on modeling the interannual                 variability of the tropical Pacific Ocean, using a 15-year record               of atmospheric forcing from a version of the NCAR Community                     Climate Model.  The skill of the ocean model's hindcast will be                 assessed.  To the extent that the ocean model reproduces extremes               of sea surface temperature that were present in the original                    boundary forcing, the dynamical causes of these events will be                  determined, including the relative contributions of zonal                       advection, upwelling, and anomalous surface heating.  Several                   integrations with different sampling of surface forcing fields                  will be carried out to determine the requirements for                           measurements of surface wind stress and surface heat flux to                    reproduce the main results with the highest quality of specified                forcing.  The results will pave the way for coupled GCM studies                 of interannual variability and quantitative assessments of the                  potential of long-range forecasting.  It will also contribute to                the design of observing systems for the tropical Pacific Ocean.                      This project is important because it attempts to develop and               test a way to treat in a modeling perspective the global                        processes by which oceans and atmosphere interact to produce and                to alter climate.  This project is a primary part of the World                  Climate Research Program's Tropical Oceans Global Atmosphere                    research program.",
