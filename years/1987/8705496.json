 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scorpion venom is a complex mixture that contains a large                       number of small basic proteins which are responsible for the                    neurotoxic effects of the venom.  A broad range of receptive                    excitable cells, e.g., synoptic neurons and muscle.  are                        depolarized and in the case of nerve ending, depolarized with                   release of neurotansmitters.  The venom from Centruoides                        sculpturatus Ewing (CsE) like that from other species of                        scorpions is unique in that the various toxins present in the                   venom can differ markedly in their toxicity to a given                          species, despite their closely related chemical properties                      and similar modes of action.  These toxins offer an excellent                   opportunity to study structure-function relationships within                    a class of closely related proteins that display widely                         different toxin effects. Also, because of their varying                         activities on sodium current in excitable membranes, the can                    serve as excellent probes for studying the sodium channel.                                                                                                      Dr. Krishna will use NMR spectroscopy to determine the                          solution structure of varies homologous toxins from CsE and                     compare them to the crystallographic conformation available.                                                                                                    A diverse number of mutually complementay NMR techniques as                     well as distance geometry computational methods will be                         employed in the study.  This project will ultimately provide                    the background information necessary to use the neurotoxins                     as structural probes of sodium channels.",
