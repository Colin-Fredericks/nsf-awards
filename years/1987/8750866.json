 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the establishment of a laboratory at Hunter          College, part of the City University of New York, within the department         of Geology and Geography.  The project will integrate an existing               program in remote sensing and image processing with related new and             existing classes in geographic information systems and analytical               cartography.  This goal will be achieved by the establishment of a new          laboratory containing four IBM-PC AT-based Earth Resources Data Analysis        Systems, with associated geographic data processing modules, and the            PMAP geographic information system software.  When integrated with              existing and new department computer hardware and software, this                facility will offer a state-of-the-art instructional environment for the        laboratory component of three separate but related areas of                     undergraduate coursework.  These courses will strengthen an existing            undergraduate program in remote sensing by providing a common ground            between remote sensing and image processing, analytical and computer            cartography, and geographic information systems.  The resulting                 specialization will provide students with advanced undergraduate                training for geographic information processing, and will give them              experience with a system which is becoming something of an industry             standard.",
