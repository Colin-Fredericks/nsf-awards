Her specific interest is in changes in         the size and location of the middle segment of the earnings distribution        (the \"middle class\"), which will be defined and measured in two                 different ways.                                                                         The purpose of this project is to determine whether the middle          class is shrinking as a percentage of the total population, as is often         alleged, and if so, how changes in the middle class vary from region to         region in the United States.  The changes and regional variations               documented by the analysis will then be related to national and regional        changes in economic structure during the period of analysis.  This              project will yield important theoretical and policy insights concerning         the relationships between regional industrial development and regional          income changes.",
