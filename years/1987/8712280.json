 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Wyoming Infrared Observatory (WIRO) will be an NSF sponsored                Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site for the summer               of 1987.  The WIRO summer program offers undergraduate students a               research opportunity in observational astrophysics projects,                    image processing and instrumentation.  The principal goals of the               program are:  first, to introduce the undergraduate to a                        fulfilling experience in infrared astrophysics research,                        including an introduction to photometric and spectral data                      analysis, image processing, and observational techniques; second,               to expose the undergraduate to several of the diverse research                  fields in modern astrophysics; third, to offer an opportunity to                work directly with active professionals; and fourth, to relate                  the importance of this research experience to the student's                     formal education.  Participants will come from colleges and                     universities throughout the nation.  A concurrent academic course               will help the students place this experience in a wider academic                context and provide a general direction of the program.                                                                                                         The Wyoming REU program is a highly regarded component of the                   NSF's effort to directly involve undergraduates at the nation's                 colleges and universities with professional basic research in                   science and engineering.",
