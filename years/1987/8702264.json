The program is designed to enable U.S.                  scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research              institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well          as Japan, Australia and New Zealand.  Exchange awards provide                   opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of          unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental                  conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                                                Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to             his/her field of science, the prospective potential of the applicants           for professional growth, as well as criteria relevant to the furthering         of international cooperation in science and engineering.  The program           is particularly directed to scientists and engineers who are embarking          on their research careers.                                                                                                                                      This research project aims at incorporating the disjunctive kriging             into the variance reduction analysis (a geostatistical sampling scheme          developed by the proposer).  This expansion enables the program to              identify the optimal sequence of sampling points for random variables           with any distribution.  It will be attempted to expand this algorithm           to the time-space domain to be applicable to most physical processes in         water science.                                                                                                                                                  The project is under the direction of Professor Shahrokh, Rouhani,              School of Civil Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta,          GA 30332, U.S.A., and Professor Margaret Armstrong, Ecole Nationale             Superieure des Mines de Paris, 35, rue Saint-Honore, 77305                      Fontainebleau, France.                                                                                                                                          This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,              international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents                  allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat            administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
