 "awd_abstract_narration": "The complexity of integrated circuit chips such as those used in                computers is such that it is becoming extremely difficult to                    interconnect the various points with wires or even thin lines of metal          evaporated onto the chip itself.  One way which has been proposed to            circumvent this complexity problem is the use of light propagating              freely around the chip.  To accomplish this it is necessary to bring            together optics and integrated circuits, namely to place generators of          optical beams and detectors of them at various places on the chip.  This        involves materials and device problems which are to be considered by the        effort proposed.  A breakthrough in this area could result in a new             generation integrated circuits with more functions integrated within the        same chip.                                                                                                                                                      An award is recommended.",
