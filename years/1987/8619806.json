 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Dr. Michael H. Green to collaborate with                 Drs. Kaare R. Norum, Rune Blomhoff, and Trond Berg, University of               Oslo, Norway.  They will study the metabolism of vitamin A and will             apply the unique approach of computer-assisted, model-based                     compartmental analysis to data on (1) the in vivo turnover of                   retinol and retinol-binding protein (RBP) in vitamin A - sufficient             rats, (2) the dynamics of intracellular transport and secretion of              retinol in vitamin A - deficient rats, and (3) the kinetics of                  receptor-mediated endocytosis of retinol/RBP in parenchymal and                 stellate rat liver cells.                                                                                                                                       Their studies will facilitate the development and quantification of             physiologically relevant compartmental models which describe the                dynamics of whole body and hepatic retinol and RBP metabolism.                  They will gain information on (1) the nature and extent of                      RBP vs. retinol recycling among plasma, liver, and extrahepatic                 tissues, (2) the hepatic regulatory pathways which are affected by              vitamin A deficiency, and (3) the intracellular and subcellular                 transport of retinol and RBP in hepatic cells in vitro.  The                    proposed experiments are a continuation and extension of their                  previous successful research collaboration.  Dr. Green is an                    expert in analytical methods for vitamin A, model-based                         compartmental analysis, and whole body vitamin A metabolism.  The               Norwegian researchers are specially skilled in receptor-mediated                endocytosis, liver cell separation and culture, and vitamin A                   metabolism and methods.",
