 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a recommendation for an award to support research on the                feasibility of development of a field portable gas-chromatograph/tandem         mass-spectrometer (GS/MS/MS) for application to critical environmental          monitoring needs.  The proposed instrument system will greatly improve          the capability to monitor and ultimately predict the diffusion,                 dispersion, interactions and impacts of air, water and land pollution.          Phase I of this research will explore the technical feasibility of a            miniaturized and portable GC/MS/MS sysbm by (a) developing a conceptual         design, (b) performing high risk research on subsystems, and (c)                assessment of advanced field sampling methods.                                                                                                                  This research has objectives consistent with those of the Environmental         Engineering program.  The qualifications of the investigators are               appropriate for the work to be done.  The proposal leading to this              recommendation for support was submitted under conditions of the SBIR-          Small Business Innovation Research Program Announcement NSF 86-19.                                                                                              Award is recommended in the amount of $40,000 for six months starting           February 1, 1987.  This is for Phase I.",
