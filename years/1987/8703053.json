 "awd_abstract_narration": "The GaAs materials and device development has reached the stage         where material non-uniformities limit device performance to the extent          that circuit yields are so low that only occasionally is a perfectly            working chip attainable.  A great deal of research is devoted to                material growth development.  However, very little effort is devoted to         gettering in spite of the fact that it is well known that complex Si            chips are only possible through extensive use of gettering.  It is very         likely that complex GaAs will similarly only be attainable if effective         gettering methods are developed.                                                        The objective of the program is the development of one effective        gettering method and an understanding of gettering in GaAs.  During the         first year of this three year program the PI will measure the effect of         damage-induced and stress-induced gettering to determine the best               method. During the second year the PI will choose the most promising            method and optimize it.  Most of the work during the first two years            will be done on semi-insulating substrates in order to study the basic          gettering mechanism.  During the third year the PI will extend the              research to directly ion-implanted n-layers to study the gettering              effectiveness on these layers.",
