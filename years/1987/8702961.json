This award recommendation is made under the U.S.-Industrialized                 Countries Program for the Exchange of Scientists and Engineers,                 1987/1988 Competition.  The program is designed to enable institutions          in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well as Japan,             Australia and New Zealand.  Exchange awards provide opportunities for           the conduct of joint research and the utilization of unique or                  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in              foreign contries.                                                                                                                                               Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to             his/her field of science, the prospective potential of the applicants           of international cooperation in science and engineering.  The program           is particularly directed to scientists and engineers who are embarking          on their research career.                                                                                                                                       This research project will address the problem of correlation between           the capability of the freshwater snail, Potamorpyrgus Antipodarum, of           parthenogenetic reproduction and the presence of a single trematode             parasite.  The purpose of this study is to directly test the a priori           prediction that sexual snails are more resistant to infection by the            trematode parasite than are asexual snails - a necessary condition for          the maintenance of sex by natural selection resulting from parasitism.                                                                                          The project is under the direction of Dr. Curtis M. Lively, Department          of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ          85721, U.S.A., and Dr. C. L. McLay, Head, Department of Zoology,                University of Canterbury, Christchurch 1, New Zealand.                                                                                                          This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,              international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents                  allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat            administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
