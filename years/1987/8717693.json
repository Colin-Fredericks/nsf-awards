Many tieback walls (the walls are tied or anchored by rods or cables to         the adjacent soil) have been constructed in seismically active areas of         the world. However there is no generally accepted method of seismic             analysis and design for this type of retaining structure.                                                                                                       This research project considers the case where the walls are tied with          pressure-grouted anchors. It is generally recognized that anchors               installed with grout pressure have significantly higher anchoring               capacity than those installed without grout pressure. While the reason          for the higher capacity is not well defined, there are several possible         explanations for the increase. Depending upon the actual cause, the             effect of earthquake ground shaking can lead to a loss in strength of           the anchor. The decrease in anchor capacity may vary from insignificant         to a critical loss of capacity leading to failure of the wall.                                                                                                  This research project will investigate the cause of the increased               capacity of pressure grouted anchors, as well as the effect of seismic          ground shaking upon this increased capacity.",
