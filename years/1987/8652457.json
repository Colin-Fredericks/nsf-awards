 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops an inquiry oriented, quantitative science program         in the elementary school and establishes a program by which peer                teachers provide inservice guidance to other teachers.  During the              summer of 1987, five peer mentor teachers trained in a former NSF               project will attend a one week intensive leadership seminar on the              SUNY/Cortland campus.  The purpose of the seminar is to prepare the             teachers to serve as consultants and facilitators of instruction for            teachers from the five school districts participating in the 1987-89            project.  A two day workshop will also be held during the summer for            five peer/mentor teachers, twenty K-6 teachers, ten junior/senior high          school science teachers, and elementary principals from each of the five        districts.  The purpose of this workshop is to promote working                  relationships between peer/mentor teachers and staff of the districts.                                                                                          During the 1987-88 school year the twenty k-6 teachers will participate         in sixteen 2 1/2 hour instructional sessions which will be held every           other week.  During alternate weeks the project staff will visit each           participants classroom.  The purpose of the staff visitation is to help         these peer teachers implement the science content instruction and the           methodologies into their classrooms.                                                                                                                            During the implementation phase (academic 1988-87) the four teachers            from each district will conduct inservice programs.  During this phase          Dr. Barr will make ten visits to each of the five schools.  The visits          will help facilitate implementation of the science program into all             elementary classrooms of the districts.                                                                                                                         Mini-grants, supported by local organizations, businesses, and industry,        will be available to the participants to conduct a mini research project        in their classrooms.  A second unique feature of the program is a Make          It/Take It Workshop during which classroom instructional materials will         be constructed for use in the teachers' classrooms.                                                                                                             Dr. Bonnie B. Barr, Project Director, has conducted numerous inservice          science workshops for elementary teachers.  She is author of a textbook         series and has been involved in numerous curriculum projects.",
