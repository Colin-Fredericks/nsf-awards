The 1987 conference will include the                       following: (1) At least four sessions of platform presentations.                                                                                                Topics of these sessions are \"Control of Gene Expression during                 Development\"; \"Cellular and Molecular Aspects of Limb                           Development\"; \"Muscle Development, Regeneration, and Plasticity\";                                                                                               and \"Embryonic Organization and Pattern Formation\".  Each                       platform presentation will include 3 to 5 invited speakers from                 leading developmental biology laboratories in the Midwest. (2) A                poster session. (3) Live-material sessions in various research                  laboratories in the Dept. of Biology, Indiana University.  (4) A                keynote address by Dr. Urs Rutishauser of the Dept. of Anatomy                  and Developmental Genetics, Case Western Reserve University.                        The purpose of the conference is to provide an effective                    opportunity for the formal and informal exchange of information                 and ideas between established investigators and graduate or                     postdoctoral students.  This goal is achieved much more readily                 at the regional conferences than at national meetings primarily                                                                                                 because the regional conferences are smaller, less rigidly                                                                                                      scheduled, and allow ample time and occasion for discussions.",
