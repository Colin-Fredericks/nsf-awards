 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biomembrane physics has been subject to a tremendous                            development during the last decade.  This is due to                             experimentors who, using techniques from modern physics, have                   provided an accurate experimental description of certain                        synthetic lipid bilayers and reconstituted cell membranes.                      As a result of the experimental efforts, these model                            membranes now present themselves as extremely well-                             characterized systems with properties which are believed to                     be common to a great variety of biological membranes.  At the                   same time, the experimental work has highlighted an urgent                      need for a parallel theoretical actiity.                                                                                                                        Dr. Scott's research addresses questions involving the nature                   and manifestiation of molecular interactions in biomembranes.                   The first is an analytical project in which new models for                      lipid bilayer condensed phases will be constructed and                          analyzed.  The second is a large scale simulation of model                      lipid-protein interactions in membranes.  Statistical physics                   is a difficult field to work in and more so when combined                       with biology.  Dr. Scott's recent record demonstrates that he                   is most capable of handling any problems that arise and will                    make significant contributions to this field.",
