 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research uses laboratory experimental methods to study behavior in         a variety of computerized economic decision-making environments.  All           of the experiments use human subjects acting under a cash reward                structure.  The resulting experimental data are used to evaluate the            predictive ability of models of individual and aggregate market                 behavior as well as the sensitivity of market outcomes to variations in         the institutional rules that define the structure of market information         flows.  The performance of three distinct trading institutions (double          auction, posted offer, and sealed bid-offer auction) are studied                in markets where the competitive equilibrium is nonstationary.                                                                                                  Other topics of inquiry include: the effects of introducing short               selling opportunities into asset markets where speculative \"price               bubbles\" are regularly observed; the ability of asset futures markets           to convey and aggregate a sequence of exogenous information injections          that reduce uncertainty regarding the asset's value at the end of spot          market trading; tests of price expectation formation models using price         forecast data from both market and non-market experimental                      environments; and tests of the competitive model using a hostile                parameterization of an experiment where two commodities are traded              concurrently via the double-auction institution.",
