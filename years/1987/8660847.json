 "awd_abstract_narration": "Screening and isolation of microorganisms accounts for much of the              efforts in industrial microbiology.  For example, screening for enzyme          inhibitors of microbial origin has recently led to more than 50 novel           compounds, some of which are in clinical use or clinical trial for the          treatment of hypertension, rapid screening technique could speed up the         identification of novel and new biological compounds.                                                                                                           The overall objective of this proposal is to develop an automated               cellular electrode system for screening and monitoring purposes.                Construction of a working cellular electrode system using a disk of             immobilized mammalian cells attached to an oxygen electrode is an               immediate objective of this proposal.  Two such electrodes with                 different cell lines can possibly be used to detect a substance toxic to        one of the cell lines by differential oxygen sensing measurements.                                                                                              Phase I research will focus on developing magnetically sensitized               immobilized cellular disks, and then magnetically coupling these disks          to an appropriate electrode.  If these initial studies look encouraging,        further research in engineering design and software development of the          screening system is planned for phase II.                                                                                                                       The PIs are considered to be very capable of carrying out the proposed          research project and I recommend funding according to the budget                submitted with this proposal.",
