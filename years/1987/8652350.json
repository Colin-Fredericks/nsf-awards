 "awd_abstract_narration": "This five week summer program, based in New York City, will assist              twenty-four master middle school teachers: upgrade their mathematical           knowledge, teaching techniques, and prepare/conduct workshops for co-           teachers of grades 5 - 8.  All teachers will be from New York City              schools, where at least 80% of the their students are living at or below        poverty level. The purpose of the workshops, run by the master teachers,        is to assist the participating teachers better prepare their students to        receive mathematical instruction and increase the students' rate of             retention in mathematics courses.                                                                                                                               The mathematical topics will include algebra, geometry, graphing,               computers, probability, and statistics.                                                                                                                         In addition, the City College of New York will finance the development          and pilot testing of an instructional in-service videotape  for middle          school mathematics teachers. The intent is that teachers can view the           tape as often as they want at their own convenience.                                                                                                            The project director is Gerald Elgarten, City College of the City               University of New York.  Claire Newman, Professor Emeritus, Queens              College of the City University of New York, a well-known mathematics            educator and Michael Engber of the Department of Mathematics, City              College will conduct the two courses for four weeks and the one week            workshop.   An Advisory Committee  composed of superintendents and              principals from the NYC public schools and the City College                     administration will meet several times prior to and once a month during         the project to provide policy advice, monitor and evaluate progress.                                                                                            A continuing evaluation process will assess the project's impact on the         teachers and their students.",
