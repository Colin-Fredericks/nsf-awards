 "awd_abstract_narration": "The seismic behavior of ground-based liquid storage tanks under                 horizontal and vertical excitations has received considerable                   attention                                                                       in the past two decades; however, most of these studies dealt                   only with                                                                       the behavior of anchored tanks.  Few attempts were made to                      analyze the                                                                     complex behavior of unanchored tanks and models sought were                     either too                                                                      simple to capture the basic response of such structures or too                  complicated by modeling many features at once.  It is believed                  that the                                                                        behavior of the bottom plate is a dominant factor in the analysis               of the                                                                          overall system.  Also, based on past experimental tests, liquid                 sloshing                                                                        has a more pronounced effect on the response of unanchored than                 anchored                                                                        tanks.  This research will conduct a comprehensive study to                     analyze the                                                                     seismic response of unanchored tanks.  The study consists of both               theoretical and experimental investigations, and is divided to                  three                                                                           major phases:  1. Nonlinear static and dynamic analyses of the                  response                                                                        of the bottom plate of the tank under uplifting forces taking                   into                                                                            account its nonlinear contact with the foundation, its large                    deformations, its inelastic response, its interaction with the                  underlying soil and its behavior under impact; 2. An analysis of                the                                                                             nonlinear response of the liquid, and an evaluation of the                      corresponding                                                                   hydrodynamic pressures; and 3. An analysis of the coupled                       response of                                                                     the shell, the liquid and the bottom plate under moderate to                    severe                                                                          earthquake motions.  The research will provide                                  a comparison between theoretical results and observed                           experimental data to assess the accuracy and the reliability of                 the predicted response.",
