 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) has a                 long history of research and teaching.  Ecological studies,                     limnological in particular, have been in progress since the                     Station was founded in 1909.  Long-term experiments and data                    bases form a unique background to more detailed experimental                    studies of nutrient dynamics, plant ecology, soil ecology,                      ecological genetics, and plant-animal interactions.  These areas                of study have been hampered in the past by the lack of certain                  facilities at the UMBS.                                                              This project will provide funds for a CHN analyzer,                        electrobalance and environmental chambers for the station.  The                 availability of a CHN analyzer (and the associated                              electrobalance) will make possible accurate measurements of the                 amounts of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in a wide array of                    biological samples, which is critical for both modern descriptive               work as well as experimental studies.  In addition, a wide                      variety of ecological studies which depend upon having access to                controlled environmental chambers will be possible with the added               facilities.                                                                          These additions to the Station's facilities will allow a                   variety of experimental approaches which past researchers simply                could not utilize.  Combining such improved analytical                          capabilities with the Station's historical records will greatly                 improve our understanding of ecological and evolutionary                        processes.  The role of soil nutrients in affecting plant growth                and how plants respond, in particular, to low-nutrient sutuations               will be amenable to investigation, as well as studies of the                    genetics of how plants utilize available nutrients.  Simultaneous               measurements of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in samples from                  both terrestrial and aquatic environments will lead to more                     accurate descriptions of nutrient cycles in those environments.                 In addition, this will allow experimental studies of the role of                such cycles in the growth of algae, higher plants, fungi, and                   bacteria as well as the effects of such organisms on the                        population dynamics of animals.",
