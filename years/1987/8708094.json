 "awd_abstract_narration": "Between the two world wars, the American home completed the                     transformation the industrial revolution had begun.  Changing                   demographic patterns, urbanization, technological advances, and new             economic values combined to produce a household and a homelife that             differed markedly from those of the nineteenth century.  Contemporary           observers understandably attached great significance to the changes             they saw in the new style of American family life.  Electrical                  modernization clearly occurred and both contemporary observers and              historians have presumed that it was a significant part of the                  household revolution.  Electrical lighting was safer, cheaper, and              better than gas illumination and enhanced the comfort of the home.              Electrical refrigeration profoundly affected food management (moreso            than different cooking technologies) and washing machines fundamentally         altered household hygiene.  Although electricity has been the principle         form of energy in the twentieth century, historians have not devoted            the same attention to electrical modernization as they have to other            technological and social changes.  As a result, historians lack                 a sense of the timing and course of electrical modernization.  In               their investigation of the electrical modernization of the American             household from 1920 to 1954, Drs. Tobey and Wetherell advance our               understanding of the relationship between society and technology by             examining when and how American households adopted one of the century's         most important everyday technologies.                                                                                                                           Specifically, Drs. Tobey and Wetherell aim to answer the following              questions:  When was domestic electrical technology introduced to the           American household?  What is the causal relationship between its                introduction and the distribution of labor inside the household, the            entrance of married women into the wage-labor force, and the use of             credit financing to acquire electrical technology?  And, what is the            relationship between electrical modernization of the household and the          establishment and character of the role of the modern \"housewife\"?              Using both individual and aggregate-level data, the investigators               illuminate the phenomenon of electrical modernization, its timing,              sequence, and social context.",
