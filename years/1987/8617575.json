The          presently proposed effort concentrates upon the device and materials            studies, particularly those which involve a nonlinear interaction               between the optical field and the material.  Such interactions and              devices based upon them will play a crucial roll in the realization of          optical systems which go beyond communications.  Increasing  the                nonlinearity and the variety of materials which are likely candidates           for doing so, is one of the basic thrusts within the lightwave                  technology program.                                                                                                                                             The present effort is central to this thrust of the strategic plan for          lightwave technology.                                                                                                                                           In addition to the materials studies, the grant will involve nonlinear          device studies including new means by which radiation can be efficiently        detected and structures which can guide radiation and provide feedback.",
