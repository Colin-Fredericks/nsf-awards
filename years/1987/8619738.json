 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Scalo's research follows both empirical and theoretical                     approaches to study structural features in interstellar gas                     complexes and the relation of these features to turbulence and                  the process of star formation.  The empirical work is directed                  toward a quantitative understanding of the existence and nature                 of the hierarchical structure in cloud complexes.  The                          theoretical work includes the temporal behavior of star formation               and numerical solutions of the hydrodynamic cloud fluid equations               to study the ability of star formation bursts to deplete and                    expel gas from galaxies.                                                                                                                                        Star formation is a phenomenon which involves the coupling of                   processes over a large range of spatial scales, from individual                 protostars to coherent star formation on scales of 200 to 1000                  parsecs.  The interstellar gas complexes in which stars form                    exhibit substructure on all scales from 100 parsecs down to less                than 0.1 parsec, and the structure often appears to be                          hierarchically arranged.  This coupling between the local and                   global aspects of star formation manifests itself in the fact                   that our understanding of galaxy evolution depends crucially on                 the largely unknown dependence of the star formation rate and                   initial mass function of forming stars on both local and global                 physical conditions.",
