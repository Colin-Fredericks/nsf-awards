 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the end of the Paleozoic most major seaways had                    closed and an enormous landmass \"Pangea\" had developed.  Little                 detail of the environment of this land mass is known for the                    following period (the Triassic).  The Principal Investigators                   propose here a collaborative approach using both paleontology                   and sedimentology to examine one of the classic formations of                   this land mass, the Moenkopi.  The study is set apart from                      others in this area by the collaborative effort.  Study of                      sediments as well as fossil vertebrates is an excellent approach                to understanding paleoenvironments.  Curiously, although the                    presence of vertebrate fossils in this formation was recorded                   late in the 19th century, only sporadic work on the faunas has                  ensued.  Similarly, after initial work on the stratigraphy                      beginning with its description, only limited detailed work has                  been completed.",
