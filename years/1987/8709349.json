 "awd_abstract_narration": "This continuing grant for three years is on auditory perception.                The two ears must be used together, binaurally, for localizing a sound          source in space.  The difference for the two ears in arrival time of a          signal is the interaural time delay (ITD), and the difference for the           sound intensity is the interaural intensity difference (IID).  The              auditory system is very sensitive to small changes in these cues, and           there has been a lot of theoretical interest in how such cues are used          to construct the perception of sound localization.  Models to account           for binaural phenomena usually involve a display of interaural cross-           correlation of auditory nerve activity, after some peripheral analy-            sis.  But it remains important to know whether the auditory system can          extract such interaural differences when the stimulus is not a simple           constant relatively low-frequency tone pulse, but more complex sounds           such as amplitude-modulated tones or narrowband noise, which have a             characteristic \"envelope\" of frequency or intensity with time.                                                                                                  This project will extend theories of binaural interaction to                    desribe and predict results of experiments using complex binaural               stimuli, and using pure tones over a very wide range of frequencies.            Two models will be handled.  One will be developed that considers the           peaks of crosscorrelation functions, and how those vary with                    frequency.  A second will reformulate a model initially designed only           for low-frequency stimuli, using an approach relating auditory nerve            fiber responses to high-frequency tones and broadband noise.  The               model predictions will be tested by psychoacoustical experiments,               which will be used to distinguish alternative interpretations of sound          lateralization phenomena, and better understand intersubject                    variability.                                                                                                                                                    This work is an unusually quantitative approach that will have                  substantial impact on an important issue in auditory perception.  The           models dealing with responses to complex stimuli are likely to                  influence current research in several sensory systems where complex             stimuli are now being addressed in a quantitiative way.  This work              also may lead to potential application for auditory prosthesis or               auditory displays for the blind.",
