 "awd_abstract_narration": "Structure-Function Studies on Phytochrome:  Light                       perception by phytochrome initiates many developmental and                      physiological responses in green plants.  Research outlined in                  this proposal will provide new information regarding both                       phytochrome structure and the primary signal transduction                       process(es) initiated by phytochrome photoactivation in both a                  higher plant and a green alga.  Studies on both phytochromes                    will include a) delineation of regions of light-induced                         conformational changes in the protein moiety, b)                                characterization of conserved regions of primary structure                      between the higher plant and algal phytochromes and c)                          elucidation of structural features which confer heterogeneity                   to the purified photoreceptor.  With regard to the primary                      function of phytochrome in plant cells, the hypothesis that                     phytochrome is a protein kinase or is functionally associated                   with a protein kinase, will be tested.  These studies will                      include a) delineation of the sites and stoichiometry of ATP                    (or other nucleotide) binding on phytochrome, b) demonstration                  whether the kinase co-purifies with phytochrome and c)                          determination whether phytochrome photoactivation alters                        protein phosphorylation of endogenous or exogenous substrates                   both in vivo and in vitro.  In vivo and in vitro substrates for                 the \"phytochrome-associated\" protein kinase will be compared.                                                                                                           Environmental photoperception by phytochrome is essential               to optimal growth and development of plants.  In the natural                    environment, plants are exposed to extremes in light intensity                  and spectral quality.  Phytochrome serves as a molecular sensor                 of such changes by modulating the state of development of the                   plant via changes in gene expression (cf. induction of seed                     germination or flowering) as well as influencing growth rate or                 chloroplast orientation to optimize light capture for                           photosynthesis.  The experiments outlined in this proposal will                 provide new information regarding both phytochrome structure                    and the components of the signal transduction initiated by                      phytochrome photoactivation.  It is anticipated that an                         understanding of the phytochrome-mediated signal transduction                   process at a molecular level will foster new approaches to                      improve plant productivity using molecular genetic and                          biochemical tools.",
