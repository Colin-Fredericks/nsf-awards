During                  the two year period beginning 1 July 1987, Professor Friend will                develop new research capability in near edge X-ray absorption                   fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy with which she will study                  the adsorption structure of reactant molecules on clean and                     modified tungsten and molybdenum surfaces.  This activity will                  complement chemical investigations already underway in her                      laboratory that are supported by the Foundation through a                       Presidential Young Investigator Award.  The NEXAFS studies will                 utilize the synchrotron facility at Stanford University and will                involve the collaborative cooperation of Dr. Joachim Storr of                   IBM-San Jose who is a world authority in this area.  This work is               expected to lead to an enhanced molecular-level understanding of                the reactivity of heterohydrocarbons on the surfaces of                         industrially important molybdenum and tungsten catalyst surfaces.",
