 "awd_abstract_narration": "The issue of impact of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide               (CO2) on climate is a current research topic of substantial                     interest to scientists, policy makers and the public.  Realistic                simulations of the effects of such greenhouse gases can be                      achieved through judicious use of a fully coupled ocean-                        atmosphere general circulation model which can properly simulate                critical horizontal and vertical heat transfers that must occur                 in the ocean-atmosphere system.  The objectives of the proposed                 research are to simulate and understand the changes in the                      equilibrium climate of the earth that are brought on by an                      increase in the atmosphere's CO2 concentration, and to analyze                  the mechanisms which determine the time required for this new                   equilibrium climate to be established.  Specific tasks include                  (1) numerical simulations using the Oregon State University's                   atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) coupled to a mixed                  layer ocean model to analyze the soil moisture budget (in order                 to understand the hypothesized CO2-induced dessication of the                   Northern Hemishphere continents in summer); (2) inclusion of the                diurnal cycle in the numerical model; (3) further analyses of the               results from a 20-year integration of the fully coupled ocean-                  atmosphere GCM; (4) investigation of the oceanic uptake of two                  passive tracers in the coupled GCM to determine the extent to                   which the observed penetration of passive tracers into and                      through the oceans can be used as an analog for the CO2-induced                 warming of the ocean.  This work is important because it will                   increase our understanding of and our capability to predict                     climatic changes that must occur in response to the increasing                  levels of atmospheric CO2.",
