This        application could lead to an economical and technically broad design            methodology.                                                                                                                                                    This research project will consist of developing an expert system for           earthquake-resistant design of structures.  The design of structures for        earthquake loads requires specialized knowledge in several interrelated         disciplines, and is very difficult to perform on a day-to-day basis by a        designer.  This expert system will help the designer in the development         of a safe (and economical) earthquake-resistant design on a routine             basis.  The Phase I efforts will develop the basic framework for the            proposed expert system and detailed technical development of the                methodology will be performed in phase II.                                                                                                                      An award is recommended for this six month Phase I, Small Business              Innovation Research project.  The principal investigator is highly              qualified to conduct the research and the institution provides adequate         facilities for support.",
