 "awd_abstract_narration": "The discovery of the hydrothermal vents of the deep-sea has             led to dramatic rethinking of how entire ecosystems can be fueled               through primary production sources.  Chemosynthetic production by               marine bacteria are now known to support diverse, thriving and                  unusual communities of living organisms in locations that would                 have been unexpected a decade ago.  The use of sulfur compounds,                important to deep-sea hydrothermal vents, has sparked an interest               in worlds which are closer to our everyday experience -- salt                   marshes, mangrove systems, and sewage outfalls and treatment                    systems.  These discoveries have also stimulated a great interest               in other types of chemical-based synthetic systems, for example,                the newly discovered ability of animal/bacterial associations to                utilize methane (natural gas) in hydrocarbon seeps on the sea                   floor.                                                                                  Dr. Jannasch has been one of the nation's and world's                   leaders in the study of the exciting microbiology of the vent                   ecosystems.  He has been extremely productive in the discovery,                 identification, and characterization of naval life forms.  The                  proposed studies will continue these investigations and begin to                assess how the organic biomass (food) produced by the deep-sea                  bacteria is transferred in the food web to associated animals.                  The Biological Oceanography Program recommends support for Dr.                  Jannasch's investigations at the following levels: FY87,                        $128,101, FY88, $157,130; FY89, $164,769.",
