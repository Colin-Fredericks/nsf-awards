 "awd_abstract_narration": "The measurement of temperature within cloudy air is of                     fundamental importance to atmospheric scientists.  Unfortunately,               in-cloud air temperature can not be properly measured if the                    sensor used to measure the temperature becomes wet.  Many                       different housings have been developed for the purpose of                       shielding temperature sensors from hydrometeors while allowing                  adequate sampling of ambient air. To date, however, all housings                still allow some sensor wetting under various conditions.  The                  extent of this problem has been difficult to ascertain, however,                because no standard existed against which immersion sensors                     could be tested.  Recently, a fundamentally different instrument                which does not suffer from this wetting problem has been                        developed.  Unfortunately, this instrument, known as a                          radiometric thermometer, is expensive, large and heavy which                    makes widespread use in research aircraft unlikely in the near                  future.                                                                              The Principal Investigators will use this radiometric                      thermometer to study the wetting characteristics of the most                    commonly used immersion probes.  New knowledge will be gained on                the magnitude of the problem and the conditions under which                     wetting occurs.  This will allow post calibrations to be applied                to previously collected data, thus improving its quality.  The                  knowledge gained from this study also will allow the Principal                  Investigators to pursue developing an improved housing for a                    light weight and less expensive immersion sensor.",
