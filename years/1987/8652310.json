 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association of Science-Technology Center (ASTC), a non profit               organization of science museums and related organizations, has received         numerous requests from museum members to develop an in-depth                    professional development program for top science museum administrators          and board members.  The largest number of requests is from science              centers which are in the planning stages or are newly opened.  More than        established museums, new and developing science centers face dozens of          basic decisions that will affect the character of their museums and             their chances for success.                                                                                                                                      The volume of requests for technical assistance, coupled with the               absence of any organized program to meet these needs led ASTC to develop        an Institute for New Science Centers.  The course is aimed at those who         have made a commitment to start a science center or whose doors have            opened within the past five years.  The grant will cover preparation and        evaluation of materials and programs.  Participants will pay half the           cost of the course.                                                                                                                                             Reviewers of the project agreed that strengthening the infrastructure of        the museum community is as important as developing programs for the             general public.  The National Science Foundation has the opportunity to         support an important new venture and one that will have an impact on the        number and quality of programs reaching the general public.",
