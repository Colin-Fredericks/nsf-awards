 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI has proposed to explore the autonomous interaction of               groups of machines such as robots in working toward common goals,               especially in less-structured environments than the typical                     production line.  New models will be explored, which could lead to a            system theory for cooperative robots.  The approach will draw on a              background of team theory research, but will not be limited to that             approach.  Earlier applications of team theory (eg, in its original             discipline of economics, and later in cecentralized optimal control)            have not been terribly successful, apparently because of the                    restrictive assumption that all \"players\" share a single goal.  This            assumption appears to be valid for cooperating machines.  The                   research is supported under the Expedited Awards for Novel Research             procedure.",
