 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emergence of social norms accompanied by effective sanctions is an          important social process, yet no social theory satisfactorily gives             the conditions under which norms will emerge, nor the process by which          they emerge.  This project aims at developing such theory by means of           mathematical modeling accompanied by computer simulation.  The work             will build upon recent work in evolutionary biology by Maynard Smith            and others which has led to the idea of evolutionarily stable                   strategies, as well as on the work of Axelrod and others in                     experimentation and computer tournaments with an iterated prisoners             dilemma.  The work will attempt especially to explore the effects of            social structure on the development of effective sanctions.  The                predictions of a mathematical model about the effects of variations in          social structure will be tested against computer simulation of systems          of mutually contingent strategies.  The significance of this work               beyond the development of social theory lies in practical questions of          social control, such as, for example the question of the conditions             under which adults are able to establish an effective normative system          governing the behavior of adolescents.",
