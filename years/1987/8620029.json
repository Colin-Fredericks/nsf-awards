 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent progress in microelectronic circuit packaging technologies               has begun to require a thorough understanding of time-domain                    electromagnetic wave propagation in multilayered media.  Several                issues in the theory and applications of the time-domain                        electromagnetic wave propagation in multilayered media will be                  addressed:  (1) the applications of the double-deformation technique            to transient radiation and coupling problems;  (2) transient                    propagation in anisotropic media;  (3) wave propagation along                   nonconventional transmission structures in integrated circuits;  (4)            signal distortion and electromagnetic scattering due to                         discontinuities in strip transmission lines;  (5) crosstalk in three-           dimensional integrated circuit packaging.  Better physical                      interpretation can be sought for through the development of the double          deformation technique, which is a wave-mode approach based on                   transform method.  On the other hand, the direct time-domain                    formations such as the space-time domain integral equations, the                method of characteristics, the finite-difference method, the                    transmission line matrix method help increase computation speed when            early-time response is of main concern and will also be explored.                                                                                               Time domain analysis of electromagnetic wave propagation has                    gained much attention in place of frequency domain analysis because of          various new applications.  In very-large-scale integrated circuit               design, multilayered structures are becoming more popular in light of           their capability of achieving a more condensed package, yet the                 crosstalk problems caused by transient electromagnetic coupling have            to be minimized.  When activated with electromagnetic pulses, adjacent          strips of transmission lines running in different directions or                 located at different heights can suffer from significant crosstalk.             As the rise-time becomes shorter and the clock-rate higher, the                 circuit may be rendered inoperative because of excessive crosstalk.             This research will focus on finding reliable and computationally                efficient techniques to calculate the amount of crosstalk and                   radiation.  One of the main goals will be to develop equivalent                 circuit models to facilitate computer-aided design.",
