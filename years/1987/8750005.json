The curricular improvements that            result have been based on an extensive review of facilities, equipment          and curriculum that firmly established the need for an electron                 microscope to make possible more sophisticated student work in both             introductory and advanced courses -- including Biology and Human Values,        Concepts of Biology, Plant Morphology, Anatomy of Vascular Plants,              Parasitology, Physiology, Introduction to Research, and Independent             Research Topics.  The instrument's contribution to enhancing options for        independent projects and required student research is of special                significance.  The departmental faculty is unusual in that five of its          eight full-time members have had previous experience working with               electron microscopy.",
