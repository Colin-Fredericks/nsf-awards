 "awd_abstract_narration": "Narravtive: This award supports a Presidential Young Investigator               (PYI) to study a variety of Biochemical Engineering problems.                   Current work focuses on cellular processes, enzymology, and                     developing analysis and evaluation frameworks for plant design.                 Work that has been completed includes a demonstration that                      physiological function (e.g. information transduction) linked                   pathway properties trade off with respect to structure                          (activity/regulatory mechanism organization) and operating point                (metabolite state vector), and fundamental investigations with                  single and multiactivity enzyme-membrane reactor systems.                       Future work includes experimental and theoretical studies of                    underlying molecular and physical processes that play a role in                 growth kinetics, regulation, and energetics of cells.  Novel                    bioreactors will be devised to study physical, chemical and                     biological phenomena for a better understanding of reactor                      operation.  Bioprocess design, such as developing frame works                   whereby the impact on design of key, manipulable processes                      (cellular, molecular) can be assessed.  Also, protein transport                 phenomena will be investigated to determine how alteration of                   conformational state and extent of self association influences                  mobility into/within porous separation media.",
