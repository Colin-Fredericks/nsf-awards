 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus on three areas: commutative                       algebra, representation theory and invariant theory.  In                        commutative algebra, the project will construct and study the                   generic ring for resolutions of length 3.  In representation                    theory , the Littlewood-Richardson rule will be generalized for                 all classical and spinor groups.  In the area of invariant                      theory, the principal investigator plans to find generators of                  multiplicity ideals for binary forms and prove the M. Green                     conjecture for general canonical curves of genus g.                                  One of the main sources of commutative algebra was 19th                    century invariant theory.  The problem of finite generation of                  rings of forms and its famous solution by Hilbert were the                      starting point of commutative algebra and representation theory.                This project will investigate the connections between those three               areas.  It is anticipated that the combination of algebraic,                    geometric and representation theoretic methods will lead to                     substantial progress in those areas.",
