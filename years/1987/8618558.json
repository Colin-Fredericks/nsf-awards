 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative ocean sciences instrumentation development              project project with investigators from the University of California-           Los Angeles.  Its objective is to test and evaluate the usefulness of           newly available instrumentation to study the adaptive schooling                 behavior of individuals within schools or groups of pelagic organisms.          Original and rigorous mathematical analysis of schooling behavior will          be tested by using digital data output from modern 3-dimensional                video-graphic systems and applying this data to 3-D mathematical                models developed for x-ray crystallographic studies.                                                                                                            Hamner, who is an accomplished behavioral biologist, and his                    associates at UCLA will purchase a 3-D videographic system with an              integrated data analysis and display capability.  The system's                  specialized cameras will be modified for underwater use.  Initial               video work will be done in a large aquarium but eventual use with               schooling organisms in the open ocean is planned.  Prewitt, who is              an skilled crystallographer at Carnegie will acquire a compatible               computer graphic workstation and modify existing software for 3-D               videography and automated image motion analysis for use with Hamner's           data.  They will collaborate to develop mathematical models and                 computational protocols to analyze and study schooling and behavioral           patterns.                                                                                                                                                       X-ray crystallography is the discipline that studies the geometrical            relationships of atoms, ions, or molecules within crystals.  Their              geometry may be static or dynamic, random or structured.  Statistical           analyses have been developed to describe these relationships.  Animals          also congregate in non-random, dynamic structures such as fish                  schools.  X-ray crystallographic technology and statistical analysis            methods may be transferable to biological sciences to better                    understand the dynamics and adaptive strategies of schooling behavior           in fish and other organisms.  Should the transfer of technologies               between these different fields be successful, not only will there be a          positive impact on ecological and behavioral studies, but other areas           of ocean sciences that analyze distances in three-dimensional space.",
