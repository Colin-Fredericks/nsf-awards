 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deposits of compound-complex bedforms form a significant                   portion of the eolian rock record, yet the actual dynamics of                   their airflow and bedform behavior have not been addressed.                     This obviously handicaps our ability to understand these modern                 bedforms and to interpret their deposit.  Work here constitutes                 the first detailed study of these features.  The results of                     this proposed work will be a four-year study consisting of                      monitoring bedform processes and migration, plus a documentation                of surface airflow and of the structure of macro-turbulence of                  the lee-face airflow.  This research represents a continuation                  of studies already completed, in progress, and proposed here.                   Surface processes and bedform migration will be mapped from the                 air on the ground.  Anemometers and microvanes will be used to                  document surface airflow.  Balloons and a tower with mounted                    instruments will be used to study the overall secondary lee-                    slope airflow.  The significance of this study will be the                      first documentation of the relationship of primary and secondary                airflow on a large complex bedform and the resulting bedform                    response.  The study site includes the Algodones Dune Field                     bordering S. California and Nevada.  Applications of the                        research include dune migration, erosion/deposition in farmland,                shoreline dune processes, and interpretation of paleoeolian                     features and wind regimes.",
