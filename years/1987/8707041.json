 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lower Cretaceous gravels of the western interior have                   traditionally been used to date the initiation of thrusting in                  the Sevier orogenic belt.  However, these gravels are                           anomalously widespread, extending over 500 km from the leading                  edge of the nearest thrust sheet.  In contrast, synorogenic                     conglomerates in modern and ancient foreland basins are usually                 confined to within 70 km of the thrust belt.  The goal of this                  project is to determine if these Lower Cretaceous gravels were                  indeed derived from the Sevier thrust belt or from some other                   tectonic event.                                                                         The University of Wyoming will use a new multidisciplinary              approach combining stratigraphic and sedimentologic observations                with established paleohydraulic and geophysical modelling                       techniques.  These techniques will be used to distinguish among                 four hypotheses for the origin of the Lower Cretaceous gravels:                 (1) a small incipient foreland basin developed as the thrust                    was emplaced but was filled and overtopped by the gravel; (2)                   the gravels were deposited immediately after thrusting began                    but before a foreland basin could develop; (3) the gravels were                 deposited during a broad uplift event that immediately preceded                 thrusting; and (4) the gravels were derived from west of, and                   are unrelated to, the thrust belt.  By testing these four                       hypotheses we hope to determine if the widespread Lower                         Cretaceous gravels were derived from the early uplift of the                    Sevier belt and, independently, if the gravels were deposited                   in, or preceded formation of, a foreland basin.  Thus the                       results of this study will advance our understanding of the                     timing and mechanics of the nascent Sevier orogeny by using                     quantitative basin analysis.  In addition, the integration of                   diverse and independent modelling techniques with ground truth                  observations in order to constrain sedimentary-tectonic models                  is a potentially powerful approach to answering questions                       concerning how and when basins develop adjacent to thrust-belt                  systems and in other tectonic settings.",
