 "awd_abstract_narration": "A pilot internship program in parallel computing is proposed            for university faculty and post-doctoral researchers.  The                      objective is to have a one-year postdoctoral participant and a                  five month senior participant in the pilot program.  These                      researchers would have the opportunity to master techniques and                 to conduct research in parallel computing.  Both participants                   would be encouraged to work closely with Argonne computer                       scientists who are experts in parallel computing.  The                          participants will learn about various debugging tools and                       performance measurement techniques available for parallel                       programs, study languages used to program multiprocessors, and                  work on the design of algorithms to exploit parallelism.  We                    would expect the senior person to have a well defined research                  project in mind with the expectation of completing computational                results on some of the parallel machines in the Advanced                        Computing Research Facility at Argonne.  We would expect the                    postdoctoral participant to review the wide range of applications               being carried out on multiprocessors, and to propose and work on                his or her own new applications.  Of course, the participants                   will have hands-on experience with a variety of differnet                       advanced-computer architectures.                                                        The proposed internships will provide an excellent                      opportunity for university members to acquire knowledge and                     experience in the area of parallel computing and to conduct                     research on state of the art equipment.  We are helpful that the                internship program will attract faculty members who wish to kkep                abreast of new technologies, both for their own research and for                the benefit of their students.                                                  ----------------------------------------------------------------                        The revised budget for the proposal reduces the requested               amount by eliminating ANL staff costs, by decreasing the number                 of participants and by reducing the direction of the project from               three years to one year.  In its present form the proposal                      represents a pilot internship program for one senior and one                    junior researcher.  If this program is successful, it would be                  expanded to include new participants.",
