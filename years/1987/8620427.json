 "awd_abstract_narration": "The following research will be carried out:  (1) A survey of                    radio wavelength emitting quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) will be                  carried out in an attempt to understand the statistics and                      characteristics of strong carbon line absorption in the spectra                 of radio-loud QSOs.  (2) An extensive complete survey for QSOs                  will be conducted using computer generated selection criteria                   based upon digitized scans of the United Kingdom Schmidt                        Telescope objective prism plates.  (3) The Multiple Mirror                      Telescope Echelle Spectrograph will be used in an attempt to                    observe absorption in the fine-structure lines of the ultraviolet               multiplets of the carbon line in moderate redshift QSOs in order                to measure or set limits on the cosmic microwave background                     temperature at early epochs.  These and other moderate- and                     high-resolution spectroscopic data will be used as diagnostic                   probes of the conditions in QSO absorption line regions.  (4) The               Echelle Spectrograph on the Kitt Peak National Observatory 4-m                  telescope will be used to observe line profiles in high redshift                QSOs.  (5) A search will be made for quasars near the                           line-of-sight of extremely low surface brightness galaxies.  (6)                A fraction of blazars in a complete radio sample will be studied                to test unified models of radio sources involving relativistic                  beams.  The energetics of individual beamed sources will be                     studied using the energy distributions in the fluxes observed in                the X-ray to radio wavelength region of the spectra.",
