 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of Dr. Meicenheimer's proposal are: 1. Develop an            empirical model for flax stem growth and tissue differentiation in terms        of spatial domains of relative elemental rates of cellular processes            within the stem axis. 2. Compare this model with existing cellular models       for root growth and tissue differentiation. 3. Test the hypothesis that         two classes of substances (leaf dependent and leaf independent) regulate        flax stem tissue patterns.  Flax plants will be grown under uniform             environmental conditions which give rise to steady state growth of stems.       Computer aided analyses of high resolution scanning electron micrographs        and serial transverse light microscopy sections of the stem will be used        to construct empirical models of the cellular basis for growth and tissue       differentiation of the stem axis.  Chemical treatments which interfere          with specific endogenous hormone levels within the stem will be used to         alter the normal cellular processes within the stem axes.  Models               developed for chemically treated and untreated stems will be compared in        tests of the working hypothesis.                                                    Patterns of external morphology and internal tisue anatomy of plant         stem and root axes are created through the concerted processes of               division and expansion of populations of cells initially comprising the         apical meristems of these organs.  The spatial domains of such cellular         processes have been fairly well characterized for plant roots but we lack       similar information for plant stems.  This proposal addresses this lack.",
