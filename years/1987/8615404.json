 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to facilitate a meeting of the U.S.                 University Council for Geotechnical Engineering Research.  The purpose          of the meeting is to exchange research ideas and discuss a coordinated          research approach on important and complex geomechanic research issues.                                                                                         The past decade has seen a large growth in the number of institutions           performing geotechnical engineering research.  Significant research             investigations in geotechnical engineering are now underway in several          institutions.  Many common problems are being experienced by these              institutions in addressing the technical issues.  The meeting will              provide a forum for a coordinated discussion of the methods of approach         in geotechnical engineering research.  The investigator is one of the           leaders in the council and is a recognized expert in geotechnical               engineering research.                                                                                                                                           A grant is recommended.",
