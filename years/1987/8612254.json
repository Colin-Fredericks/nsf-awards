 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research has two related goals, as follows: continued                 improvement of the high resolution scanning ion microprobe                      analysis system and its application to improved understanding of                aluminum-lithium alloys.  The program is directed towards                       quantitative determination of the distribution of lithium in                    aluminum-lithium alloys.  It requires initial studies on the                    spatial resolution of secondary ion mass spectrometry, creation                 of standards for the lithium and aluminum ion signal ratios as a                function of lithium concentration, and determination of                         detectability of lithium in aluminum-lithium alloys.  Aluminum-                 lithium alloys will be examined to measure the distribution of                  lithium in second phases, at grain boundaries, and at fracture                  surfaces to gain understanding of the segregation of lithium in                 these alloys.  Results will be correlated with transmission                     electron microscopy studies at Lehigh University.  Phase                        stability in the system will be determined using samples                        undergoing ion implantation and ageing treatments.  Results will                be correlated with studies using neutron depth profiling at the                 National Bureau of Standards.",
