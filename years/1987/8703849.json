 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Dr. Larsen and his collaborators to analyze a                series of human skeletons recovered from the site of Mission                    Santa Maria on Amelia Island, Florida. These remains date from                  the period 1684 . 1702 and were discovered during the process of                land clearing for property development. Emergency excavation                    yielded a series of aproximately 175 individuals. These remains                 will be analyzed to provide demographic and health data. Sex and                age.at.death will be determined. Postcranial, dental and cranial                elements will be measured to provide information on growth.                     Pathological conditions which reflect disease will also be noted.               The goal of this project is to gain insight into human response                 to stress. Through comparison of a series of skeletal populations               which date to different times, Dr. Larsen has obtained baseline                 information for Southeast U.S. Indian groups immediately prior to               European colonization. Through study of later groups it is                      possible to determine what happened during the contact period as                the social situation changed, as their diet was also altered and                as they were exposed to European diseases. The Mission Santa                    Maria population is especially important since these Indians are                the direct descendents of a St. Catherines Island group and were                moved to Amelia Island by the Spaniards after St. Catherines was                abandoned. Dr. Larsen has already analyzed comparable St.                       Catherines material.                                                                                                                                            This research is important because it shows how human populations               adapt biologically to stresses imposed by changing diet, disease                and social situation. In the Southeast U.S. it is possible to                   gain some control of these independent variables through                        historical records and archaeological excavation and this                       provides an excellent context for the skeletal analysis. Because                these skeletons will be reburied it is important to conduct the                 research now.",
