 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design of new ultra-small semiconductor is being driven by                  the possibilities of atomic-scale control of fabrication.                       Fabrication at the Angstrom scale means that quantum mechanical                 effects will be important.  One of the first results of advances                in crystal growth techniques which allow atomic scale control of                heterostructure device fabrication are superlattices.  In order                 to characterize the device, electron transport coefficients must                be obtained.                                                                                                                                                    Electron transport perpendicular to the lattice structure is                    important but difficult to calculate since the scale of the                     superlattice is of the same order of magnitude as the atomic                    lattice.  This Engineering Initiation project will use the Monte                Carlo simulation technique to investigate transport in                          superlattice devices.  For the first time, high field effects                   will be examined.  Particular attention will be paid to the                     interaction between transferred electron (Gunn effect) phenomena                and superlattice band-folding effects; this knowledge will                      provide ideas for new device implementations.  Furthermore, this                research not only will contribute to the area of Solid-State and                Microstructures but the Monte Carlo techniques are                              computationally intensive so that new algorithms will be                        developed which will enhance Computational Engineering.                                                                                                         This Engineering Initiation Award is jointly supported by the                   Computational Engineering and Solid-State & Microstructures                     Programs.  The institutional support is adequate and the P.I. is                fully capable of carrying out the research.  I strongly recommend               support.",
