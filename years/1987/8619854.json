 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physical processes involved in the maintenance and                     dissipation of marine stratocumulus will be studied using                       aircraft observations and theoretical models.  The observations                 for this study will be made using the NCAR Electra during the                   stratocumulus field phase of FIRE (First (International                         Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) Regional Experiment) to be                 conducted off the coast of southern California in July of 1987.                 The analysis will make use of mean, turbulence, cloud                           microphysics, and radiation measurements from the Electra.                           The overall objective is to improve and generalize methods                 for including stratocumulus processes in general circulation                    models.  The specific focus is on entrainment and mixing                        processes at cloud top, convective circulations in marine                       stratocumulus, and processes that regulate the cloud fraction in                broken cloud conditions.  The theoretical effect will involve the               development of a new low-order spectral model of convection that                contains terms representing the effects of latent heating,                      entrainment, and radiative and surface heat fluxes, as well as                  the effects of a shearing background wind field.  An analysis of                the solutions to the model will produce the expected                            macrostructure of boundary layer circulations:  for example, the                horizontal wavelenghts and orientations of the embedded bands and               the intensities of the circulations in the rows.  These                         theoretical results will be compared with the structure obtained                from the FIRE measurements.",
