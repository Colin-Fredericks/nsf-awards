 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is made under \"Expedited Awards for Novel Research\" to               explore the feasibility of using metallic tubes as cyclic energy                dissipators in building frames to dissipate most of the energy                  associated with severe lateral loading conditions.  An experimental             and an analytical phase will be included.  During the experimental              phase of this research, scale model frames will be prepared and                 subjected to cyclic loading conditions.  The frames and energy                  dissipating tubes will be instrumented with strain gages to measure             levels of strains as functions of time.                                         The primary objective of the frame experiments will be to track the             yielding and energy dissipation characteristics of the metallic tubes           when they are attached to frames subjected to lateral loading                   conditions.  The goal will be to develop structural framing systems             possessing the following two characteristics: 1) Yielding/energy                dissipation occurs in the tubes long before any plastic deformations            are initiated in the primary structural members of the frame. 2)                Yielding the energy dissipating tubes is not accompanied by a                   significant reduction in lateral stiffness of the frame.  The                   analytical phase of this task will involve the development and                  verification of computer software (ABAQUS) to predict the dynamic               response of frames equipped with tubular energy dissipators under               cyclic loading.                                                                 If feasible, a structural arrangement could result in load                      carrying main structural members remaining in the elastic ranges,               thereby eliminating major damage from occurring to the building.",
