 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the travel of eight United States scientists            to a workshop on the cytoskeleton and its formation and role in the             growth, differentiation and structure of wool and hair.  The                    workshop will be held in Adelaide, Australia, December 7-11, 1987.              Dr. Robert D. Goldman, Northwestern University School of Medicine,              and Dr. Tung-Tien H. Sun, New York University School of Medicine,               are the U.S. organizers planning the workshop with Dr. George E.                Rogers, University of Adelaide, and other Australian members of the             Committee.                                                                                                                                                      The purpose of the workshop is to assess the use of hair and wool               growth as a model system for studying the structure and function of             the major intermediate filament (IF) proteins, in particular the                keratins.  Intermediate filament proteins are major components of               the cytoskeletal system of all mammalian cell systems and keratins              are the most well characterized of all of the intermediate filament             proteins.  Discussed at the workshop will be the structure and                  function of the cytoplasmic keratins and the newly described                    complexes of keratin-like proteins within the nuclear matrix, the               lamins, as well as the microbiology of the keratin system including             the characterization and regulation of the genes encoding these                 proteins.  The result of the workshop will be an increased awareness            of the scientific activities going on in the countries represented              and greater possibilities for collaborative research between the                participants.                                                                                                                                                   This meeting will bring together for the first time Australian                  keratin experts with investigators from the U.S. having expertise on            the cellular and molecular aspects of the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic            cells.  The Australian Government Department of Science has already             approved and funded support for the Australian participants.  The               NSF Program Director for Developmental Biology has recommended this             activity at a high priority level.",
