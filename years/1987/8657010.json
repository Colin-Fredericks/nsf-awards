 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Summary:  Sub-triple liquids (metastable liquids below                 their triple point):  This project includes an experimental study               of the phase transition (unique to sub-triple liquids) involving                simultaneous boiling and crystallization, completion of a                       theoretical study of tensile instability (loss of tensile                       strength), and investigation of the molecular origin of density                 anomalies (liquids which contract when heated).  The connection                 between tensile instability and density anomalies was derived by                the PI.  Crystallization in supercritical fluids:  This portion                 of the project involves completion of equipment construction and                preliminary experiments in which continuous precipitation occurs                into a fluid whose temperature, pressure, and composition can be                independently manipulated.                                                                                                                                      Novelty/Innovation:  Sub-triple liquids are an unexplored state                 of matter (the term was coined by the PI).  Their behavior                      includes tensile instabilities (a decrease in tensile strength as               the temperature is lowered, an experimentally observed anomaly                  first explained by the PI) and a phase transition involving rapid               crystallization and boiling coupled with liquid disappearance, a                phenomenon not to be found elsewhere in nature.  Crystallization                from supercritical fluids is a novel method for the production of               uniform crystals and monodisperse polymer particles.  The most                  innovative concept in this project is the attainment of uniform,                controllable conditions within the fluid where nucleation occurs                through a manipulation of pressure instead of temperature.                      Pressure perturbations travel at the speed of sound, thus                       guaranteeing uniformity throughout the fluid medium and are                     applied to a highly compressible fluid near its critical point,                 thus giving rise to large changes in density and hence solvent                  power.                                                                                                                                                          Technical Impact/Practical Significance:  Tension generated when                a degassed liquid is cooled inside a rigid container is ideally                 suited for the non-destructive testing of adhesion on flat                      surfaces.  This is a problem of vital importance in microchip                   manufacture (e.g., photo-resist adhesion testing).  The                         experimentally observed equilibrium of a sub-triple liquid and a                crystal suggests the novel idea of creating solids which are                    uniformly stressed.  Since it is otherwise impossible to subject                a solid to isotropic tension, this process (tension                             crystallization) could lead to the production of materials with                 unique properties.",
