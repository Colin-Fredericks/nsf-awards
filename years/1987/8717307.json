 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research progress in computer-aided engineering has brought the                 construction research community to a significant front.  A most                 compelling issue on this front is representation of and reasoning on            geometric information.  Such geometric reasoning underlies the                  dominant intellectual issues of representation, reasoning, planning,            and action in the construction domain.  In spite of importance of               geometric reasoning to many computer-integrated construction                    functions, it has until very recently received only fragmentary                 attention, insufficient to meet current demands.                                This research will develop a body of theory for geometric reasoning             in the area of computer-integrated construction and will implement a            series of geometric reasoning programs to demonstrate that body of              theory.  Specifically supported by these reasoning programs will be             the planning, design and construction of building systems.                      Technically supporting the research is an architecture for geometric            reasoning.  Included in this architecture are capabilities for                  decomposition of geometric objects to their composing features, for             representation at multiple levels of abstraction, for class based               representation and reasoning and for reasoning based upon constraint            satisfaction.",
