 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues research into data structures                  which allow fast searching.  A major area of interest involves                  data structures for rapidly scanning  set of elements to find the               subset that lies in a particular geometric region, and to thereby               develop a better understanding of \"range query\" costs (from the                 vantage points of current software needs, potential geometric                   query objects, a dynamic setting, a static setting, tradeoffs                   between retrieval time and memory space.)  A second goal is to                  continue research into how to efficiency implement a non-procedu-               ral set-theoretic database query language, similar to the rela-                 tional calculus or SETL, in a main memory database.  Other areas                of study will include possible examinations of dynamimc perfect                 hashing, compact representations of sorted lists and communication              delays inherent in parallel processing.  The importance of this                 research is that geometric region searching has applications into               a wide range of area where the data can be though of as mapped out              in space - VLSI circuit design, graphic-design interfaces, and                  census or statistical database applications based on geographical               regions.  Efficient retrieval, using advanced technology such as                very large main memories for computer, is critical to developing                these applications.",
