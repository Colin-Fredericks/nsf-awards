 "awd_abstract_narration": "Random dispersions are frequently encountered in the petro-                     chemical as well as the high technology industries.  Transport                  and reaction rates in these systems may be characterized by                     effective properties; some examples are the effectve electrical                 conductivity of colloidal suspensions and microemulsions, the                   effective thermal conductivity of composite materials and                       packed beds, the effective diffusivity of porous media, the                     effective nutrient consumption or reaction rate in cell                         aggregates, and the effective ligand binding rate to receptors                  in biological systems.  Estimation and correlation of these                     effective properties accurately will enhance the understanding                  and facilitate the design of many engineering operations                        involving these heterogeneous systems.                                                                                                                          The effective conductivity (or mass permeability) and the                       effective reaction rate of a species in a random dispersion of                  particles depend not only on the properties (physical and                       chemical) of the constituent phases but also on their                           geometries, structures and connectivity.  Present theories are                  successful only in describing these effective properties at low                 to moderate particle densities, and therefore are not                           applicable to dense dispersions.  The calculation of these                      quantities at high particle concentrations will require taking                  into account the interplay between the structure of the                         dispersion and the transport process involved simultaneously.                                                                                                   The essential focus of this proposed research is to                             systematically explore the connection between certain                           representative \"families of structures and their effective                      conductivity and effective reaction rate.  The PI plans to                      determine these effective properties for dense dispersions.                     This is achieved by using: (1) methods borrowed from                            statisitical mechanics of dense fluids to describe the spatial                  arrangements and clustering behavior of particles, and (2)                      stochastic random walk theory to model diffusion on a                           microscopic level (and thus avoiding the solution of the                        differential equation for the many-particle random system).",
