 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plasma etching is one of the most important methods used for patterning         of electronic materials and for fabrication of VLSI circuts. Critical           to the understanding and further development of processes such as               plasma etching is the availability of diagnostic tools that permit              study and eventual monitoring or control of the process.  This program          will study the development of such instrumentation based on lead-salt           diode laser absorption spectroscopy to monitor important gas phase              species in the etching process. The major objective of the Phase I              program is the investigation of sensitive new measurement techniques            using diode lasers and the demonstration of these techniques to                 monitoring applications in plasma etching reactors.  In particular,             high frequency optical heterodyne techniques will be studied that               should permit a significant simplification in the optical design of the         system.  The technique will be demonstrated by measurement of boron             trichloride and its important decompositon products in a dc discharge.          Results of the Phase I study will provide the required design                   information for the Phase II development of a compact instrument for            on-line monitoring of plasma etching, plasma deposition, chemical vapor         deposition, or other chemical process.",
