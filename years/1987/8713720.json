 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  supports research by Prof. Joshua Goodman, which is aimed at                    the development of an experimental technique known as pulsed                    time-resolved photoacoustic calorimetry (PAC) and applying it                   to the solution of several important problems in organic                        chemistry and photochemistry.  This work is important because                   the PAC technique is capable of simultaneously measuring both                   dynamics and energies of light-induced reactions in solution.                   Photochemical reactions are processes of both fundamental and                   practical interest, so understanding the step-by-step                           structural and energetic changes involved in these reactions is                 an important goal.                                                                                                                                              Dr. Goodman's work has three principal objectives:  (1) to                      continue development of the PAC technique by extension to non-                  homogeneous media and by improvement of time resolution to the                  50-nanosecond regime; (2) to employ PAC techniques to measure                   bond dissociation energies in important chemical systems such                   as 1,4-biradicals, captodative radicals, and cation radicals;                   and (3) to determine the reactivity and energetics of non-                      spectroscopic reactive intermediates in cyclopropane                            isomerizations.  These novel measurements are possible because                  the photoacoustic technique can time-resolve the non-radiative                  decay processes of reactive intermediates such as those                         occurring in photochemical reactions.",
