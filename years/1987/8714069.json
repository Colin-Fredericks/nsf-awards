 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds for a Biological Facilities Center                 for Research and Development of Electro-Optical Microscopic                     Imaging Instrumentation.  The objective is to provide for the                   systematic invention and development of electro-optical                         microscopic imaging quantitation technologies and to facilitate                 the application of these new physical instrumentation                           capabilities through collaborative research in molecular cell                   biology.  The molecular dynamics of vital processes in living                   cells can be revealed and measured with the help of appropriate                 electro-optical microscopic image acquisition, photon counting                  quantitation of weak molecular fluorescence, and computerized 3D                digital image processing and storage with spatial and temporal                  transform analysis.  Collaborative interdisciplinary research on                cellular biophysical processes is to be accommodated in the                     facilities both to provide for cell biology research and to focus               the instrumentation developments on practicable research                        techniques that can be adapted by other laboratories.  The goal                 is to generate developments that optimize the trade off of                      sensitivity, speed, spatial resolution, and quantitation needed                 to study best, at the molecular level, the dynamical processes in               living cells.                                                                                                                                                   The investigator has a proven record of accomplishment in the                   development and application of biophysical methods.                             Establishment of this imaging center will directly benefit a                    substantial user community both at Cornell and within the wider                 community.",
