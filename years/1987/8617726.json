There have been Western scholars interested in                      Chinese and the other members of the family for about a century                 now, and they have gathered a great deal of information about                   the various languages in the family, adding that to the store                   of information accumulated by generations of Chinese scholars.                  This body of scholarship is however widely scattered, and of                    very uneven quality, which has been a major hindrance to                        further progress in reconstructing the history of the language                  family.                                                                                                                                                              The project proposed here is an extremely ambitious one:                   to bring together a major portion of the entire body of                         scholarly documentation of the Sino-Tibetan languages, and                      synthesize from it a coherent and accurate etymological                         dictionary and thesaurus of the entire family.  A successful                    completion of this project will bring Sino-Tibetan linguistic                   study much closer to the current level of accomplishment                        enjoyed by Indo-European linguistic research, and in so doing                   will constitute a major advance in linguistics generally.                                                                                                            The Principal Investigator proposing this project is                       arguably the only scholar in the world in a position to carry                   it out successfully, because of his vast erudition in the                       existing body of Sino-Tibetan scholarship and his brilliant                     abilities at historical analysis and argumentation.  He is now                  at the point in his career at which he feels prepared to                        undertake the mammoth task, and it is the good fortune of the                   field that he is willing and able to make this contribution.",
