 "awd_abstract_narration": "For this Phase II research project, the Spodoptera active                  B.t. strain EG 2058 will be used as a model to delineate the                    role of P1 and P2 proteins in the production of overall                         insecticidal activity.  Specific objectives include the                         indentification and characterization of a P1-type Spodoptera-                   active structural and regulatory toxin gene sequence in B.t.                    strain EG 2058 as well as a determination of the role of the P2                 type gene in encoding the Spodoptera activity.                                  Characterization of the Spodoptera-active P1 and P2 type gene                   expression will be performed by Western blot analysis of toxin                  proteins synthesized in B.t. strains constructed by microbial                   genetic or recombinant DNA technology.  The effect of the                       presence of additional P1-encoding toxin plasmids on the                        expression of cloned Spodoptera-active genes, will be examined                  using similar Western blot analysis.                                                 Data obtained in this research will permit the assessment                  of regulatory interaction occurring between both similar and                    dissimilar genes at the gene-product level, and the effects of                  these interactions on the ultimate insecticidal activities of                   strain containing multiple genes.  An understanding of these                    interactions will greatly facilitate the development of novel                   strains of B.t. having increased efficay against a variety of                   economically important target insects such as the army worm,                    Spodoptera exigna.",
