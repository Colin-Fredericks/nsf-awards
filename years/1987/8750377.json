 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is improving the undergraduate program in experimental             Physiology by introducing the use of video equipment and computer               interface devices for data acquisition and analysis.  Students are being        exposed to three current methodologies: a video-image analysis system,          an analog-digital converter system, and an x-y digitizing tablet.               Microprocessors are being used to analyze the output from the three             systems.                                                                                                                                                        The equipment is making it possible to introduce strikingly new                 laboratory exercises that improve both the accuracy and efficiency of           data acqusition and analysis, and that give undergraduates hands-on             experience with highly current research and analytical skills.  The             project is impacting students in eleven courses and in independent              student research covering three subdisciplines:  Animal Physiology,             Plant Physiology, and Physiological Psychology.",
