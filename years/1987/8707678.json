 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is aimed at maximizing the performance of                 recombinant cell fermentation processes through optimizing                      environmental conditions.  This goal is to be achieved by                       investigating two model systems:                                                                                                                                      -  alpha-amylase production from recombinant E. coli.                                                                                                           -  invertase production from recombinant Saccharomyces                             cerevisiae.                                                                                                                                            Environmental conditions strongly affect the transription                       efficiency of the genes under the control of regulated promoters,               and consequently the expression level of the target proteins.                   Growth temperature and medium osmolarity affect the expression                  and transport of alpha-amylase.  Invertase synthesis is                         influenced by the glucose content of a fermentation medium, which               influences the SUC2 promoter transcription efficiency and hence                 the invertase expression level.  A slowly metabolized inducer                   like sucrose monopalmitate may be more effective in increasing                  invertase production.                                                                                                                                           Model equations describing responses of the recombinant cell to                 various culture conditions will be formulated and incorporated                  into fed-batch fermentation processes in an effort to search for                an optimum operation strategy.  The mathematical modeling and                   optimization theory developed for nonrecombinant cells will be                  readily extended to recombinant cell cultures after taking into                 consideration unique features of recombinant cells such as                      plasmid stability and promoter induction.                                                                                                                       The PI is considered to be well qualified to carry out the                      proposed research and I recommend funding of this proposal.",
