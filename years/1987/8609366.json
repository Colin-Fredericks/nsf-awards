 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long-term sediment trap deployment provide an opportunity to            examine the fidelity of deep-sea sediments as recorders of near-                surface oceanic processes.  Such studies are important because a                fundamental assumption of paleoceanographic research is that the                micropaleontologic and sediment chemistry record can be used to                 examine changes in sea surface conditions over long geologic time               scales.  The present recommended award will support a multitracer               study of the relation of \"imput\" and \"preservation\" in marine                   sediments.  The use of stable isotope, geochemical, and                         micropaleontologic criteria should allow an accurate assessment                 of differences between deposited sediments and the initial                      surface water input.                                                                    The field phase of the project will deploy an array of                  sediment traps in the California Current system which has strong                seasonal gradients in net productivity and surface oceanography.                Analyses on the sediment trap material and surface sediments will               be used to develop a set of independent proxies for net                         productivity.  Components most likely to provide this information               include:  biogenous, calcareous, and siliceous microfossils;                    barite and bio-limiting trace elements such as copper and zinc;                 and organic matter and certain of its nitrogenous compounds                     including iodine, bromine, and phosphorous.  Such analyses should               allow an accurate definition of those signal carriers most highly               correlated to net biologic productivity.                                                The principal investigators are highly qualified to                     undertake the field and analysis portion of the project and have                successfully completed previous sediment trap projects.  Funding                is strongly recommended at the following levels:                                FY87 = $224,750; FY88 = $229,615; FY89 = $201,299.",
