 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal by Dr. Brenda Casper and her graduate                   student Mr. Roger Latham of the University of Pennsylvania,                     Philadelphia.                                                                        They postulate that differences among tree species in their                resource requirements as seedlings may not be responsible for                   species coexistence in humid temperate forests. The research                    proposed presents a well reasoned and tightly oraganized plan to                evaluate species differences in seedling response to different                  resources.  They will provide a comprehensive analysis of the                   response to resources of several interacting tree species.  Even                though limited to seedlings, they will be in a good position to                 evaluate the possibility of the general hypothesis referred to                  above, a definite empirical advance from the present situation,                 as we have many more ideas than data on the questions they                      address.  The context is well developed, and brings together some               ideas and results from population ecology, physiological ecology                and ecosystem ecology.  This integrative approach is much needed                and the pilot studies demonstrate that the proposed work will be                a good investment. Results will be of importance to forestry and                forest management.                                                                   Dr. Brenda Casper is gaining in stature in this area of                    ecology as attested by an enthusiastic reception for her most                   recent publications.  The University of Pennsylvania is well                    equipped to pursue this work to a successful completion.  The                   program recommends funding.",
