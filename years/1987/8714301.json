 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Biological Facilities Center proposal requests funding to                  establish an integrated plant propagation facility.  The facility               will include tissue culture facilities, growth chambers, and                    greenhouses.  It will be designed so that sensitive plant                       materials can be readily transferred between the tissue culture                 work area, the growth chambers, and the greenhouses with minimum                biological disturbance and risk of contamination.  The core                     research group includes both established, extremely well-funded                 senior individuals and beginning investigators.  The goal of this               Center is to become a world class center in the area of plants,                 microbes, and their interactions.  Ohio State has invested                      heavily in personnel and remodeling to generate well-equipped                   modern molecular biological research laboratories.  Also, major                 support facilities are already available.  These funds will                     complement Ohio State's  initiative by providing the greenhouses,               headhouses, growth chambers, and tissue culture facilities                      essential for developing a world class center.",
