 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Summary:  This research program is aimed at improving current          understanding of transport phenomenon of macromolecular solutes in              sheared suspensions in the laminar flow regime.  Using the novel                technique of multiple internal reflection fluorescence (MIRF), augmented        mass transfer is characterized by an effective diffusivity and is               determined using a rotating disc flow system.  The diffusion                    coefficients of several well characterized macromolecular solutes are           measured in aqueous suspensions as a function of suspension particle            volume fraction, particle size, particle rigidity, suspension                   viscosity/viscoelasticity, and system shear rate.                                                                                                               Practical Significance:  This study could lead to results that improve          our current understanding of augmented mass transfer in sheared                 suspensions by identifying and characterizing the important experimental        parameters and mechanisms involved in enhancing the diffusivities of            macromolecular solutes in sheared suspensions.  Chemical and biological         system areas that could benefit include:  1) better understanding of            polymer processing operations involving flows with phase change                 (crystallization, melting, etc.) as well as with dispersed and                  stratified multiphase flows; 2) better design of nonisothermal tubular          and CSTR reactors, packed and fluidized bed reactors, and extracorporeal        flow systems such as hemodialyzers and blood oxygenators; and 3) better         biomedical understanding of such disease processes as thrombogenesis,           atherogenesis, and hemolysis.",
