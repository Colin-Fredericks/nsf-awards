 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computers have revolutionized experimental methods in physics, yet              physics students have not had the equipment to use computers for data           acquisition and analysis.  The Physics Department at Harvey Mudd will           integrate computer systems into three laboratory experiments.  The first        experiment is in Fourier transform spectroscopy; it requires extensive          computation using the fast Fourier transform algorithm.  The second is a        photon statistics experiment, which requires the acquisition and                analysis of large quantities of data.  The third is an atomic                   spectroscopy experiment which relies upon computer-aided data                   acquisition to eliminate systematic drifts while increasing the signal-         to-noise ratio.  All three experiments depend critically on the                 judicious use of computers.  In order to equip these experiments, three         DEC LSI-11/2 microcomputers will be ungraded by the addition of hardware        and software for data acquisition and for communications to provide             access to the Harvey Mudd College central network of VAX computers.  In         addition, the department will purchase a stepping motor to complete a           Fourier transform spectrometer and photon counting accessories.  The new        equipment will be used in a junior-level optics laboratory, a senior-           level advanced laboratory, and in individual student research projects.",
