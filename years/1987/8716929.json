 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrical energy, whether in batteries or biological systems,                  accomplishes work through oxidation-reduction.  This reaction                   occurs by transferring electrons or atoms between molecules at                  slow or rapid rates depending on several factors.                                                                                                               This research is focused on determining how slowly or rapidly                   the transfer occurs for the simplest molecules that can                         participate in the reaction.  In the previous grant period such                 molecules as the industrial bleach chlorite and the atmospheric                 component nitric oxide have been investigated.  The results                     have led to a significant improvement in the understanding of                   this reaction.  The proposed research extends the studies to                    additional molecules including such common varieties as the                     oxygen we breathe and hydrogen peroxide and more unusual                        molecules such as BrCN.  The factors influencing the speed of                   the reaction such as the solvent in which it takes place will                   also be investigated.",
