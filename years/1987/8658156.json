 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Aziz has been selected as a Presidential Young                         Investigator.  He is active in fundamental research on kinetics                 of phase transformations and non-equilibrium materials, including               metastable materials.  In the research program for NSF he will                  pursue studies of crystal growth using short pulse lasers to                    achieve rapid melting and solidification.  He will examine defect               formation, microstructure, and segregation in crystals grown by                 this technique and relate the results to theories of rapid                      crystal growth.                                                                                                                                                      Dr. Aziz had three years research experience at Oak Ridge                  prior to joining Harvard University.  He is off to an excellent                 start in his career with several publications in the areas of                   solidification, pulsed laser melting, pressure effects on crystal               growth and icosahedral phase formation.  The facilities at                      Harvard University are excellent for performing the proposed                    program.  Funding of a five-year continuing grant is strongly                   recommended.",
