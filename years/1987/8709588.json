 "awd_abstract_narration": "In magnetic disk files and tape drives, the read/write element is               separated from the magnetic medium by a thin air bearing. In present            \"state of the art\" disk file, the air bearing flying height is                  approximately .33 um, and a reduction to less than .2 um is anticapated         in the near future. At those small spacings, contacts between the               read/write head and the magnetic medium are unavoidable. In addition            contacts occur during start/stop of the file and during track seeking.          Since these contacts cause wear of the  head/disk interface, a thorough         understantding of head/disk tribology is required, and extreme care must        be exercised in the design of the individual components to                      guarantee sufficient life time.                                                 This project is concerned with the mechanisms of wear and boundary              lubrication of oxide coated rigid magnetic disks. Friction and wear             experiments will be conducted on unlubricated and lubricated magnetic           medium, and accelerated wear tests will be designed. Analytical surface         instrumentation will be used to investigate lubricant distribution on           the disk, and theoretical modeling of the head/disk wear mechanism will         be conducted.",
