 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine two technologies presently entering             the commercialization stage to determine the impact that academic               research infrastructures, particularly those supported by the National          Science Foundation, have had on their emergence.  The study will trace          these technologies over the stages of their evolution, from initial             awareness of their potential through development, to their present              early commercialization.  Studied will be two technologies that have            faced a range of issues over their course.  Fiber optic cables and              high temperature superconductors are prime candidates for study.  The           aim will be to track the linkages (or lack of linkages) of university           research infrastructure to technological innovation.  The study will            analyze how factors internal and external to the university influenced          the role university research infrastructure played in the emergence of          these technologies.  The study seeks to provide anecdotal data on the           technologies studied that may help in understanding the role that               NSF/ENG can play in technological innovation in emerging engineering            technologies.",
