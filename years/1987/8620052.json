 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is an experiment in the acquisition,              use, and revision of knowledge for expert systems.  The system,                 named PROTOS, interacts with a human expert to elicit knowledge.                PROTOS then independently applies this knowledge to perform the                 expert task.  Our research addresses three fundamental issues in                concept formation and classification: First, PROTOS learns and                  uses naturally occurring, partially undefined concepts. Second,                 PROTOS uses learned knowledge in multiple ways, as people do, to                generate examples of a concept, to predict unseen features of an                object, to interpret ambiguous examples, and to explain its                     classification decisions. Third, PROTOS learns from                             teacher-supplied explanations, so that human experts can                        facilitate knowledge transfer beyond simply giving examples.                            Computer systems with intelligent behaviour must acquire and            reason with formidable amounts of knowledge.  Because it improves               the methods by which computers can absorb knowledge, this                       research is vitally important. The PROTOS system itself will                    first be applied, as a testbed example, to the task of learning                 expert knowledge for clinical audiology.",
