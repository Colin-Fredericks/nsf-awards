 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new astronomical observatory at Middlebury to be equipped through this        project will provide undergraduate students at all levels with an               outstanding experience in observational astronomy.  A professional              quality, computer-controlled 16-inch reflecting telescope will be used          to introduce beginning astronomy students to planets, stars, and                galaxies.  More experienced students will use this telescope for                photometry and photography in conjunction with astronomy courses, while         undergraduate thesis students will use it for research projects studying        variable stars or developing new instrumentation.  Three new 8-inch             telescopes will be used in lower-level astronomy courses to give                students a far greater opportunity for observational work than has              previously been possible.  The new telescopes and associated instruments        will enrich the entire astronomy curriculum at Middlebury College.  In          addition, the new observatory will become a community resource through          public viewing nights and programs for students in elementary and               secondary schools.",
