 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study concerns optically induced crystal growth of thin                    semiconductor films on amorphous insulators.  Growth of                         semiconductor films on insulators enables the fabrication of                    high-performance electronic devices.  Melting and                               recrystallization of such layers by scanning light sources is                   used to improve their electrical and crystalline properties.                    However, the development of this technique has been limited by a                lack of understanding of the associated phase change phenomena.                 In order to examine the effects of the light source intensity                   distribution, total power and motion, both experimental and                     theoretical investigations will be conducted.  Polysilicon will                 be used as the basic material, but work on compound                             semiconductors, such as GaAs, will also be initiated.  Moreover,                many aspects of the study can be directly applied to thin metal                 and amorphous semiconductor film thermal processing.  The primary               objectives of this project are; (1) to develop an experimental                  method for in-situ temperature measurement at the microscale, by                acquiring the processing surface reflectivity data, (2) to                      numerically simulate thin film melting by accurately tracking the               position of the moving phase boundary, (3) to examine the local                 crystal details by direct observations of the growth of                         interfacial microstructures, microscopy characterization, and                   theoretical analysis, and (4) to resolve the mechanism of                       radiatively induced in homogeneous film melting by experimental                 observation.",
