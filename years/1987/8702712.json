 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of Prof. John O. Rasmussen of             the University of California, Berkeley in a program of cooperative              research with Prof. Raul Donangelo and others at the Federal                    University of Rio de Janeiro, and Prof. Mahir Hussein of the                    University of Sao Paulo.  In this project, two-dimensional                      calculations of tunneling processes in heavy ion transfer, fission,             and fusion will be performed.  These calculations, which represent              a significant extension of earlier one-dimensional work, should                 lead to an increased understanding of the role played by tunneling              processes in heavy-ion nuclear reactions.                                                                                                                       Earlier collaborative research projects of these groups, supported              by the National Science Foundation, resulted in an understanding of             heavy-ion scattering and neutron transfer processes that was                    reported in several publications.  However, as the simpler                      questions about these processes have been answered, and as improved             computational facilities are now available, it has become both                  necessary and possible to extend the initial one-dimensional                    analyses to two dimensions, and particularly to study the role of               tunneling in these reactions.  Second-order multidimensional                    effects, such as those arising from the molecular cranking inertia,             should also be included.  The Brazilian collaborators have already              developed and tested multidimensional computer codes which                      incorporate some, but not all, of the effects required; the U.S.                investigators are developing additional codes themselves and, in                addition, have access to some codes developed at the Lawrence                   Berkeley Laboratory.  In addition, more substantial computer                    facilities are available at Berkeley than in Brazil.  Therefore,                the joint extension of the Brazilian codes, the incorporation of                the LBL codes, and the performance of the computations at Berkeley              represents an efficient collaboration which should result in a                  greater understanding of nuclear processes in general.",
