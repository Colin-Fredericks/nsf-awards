 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biology and Microbiology is incorporating the methods         of modern Molecular Biology and Biotechnology into the undergraduate            Microbiology laboratory curriculum.  The improvements are providing a           strong background in classical Microbiology, as well as giving students         hands-on experience with the techniques that have revolutionized                Microbiology and other Biological Sciences in the last decade.                                                                                                  Centrifuges, spectrophotometers, electrophoresis equipment, and                 microcomputers are being used to implement major improvements in                Bacterial Genetics and Bacterial Physiology laboratories.  These changes        ensure that the students receive modern instruction in the methods,             principles and applications of DNA isolation, electrophoretic separation        of DNA molecules and proteins, gene cloning techniques, DNA sequencing,         and the use of computers to evaluate DNA molecules.  Tissue culturing           equipment is being used to instruct Immunology students in the                  fundamentals of cellular and humoral immunity and to provide them with          experience in tissue culturing.",
