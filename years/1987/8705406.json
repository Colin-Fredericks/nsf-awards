 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Engineering Research Equipment proposal is for funds for a         scanning acoustic microscope to conduct a broad range of studies in             materials engineering, precision machining, physics, archaeometry,              and fiber and polymer science.  True acoustic microscopes are recent            developments that now have a resolution equal to that of a light                microscope.  The important difference between light- and acoustic-              microscopy is in the causes of image contrast.  Contrast in light               microscopy is due to the existence of and variations in optical                 indices of refraction and coefficients of optical absorption.  These            basic parameters are, in general, only indirectly related to the                material's physical properties; whereas, with the acoustic                      microscope, contrast within the image is due to variation in the                elastic, viscoelastic and density properties.  The image is thus not            dependent on visible light transmission.  Specific problems on which            the acoustic microscopy is to be used are: (1) to examine                       microscopic elastic and viscoelastic moduli and density variations              in ultra-oriented fibers produced by flow-induced orientation and               high-speed takeup; (2) to examine the interfacial regions using a               non-destructive procedure in reducing the moisture absorption of                epoxy resin/graphite fiber composites; (3) to characterize defects              in semiconductor materials and in developing new image analysis                 techniques; (4) to investigate the interface during strain in                   polymer matrix composites (the novel utility here is due to the                 composites being opaque to light but still transparent to ultra-                sound); (5) to assist the Precision Engineering Center (newly formed            at this university) in the characterization of subsurface damage;               and (6) to examine, count, and measure subsurface structures in                 archaeological specimens.",
