 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science manifestly has the capacity to change our views of the world.           Major transformations of our world view, however, are relatively                rare.  The paradigm case is that of the Scientific Revolution of the            16th & 17th Centuries in which the traditional view of a closed                 universe with the stationary earth at its center was replaced by an             infinite universe in which the earth is one of several planets                  circling the sun.  Another radical transformation of our world view             occurred at the start of the 19th century.  In this case, geological            sciences replaced the classical understanding of a brief history of             the earth traditionally derived from the Bible, to the vastly                   extended histories associated with modern radiometric methods and               modern cosmologies.  This temporal transformation, as significant in            its extent as the spatial transformation of the Scientific                      Revolution, is surprisingly poorly understood and is too often                  described in terms limited to the simplistic models of the conflict             of science and religion.  Although the issues are generally framed in           terms of an expanding time scale, the magnitude of time itself was              actually of less importance than the character of the history (of the           earth and of life, including human life) that was believed to have              filled it.  The crucial period in this outstandingly important                  development was the first half of the 19th century (with the last               years of the 18th).  With this grant, Professor Rudwick will                    undertake research necessary for a new synthetic account and                    interpretation of the building of earth-history during this decisive            half century.",
