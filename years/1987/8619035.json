 "awd_abstract_narration": "The U.S. coatings industry faces concurrent demands for                    improved quality, energy conservation, reduced pollution and                    elimination of unsafe materials, at the same time it is becoming                increasingly vulnerable to foreign competition.  The 1,100                      companies that produce coatings and their raw material supplies                 are responding to these changes in different ways, including                    increasing research and development budgets.  An                                Industry/University Cooperative Research Center is a possible                   approach that might provide industry with additional research                   addressing industrial needs.  This planning grant is studying the               feasibility and viability of an Industry/University Cooperative                 Research Center in coatings.                                                         The project is studying the alternative organization,                      policies, operations, and industrial research interests for an                  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center in Coatings at                  Eastern Michigan University and North Dakota State University, as               a joint endeavor.                                                                    The Co-Principal Investigator and the associated researchers               at both universities are national recognized experts in their                   fields and have the industrial contact necessary to study the                   potential for an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center                in Coatings.                                                                         This project has been coordinated with Robert M. Wellek,                   Chemical, Biochemical, and Thermal Engineering in the Directorate               for Engineering.                                                                     The Program Manager recommends that Eastern Michigan                       University (with a subcontract to North Dakota State University)                be awarded a grant of $49,927 for one (1) year of this project.",
