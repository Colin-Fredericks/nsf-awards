 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution proposes to                    write an informal history  of the ALVIN deep submergence                        program suitable for wide dissemination to a lay audience.  For                 more than two decades, ALVIN has served as the principal deep                   submergence facility for ocean science and has proved to be an                  essential tool for the investigation of ridge crest processes                   and a wide variety of other deep ocean phenomena.  In addition,                 ALVIN has received wide publicity for two major non-science                     missions:  the search for a hydrogen bomb lost in the crash of                  a B-52 aircraft off the coast of Spain in 1966, and her                         historic dive to the wreck of the TITANIC in 1986.                                      The ALVIN submersible has evolved significantly since                   her initial certification in 1964, including the addition of a                  titanium personnel sphere to permit a 4,000-meter dive                          capability, an entirely new propulsion system, exceptionally                    sensitive video equipment, and the almost continual evolution                   of her external sampling and grappling gear.  In fact,                          improvements to the original submersible have been so complete                  that not a single part of the early ALVIN remains in the                        present-day submersible.                                                                As significant as ALVIN's contributions have been to                    date, there is reason to expect continued -- perhaps even                       increased -- attention to the ALVIN program in the future.  The                 recent conversion of R/V ATLANTIS II to replace R/V LULU as                     ALVIN's support ship now provides the program with a new                        worldwide  capability as well as significantly enhanced                         laboratory support, maintenance facilities, and improved                        accommodations for scientists and the ALVIN team.  The upgrade                  of ALVIN's support ship seems certain to spur a major new era                   in ALVIN investigations.  Consequently, a history of the ALVIN                  program is particularly appropriate at the present time, and                    its publication will coincide with the 25-year anniversary of                   the ALVIN program.                                                                      The principal investigator has an excellent record of                   science publications for the lay audience, and her previous                     publications have focussed particularly on marine scientific                    research.  Ms. Kaharl's position at WHOI provides her with                      particularly good access to many of the principal figures in                    the history of the ALVIN program.                                                       Reviews in general were highly favorable, with some                     concern expressed regarding the high cost of this proposal in a                 period of tight budgets in NSF ocean science.  However, the                     reviewers were not aware that support of this proposal is to be                 a joint effort among the agencies which support the ALVIN                       program:  the Foundation, the Office of NAVAL Research, and the                 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  In addition,                  Program has negotiated a reduced budget which institution's                     representative has agreed is sufficient for this project to                     proceed.  Program has also expressed to institution's                           representative the particular importance of emphasizing the                     contributions of the ALVIN program to ocean science in addition                 to her well-known technological significance and her previously                 well-publicized achievements in ocean exploration.                              ALVIN has served with a remarkable record of safety,                            reliability, and effectiveness as the pre-eminent U.S. national                 facility for deep submergence research.  This is a story that                   fully deserves to be made publicly available.  Program                          recommends that an award be made at this time in the amount of                  $60,000.                                                                                This amount includes $15,000 from the National",
