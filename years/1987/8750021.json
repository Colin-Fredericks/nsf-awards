 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent acquisition of a photodiode array ultraviolet-visible                spectrophotometer is being used in the teaching of chemical principles          and laboratory techniques to chemistry majors, other science majors             and/or premedical students, and non-science majors at Davidson College.         The speed of the instrument allows complete spectra to be acquired              within seconds, displayed on a monitor, stored on disk, mathematically          manipulated, and printed. The instrument is being used for kinetic              experiments that require absorption values at more than one wavelength          to be measured simultaneously. It also serves as a detector for high            performance liquid chromatography, thus introducing students to                 principles of chromatography-spectrophotometry. Chemistry majors study          the principles of operation of this computer-controlled instrument, with        emphasis on concepts of digital electronics, instrument control, data           file structures, and data transfer operations. The instrument is also           used in student research projects involving organic photochemical               reactions, the characterization of transition metal complexes, and              investigation of the function of proteins.",
