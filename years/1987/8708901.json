 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multibody systems consist of several interconnected bodies                      (linkages) whose dynamics is in general described by a set of                   nonlinear, coupled differential and algebraic equations.  The                   incorporation of flexibility effects in such linkages                           dramatically increases the complexity of the system of equations.               However, the newly emerging technology of multiprocessors and                   concurrent processing offers a cost-effective means to increase                 computational speed by several orders of magnitude for certain                  problems; multibody dynamics being a prime candidate. There are                 several issues that must be resolved before multiprocessing                     systems can be used as a practical alternative to existing                      synchronous systems.                                                                                                                                            The goal of this Engineering Initiation project will be to                      formulate the multibody flexible system dynamics problem for                    efficient parallel execution on a multiprocessor, i.e. to select                as  formulation with maximum degree of intrinsic concurrency.                   Futhermore, a software package will be developed for execution on               a general multiprocessor.                                                                                                                                       The institutional support is adequate and the P.I. is well                      qualified to carry out the research.  I strongly recommend                      support.",
