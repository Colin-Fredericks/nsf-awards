 "awd_abstract_narration": "The function of the oligodendrocyte is the ensheathment of axons                with myelin in the central nervous system.  Myelin basic protein                (MBP) expression in oligodendrocyte cytoplasm is a prelude to the               onset of myelination.  Little is known regarding the regulatory                 signals that influence the development of oligodendrocytes and                  their progenitor cells.  Interleukin-2 (IL-2), a molecularly                    cloned T-cell derived lumphokine, induces oligodendrocyte                       proliferation and maturation (enhanced expression of MBP).  The                 precise biological role of IL-2 in the regulation of gliogenesis                is unknown at this time.                                                                                                                                        The proposed studies will investigate the cellular and molecular                mechanisms by which IL-2 influences the development of                          oligodendrocytes and glial progenitor cells.  To define the                     effect of IL-2 on oligodendrocytes, I will analyze how IL-2                     modulates the expression of myelination-specific antigens at both               the mRNA and protein level.  The influence of IL-2 on glial                     progenitor cell development will be studied as these cells can                  differentiate into either astrocytes or oligodendrocytes                        depending on culture conditions.  The role of IL-2 in regulating                their proliferation and differentiation will be examined.                       Studies will be done to identify, quantitate, and characterize                  the receptor for IL-2 on glial cells.  A binding asasy will                     determine the number and affinity of receptors, while                           characterization by biochemical means will allow for comparison                 with the lymphoid IL-2 receptor.                                                                                                                                Damage to oligodendrocytes and/or myelin leads to various                       pathological conditions typified by the demyelinating disease,                  multiple sclerosis (MS).  The proliferative capacity of mature                  oligodendrocytes and precursor cells, and their ability to                      regulate responses to injury are of extreme importance in                       wound-healing events.  Understanding the control of normal                      oligodendrocyte development by IL-2 will be of value in                         influencing the course of regeneration and remyelination in                     diseases such as MS.",
