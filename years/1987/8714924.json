 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Summary:  One important form of fluid microstructures is               the so-called liquid crystal.  In this project, highly pure polymer             liquid crystals will be synthesized under supercritical fluid                   conditions for the investigation of thermotropic behavior and for               novel applications in laser systems.  A sound understanding of                  structure-property relations will permit molecular design of                    polymer liquid crystals for desired applications in a number of                 technological areas involving interfacial and transport                         processes.                                                                                                                                                      Uniqueness/Innovation:  The proposed methodology, if                            successful, is innovative in that polymer liquid crystals can                   be prepared cost effectively in high purity to meet the needs                   of high energy laser technology.  To achieve the optical                        homogeneity as demanded in laser technology, it is proposed to                  carry out polymerization and purification simultaneously.  Polymer              liquid crystals reported in the literature have been consistently               prepared in liquid solvents,  where the subsequent removal of                   remaining solvent and unreacted monomer and the refinement of                   molecular weight distribution are both difficult to accomplish.                                                                                                 Significance/Technical Impact:  An economical approach to the                   preparation of polymer liquid crystals in high purity should                    have profound impact on a number of technological areas.  The                   synthesis of highly selective biologically active membranes,                    controlled administration of highly soluble drugs, thermally                    sensitive gas and vapor barriers, photoactive polymers, are                     examples of applications with potential benefits from the                       results of this proposed study.  The emphasis on polymer liquid                 crystals in relation to the laser technology should have                        immediate contributions to the induction of non-linear optical                  effects including frequency conversion, four wave mixing, laser                 beam self-focusing, and electro-optical switching.  The                         ultimate goal of this project is to furnish structure-property                  relations based on extensive analyses of highly pure liquid                     crystal samples, thereby providing a sound basis for molecular                  design for existing and new applications.",
