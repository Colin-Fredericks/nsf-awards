 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the impact of natural enemies and host                  plant variation on the population dynamics and success of a leaf                mining herbivore Phytomyza ilicicola which specializes on                       American holly.  The study is explicitly designed to test the                   idea that the first (host plant) and third (natural enemies)                    trophic levels interact to influence herbivore dynamics which can               not be understood without simultaneous consideration of both                    aspects.  Preliminary work has shown that leaf miner densities,                 survivorship, and oviposition preferences show consistent                       differences among trees, and between suburban and forest                        understory habitats.  These differences provide in effect a                     natural experiment for testing the impact of enemies and host                   nutrition on herbivore success.  The research effort will focus                 on four interrelated facets of the problem:  1) host plant                      quality, specifically variation among trees as resources; 2)                    density and survivorship responses of herbivores to resource                    variation among trees, and the mutual impact of resource                        variation and miner demic variation on oviposition response; 3)                 the direct influence of natural enemies and the interaction of                  natural enemies and resources on herbivore success; 4) and the                  relative influence of genetics, environment, and their                          interaction on host quality variation.                                                                                                                          Together, these aspects of the study will help to resolve some                  uncertainties in our standing of plant/herbivore interactions and               may aid in the development of biocontrol strategies in forestry                 and agriculture.",
