 "awd_abstract_narration": "A significant gap exists in composite materials technology in the area          of dynamic mechanical behavior studies.  Research to date has focused           primarily on studies of static behavior and properties.  Current and            anticipated applications of these materials also require an                     understanding of their behavior under dynamic loading conditions.               Recent research at the University of Idaho has emphasized the                   measurement and prediction of dynamic response and the use of dynamic           testing techniques to characterize the structural integrity of                  composite materials.  The research involves the development of                  analytical and experimental techniques for characterizing dynamic               mechanical properties of composites, the development of composite               materials with improved noise and vibration damping capacity, the               characterization of material properties and material integrity by the           use of dynamic measurements, and the study of dynamic characteristics           of composite interfaces and viscoelastic adhesive joints.  This                 research has identified several key problems and the equipment provided         by this grant will be used for addressing and solving those problems.",
