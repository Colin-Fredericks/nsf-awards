 "awd_abstract_narration": "Energy balance and constancy of body temperature are controlled                 by the brain in relation to changing conditions of an animal's                  body and environment. An attempt will be made here to investigate               the characteristics of this regulatory system by studying an                    exceptional situation: the brief nightly period of 1-10 hours                   when the normal constancy of body temperature is abandoned as an                energy conserving measure by one of the smallest known warm-                    blooded animals, a hummingbird. Like hibernating mammals,                       hummingbirds can enter a physiological state of torpor, in which                metabolic rate and body temperature are greatly reduced. The kind               of information about the internal state of the bird and the                     environment that is integrated by the physiological control                     system that initiates torpor will be determined. The special role               of torpor in making possible the rapid and repeated weight gain                 necessary to achieve long-distance migration will also be                       investigated. Although hummingbirds enter the deepest state of                  torpor known among birds, almost every species of bird studied,                 as well as many mammals, reduce nighttime body temperature and                  metabolic rate to some degree in times of energy shortage.                      Torpor also appears to be analagous to human sleep.                                                                                                             Thus torpor in hummingbirds provides an opportunity to study                    series of generally important physiological fundamentals with                   the special experimental advantages afforded by an exception                    to the rule of constant regulation.",
