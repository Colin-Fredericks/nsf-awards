 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important new phase in the study of parallel execution of logic              programs is the development of efficient implementation techniques.             This project focuses on the design of a virtual machine for the AND/OR          Process Model, an abstract execution model in which user goals are              solved by independent objects communicating via messages.  This work            can be characterized as an attempt to do for the AND/OR Process Model           what the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM) did for Prolog:  achieve                 significantly faster execution through compilation to a virtual machine         tailored to the model of computation.                                                                                                                           Important aspects of a virtual machine for logic programs are the               representation of binding environments and instructions that control            the order in which goals are solved.  The proposed machine will build           what they call \"closed environments,\" environments that have little or          no interaction,so that they can be built and moved anywhere in a                multiprocessor system.  Minimal interaction between environments is             important if the system will be implemented on a non-shared memory              multiprocessor.  The instruction set of the virtual machine will be             tailored to operations of a new method for controlling AND-parallel             processing.",
