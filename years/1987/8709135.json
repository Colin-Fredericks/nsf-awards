 "awd_abstract_narration": "The New York State Museum houses numerous collections                      dealing with the archaeology of New York State and the northeast.               These materials are irreplaceable and crucial to our                            understanding of the prehistory of the eastern United States.                   Collected systematically by prominent archaeologists, they are an               important research resource both for the long sequence of                       occupation that they represent and for their regional character.                Unfortunately, they have suffered because of past housing                       problems.                                                                            The New York State Museum recently moved to new climate-                   controlled quarters.  This project, part of a three stage                       program, will upgrade curatorial standards.  The staff will                     inventory the collections, reorganize the way the objects are                   stored, and conduct a survey for conservation needs.  They will                 also develop a computerized inventory.  These procedures will                   help stop the deterioration of the collection and make the                      objects more accessible to researchers.",
