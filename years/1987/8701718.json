Specifically, the PI will investigate:  1) Diffusion and           association in solutions of alcohols and carboxylic acids; 2) Sol               formation by the hydrolysis of organo-silicon esters; 3) Component              activities for oil-in-water and water-in-oil microemulsions; and 4)             Stability and formation mechanisms of Silicone oil/nonionic                     surfactant/water microemulsions. This research group was one of the             very first to use the tools of light scattering and vibrational                 spectroscopy in investigating non-ideal solutions at the molecular              scale.  They combine light-scattering, which is sensitive to aggregate          size, with vibrational spectroscopy (IR-Raman) sensitive to the                 changes at the functional group (O-H, C-H etc.) level, to find out              what molecular processes and reactions are responsible for the usual            macroscopic behavior of non-ideal solutions.                                                                                                                    Technical Impact:                                                                                                                                               The impact of this research will be at several levels:  1) The                  research on association through hydrogen bonding is desperately                 needed in developing and refining predictive models of                          diffusion and thermodynamic activity in non-ideal solutions.                    These data are used in designing common separation processes                    such as liquid-liquid extraction and distillation, as well as                   gas purification; 2) Development of new processes to form                       narrow distribution silica sols in the 100 A size range from                    organic esters of silicon will be very useful for producing                     regulated secondary size standards for electron microscopy and                  light scattering instrument makers.  A second and equally                       useful application will be in optical thin film coatings for                    high power laser optics.  Finally, what is learned here is                      directly transferable to production of high purity, exotic                      ceramic powders; 3) Developing new methods of silicon oil                       microemulsion formation, and understanding the molecular                        parameters affecting their stability will impact the cost and                   shelf life of this new class of microemulsions.  Silicone oil                   microemulsions have the potential to be used extensively as                     textile softeners as well as in cosmetic products.",
