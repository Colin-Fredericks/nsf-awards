 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Taut Batu are a little studied, pre-literate tribal                    group of the Phillipines.  Living in a restricted mountainous                   area, they have an unusual settlement pattern:  some local groups               live in specially designed \"tree houses\" which are seasonally                   abandoned for dwellings in caves.  This project is designed to                  understand the relationship of this special type of settlement                  pattern and dwelling with regards to environment, social                        structure, religion, and daily interaction patterns.                                 This study will extend our understanding about the                         relationship between material culture and the non-material                      aspects of culture in a social context.  It will benefit both                   ethnology and archaeology with regards to the inferences about                  behavior, values, and symbols that can be made from physical                    objects such as houses.                                                              This study will have practical as well as theoretical                      benefits.  It will provide development agencies with an interest                in cultural minority resettlement with information on housing and               the people's point of view on the quality of life of their                      housing.",
