 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is for continued support of ECE-8408227.  The aim is to             predict the ground motion at a particular construction site in terms of         the earthquakes expected to occur on neighboring faults.  The prediction        is based upon a knowledge of physical processes occurring in the fault          zone, the historical record of earthquakes on the fault, the properties         of the lithosphere through which the seismic waves propagate, and the           response of the ground at the particular site to the incoming seismic           waves.                                                                                                                                                          The focus will be on:  (1) development of a unified theory for                  estimating source parameters of a characteristic earthquake from                geophysical and geological observations on a fault, (2) further study on        the relation between long-term seismicity and the quality factor of the         Earth's crust, (3) study of the limit of applicability of the 1-D model         for soil amplification and (4) study of the effect of non-linearity on          strong ground motion.                                                                                                                                           The PI is internationally recognized for his research in this area.  He         has the ability and institutional facilities available to complete the          research proposed which is expected to yield information which is               urgently needed by geotechnical engineers for earthquake hazard                 mitigation.",
