 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Gentry and Giese plan to continue and expand a program of                  research involving the following types of experiments.  (1)                     Molecular beam experiments will be carried out to measure                       differential cross sections for the benchmark chemical                          exchange reaction between deuterium atoms and hydrogen                          molecules. (2) Photodissociation dynamics for both small and                    large molecules will be examined by time-of-flight measurements                 on the fragments with very high resolution.  (3) The decay of                   weakly-bound molecular clusters will be measured in real time                   following vibrational excitation of the cluster, in order to                    study the dynamics of energy flow within the cluster.  (4) A                    new apparatus incorporating vacuum-UV photoionization and mass                  spectral analysis will be used to measure cross sections for                    growth, exchange, and metathesis reactions of weakly bound                      clusters as functions of kinetic energy.  (5) Energy flow and                   reaction dynamics in electronically excited states of simple                    van der Waals molecules will be examined by laser induced                       fluorescence and chemiluminescence spectroscopy.  (6) A unique                  time-of-flight apparatus will be used to study the properties                   and applications of extreme gas expansions in generating                        super-cold gas phase species.                                                                                                                                   These investigators have made and are continuing to make                        important new technical constributions to experimental                          capabilities.  The pulsed nozzle which they developed has been                  adopted by many other groups.  Their proposed work on                           generating super-cold gas phase species is also expected to                     find applications in future research.  The importance of the                    hydrogen exchange reaction is its extreme importance for                        fundamental and rigorous comparison between theory and                          experiment in chemical kinetics.  Experiments with super-cold                   molecules are expected to provide data which will be sufficient                 to distinguish between competing theories.",
