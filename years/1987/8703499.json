 "awd_abstract_narration": "Use of NMR Imaging for Research in Plant Physiology:  The               usefulness of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been                 established in medical diagnosis and research.  It should be                    equally useful in studying plant physiology especially where it                 is desireable to monitor non-destructively the changes in water                 content of living tissue over time.  Improvements in resolution                 and definition now make it possible to obtain good images at                    the microscopic as well as the macroscopic level.  Subjects to                  be investigated include:  water movement from soil to roots;                    efflux of water from roots to dry soil; effects of root                         shrinkage on water absorption; radial movement of water in                      roots; water movements to leaves and xylem changes in water                     during drying and rehydration.                                                                                                                                          The proposal has the potential of answering definitively                many questions that have been only half answered for several                    decades.  The application of MRI has many potential                             applications in crop science and in agricultural research.  The                 knowledge acquired, thereby, could easily lead to the                           development and screening of novel hybrids.",
