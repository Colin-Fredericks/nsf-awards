This novel laboratory experience             (which involves videotaping physics laboratory experiments and \"real            world\" experiments that cannot be directly performed in the classroom)          will allow the student to gather data and to learn at his or her own            rate in an interactive mode.  The equipment consists of Macintosh               computers, video cameras, and recorders.  Students will make detailed           measurements on successive video frames using the computer and analyse          the motion which has been recorded.  It is expected that this project           will enable students to better appreciate and learn physics.",
