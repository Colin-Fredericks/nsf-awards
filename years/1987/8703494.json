 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a fundamental study of the role of cellular dislocation                 structures in the deformation and fracture of materials.  It is                 an outgrowth of previous work on the fundamental mechanisms                     controlling the steady-state response of cellular dislocation                   structures produced by fatigue.  Since dislocation cellular                     microstructures and their behaviors are archetypical of the                     inhomogeneous structures and inhomogeneous behaviors that                       characterize the deformation of many ductile crystalline                        materials, the scope of this work is broadened to study                         dislocation cellular microstructures as phenomena.  From the                    theoretical point of view, several issues are addressed, such as                internal stress development, the stabilizing forces that lead to                a dynamic steady state, the evolution of cell structures from                   restricted random dislocation activity, the motion of cell walls,               the detailed dislocation mechanisms for slip and dynamic recovery               and the onset of instabilities that lead to fracture.                           Experimentally, this project addresses two of what are believed                 to be the most significant issues related to cell structures that               can be settled experimentally, namely the effects of deformation                cell structures (or their absence) in fracture toughness and the                effects of partial (or recovery) anneals on the behavior of                     isothermally formed cellular dislocation structures.  The former                will be very valuable to the fracture community and its ongoing                 examination of the shielding concept, while the latter will                     address the contribution of vacancies and internal stresses to                  the observed mechanical response of fatigued metals.",
