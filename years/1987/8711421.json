 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objectives of this project are to anticipate impacts               in environmental applications of biotechnology and to illuminate                ethical and value issues embedded in them.  These issues stem from              scientific uncertainty, the varying impact of the new technologies              on different sectors of society, and disagreements as to how and by             whom regulatory decisions should be made.  Throughout the project,              oversight will be provided by a balanced advisory board.  The                   project is divided into two phases.  In the first phase, the                    principal investigator and team members will write detailed                     technical scenarios for analyzing potential impacts for three                   specific applications of biotechnology: fast growing tree clones,               herbicide resistant plants, and the decontamination of hydrocarbon              wastes.  The scenarios will be shared with scientists and                       policymakers in industry, government, academia and public interest              organizations.  Representatives of these groups will be interviewed             to ensure that the scenarios identify the major alternative                     projections of future impacts of biotechnology and illuminate the               scientific, social and political judgments and values implicit in               the different perspectives.  In the second phase of the project,                the team will develop a casebook and simulation exercise based on               the scenarios, for use with lay audiences.  The simulation will                 involve participants in choosing and negotiating among conflicting              data, disciplines, theories, values and public policy options.                  These and other background materials will be the basis for a one                and one-half day conference.  Fifty participants, representing the              major interest groups in North Carolina that are likely to become               involved in issues concerning the commercial applications of                    biotechnology, will be invited.  The conference, including small                group simulations, will be taped and transcribed.  Results will                 include a series of scholarly articles.  Ultimately the team hopes              to publish a book and make the casebook and simulations available               nationally.                                                                                                                                                     This project will illuminate ethical and value issues associated                with environmental applications of biotechnology.  It will also                 provide a model for reasoned deliberation and negotiation about                 choices and decisions which must be made about them.  The principal             investigator is very well qualified to undertake this project and               she has credibility with from diverse interest groups that is                   necessary to make it successful.  Institutional support is good;                costs are reasonable; the research plan is both innovative and                  feasible; and results are likely to be useful and influential.                  Total support in the amount of $82,448 ir recommended, of which                 $62,448 comes from the National Science Foundation and $20,000 from             the Department of Agriculture.  Of the total, $40,000 is awarded in             this fiscal year.  $42,488 will be awarded in fiscal year 1988.",
