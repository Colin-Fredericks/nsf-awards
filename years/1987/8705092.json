 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits publication of Dr. Brown's five volume Spiro                 Studies Reports. Since they were written some time ago, they will               be revised and then edited and published in the Memoir Series of                the Museum of Anthropology, University of Michigan.                                                                                                             The Sprio site provides the key archaeological record of                        Mississippian Period developments in the U.S. Eastern woodlands.                This period saw the rise of a level of social complexity which                  nearly rivaled that seen in the civilizations of Middle and South               America. The site provides a 600 year record of mound                           construction, site use and burial practices. The original data                  was generated through WPA sponsored excavations which took place                between 1936 and 1941. Spiro has also yielded a large quantity                  and variety of prestige goods and these can be used to                          reconstruct large scale trade networks and social stratification.               Dr. Brown's analysis provides an essential informational base for               this long sequence and presents data on a wide range of                         materials. The reports total over 1200 pages and includes over                  200 mounted illustrations. Although the information existed in                  manuscript form for some time, it is not widely available and                   this publication should alleviate the problem.                                                                                                                  Since this research was supported with government funds, and such               work achieves its full value only when the results are                          disseminated, it is important to publish these manuscripts. They                will aid archaeologists in their interpretation of the American                 past.",
