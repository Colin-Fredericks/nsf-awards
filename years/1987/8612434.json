 "awd_abstract_narration": "The synthesis of complex molecules provides the driving force for the           development of new synthetic strategies.  This research, in the Organic         and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, is centered around the                    development of highly regio- and stereoselective synthetic methods.  A          major area concerns the development of methods based on the cyclization         of chains so constructed as to allow cleavage or detachment of the              cyclized appendage, thus controlling regio- and stereochemistry of              carbon-carbon bonds formed by addition at both ends of an unactivated           double bond.  Other areas of interest to this research concern the              development of a general method for the formation of polypropionate-            derived sequences of any stereochemistry.  Finally, the possible design         of molecules which might produce chiral induction in catalytic                  hydrogenation is considered.  Dr. Stork's prior research has resulted           in the publication of nineteen technical articles.",
