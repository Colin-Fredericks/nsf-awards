 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will examine in detail the regulation of the PR1          set of the Pathogenesis-Related (PR) proteins whose synthesis in                tobacco plants is induced by infection with Tobacco Mosaic Virus.               Preliminary work indicates that the level of PR1 transcripts increases          after infection.  The proposed research will investigate the cause of           the increase by measuring individual transcription rates and mRNA               stabilities, and will determine if translational regulation also                occurs.  If appropriate, regulatory elements of the PR1 genes will be           identified.  The fate of the PR1 proteins will also be examined.                Preliminary evidence indicates that the proteins are secreted; the              secretory pathway and eventual extra-cellular localization (if any) of          the proteins will be examined using a combination of genetic and                cytological techniques.  Finally, transgenic plants that                        constituitively over-express PR1 proteins will be constructed in an             effort to identify the function(s) of the PR1 proteins.                         It has long been known that infection of vascular plants by fungi,              viruses or bacteria often leads to a so-called hypersensitive response.         Besides the death of nearby tissue, which helps limit the spread of the         infectious agent, the response frequently leads to establishment of             resistance to the pathogen (\"acquired resistance\") throughout the               plant.  Resistance is not limited to the original infectious agent;             thus, for example, a bacterial infection can lead to resistance to              viral infection.  Furthermore, certain chemicals can also elicit the            response.  More recently, it has been shown that the response is                accompanied by the synthesis of a number of small proteins whose role           in resistance is still unclear.  The proposed research will clarify the         genetic mechanisms that regulate synthesis of one set of such                   Pathogenesis-Related proteins and, as well, identify the eventual fate          of the proteins following their secretion by the cell.  The research            should advance significantly our understanding of gene regulation and           of the disease process in plants.",
