 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will investigate the individualization               of land in American Samoa, which is a consequence of social and                 economic changes following World War II.  Specifically, the                     researcher will analyze the legal aspects of individual ownership               in a society where communal land is protected by law, understand                the process of individualization, the reaction of conservative                  individuals who call for a return to indigenous forms of land                   tenure, and the affects of changes on family organization.                           This project will contribute to our understanding of culture               change by looking at a society and its traditional structures as                it is transformed on becoming part of the world economic system.                It will also contribute to our knowledge of the processes                       affecting land tenure and the attitudes and values which                        accompany change.                                                                    This research will make a practical contribution as well as                a theoretical contribution.  Too little is known about land                     tenure and the social consequences of programs of agricultural                  and housing development.  Since, the project will address world                 wide concerns of land alienation and access to food resources, it               will provide information for policy development.",
