 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to investigate the characteristics of              intense electron beam sources based on laser-generated photoelectrons at        the surface of an organic thin film on a metal substrate.  Recent work          has demonstrated that high current densities and large total currents           can be generated by laser illumination of conventional photocathodes in         ultrahigh vacuum environments, and also that organic thin films can             serve as excellent photoelectron sources.  The advantages of organic            films include greatly reduced vacuum requirements and ease of                   fabrication. This project will determine the energies, energy spreads,          angular divergences, and apparent source sizes of photoelectrons from           organic-thin films.  The temporal behavior of the emission will be              investigated with various laser wavelengths and pulse lengths.  Films           containing active molecules in a host, and more than one type of active         molecule, will be evaluated, as well as coatings of a single material.          Substrate effects will also be explored.  A kinetic model of the                emission process will be developed to explain the temporal and spectral         characteristics.  The proposed research program is an investigation of          new techniques and materials, particularly nonlinear organic thin films,        which can be used to generate electron beams of high current density            under intense illumination by a laser.  Electron beams of high                  brightness can be used for integrated circuit lithographic exposure, for        instruments such as microprobes and electron microscopes; for point-            source X-ray generation, and for large scale devices such as                    accelerators and free electron lasers.  Laser-generated results indicate        that kiloampere currents can be produced easily.  Synchronized emission         from multiple emitters as well as optically controlled beam shapes are          possible with this technique. Because high current densities and small          spot sizes with extremely rapid spot deflection can be achieved, the            interaction of these beams with semiconductors should make possible some        very useful signal processing and switching applications.",
