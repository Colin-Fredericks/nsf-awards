 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Dr. Deagan and her colleagues to continue                    archaeological research at the site of En Bas Saline which is                   located about 10 kilometers east of Cap Haitien, Haiti. It is                   believed that this marks the location of La Navidad the                         settlement established by Christopher Columbus from the timbers                 salvaged from the Santa Maria. Dr. Deagan's past work at the site               has focussed on this early European presence. (While the site                   contains early Spanish remains, it is still not certain whether                 it is, in fact, La Navidad.) Excavation has clearly demonstrated                however the presence of an earlier native American village and it               is possible to trace the history of this village through pre and                post contact periods. This grant will allow Dr. Deagan to focus                 on this non.Spanish component of the site.                                                                                                                      Based on an electromagnetic survey, anomalies which indicate                    subsurface disturbance have been located. A selected sample of                  these will be excavated and are expected to yield ceramic and                   other cultural remains as well as fauna and human skeletons.                    Analyses of materials will permit estimation of population size                 and how this changed over time, of settlement organization and of               diet. It should be possible to establish a pre Hispanic baseline                and then examine the effects of contact with the Spanish. Through               analysis of the skeletons, one can determine how diet and disease               patterns changed during this period and what the biological                     response was.                                                                                                                                                   This research is important because it will shed light on human                  response, both cultural and biological, to severe stress.                       Hispaniola, prior to European contact contained one of the                      largest population aggregates in the New World. It had achieved a               complex chieftan level of organization. Within a century of                     European contact these people had become extinct through Spanish                action and through exposure to disease. Hoepfully we can gain                   insight into human adaptation from this unfortunate case.",
