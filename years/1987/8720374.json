 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this grant is to provide partial support for the                 preparation of a handbook on risk assessment for scientists and                 decision makers. The handbook is being prepared by the Office of                Environmental Quality with the assistance of one or more contractors.           The handbook will provide background on risk assessment and its use in          characterizing risks. The handbook will also include two appendices.            The first appendix will review the theoretical and methodological               literature on biotechnology risk assessment. The second appendix will           review the theoretical and methodological literature on ecological risk         assessment. For purposes of writing these appendices, expert papers             will be commissioned and expert workshops will be held.                                                                                                         Despite the importance of risk assessment in decision making, no                attempt has been made to integrate knowledge from theoretical and               applied studies. This innovative project will review the risk                   assessment literature in order to develop a comprehensive guide to              recent developments in risk assessment theory and methods. It is                expected that the project will provide important information both for           individual research scientists and for government research programs.            Specifically, it is expected that the results of the study will (l)             contribute to the development of improved understanding of the role of          risk assessment in the decision making process; (2) identify gaps in            scientific knowledge and needs for research,  and (3) provide  critical         access to information on models and methods for  addressing difficult           and complex issues in risk assessment and management.",
