 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  supports research by Prof. David Reingold, which is aimed at                    elucidating features of electronic interactions between atoms                   in a molecule which are not bonded to each other.  Organic                      chemists believe they have a sound understanding of electron                    sharing between bonded carbon atoms.  However, recent advances                  in the synthesis of strained-ring organic molecules demonstrate                 gaps in our understanding of the concepts of bonding and                        electron-sharing.  This work is aimed at synthesizing and                       exploring the chemistry of molecules which have significant                     electron density between non-bonded atoms.                                                                                                                      Two different projects are planned.  In the first, Dr. Reingold                 plans to prepare a family of compounds which should provide a                   test of the Goldstein-Hoffmann theory of through-space                          (longicyclic) conjugation.  In the second, Dr. Reingold will                    synthesize what could be the first bishomobenzene derivative, a                 cyclopropasemibullvalene.  On rearrangement, this should                        provide the first planar, electronically unperturbed                            \u01318!annulene.",
