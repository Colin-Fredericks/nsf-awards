 "awd_abstract_narration": "The oviduct exerts a profound effect on sperm motility prior               to fertilization.  In several mammals, including cattle, sperm                  are sequestered in the caudal, or lower, oviduct.  During the                   period surrounding fertilization, sperm gradually ascend to the                 ampullary region of the oviduct and their motility is                           hyperactivated.  These phenomena have been studied indirectly in                large mammals and directly, but to a limited extent, in the                     mouse.  An in vitro system would be extremely useful to examine                 the endocrinological, physiological, and biochemical mechanisms                 governing these phenomena.                                                           The purpose of this project is to establish an in vitro                    system for studying the interaction of mammalian sperm with                     oviductal epithelium, and to ascertain the effect of epithelial                 secretions upon sperm motility.  Four functionally distinct                     regions of bovine oviduct will be cultured in vitro:  the                       uterotubal junction, the caudal isthmus, the cephalic isthmus,                  and the ampulla.  The effect of the hormonal conditions of the                  estrous and periovulatory periods on the cultured tissue will be                examined by electron microscopy, especially to establish the                    morphological integrity of the tissue.  In the oviduct, these are               the critical periods for sperm transport, storage, capacitation,                and fertilization.  In the second phase of the project, sperm                   will be co-cultured with the tissue.  Observations will be made                 on sperm interaction with the tissue, such as adherence to                      isthmic epithelium, suppression of motility by tissue from the                  caudal isthmus, and hyperactivation of motility by tissue from                  the cephalic isthmus and ampulla.  The role of the hormonal                     environment will also be examined. Finally, the effect of culture               supernatants on sperm behavior will be observed, with the long                  term goal of identifying factors responsible for such phenomena                 as hyperactivated motility and motility suppression.  In addition               to allowing the study of sperm transport and motility, the                      development of an in vitro system of co-culturing sperm with                    oviductal tissue could be utilized in the study of sperm                        capacitation and fertilization.",
