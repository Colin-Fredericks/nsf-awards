 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant allows Dr. Grayson to prepare illustrations for                      inclusion in a monograph to be published by The American Museum                 of Natural History. This volume reports results of analysis of                  faunal materials from three deep stratified rockshelters and                    caves excavated in the northern half of the U.S. Great Basin:                   Danger Cave, Last Supper Cave and Hanging Rock Shelter. All these               sites contain sizeable vertebrate faunas which span over 10,000                 years and which come from areas for which little information on                 mammalian history and on interactions between prehistoric peoples               and animal communities are available.                                                                                                                           The monograph is of significance for three reasons. First it                    provides information on the changing environments in the American               West and how different species of animals responded to it. This                 helps to explain the distributions of small mammals which one                   sees today. Secondly, the research sheds light on how prehistoric               peoples used this environment and obtained their subsistence from               it. Finally, Dr. Grayson and his colleagues have worked to test                 and develop new methods for analyzing faunal materials. These                   techniques should be useful to a large number of reseachers.                                                                                                    This grant is important because it will allow full publication of               this NSF supported research. Such work only gains full value if                 it is widely disseminated and the American Museum publication                   will make this possible.",
