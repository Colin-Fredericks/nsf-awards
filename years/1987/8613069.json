 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this basic engineering research is to produce an                 instrument that will very accurately measure the velocity of some waves         in tissue.  Ultrasound has become a useful clinical tool, especially in         the formation of images of internal organs.  However, the accuracy of           the formation of images of internal organs depends upon the information         placed into the computer to interpret the measurement.  One major reason        that the ultrasound imaging pictures are not yet very clear is that the         tissue data placed in the computer and used by the computer to form the         image is not sufficiently detailed or accurate.                                                                                                                 This research is developing new instrumentation to gain more accurate           and detailed data which can then be placed in the computer for                  interpretive purposes.  In addition this research will develop the means        to use data for forming a better physical understanding of tissue and           its physical properties.",
