 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term objective of this proposed research is to understand          the hormonal control of a developmentally regulated gene.  The                  Drosophila larval serum protein gene, LSP-2,  will serve as a model             system since its transcription occurs only in the fat body tissue during        the last stage of larval development and is stimulated by high titers of        the arthropod hormone, ecdysterone.  The two major objectives of this           project will be to identify and characterize 1) the cis-acting                  regulatory DNA sequences and 2) LSP-2-specific transcription factors            required for both initiation and ecdysterone stimulation of LSP-2               transcription.  The specific aims of this proposal are 1) Identification        of cis-acting and LSP-2 regulatory sequences by gene transfer of LSP-2-         hybrid genes into cultured Drosophila cells, 2) Mapping of DNase-               hypersensitive sites surrounding LSP-2 genes in transformed cell lines          and larval fat body tissue to determine changes in chromatin associated         with gene activity, 3) Demonstration and characterization of non-histone        chromosomal proteins bound to cis-acting LSP-2 regulatory sequences             during expression in cultured cells and larval fat body tissue.                     This study will serve to elucidate at the molecular level mechanisms        by which gene expression can be regulated in terms of tissue, hormone           and stage of development.",
