 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research proposed has significance in the area of                           catalysis.  The results of this work will aid in the                            development of the synthetic fuels area.                                                                                                                        It is proposed to use the complexes, trans-RIr(CO)LL,R = alkyl                  or alkoxy and L = phosphorus donor, to examine bond forming                     reactions.  These sixteen-electron square planar complexes                      readily add molecules bringing carbon and hydrogen, oxygen and                  hydrogen, carbon and carbon, and oxygen and carbon bonds into                   cis positions on the iridium.  In many cases the formation of                   bonds in a reductive elimination reaction is observed.  For                     instance C-H and O-H bond formation occur by addition of                        dihydrogen, HX or metal hydrides to trans RIr(CO)L, C-C bond                    formation occurs by addition of some alkyl halides and acid                     chlorides to trans RIr(CO)LL (R=alkyl) and C-O bond formation                   occurs by addition of acid chlorides and aldehydes to trans                     ROIr(CO)LL.  The unique feature of this proposal is the ability                 to study different bond forming reactions from analogous                        complexes.  Such a systematic investigation may allow a greater                 understanding of the mechanisms of bond formation by reductive                  elimination reactions.",
