 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major challenge in exploring the coupling between the                         mesosphere and thermosphere is to obtain appropriate data.                      Part of the reason so little is known about this altitude                       region is the difficulty in making adequate measurements.  For                  example, the ability to use incoherent scatter radar to examine                 the high-latitude thermosphere and mesosphere and to                            investigate the coupling between these regions requires                         sophisticated radar techniques. These techniques include Barker                 coded pulses, multiple pulses, coded long pulses, high-                         resolution intermediate pulse lengths, and pulse-to-pulse                       sampling.  Because of system hardware limitations, only                         primative versions of these techniques have been implemented at                 the Sondrestrom Radar Facility.  This situation is changing:                    the entire receiver and data-taking systems are currently being                 upgraded.  The upgraded system will create the opportunity for                  a large number of long-awaited new observations in the                          mesosphere/lower thermosphere region at very high latitudes.                    This award will provide for the necessary software development                  and data analysis to permit these observations and use them to                  attack the mesosphere/lower thermosphere coupling problem.",
