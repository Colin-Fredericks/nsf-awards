 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study concerns a novel application of immunochemistry to               oceanography.  The surface layers of the ocean are inhabited by                 vast numbers of organisms, most of which are too small to be seen               with the naked eye.  Characterizing the organisms present                       therefore, requires time consuming microscopic work on sea water                samples.  This work will develop a method borrowed from                         biotechnology to enable oceanographers to rapidly screen samples                for the presence of plant cells called dinoflagellates that are                 common in coastal U.S. waters.  The technique involves the                      production of antibodies that react only with a specific type of                chemical, in this case, chemicals that are characteristic of                    certain marine plant cells.  A rapid and reliable technique to                  identify dinoflagellates may be a valuable propholactic against                 the toxic effects of these plant cells to coastal shell                         fisheries.",
