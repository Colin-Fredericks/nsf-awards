 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental tests will be carried out using an alpineplant,            \u001aAntennaria\u001a \u001aparvifolia\u001a.  \u001aAntennaria\u001a is ideal for carryingout               these tests, because populations consist of two kinds                           ofindividuals, morphologically similar but differing in their                   modeof reproduction.  Some plants are sexual, requiring pollen                  tofertilize their seeds, and producing genetically                              variableoffspring.  Others are asexual (apomictic), requiring no                pollenand producing genetically identical offspring.  At some                   sites,both types coexist in the dame populations; at others, only               onetype or the other is present.  In mixed populations,                         adultindividuals of the two types are about equally common.                     However,the seed production of asexual females exceeds that of                  sexualfemales by a factor of two, as predicted.  Thus,                          thisexperimental system epitomizes the paradox we seek to                       explain:why are sexual individuals so common when they have                     areproductive disadvantage?                                                             In addition to increasing our understanding of a very                   basicbiological phenomenon, this work also has applications                     foragriculture and forestry.  Agricultural plantings are                        typicallygenetically homogeneous, and any disadvantages                         associated withasexual reproduction in \u001aAntennaria\u001a may also                    exist in thesegenetically uniform plantings.  Research findings                 may lead torecommendations for the design of agricultural systems               that mightreduce the amount of fertilizer and pesticide inputs                  necessaryfor success.",
