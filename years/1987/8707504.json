Responses of sediment mobility and storage                 to environmental changes in watersheds will be examined on                      three time scales, including: historical, Holocene (post-                       glacial), and late-Wisconsin (late-glacial).  Results of the                    research contribute to improving the understanding of how                       environmental changes, operating at differing time and spatial                  scales, influence the type of quantity of sediment that is                      either stored or transported at various locations in watersheds                 of a humid climate region.  Methodology includes:  (1) field                    stratigraphic studies of sediment stored as colluvium, alluvial                 fan, terrace, and floodplain deposits, (2) laboratory                           sedimentological and geochemical analyses, and (3) statistical                  analyses that link archival data on climate, stream runoff, and                 land use to the field stratigraphic and laboratory results.                     The research should provide critical information that tests the                 hypothesis that erosion, storage, and delivery of sediment in                   watersheds is an episodic process that is dependent upon the                    occurrence of specific events which influence thresholds of                     sediment stability.",
