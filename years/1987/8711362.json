 "awd_abstract_narration": "A philosopher specializing in biomedical ethics and a biologist who             directs a research laboratory in which research on diabetes is                  undertaken will study moral problems in the use of animals in                   scientific research which (a) targets widespread, debilitating                  diseases, (b) has a record of contributing to the understanding and             management of the disease, and (c) operates according to professionally         accepted humane standards.  Much of the research on diabetes mellitus           satisfies these conditions.  Through a survey of current diabetological         literature, the investigators will determine the patterns of usage of           animal models in this research, and relate this to the outstanding              questions investigators are currently pursuing.  Using techniques of            ethical analysis, they will attempt to identify the moral issues                suggested by this use of animals and outline different strategies for           responding to these questions -- from abolition of the research,                through various proposals for replacement, reduction, and refinement of         animal use, to intensification of current efforts.  They will display           the implications of these strategies and assess which courses of action         are the most defensible.  Preliminary results will be sent for comment          to outside experts and consultants.  Project results will include               presentations, papers and a monograph, and will be made available to a          wide audience of interested persons and organizations.                                                                                                          This project should make a timely, scholarly contribution to the                professional and public discussion of issues surrounding uses of                animals in research.  The investigators are very well-qualified;                institutional support is very good and costs, very reasonable. This is          a good example of the kind of cross-disciplinary research EVS should            encourage.  Total support in the amount of $35,939 is recommended.  Of          that amount, half comes from the National Institutes of Health and is           to be awarded this year.  The remainder will be awarded next fiscal             year.",
