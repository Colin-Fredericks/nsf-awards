 "awd_abstract_narration": "An accurate computational model of the prosodic patterns which                  organize utterances into coherent units of sound is essential for               good-quality machine synthesis and recognition.  Such a model                   will require an understanding of the abstract prosidic categories               of intonation, stress, and phrasing, and a description of how                   they are implemented in pitch and rhythm patterns.  This research               is aimed at modeling the timing patterns of English as they                     reflect abstract prosodic categories. First, experiments will be                conducted to explore the types of stresses and phases that affect               speech timing, and the precise nature of the effects.  A                        particular concern will be to discover a representation for these               effects that will make the specification of the underlying                      prosodic patterns invariant across changes in speech tempo and                  segmental content.  For example, the representation must allow                  slow and fast productions of machine recognition to be generated                from an invariant specification of the stress and phrasing for                  this noun phase, and it must allow the use of the same                          specification in generating the prosodically identical noun                     phrase sublime delegation.  The preliminary experiments will                    examine the timing patterns of the speech articulators involved                 in speech production as well as the resulting patterns evident in               the acoustic signal.  The computational model also will generate                both articulatory and acoustic timing patterns.",
