 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a U.S. Yugoslav project development visit to the            Gradevinski Institute, Zagreb, Yugoslavia.  The primary purpose of              the visit is to develop a collaborative research proposal between               Dr. Robert Schiffman of the University of Colorado's Department of              Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering and Dr. Antun                Szavits-Nossan at the Gradevinski Institute on a comprehensive theory           of finite strain consolidation of soft soils.                                                                                                                   This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is funded through a joint             fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav            governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the                 Department of State and no NSF funds are involved.  The grants are              composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal               Yugoslav institute.  A project development award provides travel                funds for the American scientist to Yugoslavia.",
