 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arctic and Antarctic seals are able to inhabit areas of complete ice            cover by virtue of their ability to make and maintain breathing holes           through the ice.  The sensory system of these marine mammals is                 crucial for locating these holes while the animal is under ice.  The            difficulty of working with these animals in the natural environment             has resulted in few studies which address the orientation and                   navigation capabilities of marine mammals.  This project involves the           refinement of acoustic remote sensing technology and its application            to Weddell seals in the natural environment in Antarctica.                      Drs. Wartzok and Elsner have developed a system for acoustically                tracking seals as they swim under the ice.  Preliminary studies have            indicated that vision plays a dominant role in under-ice navigation             when this sensory modality is available.  More detailed and quantified          studies of the roles vision, audition and vibrissal senses play in              under-ice navigation and hole finding by seals will be conducted.  In           addition, the ranges at which seals can visually detect new breathing           holes will be correlated with the laboratory-based limits of visual             sensitivity and the field measured light extinction coefficients will be        determined.  Additional research will quantify the ranges at which seals        can use auditory cues to detect new breathing holes and what types of           auditory cues they use.  Once the importance of audition for these              animals in their natural environment is determined, the impact of               anthropogenic sound on the biology of these animals can be inferred.            The range over which vibrissae function in hole finding will be                 determined.  The tracking of more than one seal under the ice will              provide an understanding of under-ice behavioral interactions.",
