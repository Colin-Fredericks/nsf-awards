 "awd_abstract_narration": "Monochromatic imaging devices are like television cameras,              with the capability added to make images in the light of just one               wavelength, such as that emitted at 630 nm wavelength when                      ionospheric oxygen ions recombine. However, they have much                      greater sensitivity to low light levels than television cameras,                and read out the image data in digital form directly into                       computers.                                                                              An imager is to be built that provides images of the whole              sky and is equipped with a set of filters to image in any one of                four wavelengths.  In this way the structure of the emissions                   from several levels such as from Na and O at 85km and 95km                      altitude, and N2+ and O+ from 150 and 250 km altitude can be                    made.                                                                                   The imager is to be used in conjunction with the radar at               Millstone Hill for study of magnetic storm effects on the                       ionosphere. It will also be taken to other parts of the USA,                    Canada and overseas for observations with other instruments in                  CEDAR coordinated campaigns, such as in studies of the waves and                winds in the mesopause region (80 to 100km altitude).  The PI and               his associates are international experts in construction of this                equipment and in image data processing and interpretation of the                results.",
