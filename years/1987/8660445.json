 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a recommendation for an award to support research on the                feasibility of recovering the valuable metallic and reinforcing                 components of metal-matrix composite (MMC) materials in order to                eliminate the needless environmental releases of fine inert particulates        and harmful metal leachates.  PyrometallurgicaI and electrometallurgicaI        reprocessing of aluminum and magnesium matrix MMC's will be evaluated           and a new flowsheet will be designed to accommodate the unique                  processing technology.  Two major benefits will result from the eventual        commercialization of a composite recycling process.  First, a                   potentially severe source of environmental hazard will be eliminated by         reprocessing composite scrap material directly at the point of origin.          Second, both valuable metals and high strength reinforcements will be           efficiently reprocessed into new composite structures resulting in              overall savings of labor, materials, energy and cost.                                                                                                           This research is consistent with the Environmental Engineering program          objectives.  The investigators are highly qualified to carry out the            research.  This proposal was in response to SBIR Phase I Program                Announcement NSF 86-19.                                                                                                                                         An award of $40,000 for six months starting February 1, 1987 is                 recommended.",
