 "awd_abstract_narration": "A 3-year program of research on great earthquakes and the subduction            process and on the properties of large shocks along transform faults is         proposed.  Under an existing grant from NSF a synthesis of data from            seismology and marine geophysics indicates that the interplate thrust           boundary from depths of 0 to 15 km at subduction zones moves mainly             aseismically.  The transition to slip in large earthquakes at greater           depth occurs at the transition along the plate boundary from young,             weak sediments to stronger rocks of what is called the backstop.  That          transition also controls the morphology of the accretionary wedge-              forearc basin.  We propose to map the downdip width, W, of rupture              zones since it is likely to be a critical parameter governing the               maximum size of thrust events and the average repeat time of large              shocks along given parts of subduction zones.  Knowledge of W should            allow us to ascertain if the plate boundaries off Washington, Oregon,           New Zealand and the southern Lesser Antilles - all regions of young             thick sediments - are capable of generating large or great thrust               events.  A catalog of seismic moments for large shocks worldwide is             being prepared that will be used to study the distribution of seismic           and aseismic slip along and among various plate boundaries.  We will            examine the transition form seismic to aseismic slip at depth in                subduction zones and factors that cause that depth to vary from 25 to           70 km.  Accurate hypocentral locations, focal mechanisms and knots of           seismic activity will be used to search for major asperities along              thrust boundaries.  We think that offsets downdip from a planar geometry        at duplex and ramp structures can act as major asperities.  Such                features are well known to structural geologists but their effect on            the mechanics of large earthquakes does not appear to have been                 investigated.  Work under existing and prior grants led to the                  identification of a seismic gap off central Chile as having a high              probability of rupturing from 1982 to 2000.  A large and damaging event         occurred there in l985.  The proposed research should have major social         benefits by the identification of repeat times and maximum sizes of             large earthquakes and specific sites where precursory phenomena are             likely to occur.",
