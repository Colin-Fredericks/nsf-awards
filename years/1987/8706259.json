 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is designed to analyze the diet of prehistoric                  peoples of Peru.  The student will work at the urban center of                  Pacatnamu that was occupied during the Chimu period (AD 1000-                   1350).  He will focus on subsistence practices and relate diet to               social status.  The idea that higher ranking social groups will                 have a wider variety of foods to eat than lower ranking groups                  will be tested.                                                                      This dissertation study is an integral part of the Pacatnamu               project, a large interdisciplinary project.  Most of the                        archaeological research in the past four years has been designed                to establish cultural and architectural chronologies.  The                      proposed systematic study of subsistence will be the first to                   determine the interplay of ocean and land-based resources on the                diet of prehistoric Peruvians.                                                       By examining the diet of groups within a single place and                  time period, the researcher will help us understand diet and                    subsistence in terms of class composition.  This, in turn, will                 provide us with a detailed understanding of diet in complex                     societies.",
