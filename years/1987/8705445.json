George Lacy and John Cairns of Virginia Polytechnic                        Institute and State University request funds to determine (1) if                recombinant DNA may be dispersed into or from other bacteria in                 plants as well as in selected microcosm habitats, (2) if                        genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs) survive and/or                     colonize these habitats, and (3) if the presence of genetically                 engineered microorganisms (GEMs) have an effect upon bacterial                  community structure.  The GEMs to be used are constructed from                  the pathogenic bacterium Erwinia carotovora, which causes soft                  rot or many plants, has distinct pthogenic and resident phases on               or in living plants, and survives transiently in, but does not                  colonize, soil or aquatic habitats.  These objectives will test                 the hypotheses that (1) recombinant DNA can be dispersed from                   GEMs to native bacteria, (2) that GEMs survive the habitats into                which they are placed, even if at low concentrations, and (3)                   that GEMs will compete with and displace native species, thus                   producing alterations in normal community structure.                            The frequency for dispersal of recombinant DNA from the GEMs and                its integration in the genomes of other microbes will be examined               from three points of view:  (1) in vitro studies will determine                 the frequency for mobilization of recombinant DNA conjugation and               transformation under optimal laboratory conditions, (2) in situ                 microcosm studies will determine detectable frequencies for                     genetic mobilization by any genetic mechanism, and (3) in plants                studies will determine if transfer may occur within diseased                    plants.  In these experiments, the effect of genetic similarity                 of DNA recipients will be followed using taxonomically less                     related organisms (Bacillus and Pseudomonas spp.) isolated from                 the microcosms, related organisms (Erwinia and Klebsiella spp.),                and closely related organisms (strains of E. carotovora EC14 from               which the GEMs are derived.                                                     Effects upon bacterial community structure will be measured in                  microcosms representing soil and aquatic habitats into which the                pathogen is released naturally in high to low populations by                    decomposition of diseased plants.  Estimates of survivorship                    and/or colonization by the introduced GEMs will be determined by                comparing the populations reached by the GEMs with those reached                by the wildtype pathogen and total bacterial and actinomycetal                  populations.  Populations of specific genera will be monitored,                 including Bacillus, Clostridium, Streptomyces, and fluorescent                  Pseudomonas spp. by viable count procedures.                                    This area of research in microbial ecology is highly topical and                needed at the national level.  There is a great paucity of data                 in these areas and both industry and regulatory agencies are                    being inhibited in progress with GEMs because of the lack of                    fundamental information.  The research will be funded jointly                   with the EPA.                                                                   The investigators and their institution are highly regarded and                 suited for this research.  The Program recommends funding.",
