 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aggregation of receptors for immunoglobulin E in the plasma                membrane of mast cells leads to an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+                 and the subsequent exocytosis of secretory granule contents.                    However, the biochemical and physiological mechanisms involved in               these responses in individual cells are still poorly understood.                In this proposal quantitative digital image-enhanced fluorescence               microscopy will be used to image cytoplasmic free ionized                       calcium, membrane potential and exocytosis in individual mast                   cells.  A number of approaches will be used to determine the                    physiological basis for the stochastic variations observed in the               individual Ca2+ responses of tumor mast cells to antigen                        stimulation.  The relative contributions of Ca2+ influx and                     release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores to these responses will               also be assessed.  The possibility that localized increases and                 transient gradients of Ca2+ are generated in response to                        stimulation of a discrete region of the plasma membrane will be                 explored.  The fluorescent indicator fura-2 and other fluorescent               probes will be used in these studies to measure changes in                      membrane potential and exocytotic responses of individual cells.                     These experiments will be important in understanding the                   ionic mechanisms involved in secretion.",
