 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award would allow 11 American scientists to attend a joint seminar         with 10 German scientists on electrochemical passivation.  The seminar,         organized by Professor Richard A. Oriani, University of Minnesota, and          Professor Hans J. Engell, Max Planck Institut fuer Eisenforschung,              Dusseldorf, Federal Republic of Germany, will be held in Numbrecht,             Federal Republic of Germany, on September 8-13, 1987.  Passivation is           the formation of thin layers of mainly oxides and hydrous oxides on the         surface of metals.  These surfaces protect against corrosion.  Metals           owe their utility to the ability to form these surfaces and thereby             remain stable in the presence of thermodynamic activities from the              environment.  Understanding the stability or breakdown characteristics          of the passivating layers is of critical importance for the                     technological use of metals.  Many new techniques have recently emerged         for the study of passivation, and the bulk of the research is being             done in the U.S. and the Federal Republic of Germany.  The study of             passivation presently includes many disciplines not common to classical         corrosion research.  One goal of the proposed seminar is to provide an          opportunity for American and German researchers and scientists from             several disciplines to learn of each others' work.  The seminar                 participants were chosen because they are among the most active in              research on passivation.                                                                                                                                        The seminar should provide a useful interchange of ideas between the            participants and could lead to additional collaborative research                between the American and the German scientists.  At the seminar, each           participant will present a report on his or her work.  Discussion will          follow the presentations.  Then the participants will be assigned to a          small group which will discuss a specific topic in passivation                  research.  The small groups will prepare outlines for position papers           on their topics, and they will present the outlines to the total body           of participants for discussion.  After this, the small groups will              prepare written statements of their outlines.  The outlines and the             other records of the seminar will be converted by the organizers into a         summary paper, including recommendations for future research, which             will be submitted to a journal for publication.",
