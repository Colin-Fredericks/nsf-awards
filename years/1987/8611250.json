 "awd_abstract_narration": "The newly-evolving area of biotechnology involves an attempt to use             microorganisms to produce new products.  Essential is the development           of novel configurations of large bioreactors that utilize the                   microorganisms more efficiently than the reactors of the past which had         to be run in batches and consisted of very dilute aqueous systems (and          therefore had to be followed by very expensive separation sections).            Immobilizing enzymes on a solid support structure permits continuous            operation and is aimed at alleviating the first of the above                    limitations.  The design of large scale bioreactors, utilizing such             immobilized enzymes is in its infancy.  This research is attempting to          use methodology developed in heterogeneous chemical catalysis for such          bioreactors.  The system to be used for these experimental studies are          immobilized enzyme systems which behave as pseudo-first-order reacting          systems.  The solid phase, in this care a bioparticle, (analogous to            the catalyst in chemical systems) is where the reaction occurs.  The            specific systems that will be used include immobilized glucose                  isomerase, immobilized invertase, and immobilized lactase.",
