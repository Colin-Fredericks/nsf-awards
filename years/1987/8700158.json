 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research to be undertaken by Randall W. Phillis is intended to         assess the ability of the baculovirus Autographa californica Nuclear            Polyhedrosis Virus (AcNPV) to act as a vector for the horizontal                transfer of transposable elements.  The design will take advantage of a         combination of the molecular genetics of AcNPV and Drosophila                   melanogaster.  A recombinant AcNPV genome will be constructed which             carries a P element from Drosophila melanogaster into which a                   functional copy of the Xanthine Dehydrogenase gene (Xdh) has been               inserted.  Baculovirus particles which carry this recombinant genome            will be injected into larval and adult Drosophila melanogaster which            lack activity of the Xdh gene.  Transposition of the P element from the         baculovirus genome to the Drosophila chromosomes will be scored by loss         of the eye color phenotype associated with the mutant Xdh gene in the           infected flies.  Flies found to have gained Xdh activity in the genetic         tests will be used in a series of experiments to characterize the Xdh/P         element at the molecular level.  This work will be completed during a           two-year postdoctoral research fellowship tenure at the University of           Wisconsin, Madison.",
