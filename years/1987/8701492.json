 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trickle-bed reactors are used in a wide variety of petroleum                    processing systems such as hydrodesulfurization,                                denitrogenation, demetallization, hydrotreating and in                          manufacture of chemicals involving hydrogenation and oxidation                  reactions.  The reactors consist of solid catalyst pellets,                     0.08 cm to 0.32 cm in diameter, packed into a vertical tubular                  reactor with cocurrent (downflow or upflow) or countercurrent                   gas/liquid flow configurations.  They are widely used because                   their flow pattern approaches plug flow, high catalyst loading                  per unit volume of the liquid is possible, energy dissipation                   is low, and there is flexibility in production rate and                         operating conditions.                                                                                                                                           The potential of trickle-bed reactors has never been fully                      utilized especially in chemical processing and manufacture of                   specialty products.  This is due to the fact that the phenomena                 in trickle-beds are incompletely understood, and the                            difficulties which are associated with trickle-bed design                       exceed those encountered with other reactor types.  While                       scaleup of trickle-bed reactors in petroleum processing for                     certain types of known feeds is well established as an art, \"a                  priori\" prediction of trickle-bed performance of scaleup from                   small laboratory units for feeds and processes for which                        previous know-how does not exist is still considered very risky                 and is simply not done.                                                                                                                                         The scaleup problem in trickle-beds is hampered mainly by                       inadequate knowledge of both the particle scale incomplete                      contacting as well as by the gross liquid maldistribution on                    the bed scale in industrial trickle-beds.  Accurate design                      presupposes the knowledge of local liquid-solid contacting                      (i.e. of the extent of external and internal wetting of the                     particles) and of the non-idealities of flow of the liquid                      external to particles (i.e., bypassing, radial non-uniformity                   in flow, other deviations from plug flow, etc.).  Tracer                        methods offer a tool for evaluating both of these reactor scale                 and particle scale non-idealities.  It is the scope of the                      proposed research to investigate new methods of tracer data                     interpretation in identification and decoupling of the above                    effects.                                                                                                                                                        The key idea behind the proposed project is the use of multiple                 tracers i.e. the use of non-adsorbing and adsorbing (non-                       volatile) tracers to characterize the behavior of the liquid                    phase in a reactor.  The PIs want to show that additional                       information, which allows the decoupling of the reactor scale                   and particle scale non-idealities, can be obtained by the use of                this technique.",
