 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop on Construction Automation:  Computer-integrated Construction        is in response to the National Science Foundation's increased activity          in Construction Automation Research.  The workshop will be held April           2O-23, 1987 at Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pa., site of the NSF               Engineering Research Center for Advanced Technology for Large Structural        Systems.  Preeminent individuals from all major facets of the                   construction industry, as well as those from disciplines which may              substantially contribute to its technological integration, will be              brought together in a suitable forum to effectively foster the                  advancement of the multi-faceted construction industry.  This industry          is a critical, traditional component of the nation's gross national             product.                                                                                                                                                        The primary purposes of the workshop itself will be to identify and             formalize the folIowing:  (a) the \"Pressure Points\" or areas in the             construction industry for significant breakthroughs; (b) the research           that should be performed to meet the needs of this critical industry--          giving consideration to both the short-term and the long-term needs; (c)        the resources required to support or perform this research; (d)                 resources available to support or perform the research and (e)                  mechanisms and incentives to implement the results of the research              efforts.  The recommendations and conclusions from this workshop will           receive extensive distribution to the many segments of or related to the        construction industry.                                                                                                                                          ApproximateIy 45 invited participants, and a second group (gallery) of          about the same number of interested practicing professionals,                   researchers, and educators will be encouraged to attend and observe             without having the responsibility to directly develop the position paper        which will result from the workshop.                                                                                                                            A report will be produced containing a substantive analysis, summary            discussions, and implementable recommendations.                                                                                                                 The Principal Investigator is very capable, is very active in research          and administrative matters relative to the contents of the workshop.            Institutional resources and budget are appropriate.  An award is                recommended.  The Structures and BuiIding Systems Program will                  contribute $23,715 and the Automation and Systems Integration Program           will contribute $23,715 for a total of $47,430.",
