 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Great Basin in eastern Nevada and Utah has experienced a complex            history of superposed Mesozoic magmatic, metamorphic, and deformational         events as well as a pervasive Cenozoic ductile-brittle extensional              history.  Prior work has outlined important aspects of this history, and        this project is a study to restore a crustal cross-section for the              eastern Great Basin, by a combination of methods including 40Ar/39Ar,           and U-Pb geochronology and geothermobarometry.  In the study area, the          Cenozoic crustal extension has exhumed middle crustal rocks, thereby            providing a window into the Mesozoic and Cenozoic infrastructure of the         western North American Cordillera.  Results will provide accurate timing        of tectonic events associated with Mesozoic convergence and with                subsequent extension, which together with an accurate crustal cross-            section, will allow an in depth characterization of the complex tectonic        evolution of the western margin of North America.",
