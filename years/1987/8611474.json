 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is a continuation of experimental work in laser           physics supported under NSF grant ECS-8411743.  Its goals are the               development of new and efficient sources of tunable coherent radiation          in the visible and ultraviolet spectral regions, and a better                   understanding of the fundamental processes occurring in existing and            potential new sources.  One experiment is designed to demonstrate an            optically-pumped, continuous HgBr, HgI or PbI laser in the visible.             The electrical or optical dissociation of HgBr2, HgI2 or PbI2 would be          followed by optically exciting (with a CW UV laser or an arc lamp) the          B state from the ground state.  Measuring the threshold pumping power           for this laser and investigating the use of isotopically-enriched               metal-halide salts to enhance the small-signal gain are two of the              primary initial goals of this research.  Also proposed are studies to           examine the feasibility of a quasi-CW Iodine Fluoride (IF) laser pumped         by excitation transfer from the lowest metastable state of N2 or CO.            Electron beam-produced metastable molecules would be mixed with I2 and          F2 in a cylindrical nozzle arrangement and the presence of gain                 detected with a CW dye laser.  Microwave probing experiments will               investigate the limitations posed by excited state collisions on energy         loading of the active medium.",
