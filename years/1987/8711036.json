 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective and Relevancy:  This project supports 12 U.S. scientists to           attend a workshop on advanced laser Raman spectroscopy to provide               state-of-the-art knowledge and background on significant developments           in the field through presentations and discussions.  The meeting will           provide young scientists from India and neighboring countries an                opportunity to meet their counterparts from developed countries to              discuss research problems of mutual interest.  It is expected to                emphasize the role of young scientists in research and development in           the branches of interdisciplinary field encompassing physics,                   chemistry, materials science, biology, medicine, and industrial                 fields.  Participants are expected from Western Europe, USSR, and               Japan.                                                                                                                                                          Merit:  The P.I. is an eminent scientist who has considerable                   experience in the field of Raman spectroscopy and in India.  He is              collaborating on a joint research project with scientists at the Indian         Institute of Technology at Kanpur where the meeting is to take place.           The Indians are particularly active in this field and it is likely that         further collaboration will result from this meeting.
