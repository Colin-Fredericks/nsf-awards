 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emotional expressiveness refers to nonverbal behaviors which                    communicate how an individual feels.  What one reveals                          expressively to others about one's feelings may in fact be                      different from what one actually feels 'inside.'  In the course                 of development, children learn to modify (or manage) their                      emotional-expressive behavior depending on how they want                        others to respond to them.  In order to figure out when, where,                 and how to modify their emotional expressiveness, children need                 to learn how others will react to their genuine                                 emotional-expressive behavior.  If that anticipated reaction is                 not a desirable one, then the child needs to consider what                      impact a modified or dissembled version of that expressive                      behavior would have on others.                                                                                                                                  The research will examine how children come to anticipate                       others' reactions to emotional-expressive behavior from a                       number of perspectives.  The research will extend our                           understanding of what children know about social situations                     relative to whether it would be appropariate (or strategic) for                 them to manage thier display of emotional behavior. Qualities                   of relationship (namely, degree of intimacy, controllability,                   and status) will be examined for their impact on what children                  expect as the interpersonal consequences to genuine or                          dissembled emotional-expressive behavior.                                                                                                                       Descriptive behavioral information will be obtained which will                  illuminate what children of different age groups actually do                    when confronted with a situation that is conducive to                           expressive behavior management.                                                                                                                                 The  research will also examine the influence of parental                       attitude on children's thinking about the connections among                     emotional experience, expressive behavior management, and                       social relations.                                                                                                                                               These studies should provide a sophisticated descriptive data                   base about the development of children's understanding of                       emotional-expressive behavior in different social situations.                   Researchers are just beginning to document norms for                            emotional-expressive behavior in adults; the present set of                     studies will extend that documentation downward to ages six to                  twelve with additional informaion regarding (a) the                             socialization of emotional-expressive behavior and (b) the                      developmental progression involved in acquiring expectations                    about interpersonal responses to emotional-expressive behavior.",
