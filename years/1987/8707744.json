 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks support for a two-year project to                           investigate the complex but systematic variation of earthquake                  activities near plate interfaces in Wadati-Benioff zones.  In                   particular, we plan to characterize the nature of a notable                     number of predominantly normal faulting events that cannot be                   accounted for by slip on the interplate thrust zone.  The depth                 and mechanism of approximately 100 moderate- sized earthquakes                  that are shallower than 100 km in major subduction zones will                   be precisely determined by inverting the long-period P and                      SH waves at teleseismic distances and by identification of                      surface reflections from short-period seismograms.  We                          anticipate delineating the position of the plate interface and                  the seismicity near it in some detail.                                                                                                                          The results will then be combined with a compilation of source                  parameters for events in the outer-rise region and intraplate                   seismicity downdip from the interface.  We seek to clarify the                  possible association of thrust and normal faulting events near                  the plate interface, the nature of the transition from                          interplate to intraplate seismicity at intermediate depths, and                 the connection between intraplate seismicity in the outer-rise                  region, beneath the plate interface, and beyond the                             interface in the downdip direction.                                                                                                                             The ultimate goal of the synthesis is to identify constraints                   that can be placed upon the state of stress both on the plate                   interfaceand the subducted lithosphere by the source parameters                 of earthquakes.  We believe that the proposed study would                       provide enough data to at least qualitatively address several                   important questions.  For instance, if the occurrence and                       mechanism of events below the plate interface can be correlated                 with plate tectonic parameters that are believed to control                     the seismic coupling of the interplate zone, then these events                  might provide information about the zone both occur, the                        transition of the strain field within the slab from                             lithospheric bending seaward of trenches to unbending at                        intermediate depths will be investigated.",
