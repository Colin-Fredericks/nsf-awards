The                       intent of this effort is to provide academic research vessels                   that permit diving activities in the deep ocean a more complete                 set of guidelines to ensure greater safety.  These guidelines                   may also be incorporated in the University-National                             Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) Research Vessel Safety                  Standards.                                                                                                                                                      The U&HMS has prepared many bibliographies on various diving                    activities and convened several national and international                      workshops on medical and scientific problems.   The Society                     also publishes a newsletter and two highly regard professional                  journals.                                                                                                                                                       The P.I., Dr. Leon Greenbaum is the Executive Director of the                   Society with extensive experience in medical and diving                         activities and has directed  a number of similar projects in                    the past.                                                                                                                                                       Because diving standards vary from one institution to the next,                 this study and workshop will provide the basis for greater                      uniformity of safety standard for open ocean diving from UNOLS                  research vessels.  Participants for the workshop will be                        selected when the bibilography has been completed.",
