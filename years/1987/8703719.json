 "awd_abstract_narration": "Contrary to the predictions of anthropologists and laymen,              ethnic groups have not assimilated into politically and                         economically dominant cultures.  This research project will look                at how peoples maintain their sense of ethnic identity in the                   face of pressures to change: ethnicity will be studied on the                   Bonin Islands in the North Pacific.  The population of these                    islands consists of the politically dominant Japanese and                       European/American colonists who have maintained a sense of                      separateness for over 100 years.  The researcher predicts that                  the sharing of experiences as well as a sense of group identity                 rather than shared economic interests has kept the two groups                   separate.                                                                               The research project's focus on ethnicity represents and                important area in the social sciences that is in urgent need of                 clarification.  Due to the unique features of the particular                    population identified in the proposal, the researcher will be                   able to add new dimensions to the concept used by all the social                sciences.  The formation and maintenance of ethnic identity will                be fruitfully analyzed within the context of a particular                       historic and cultural setting.                                                          Ethnicity is emerging as a critical national issue in both              developed and developing countries throughout the world.  In                    South Africa, India, Israel, Canada, and the Philippines, to                    mention but a few countries, ethnicity lies at the center of                    cultural upheavals and threatens the stability of cultural and                  political institutions.  In the U.S., a similar need for                        refinement of the conceptual framework of ethnicity underlies                   pressing social and economic problems.",
