 "awd_abstract_narration": "A laser Raman spectrometer is being acquired.  This instrument                  will provide capabilities for conducting research in                            heterogeneous catalysis.  These capabilities cannot be matched                  with any of the available facilities.  Incorporation of the laser               Raman spectroscopy technique to the ongoing research programs on                selective oxidation of lower molecular weight hydrocarbons and on               catalytic incineration of organic air pollutants will open up new               avenues for research such as in situ characterization of the                    catalyst synthesis process, characterization of catalyst surfaces               under reaction conditions, investigation of adsorbent-adsorbate                 interactions, in situ characterization of catalyst deactivation                 process and identification of active catalytic sites by use of                  isotopically labelled reactants.  Since in situ characterization                of catalyst surfaces is the key to acquiring an indepth                         understanding of the catalysis phenomenon, availability of this                 technique will help us answer several fundamental questions                     regarding catalytic activity, selectivity and reaction schemes.                 Only such fundamental understanding will make the solid state                   design of active and selective catalysts possible.",
