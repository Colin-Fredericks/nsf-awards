 "awd_abstract_narration": "The illitization of smectite during diagenesis and burial                  metamorphism is a major aspect of shale petrology; K/Ar dating                  has elucidated the process.  Bentonites simplify the study                      because they are free of detrital illite/smectite.  Recent                      research shows that  Ordovician bentonites throughout the                       southern half of the Applachian basin underwent illitization to                 potassium (K)- bentonites during a relatively short episode                     300-265 m.y. ago in the upper Pennslyvania- lower Permian,                      corresponding to the Alleghenian Orogeny.  Some of the                          K-bentonites are in close association with Mississippi Valley                   Type (MVT) zinc deposits.                                                            Basin-wide illitization may be attributed to explusion of                  edge of the foreland basin during Blue Ridge overthrusting, a                   novel hypothesis that is receiving support from diverse                         observations by many researchers.  If true, the explusion of hot                waters to the distal edges of the basin as of mega-importance                   to the secondary history of such sedimentary basins, as outlined                in the speculative hypothesis by Oliver (1986).  This project                   will contrast the geographic distribution of illitization                       dates (1) within the Appalachian Basin from south to north,                     where the timing and character of the Alleghenian Orogeny may                   have been different; (2) between the Appalachian Basin and                      Illinois Basin along their divide at the Cincinnati                             Arch-Nashville Dome; and (3) between the Appalachian and                        Ouachita/Arkoma Basins along the strike of the orogen.  Finally                 the petrology of the smectite to illite reaction in Appalachian                 shales should provide a marked contrast with the generally                      accepted model proposed from deeply buried cases like the Gulf                  Coast, where the chemical breakdown of detrital K-feldspar                      plays a major role.",
