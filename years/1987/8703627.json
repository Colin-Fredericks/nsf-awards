 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will allow the PI to do research in Jamaica on the relation        between social structural and ideological factors affecting parental            treatment of children.  The effect of women's roles as primary providers        and decision makers in both domestic and public domains upon any                preferential treatment of male or female children will be studied by            conducting a household census of about 200 households in an urban               neighborhood of Kingston and conducting participant observation and in-         depth interviews with fathers and mothers, in collaboration with local          researchers from the Institute for Social and Economic Research,                University of the West Indies.                                                                                                                                  This research is important because a gender bias in the treatment of            children is widespread in the world, usually in the favor of males.  The        investigation of bias (favoring either males or females) in a situation         where adult females have relatively higher economic and social status           than males thus provides an important comparison to the more usual male         dominated social situation.",
