 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cartography, the art and science of map making is rapidly converting to         computerized, digital data bases and highly interactive computer graphic        displays.  The Cartography and Map Technology Program is taking                 significant steps towards computerizing the map-making process taught to        students.  A mini-computer graphics system is being used in two separate        ways:  for teaching interactive map design; and in teaching data base           concepts necessary in handling map data bases.  The system includes             graphics work stations with digitizers and controllers as well as a             color hardcopy device to print the maps being produced.  Since                  cartographic data represents some of the largest, most complex, and             rapidly changing data bases, an advanced graphics computer system is            helping students acquire the theoretical and practical knowledge                necessary for dealing with mapping problems in the future.",
