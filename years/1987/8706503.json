 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives and Relevancy: This project supports Dr. John Scocca to              spend four weeks at the Center for Advanced Molecular Biology at the            University of Punjab, in Lahore, Pakistan.  During this period he will          collaborate with Dr. S. Riazuddin, director of the center, in                   conducting a workshop on molecular biology techniques.  They will be            joined by two scientists from England and India as well as scientists           from Pakistan.  Students will be young researchers from Pakistan as             well as from neighbouring countries.  In addition, Dr. Scocca will              review with Pakistani scientists their research in this field and               examine areas where future collaborative research can be beneficial to          the two countries.  Special emphasis will be on the application of              these techniques to plant research.  He will also deliver lectures              describing his current work.  The Science in Developing Countries               program supports participation by U.S. scientists in workshops in a             foreign country to assist in the application of science and technology          to development.  The training of these Pakistani scientists is useful           to both countries because their laboratory is currently carrying                extensive experiments in conjunction with  scientists from several top          U.S. research institutes, and the proposed investigation will help the          work on improving agriculture products in Pakistan.                                                                                                             Merit: The P.I. is a capable researcher in the field of the workshop.           The pakistani scientist is one of Pakistan's best known in molecular            biology experimentation, who has conducted productive research under            NSF grants in the last seven years.  The workshop is likely to help the         participants from Pakistan and neighbouring countries by exposing them          to the most recent techniques of research in the field.  The                    interaction is likely to increase the interest in the field and in              collaboration with the U.S. to the advantage of both countries.                                                                                                 Funding: None other than this grant.",
