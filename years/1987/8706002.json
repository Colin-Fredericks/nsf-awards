 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator's approach is to study problems in the               management of data in the CAD design process.  In previous NSF-                 supported research, the proposer has implemented a prototype version            server for computer-aided design (CAD) data.  He plans to use this as           an operational testbed in which to investigate how to apply and                 implement object-oriented and logic-programming concepts, such as               prototypical objects, inheritance, and inference, within the CAD                environment.  Dr. Katz plans to investigate two problems:  (1) new ways         to propagate data through a lattice of interrelated design objects; and         (2) extend some recent work, applying inference techniques to validate          design correctness, to the problem of controlling constraint and change         propagation.                                                                    VLSI (very large scale integration) is a recent field that explores how         to design highly complex integrated circuits and related electronic             systems.  Development of the field is important to the nation's                 competitive lead in electronics.  The proposed research is in CAD               design management, a subject that is of exceptional importance to the           CAD industry.  Traditional database techniques are not adequate to              support today's CAD design process.  This research addresses the need           to carefully manage the many information details which are typically            produced during the CAD process.  Such research is needed to promote            automation in the CAD field, where design of very and ultra large scale         integrated (VLSI/ULSI) circuits is now so complex that humans cannot            effectively deal with them.  The principal investigator has made                important contributions to the CAD design management area.  He brings           to bear a useful blend of theoretical and practical talents.",
