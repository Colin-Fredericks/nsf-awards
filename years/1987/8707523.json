 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Eocene Clarno Formation of Oregon contains a diverse                assemblage of fossil fruits, seeds, woods and leaves.  Although                 frequently cited in discussions of Eocene phytogeography, only                  a small percentage of the Clarno flora has been described.                      Because it contains several kinds of plant structures preserved                 in a variety of depositional settings that can be dated                         radiometrically, the Clarno assemblage is potentially important                 as a link in correlating Eocene floras across the Northern                      Hemisphere.  A comprehensive treatment of the Clarno flora                      including reproductive structures and leaves will facilitate                    intercontinental correlations between the early Tertiary floras                 of Europe, known mostly from fruit and seed deposits, and those                 of Asia and North America, best known from leaves.  The                         resulting data set will provide a better understanding of                       relative intra- and intercontinental floristic uniformity in                    the Northern Hemisphere during the Eocene and insight into the                  timing  and directions of phytogeographic migrations.",
