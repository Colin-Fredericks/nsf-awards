 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a request to provide renewed support for the operation of               a National Center for Small-Angle Scattering Research under the                 direction of G. D. Wignall at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.                The center operates as a National Facility providing outside                    users with access to a 30 meter small-angle neutron scattering                  instrument at the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR), and a 10                    meter small-angle neutron scattering instrument at the Oak Ridge                Research Reactor.  A 10 meter small angle X-ray scattering                      facility with a rotating anode source has also been available to                outside users on a part time basis.  The Center is staffed by                   three research staff members (including the director) and                       associated support personnel.                                                                                                                                   The center identifies four major scientific areas for its                       research activities and user programs:  polymers; colloids and                  microemulsions; metallurgy and ceramics; and biological sciences.               In all these areas important scientific advances are being                      achieved and research of high quality is being performed, both by               outside users and by the Center's own research staff.  Small-                   angle scattering research is important to many fields of science                and there are many areas where its impact and importance are                    still increasing.  The center constitutes a facility that is                    accessible to the research community and unique in the nation.                  The key component is the 30 meter neutron scattering instrument.                Interactions with the management and research staff of the Solid                State Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory are strongly                    synergistic and mutually beneficial.                                                                                                                            Support for continued operation of the National Center For Small-               Angle Scattering Research is strongly recommended, with emphasis                on neutron scattering research and facility development for                     research in all four scientific areas addressed.  This is a                     thirty-one month award.  Continued support for the final two                    years of this award is contingent on the anticipated restart of                 the HFIR reactor in mid-1987.  This is a renewal of NSF grant No.               DMR-8311769.",
