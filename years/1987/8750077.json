 "awd_abstract_narration": "As many undergraduates are moving away from an interest in medicine and         descriptive biology into the research and technical areas of Molecular          Biology, it becomes increasingly important to expose them to basic              methods of ultracentrifugation and spectrophotometric analysis.  The            Department is changing its curriculum to offer an emphasis in                   Microbiology and Molecular Biology to meet this change in student               interest.                                                                                                                                                       The new equipment (ultracentrifuge and UV/Vis/spectrophotometer)                purchased through this award is being used for experiments in six               different laboratories as well as in independent student research               projects.  This broadly based exposure is ensuring that the students            have multiple chances to use and become familiar with this                      instrumentation and its uses.",
