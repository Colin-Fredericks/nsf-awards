 "awd_abstract_narration": "STEPS (Science Textbook Extensions through Problem Solving) focuses on          the implementation and testing of two approaches to developing peer             teachers for middle school teachers.  Emphasis will be placed on the            Search, Solve, Create and Share model of problem solving developed by           the Principal Investigator.                                                                                                                                     During the spring of 1987 forty middle school teachers from school              districts surrounding the University of Iowa will attend both a two day         Awareness Conference and six one-half day workshops.  The workshops will        emphasize content, methodology, and problem-solving.  During the summer         of 1987 twenty-five of the teachers will be invited to attend an                intensive three week Leadership Training Workshop.  The purpose of the          workshop is to present additional science content, learn research               methodology, interact with research scientists, review curricular               material and develop the procedures necessary to conduct inservice              activities.  During the school year of 1987-88 the Leadership Teachers          will attend nine seminars which will enforce the work presented during          the summer.  The staff will work with the teachers to utilize the               methods and materials developed during the summer.  The same twenty-five        teachers will attend a two week facilitator program designed to finalize        the design of the inservice program.  During the 1988-89 school year the        Peer Teachers will work with other teachers in their districts.                                                                                                 A comparison group of Peer Teachers will be developed through an                accelerated program, consisting of a two-week concentrated workshop             during the summer of 1989.  These Peer Teachers will conduct inservice          activities during the school year of 1989-90.  An extensive evaluation          program will compare the effectiveness of the two groups of Peer                Teachers.                                                                                                                                                       In addition to the problem solving techniques, the program will result          in the production of the following:  a Facilitator Training Handbook for        implementing, evaluating, and managing inservice programs; Technique            Training Video Tapes for learning the problem solving approach;                 newsletter; and an electronic bulletin to exchange information among the        participants.",
