 "awd_abstract_narration": "The geochemistry of rare earth elements (REE) in                        estuarine and coastal waters, sediments, and pore waters                        in the main focus of this renewal proposal.  The                                Chesapeake Bay and Amazon River shelf will be the main                          study areas.  Based on the P.I.'s current grant, the flux,                      cycling and fractionation of REE undergo major                                  biogeochemical perturbations in the estuarine zone.                             Results from the Cheseapeake Bay show that light REE as                         being enriched in the dissolved phase during the                                development of anoxic conditions in the deep basins.  In                        the proposed research, a time-series study in a Chesapeake                      Bay seasonally anoxic basin (water column and sediments)                        will be carried out to quantify the extent and kinetics of                      such fluxes and fractionation.  Incubation experiments                          will also follow the diagenesis of REE.                                                 Collaboration with a large multi-disciplinary study                     (\"AmasSeds\" project) of the Amazon shelf is also proposed.                      A seasonal study of the Amazon estuary will focus on the                        remineralization and removal of REE in the estuarine                            waters and REE diagenesis in the sediments associated with                      dynamic cycling of Fe and organic matter.  The Amazon                           River estuary study will provide much needed data on REE                        for a major river/estuary system.",
