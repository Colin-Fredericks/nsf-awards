 "awd_abstract_narration": "The equipment is specifically designed to establish a fixed or                  semi-fixed multitask construction robotics system (MCRS).  The overall          goal of the research is to study the adaptability of high-technology to         today's construction processes.  This will be accomplished by studying          the flexibility of certain construction operations to modification.             Concepts developed for other industries will be studied.  The equipment         provides the opportunity to emulate automated data acquisition systems,         fixed and semi-fixed flexible manufacturing systems, automated quality          control and automated material management in simulated real world               conditions.  It is hoped that by experimenting and emulating a variety          of construction processes, a knowledge base can be established for              important production oriented problems, improving the quality and               verifying the findings gained from the three related research projects.         This equipment will improve the quality and broaden the scope of two            major research grants presently funded by NSF (Grant MSM 86-15187               entitled \"Adaption of FMS Concepts to Construction\", and Grant CEE              86-96051 entitled \"Robotics Feasibility in the Construction Industry\").         It will also help to support a research project funded by the Navy in           the area of automated construction.",
