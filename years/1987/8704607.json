 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support a group of U.S. mathematicians under the              leadership of Professor H. Blaine Lawson, Jr., of SUNY at Stony                 Brook, to collaborate with a group of Brazilian mathematicians                  headed by Professor M. do Carmo of the Institute for Pure and                   Applied Mathematics (IMPA), located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  In              general, these mathematicians intend to continue a very successful              research exchange that has grown over the past twenty years mainly              in the fields of Differential Geometry and Dynamical Systems.                   Funding will go to support travel by six distinguished U.S.                     mathematicians to Brazil over the span of two years, to work                    interactively on the following topics:  minimal submanifolds,                   isometric conversions, conformal geometry, Yang-Mills theory,                   Backlund transformations, and other related topics.                                                                                                             The past two decades have witnessed the growth of the Brazilian                 School of Differential Geometry to become one of major stature.                 Some of the best results of this school have been in the area of                submanifold theory; in several cases these results have led to                  collaborative work with U.S. mathematicians where both sides have               benefited.  One need only mention, among others, the fundamental                pioneering work of Barbosa and do Carmo on the structure of stable              surfaces, and the complete classification of compact conformally                flat hypersurfaces in euclidean space achieved by members of the                Brazilian school (Dajczer, do Carmo, Mercuri).  This project will               bring together a group of productive U.S. mathematicians who                    either already have established collaborations with Brazilian                   mathematicians or whose work is likely to inspire new activity to               continue the direct exchange of ideas that is of vital importance               for mathematical research.",
