 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the development of our current understanding of condensed                    phases of matter (e.g., solids, fluids, superfluids, liquid                     crystals, magnetism, etc.), the concepts of symmetry and                        dimensionality have played vital roles.  This is especially true                in the study of transitions from one phase to another where it is               currently believed that a knowledge of the dimensionality and of                the change in symmetry of the two phases is often sufficient for                the determination of singularities in the structural and thermal                response functions of the system very near the transition.  This                unifying concept is currently being widely tested and exploited                 to systematize condensed matter phases according to their                       sometimes subtle properties.                                                                                                                                    Proposed here is a program of thermal and optical studies of                    certain monomer and polymer liquid crystal phases and phase                     transitions designed to reveal the place held by these                          interesting phases within the broader scheme of condensed matter                phases, wherein it appears they may fill previously unknown but                 now conspicuous gaps.",
