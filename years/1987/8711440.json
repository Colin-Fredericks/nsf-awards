 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will combine archaeology and ethnoarchaeology              to study the role of storing foods and goods in the development                 of complex societies.  Specifically, the researcher will look at                household storage behavior in Mesoamerica by using historic and                 ethnohistoric documents and test a resulting model on prehistoric               settlements in the Puuc region of Yucatan, Mexico.  The goal of                 the research is to understand the physical remains of the storage               of food and objects, the activity of storing things, and how the                way people stored goods has affected the archaeological record.                 Analyses will concentrate on the socioeconomic role of storage                  particularly by specifying the relationships between status                     differences and agricultural production.                                                The role of household storage in the development of complex             societies has received little attention in the New World, even                  though archaeologists have recognized it as an important                        component in the development of social complexity.  This research               will begin to define the material remains of domestic storage in                traditional agricultural societies and infer behavioral and                     social roles from this evidence.                                                        The storing of water, agricultural food surpluses and goods             is crucial to complex societies around the world.  What is being                stored, how and where the stores are housed and who controls                    access to the facilities are crucial characteristics for                        understanding the social and economic aspects of class                          differentiation.  This project should help archaeologists                       understand the full labor costs of this poorly understood aspect                of social stratification in agricultural societies.",
