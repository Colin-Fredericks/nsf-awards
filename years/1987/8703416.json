 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a very exciting proposal by Dr. Strong of Florida State                 University that takes a thorough, rigorous approach in examining                the dynamics of planthoppers on cordgrass.  If successful, it                   could provide the best example to date of how a wide variety of                 factors interact to generate spatial and temporal patterns in                   insect populations.  Most of the biotic and physical factors                    which Strong is proposing to examine in relation to planthopper                 population dynamics have been studied previously but they have                  generally been studied in isolation.  While valuable, studies of                isolated factors tell us of potential effects, but do not tell us               what we need to know--what is their relative importance in                      relation to other factors in influencing population dynamics and                distribution patterns.  Based on an impressive background with                  the planthopper/cordgrass system, Strong has now developed                      eloquent techniques and identified the major factors regulating                 planthopper populations.  The research outlined in this proposal                could only be productively attempted by someone with Strong's                   experience and previous research support.",
