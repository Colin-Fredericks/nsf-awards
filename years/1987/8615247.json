 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is designed to reconstruct the economy            of societies using Topara ceramics in the lower Pisco valley of                 Peru.  It will build on a survey at the site of Chongos conducted               by the student in 1985 and is the first study of habitation sites               and economic activities of these transitional societies of the                  Formative.Early Intermediate periods (ca. 200 BC). The research                 will also focus on the regional interaction between sites and                   between cultures in the region.                                                         While the south central coast of Peru has been the subject              of outstanding chronological work, only recently has work                       focusing on living sites been undertaken.  This research project                will fill gaps in the existing data base in this area and will                  deal with the problem of regional variation and allow                           reconstruction of the settlement pattern.  It is predicted that                 the settlement will be urban, a rare and importance occurrence in               the southern coastal area.  It will also increase our knowledge                 of subsistence practices in the region.                                                 This research will help archaeologists understand the                   processes of interaction between indigenous peoples and                         politically and economically larger societies.  It will help show               how new ideas are introduced and accepted by an indigenous                      society.",
