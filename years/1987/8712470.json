 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of electrochemistry.  The thrust of               this research is to improve the understanding of the intrinsic                  properties of dipolar aprotic solvents, including dimethyl                      formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, sulfolane, tetrahydrofuran, and                  dioxolane, which are important in many diverse fields such as                   synthesis, homogeneous catalysis, electrocatalysis,                             electroanalysis, and high energy density battery technology.                    Since many of these applications are compromised by reactive                    impurities present in the solvents, the characterization and                    removal of these species is of paramount importance.  Professor                 Coetzee and his co-workers will characterize impurities on the                  basis of their reactivities, rather than their concentrations                   only, by using a highly effective 'ion probe' method that they                  developed under the previous NSF grant, CHE-8408411.  In this                   method, such highly reactive ion probes as hydrogen, copper (II),               and fluoride are added over an appropriately wide concentration                 range (typically 10 nanomolar to 10 millimolar) while their                     activities are monitored with the corresponding indicator                       electrodes.  Well characterized deviations in the responses of                  the electrodes reveal the presence of certain classes of                        impurities.  Gas chromatographic and mass spectrometric                         procedures are then optimized for final identification and                      quantification of individual impurities.",
