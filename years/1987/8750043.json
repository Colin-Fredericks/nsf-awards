 "awd_abstract_narration": "New thrusts in Biotechnology are being provided in the curriculum at the        freshman, sophomore and advanced levels.  Related laboratory experiences        include work in modeling, DNA manipulation, fermentation, and tissue            culture using agarose gel electrophoresis and electro-blotting.  New            equipment supporting these advances include a hood, a freeze dryer and a        computer-based data acquisition system.  Three tissue culture, three DNA        manipulation, a stable isotope plant selection exercise, and two                computer modeling lab sessions are being added to existing courses.                                                                                             A new lab oriented-course called Biotechnology also is being developed.         Its major components involve recombinant DNA methods, fermentation,             bioproduction and bioconversion, eukaryotic tissue culture and                  differentiation, and simulation modeling.  Enhanced educational                 opportunities in experimental and quantitative Biotechnology are being          provided, and a regional need for formal education in Biotechnology is          being met.",
