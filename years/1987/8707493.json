 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite its importance to paleomagnetism, the properties of             magnetic remanence carried by authigenic minerals is perhaps the                least understood of the various processes of magnetization.                     Theoretical consideration of this so-called \"chemical remanent                  magnetization\" or CRM makes several testable predictions.  Many                 of the predictions have not been adequately tested with well                    controlled experimental data; hence the theory has not changed                  substantially since its first formulation.  A series of                         experiments, primarily using hematite, address the following                    specific problems: 1) what controls the direction of CRM?; 2)                   what is the relationship of CRM intensity to the applied field?;                3) what control, if any, does the applied magnetic field have on                crystal growth?; 4) what influence does variability of                          composition and defect structure have on the remanent and bulk                  characteristics of our synthesis products?; and 5) can                          experimental analogues be reconciled with observed behavior of                  natural samples?  This is an ideal ROW Career Advancement Award                 which will help a very promising young PI to carry out this                     important body of research and further develop an excellent                     laboratory.",
