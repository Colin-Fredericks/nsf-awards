 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a group travel project in which twelve scientist, six from              Europe and six from the U.S. will participate in a workshop in the area         of queueing networks with finite capacity.  This will be the first              international workshop ever to be held on this important topic, and it          will take place at North Carolina State University, on May 20-21, 1988.                                                                                         The subject matter of this workshop deals with performance modelling of         finite resources as used in computer systems, computer communication            networks, and flexible manufacturing systems.                                                                                                                   There is a crying need for a workshop on this topic.  This is because,          in the recent years there have been significant advances in the state-          of-the art in this area.  However, not enough time is allocated to this         topic at the regular meetings of the relevant professional societies.                                                                                           The objectives of this workshop are:                                                                                                                            a)  to provide the opportunity to researchers who work in this area to          present      their latest research.                                                                                                                             b)  to foster co-operation between researchers, minimize unnecessary                        duplication, and identify new long-term research                    objectives.                                                                                                                                                     c)  to educate or bring up-to-date other researchers who work in other          areas of     computer and communication performance modelling.                                                                                                  d)  to provide a comprehensive set of proceedings (the first ever in            this           research area).                                                                                                                                  Approximately 50 scientists will attend this workshop.",
