 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to continue development of               a physically-based parameterization of clouds and their radiative               interaction for use by general circulation models (GCM's).  The                 refined parameterization scheme will be implemented and tested                  using the Oregon State University 7-layer atmospheric GCM.                      Careful and detailed evaluation of the efficacy of the                          parameterization procedure will be carried out.  This cloud/                    radiation parameterization may reduce errors in the sea-surface                 temperature fields simulated by GCMS and will enable a                          quantitative determination of the potentially crucial cloud                     optical depth feedback process in numerical experiments of                      climate change due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide.                         Dr. Schlesinger will also involve two undergraduate students               (Ms. Bogar and Ms. Bishop) in research tasks related to this                    grant.  Ms. Bogar will asist in analyzing the inter-annual                      variability signal in GCM outputs.  Ms. Bishop will work on                     modeling of climatic conditions during the previous interglacial                (115,000 years ago).  Besides gaining technical research                        experience, both undergraduates will benefit from working under                 close supervision of the PI and in collaboration with other                     graduate students and programmers.",
