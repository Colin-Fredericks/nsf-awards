 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two aspects of the rupture initiation of earthquakes will be                    investigated: 1) the relation between the stress distribution on the            fault surface and precursors and 2) the relationship between pre-               existing fault geometry and the initiation of ruptures.                                                                                                         Asperities and stress distribution on the fault surface associated with         large earthquakes may be related to short-term precursors and                   predictability of such earthquakes.  If an asperity gets stressed               enough to produce dilantancy and then ruptures, short-term precursors           are likely to be observed.  If rupture originates in a low-stress               (\"weak\") region of the fault and propagates and breaks asperities,              there may be no stress-related precursors.  Preliminary investigations          of several large earthquakes support the above concept.                                                                                                         It has been suggested that pre-existing fault geometry and the                  distribution of physical barriers may strongly influence the initiation         and the total extent of earthquake ruptures.  In particular, King and           Nabelek (1985) pointed out the strong influence fault bends can have on         the initiation and termination of rupture and showed several examples.          If earthquakes initiate near bends (or other barriers) and if such              behavior is sufficiently common, it can be used to identify areas for           intensified monitoring.  Similarly, if ruptures tend to be confined to          regions between bends, the geometry of the fault-zone can be used in            estimating earthquake hazard.                                                                                                                                   We propose to test the above hypotheses.  We shall determine the                locations of asperities on the fault surfaces of large earthquakes by           inversion of teleseismic waveforms.  The locations of high-stress               asperities will then be compared to the locations of observed precursors        if any were observed.  By inverting for the details of the faulting             mechanisms and stress release, we will determine where the ruptures             initiated and what segments of faults moved during the earthquakes.             Detailed comparisons with geological observations will be made.  We             will analyze large events world-wide in well monitored areas for which          good geological and/or precursory data are available.  Initially, we            will concentrate on nine large events in China for which we have                already collected geological, seismological and precursory data.  We            will also analyze the most recent (1986) events in California and               Alaska.",
