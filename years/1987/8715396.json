 "awd_abstract_narration": "The lack of knowledge and the inadequacy of tools and                      techniques for effective management of information has serious                  negative impact on the management and control of enterprises.                   Industry is beginning to recognize the need for research about the              creation, storage/retrieval, display, transmission, management,                 and use of information, as well as how to integrate all of these                processes through a total systems approach.  One of the ways                    industry can support the research necessary to address their                    problems is through an Industry/University Cooperative Research                 Center.                                                                              This planning grant is studying the feasibility and viability              of an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center in                        Information Management at the Georgia Institute of Technology in                collaboration with the University of Arizona.  The study is                     addressing the research interests and needs of industry,                        alternative organizations, policies and operations of a Center,                 and the potential for such a Center to become self-sufficient.                       The Co-Principal Investigators and their colleagues are noted              researchers in their fields and have the necessary expertise and                industry contacts to perform this study.                                             The planning grant is being co-funded by the U.S. Army                     Institute for Research in Management Information Communication and              Computer Science.                                                                    The Program Manager recommends that the Georgia Institute of               Technology in collaboration with the University of Arizona be                   awarded a $100,000 grant for one (1) year to fund this study.",
