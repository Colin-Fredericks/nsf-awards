 "awd_abstract_narration": "One method to evaluate our understanding of the climate                 system is to compare model simulations of past climate with                     reconstructions of the climate from the data available for those                time periods.  This is the approach of the COHMAP project                       (Cooperative Holocene Mapping Project), a multi-institutional                   (Brown, Columbia, Minnesota, Oregon and Wisconsin) effort focused               on examination of  the climate of the last 18,000 years.  This                  time interval encompasses the last glacial maximum, the                         termination of the glaciation, and the present Holocene                         interglacial.  The investigators are reconstructing climate from                pollen, lake levels, and marine plankton.  The global data sets                 are organized in 3,000 year intervals and include ice-sheet                     height area, distributions of fossil plankton, pollen and plant                 microfossils, and status of lake levels.  The project includes a                parallel effort to simulate the global patterns of climate with                 the Community Climate model of the National Center for                          Atmospheric Research.  The simulation experiments are \"snapshots\"               of the climate at 3,000 year intervals spanning the same 18,000                 year period and incorporating the effects of changes in earth's                 orbital parameters and slowly changing boundary conditions such                 as ice- sheet height and area.  Proposed work over the next                     several years includes (1) completion of global analysis of the                 observed paleoclimate and comparison with recent numerical                      simulation experiments, (2) initiation of new work with ocean                   models and comparison of simulations with fossil plankton                       distributions, (3) test the sensitivity of the model simulations                to variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide and aerosol that have               accompanied climate changes over the past 18,000 years, (4)                     intrepretation of data from North America, North Atlantic, and                  Europe for quantitative reconstructions of past climates.  This                 work should lead to an improved understanding and theory of the                 dynamics of glacial/interglacial (i.e., large scale) climatic                   change, to an appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of                   climate models, and to new insights about the nature of the                     relationships between the biosphere and climate.",
