Varekamp,                   Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Wesleyan                        University, to pursue with Dr. Adjat Sudradjat and staff members,               Volcanological Survey of Indonesia, for a period of 24 months, a                program of research on the geophysics and geology of the East                   Sunda and Banda Arcs, strings of small, active volcanoes, north                 and east of Timor in Indonesia.                                                                                                                                 By combining field studies of volcanic stratigraphy with                        petrography, mineral and glass analyses, volcanic gas                           geochemistry, and bulk rock element and isotope geochemistry, the               collaborators will obtain new insights into the origin and                      development of the enigmatic potassic arc volcanoes in this                     region.  They also will trace the genetic relations between these               volcanoes and neighboring calcalkaline volcanoes.  Studies of the               volcanic gases and hydrothermal fluids will provide an assessment               of geothermal potential of these arcs.  The collaborators are                   highly respected scientists with a record of successful research                collaboration in the region to be studied.  This project is                     relevant to the objectives of the Science in Developing Countries               Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between                U.S. scientists and engineers and their counterparts in developing              countries through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,                skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of                 mutual benefit.",
