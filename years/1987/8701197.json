 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ice nuclei can be applied to promote the independent                       freezing of large numbers of water droplets, and to transduce                   molecular events into macroscopic signals.  Ice nuclei of                       bacterial origin vary in their critical temperature for                         activity; the variability is problematic for practical                          applications, and its cause is not understood.  In this                         research, the ice nucleation gene InaZ is manipulated and its                   products are analyzed to discover what governs the variability                  in critical nucleation temperature.  Changes in protein                         concentration, caused by promoter substitutions, are correlated                 with nucleation frequency; this will indicate the molecularity                  of the assembly reaction for ice frequency: this will indicate                  the molecularity of the assembly reaction for ice nuclei over a                 range of critical temperatures.  The subcellular locations of                   mutant InaZ proteins are determined and compared to their ice                   nucleation potentials, to reveal relationships between protein                  primary structure, localization, and function.  Domains from                    heterologous proteins are substituted into the InaZ protein to                  further explore the requirements for nucleation at the higher                   end of the range of critical temperatures.  The information                     obtained is utilized in the engineering of ice nucleation                       proteins with enhanced capacities for forming populations of                    ice nuclei with uniformly high critical temperatures.                                The goal of this research is to analyze how the critical                   temperatures of ice nucleic are determined.  This is a                          thoughtfully concerned and focused research effort dealing with                 a significant phenomenon of great interest in biology.  The                     implications for frozen food processing, snow making, arctic                    ice engineering, climate modification and frost control are                     infinite.",
