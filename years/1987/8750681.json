 "awd_abstract_narration": "The psychology students will be provided with exposure to a variety of          basic scientific laboratory situations involved in the experimental             study of behavior.  A computerized biofeedback system designed to               measure human physiological responses (skin resistance, muscle activity,        heart rate and brain waves) is providing students with the opportunity          to study experimentally and clinically significant phenomena such as            conditioning, emotionality, stress, anxiety and the effects of                  theraputic interventions such as biofeedback.  Additionally, four custom        circuit cards, complete with interface relays and switches, are being           used in conjunction with the microcomputers and other hardware.  The            devices are designed specifically for the psychology laboratory and are         facilitating the integration of the microcomputers into the                     undergraduate laboratory courses.  Such integration provides students           with first hand experience in using computers to control experiments and        record and store data.  The equipment is also being used in support of          undergraduate student research projects.",
