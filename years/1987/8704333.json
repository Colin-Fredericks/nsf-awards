 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the biologic linkages between                 streams and surrounding terrestrial habitats in the tallgrass                   prairie biome.  Emerging aquatic insects and stranded fauna                     in drying channels are hypothesized to represent important food                 sources for terrestrial predators (birds, spiders, and mammals)                 due to the large biomass exported relative to terrestrial                       production and the concentration of this biomass along riparian                 corridors.  Spatial and temporal variation in emergence biomass                 within the watershed is large because of flash flooding and                     insect life cycles.  The abundance of terrestrial insectivores is               expected to be positively correlated with the magnitude of                      emergence production at sites within the watershed.  Predators                  are expected to rapidly exploit stranded fauna.  Measurement of                 rates of transfer to terrestrial habitats will involve a                        combination of experimental and descriptive procedures for                      community emergence, densities of terrestrial insectivores, and                 exploitation of stranded fauna.  The research is expected to have               significance in the examination of terrestrial-lotic linkages in                other biomes.                                                                           The project will offer an opportunity for participation by              undergraduate biology students in a formal research project and                 will allow the department to examine potential deficiencies in                  the curriculum related to the preparation of students for post-                 graduate training.",
