 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optoelectronics has progressed to the stage of being practical for some         applications.  These include communications, storage, and certain signal        processing techniques.  These developments depend critically upon a well        integrated research approach including materials, devices, and systems          considerations.  This is expected to be even more important for future          developments in the area, particularly those relating to the                    controversial area of optical computing.                                                                                                                        The central issue of materials will be addressed, particularly the              technical properties, availability to researchers, and new directions           with perspective of the lightwave technology area.                                                                                                              A second issue to be addressed is that of systems architecture.  This is        becoming increasingly important as lightwave systems increase in                emphasis and as highly precise technology developments allows the finer         aspects of systems principles to not only be tested but to be                   implemented.  The most obvious is that of coherent communications.              Also, however, are                                                              computational architectures, neural adaptive architectures, and the             entire area of nonlinear systems.                                                                                                                               The workshop will provide guidance for future planning of the lightwave         technology program, and will provide a forum for dicussion of issues            relevant to the quantum electronics field generally.  The attendance of         foreign specialists will allow a broader perspective and a view of the          efforts of other countries in this area.  It is expected that closer            collaboration among university researchers will be discussed.",
