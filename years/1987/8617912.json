 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this activity is to review how basic knowledge developed         in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) has been           and is being applied.  Three regional workshops will be organized to            bring together researchers who have been funded by the National Science         Foundation and U.S. Geological Survey, and policy makers of the region.         They will evaluate the ways that knowledge production and knowledge             applications in the region have evolved since the enactment of the 1977         National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act.  The goals are to learn from         past experiences and to identify research and applications agendas for          the future.  Incorporation of these agendas into NSF and USGS programs          will accelerate progress in mitigating potential losses from future             earthquakes in all earthquake-prone regions of the U.S.                                                                                                         The investigator is qualified to carry out this project.  He has                successfully coordinated similar activities during the past several             years.",
