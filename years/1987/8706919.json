 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is temperature measurement in grinding            using infrared sensors.  Precision machining of ceramic and other hard          materials is predominantly carried out by Diamond and Cubic Boron               Nitride (CBN) grinding.  The high temperatures produced in the grinding         wheel and workpiece is a topic of considerable interest because of its          significant influence on the surface integrity, the mechanical and              physical properties of the finished surface and wheel wear.  A critical         need is shown to exist for precise measurement of these temperatures.           This project is directed towards measurement of wheel and workpiece             temperatures in fine grinding and creep feed grinding using a new               Indium-Antimonide infrared sensor.  This sensor is of the non-contact           type and has an excellent frequency response that is uniquely suited to         measure even transient temperatures.  By sensing the temperature of             cutting points around the wheel, novel methods for adaptive control of          thermal grinding damage in the workpiece and detection of wheel wear            (wheel geometric errors) are proposed.  The latter will enable                  in-process compensation of wheel errors in automated grinding systems.          Besides, by studying the effect of various grinding fluids on wheel             temperature, this sensor can be used to quantitatively and rapidly              evaluate the performance of grinding fluids.  The infrared sensor also          offers enormous potential for temperature measurements in other                 machining and tribological situations.",
