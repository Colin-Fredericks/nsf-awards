 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is in support of a program of field measurements of                  Columbia Glacier, Alaska, to establish the relationships by which               basal water pressure and volume of water accumulated at the bed                 influence the basal sliding velocity of the glacier.  Columbia                  glacier is grounded well below sea level in a fjord;recently it                 began retreating rapidly while calving icebergs at an increased                 rate into Prince William Sound.  It provides a unique opportunity               to study the relationships between fast glacier flow and                        subglacier water.  Dr. Kamb and his colleagues will measure                     subglacial water pressure in bore holes drilled to the bottom of                the glacier, and to correlate variations in water pressure with                 variations in surface velocity.  Surface velocity, water balance,               and meteorological observations will be made simultaneously by                  Dr. Mark F. Meier and his colleagues (companion proposal DPP",
