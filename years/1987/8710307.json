 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant focuses on a church-           based process of electoral mobilization among black women.  Although            religion is thought to be a force that influences political action,             it is only recently that political scientists have attempted to build           a theoretical and empirical base to study the subject.  As a                    consequence of this dearth of research there is no tradition of                 research in this field that can act as a guide for analyzing the                electoral mobilization of religious black women.  Thus, this research           has as its main purpose the development of a convergent picture of how          the black church acts as an agent of political socialization, thereby           politically mobilizing black women.                                                                                                                             The research will examine data from five existing data sets.  The               first three (the National Survey of Black Americans, the Three                  Generational Family Study, and the National Black Election Study) are           national representative samples of the black population.  The second            two (the 1980 and 1984 National Election Studies) are representative            samples of the general population.  The latter two data sets will be            used to compare the relative impact of religion and church life on the          political mobilization of white females.  By having both a within-              group and racial group comparative research framework the investigators         hope to learn more about how and why religion influences the political          actions of black women.",
