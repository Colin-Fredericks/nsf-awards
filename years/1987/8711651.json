 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chlorine is the most commonly used disinfectant and oxident in                  water treatment in the U.S.A.  However, chlorination of water                   produces various halogenated organics including trihalomethanes                 (THMS) which are suspected carcinogens. Presence of halogenated                 organics are frequently correlated with mutagenic activity in                   water, ozone, UV radiation, have been used as effective                         disinfectants.  However, ozone and UV light do not leave any                    residual in water treatment.  Presence of a residual disinfectant               in thedistribution system is desirable for protection of the                    microbiological quality of water and prevention of aftergrowths.                This research is to investigate the combined treatment of UV                    radiation and chlorination as an innovative technique in drinking               water.  It is expected that this process might produce much less                chlorinated organics as end products then chlorination alone,                   while achieving removal of organic compounds by oxidation.  UV                  light acts as a catalyst for the reaction of chlorine with the                  organic compounds in water.  The UV light not only makes possible               the oxidation of compounds which would otherwise be resistant to                chlorine, but also increases the rate of oxidation of oxidizable                substances.  The proposed research will address the extent of the               organic removal and the formation of any halogenated organic                    products driving UV/Chlorination of humic material under                        controlled laboratory conditions.                                                                                                                               The P.I. is a qualified investigator to carry out this research.                She has 15 research publications in water treatment research.  An               Expedited Award for Novel Research (Bulletin 85-25) of $30,000                  for 12 months is recommended.",
