 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a coordinated effort of experimental work analysis in           order to be responsive to two major problems:  verification mathematical        modelling and prediction of the capacity of actual structures.                                                                                                  The emphasis of this project is placed on steel structures and                  components.                                                                                                                                                     The experimental and analytical laboratory studies to be carried out can        be conveniently grouped under three main headings:  (1) equipment, (2)          frames, and (3) joints.  These studies complement the scale field tests         on existing motion earthquakes which are underway or being proposed.                                                                                            The study of equipment includes investigation of the failure modes              supported correlation equipment response.  For the steel frame study a          4' x 6' shaking table will be used to study the response due to the             horizontal motion and the effects of vertical irregularity of frame             stiffness.  Detailed nonlinear models will be developed for selected            structures.  For joint study biaxial full-scale steel-moment connection         tests will be conducted and compared with the analytical prediction.                                                                                            The investigators are all competent researchers of proven track record.         The Principal Investigator is a leader in the field and is highly               experienced in the practical problems of seismic-resistant design.  This        research will fill some of the gaps in the current knowledge base about         the nonlinear structural behavior and will lead to techniques for               improved reliable design of structures subjected to strong earthquake           shaking.                                                                                                                                                        A two-year continuing grant is recommended.",
