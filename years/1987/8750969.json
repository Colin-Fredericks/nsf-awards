 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Physics Department at Rutgers University-Camden will upgrade its            present microprocessor laboratory in order to keep the student                  laboratory work in step with the already updated lecture material and           the changes in industrial employment demands.  The Department will              install fourteen microprocessor developmental study system units.  Each         unit will consist of a Motorola MEK68000ECB educational computer board,         video display, cassette transport, and interconnecting cables.  In              addition, a network switch, two printers, and cables will be added for          hardcopy of student ouput and system communication.  The new equipment          will give the student hands on exposure to the latest 16/32 bit CPU             architecture.  The laboratory exercises will illustrate synchronous and         asynchronous data acquisitions and control, 16/32 bit bus architecture,         8/16 bit I/0 control, higher level assembly language programming and co-        processing techniques with other CPU families.  In addition, present            laboratory support equipment will afford the opportunity of using higher        level system development tools such as Pascal, C, trace analyzers, and          process emulators.",
