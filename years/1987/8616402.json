 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this basic engineering research is to produce an                 instrument that will provide for control of leg muscle movement in              patients who have incurred irreparable damage to the nervous system             eg.,stroke and spinal-cord injury.                                                                                                                              The system will be novel in two ways:                                                                                                                                1. A predetermined sequence of electrical signals will be used to           stimulate the muscles of the lower limbs to provide a walking                  motion.                                                                                                                                                              2. A method will be used to predict when the leg muscles are               becoming fatigued.  This aspect of the research is very        important        since the patient can not \"feel\" the \"pain\" which         normally              accompanies fatigue and, thus, cannot order the      instrument to stop.                                                                                        The basic engineering component of this research has reached an                 appropriate level of sophistication that patient trials have begun.             During the next two years, the engineering component will have been             completed; NSF should terminate its advocacy role, and the principal            investigator should continue his research under the support of a                clinically oriented agency or industry.",
