 "awd_abstract_narration": "The area of neuroengineering and parallel computing are closely related         and their developments go hand in hand.  Of the various ways in which a         parallel computer can be implemented with individual computational              processing elements, the hypercube is one.  It is arrived at by taking          the sequence of a point to a line, a line to a square, a square to a            cube and subsequent generalizations to hypercube architectures.  A              processor is located at each vertex.  Such a topology is not as tightly         connected as others but is sufficient to allow significant speed-up in          those calculations involving processors in relatively close                     neighborhoods.                                                                                                                                                  The neural architecture is connected much more densely.  It is also             analog and involves nonlinear summing of signals with subsequent                thresholding (taking a large signal or nothing depending upon whether           the sum is large or small).  It is thus quite different, although it has        parallelism in common.  The hypercube is a good parallel computer on            which to study the behavior of potential neuroengineering systems, for          example an artificial vision system.  Vice versa, the neuroengineering          approaches in development are excellent tools by which to control the           loading of the processors in a parallel machine such as the hypercube           and to control the actual numerical procedure itself.                                                                                                           The fields of endeavor are highly cross-disciplinary.  The benefits to          the engineering profession by support of such a parallel computing              effort will be enormous in terms of speeds of processing and                    calculations which will be attained, as well as large problems which can        ultimately be handled.                                                                                                                                          The orientation of the specific cross-disciplinary team is that of              neuroengineering.  This is an effort which involves vision in particular        and is directed towards its understanding and its operation as an               engineering system.  In addition, effort is being directed towards              understanding of learning and memory processes.  Learning in particular         involves complex processing which for the moment is too complex and too         little understood to be effectively, if at all, integrated into the             hardware of a neuroengineered chip or optical system.",
