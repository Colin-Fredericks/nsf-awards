 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallics Chemistry Program, Professor Vincent J. Catalano of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Nevada, Reno is exploring the use of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands to create luminescent, multimetallic assemblies.  The NHC ligands are considered better sigma donors than most phosphines, are easier to synthesize, and have the potential for increased pi-backbonding.  These characteristics allow for subtle tuning of the bonding and optical properties of their transition metal complexes.  In particular, polymeric Au-Ag complexes with NHC backbones described in this proposal are intensely photo-luminescent and are particularly well-suited to act as sensors for small molecules.  Initially, the preparation and optical properties of long-chain, Au-Ag polymers will be studied.  Later studies will focus on rhodium, iridium, platinum and palladium NHC complexes which are expected to form extended linear chain structures, with unusual ground-state optical properties.  The final goal of the proposal will be to develop simple bimetallic model complexes to understand the fundamental properties of the larger poly-metallic systems.  This proposal incorporates a broad range of topics giving students at all levels a broad education in chemistry.  Professor Catalano contributes to the infrastructure for research and education by directly overseeing the new X-ray crystallographic facility at the University of Nevada at Reno.  This facility serves several regional primarily undergraduate institutions such as Occidental College, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Lebanon Valley College and the University of West Florida as well as international collaborators in Greece and Turkey.  A new \"hands-on\" course in crystallographic methods, targeted especially to organic graduate students, will be developed as a result of this award and undergraduate participation will be strongly encouraged through independent research and the Advanced Synthesis course.  \r\n",
