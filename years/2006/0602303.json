 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop award supports a November 2005 workshop on Chemistry and Sustainability. The workshop has two objectives: (1) articulate a set of science drivers for Sustainability, from a Mathematical and Physical Sciences perspective; and (2) consider resources necessary to address these research opportunities. Geoffrey Coates (Cornell University) and Heather Allen (Ohio State University) are the workshop leaders. The diverse group of participants is drawn primarily from U.S. academic institutions, but selected representatives from the U.S. chemical industry, national labs and foreign universities will also participate.  The workshop is scheduled for November 2-4, 2005 at the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory at Pacific Northwest Laboratory in Richland Washington.\r\n\r\nThe science drivers that frame sustainability (environment, air, water, energy and manufacturing) from the perspective of molecular scientists will be developed and articulated. The participants will also become familiar with the researchers and unique user facilities at the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory. A summary report and interactive website will communicate the workshop discussions to the research community. \r\n\r\n",
