 "awd_abstract_narration": "Measuring and describing patterns of individual and population movement is a fundamental aspect of understanding the physiology, behavior, ecology and life-history of any animal.  Measuring movement also can provide the key to predicting species extinctions and invasions or the spread of disease.  Yet, we have long been limited in our abilities to track animal movements over large distances and across time. Following individual animals has always proven challenging for human observers.  Researchers must rely on technological innovations to expand our abilities to measure and describe movement.  Recent rapid advances in molecular, chemical, electrical, and remote-sensing technologies are creating new tools for tracking individuals and whole populations and opening new frontiers for ecologists by allowing us to follow small, highly mobile animals like migratory songbirds in real-time across continents.  The MIGRATE Research Coordination Network (RCN) will bring together researchers who are pioneering the development and application of emerging technologies for the purpose of investigating the amazing long-distance movements of migratory songbirds.\r\nLong-distance landbird migration is an ideal system for applying new technologies in ways that advance both the technologies and our ability to describe movement strategies.  To accelerate progress in these areas, the MIGRATE network will: (1) focus research techniques and questions on a small suite of model species that will advance understanding of ecological and evolutionary implications of long-distance movement; (2) foster cross-disciplinary collaborations among researchers throughout the Americas and Europe; (3) encourage standardized collection and sharing of tissues, technological advances, and data; and (4) create a platform for interdisciplinary training of students and the public.  Additionally, by working at the nexus of emerging technologies (e.g., molecular, electrical, remote-sensing) and ecology, this network will provide allow currently active researchers to engage students from groups under-represented in the sciences in novel research projects.  \r\nApplication of emerging intrinsic and extrinsic tracking technologies to novel problems in ecology will improve the technologies themselves.  The rigorous research fostered by MIGRATE will increase our ability to identify population-level sources of DNA, stable isotope ratios, and trace elements.  Advances in use of molecular markers will have applications across a broad range of disciplines such as identifying sources of bio-terrorism, commercial testing of ingredient purity, and locating origins of introduced exotic species.  MIGRATE will allow students to access the newest developments, make field scientists aware of state-of-the-art technology advancements, and provide an interface between industry and field ecologist in diverse countries. In areas of health and economics, the results of MIGRATE can be applied to understanding and controlling the spread of disease through animal movement.  Moreover, the ability to track individual migrant birds and identify populations will have immediate applications for conservation planning.  A complete and integrated understanding of migration ecology will allow for more effective use of limited conservation resources and provide scientists with the ability to use migratory birds to monitor ecological responses to global climate change.  This network will bring together a diverse set of approaches, facilitating communication among researchers on a multinational, inter-continental scale. \r\n\r\n",
