 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes to validate and evaluate a new technology for mirroring data from a primary storage to mirror storage across a LAN/WAN network for the purpose of data protection. The idea of the new technology is to mirror only the parity resulting from a write operation instead of the data itself. By\r\nleveraging the parity computation that exists in RAID storage systems, we mirror only\r\nthe new parity to the remote site whenever a disk write operation is performed.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nMirroring-only-parity (MOP) results in substantial data reduction making it possible to\r\ndo real-time data mirroring over limited bandwidth network without negatively impacting\r\napplication performance. Data can be computed back using the received parity and\r\npreviously existing data at mirror storage. The new method trades off inexpensive and\r\nfast computations outside of the critical data path for high cost and slow communication.\r\nPreliminary analyses show that an order of magnitude data reduction is possible\r\nwithout noticeable overheads that are generally required by existing technologies such as\r\ncompression algorithms and TCP/IP optimizations.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThe impact of the proposed research is expected to be dramatic and broad. Industries such as\r\nfinancial, health care, information technology, manufacturing, governmental, research/education\r\nall rely on digital data that needs to be protected from any unexpected disasters.If validated, our new technology makes it possible for any organization to inexpensively deploy remote data mirroring in \r\nreal time, which has not been possible because of the prohibitively high cost and intolerable delays of traditional technologies. The proposed research will have educational impact because the proposed experimental activities will be mainly carried out by graduate and undergraduate students.",
