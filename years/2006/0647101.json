 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) addresses a totally new, novel and untested idea with potential for very high return. The idea of creating thin films of Magnesium Diboride on copper substrate is a totally new and novel concept. There is tremendous potential for high return from this research effort. It could have a significant impact on the material processing and heat treatment industries in the US. A novel heat treatment process will be developed which will benefit U.S. heat treatment as well as material processing industries significantly. A novel technology and electroplating process will be developed, which will benefit the U.S. material processing, electronics, computer and superconducting industries significantly. The result of this process will be engineering materials with very little power loss and hence will result in a significant amount of energy savings in power transmission. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in the development and fundamental understanding of a totally novel technique for a superconducting thin film fabrication process. It will generate significant new knowledge base on the superconducting properties and phase transition in these films.  The broader impacts of this project include an impact on fabrication of superconducting films for possible device applications and a major impact on the superconducting and electronic industry as well as the plating industry.  This could facilitate the creation of new manufacturing industries in US and enable the development of copper wires with superconducting film, which will save energy and reduce cost of energy transmission significantly. The project will also train and educate one student in cutting edge technology of superconducting devices and thin films and thus creating a well trained technical professional.",
