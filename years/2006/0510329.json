 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cosmogenic isotopes such as 10Be and 26Al are widely used to determine the age\r\nand exposure histories of landscape features. Such information is critical to\r\nunderstanding the timing and rate of geologic processes such as active fault ruptures,\r\nglacial advances, soil formation and erosion of mountain belts. However, the utility of\r\nthese isotopes is limited by the high cost and intense labor associated with producing a\r\nsingle measurement. This project proposes development of cosmogenic 3He as a dating\r\ntool in common accessory mineral phases such as apatite, sphene and zircon. If\r\nsuccessful, this technique will be unique in several respects. First, it will allow rapid and\r\ninexpensive cosmogenic dating of a wide range of rock types, thus increasing the number\r\nof samples that can be dated in a single study. Second, because 3He is stable and has a\r\nvery high production rate, it may prove useful in combination with other cosmogenic\r\nnuclides to address problems such as paleoaltimetry, ancient exposure and burial histories\r\n(100 my time scales), and dating of archaeological sites and artifacts.\r\nSeveral technical challenges need to be overcome before 3He in apatite, sphene\r\nand zircon can be used as a cosmogenic dating tool. First, it is necessary to develop\r\nanalytical procedures such that the measurement of small amounts of 3He in the presence\r\nof large quantities of radiogenic 4He is not hampered by the \"tailing\" of low energy 4He\r\nions onto the 3He peak, or by space charge effects at high 4He abundances. The former\r\nis likely not a problem based on the demonstrated abundance sensitivity at mass 3, and\r\nthe latter will be addressed using a spike of standard gas inlet during the measurement\r\nof an unknown to calibrate the instrument at that He pressure. A second challenge is to\r\nverify the production rate of 3He, which will be done using samples of known exposure\r\nage from glacial moraines in the Sierra Nevada and Nepal Himalaya. Implicit in this task\r\nis identifying and correcting for non-cosmogenic sources of 3He such as inheritance from\r\nfluid inclusions and production via 6Li(n, alpha) + time -> 3He.",
