 "awd_abstract_narration": "NER: A novel Lab-on-Tip nanomechanical platform for single molecule DNA sequencing \r\nThis proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 05-610, category NER.  The objective of this research is to develop a novel Lab-on-Tip nanomechanical platform with an integrated nanoscale pore for single molecule DNA sequencing.  The approach is based on the different unbinding forces between DNA nucleotides.  As the target single stranded DNA molecule passes through the nanoscale pore, different pico-Newton level forces will be generated.  This force is then detected by the Lab-on-Tip device, which is developed using state-of-the-art micro- and nano-fabrication techniques.  Therefore, the DNA sequence can be obtained by monitoring the forces as the single stranded DNA molecule traverses the nanoscale pore.  \r\nThe proposed research has the potential to realize a revolutionary new DNA sequencing method and be a leader in the race to sequence whole human genome for $100,000 in five years, and for $1,000 in a decade. Therefore, this high risk/high return research is likely to bring significant societal benefits because of the crucial roles played by DNA sequencing in various biomedical researches and practical applications.  The research will be effectively integrated with education through interdisciplinary courses.  The PI is also committed to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\n",
