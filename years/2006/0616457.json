 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the development of a molecular-level understanding of chemical reaction processes on solid surfaces, with a major theme being organic moieties on inorganic surfaces. The formation of organic monolayer structures will be systematically studied, with particular emphasis on the formation of chiral monolayers, using STM. Variations in adsorption temperature, adsorbate chain length and functionality, and the effect of solvent coadsorption and competitive coadsorption of mixed adsorbates, will be used to probe the energetics of structure formation. Adsorption of molecules on mineral surfaces relevant to the questions of molecular evolution and homochirality in living systems will be addressed. Studies of multilayer architectures on silicon surfaces will be expanded, using organometallic and organic coupling routes to construct these layers. Multilayer architectures will be examined by vibrational spectroscopy (high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry), both in UHV and under ambient conditions. Finally, the thermal stability and decomposition mechanisms of organic monolayer corrosion inhibitors on iron surfaces, will be studied using a combination of UHV spectroscopic and electrochemical analysis methods.\r\n\r\nProfessors Andrew Bocarsly and Steven Bernasek of Princeton University are supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for studies with the goal of obtaining a molecular-level understanding of chemical reaction processes on solid surfaces, with a major theme being organic moieties on inorganic surfaces. Functionalized silicon and metal surfaces are of growing importance for micro- and molecular-electronics applications. This work will provide fundamental information about the structure and reactivity of organic monolayers and thin films. These results may help to answer questions about the development of chirality in living systems. Information from this work may be useful in the design of chiral separations media and chirally active catalysts. A fundamental understanding of semiconductor surface modification will be useful in the development of molecular electronic devices. An understanding of corrosion inhibitor adsorption and decomposition chemistry may be useful in designing improved inhibitor molecules with applications in electronic materials and structural materials corrosion inhibition. In addition to fundamental knowledge gained by this basic research, students ranging from high school to postdoctoral fellows will be trained in the art of research by involvement in various aspects of this work.",
