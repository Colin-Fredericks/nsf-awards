 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis proposal consists of two main sections.  The first section deals\r\nwith coarse geometry and geometric group theory. The PI (together with\r\nD. Fisher and K. Whyte) has recently developed a new technique,\r\n\"coarse differentiation\", which can be viewed as a sort of\r\ndifferentiability substitute for quasi-isometries. Of course,\r\nconventional derivatives do not make sense for such maps, since they\r\nare not even defined on small scales; instead we must go to larger and\r\nlarger scales. Using this technique, we were able to resolve three\r\nlongstanding open problems in the field, namely proving the\r\nquasi-isometric rigidity of the three-dimensional solvable group Sol,\r\nexhibiting a transitive graph which is not quasi-isometric to any\r\nCayley graph, and showing that the two state and the three state\r\nlamplighter groups are not quasi-isometric. We list some other\r\npotential applications of the method, many of which are to problems\r\nwhich seemed completely out of reach a year ago.\r\n\r\nThe second section concerns the interrelated analytic study of\r\nbilliards in rational polygons, moduli spaces of abelian and quadratic\r\ndifferentials, and the dynamics of the SL(2,R) action on these moduli\r\nspaces. The PI also proposes to study related questions about the\r\ngeometry of these spaces, such as their volumes and their SL(2,R)\r\ninvariant submanifolds. In particular, the PI has found by numerical\r\nexperiment some polygons which seem to have competely unexpected\r\nproperties, and proposes to study them further.\r\n\r\nSome of the coarse geometry in the the first part of the proposal has\r\nunexpected connections to computer science, in particular the\r\nexistence of efficient algorithms for finding ways to disconnect a\r\ngraph by cutting as few edges as possible. In fact, one of our\r\nproposed problems is taken from this field. \r\n\r\nThe rational billiard, which is the main subject of study in the\r\nsecond part of the proposal is important in particular for the\r\nfollowing reason: Some natural phenomena are \"chaotic\"\r\n(i.e. unpredictable). These are often studied by statistical\r\nmethods. Others are \"integrable\" (i.e. predictable and regular). Other\r\nphenomena fit somewhere in between. The polygonal billiard is one of\r\nthe simplest known models of intermediate behavior. As such it has\r\nbeen studied extensively in physics as well, in particular in\r\nconnection to \"quantum chaos\".\r\n\r\n",
