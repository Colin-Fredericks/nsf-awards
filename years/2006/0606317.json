 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical summary \r\n\r\nThe focus of this project is on using a multidisciplinary approach to understanding the behavior of rationally designed liquid crystalline materials in the presence of external stimuli, such as electric fields and nuclear radiation, and then to develop these new materials for electrooptical and sensory applications. The proposed materials are nematic liquid crystals designed to take advantage of unique steric and electronic properties of boron clusters (e.g. carboranes), and the high cross-section of the boron nucleus for capture of thermal neutrons. The project involves the molecular design of new materials aided by quantum-mechanical calculations, the application of novel inorganic/organic synthetic methods, studying structure-property relationships, to include electrooptical characterization and aspects of nuclear chemistry and physics. \r\n\r\n\r\nNon-technical summary\r\n \r\nThis multidisciplinary program will provide excellent opportunities for the broad education and training of post-doctoral researchers, and graduate and undergraduate students including underrepresented groups in areas of modern materials chemistry to include chemical synthesis, characterization, and elements of device engineering.  Collaborations with staff at Oak Ridge National Laboratory will provide unique research experiences for the students that will make them uniquely competitive in the job market.  It is expected that results obtained under this program will contribute especially to the field of inorganic chemistry and will have significant impact on fundamental and applied aspects of liquid crystal research. The results will also be of interest to nuclear safety personnel, and they will play a role in the development of new types of neutron detectors to address important issues related to national security. \r\n\r\n",
