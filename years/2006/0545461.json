 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this CAREER award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Carlos Meriles of the City University of New York -- City College and his postdoctoral and graduate research students will develop a general strategy for high-sensitivity detection of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) for use in micro-imaging and micro-spectroscopy of organic and biological materials.  This will be achieved by detecting the change in nuclear polarization, via long-range dipolar interaction, of a hyper-polarized semiconductor tip as it interacts with a sample.  Prof. Meriles will also develop a new course on imaging methods for graduate students and will further develop his science course for non-science undergraduates.  \r\n\r\nDue to its low sensitivity, the spatial resolution of conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is limited.  Scanning microscopy techniques have much better spatial resolution than MRI, but these techniques do not have the superb chemical contrast achievable with MRI.  Prof. Meriles' group hopes to develop a technique that combines strengths of both MRI and scanning microscopy so that scientists may ultimately be able to obtain meaningful MRI images of single biological cells.\r\n",
