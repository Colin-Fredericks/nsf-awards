 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is providing scholarships to students in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences that enable the recipients to pursue studies full-time, enhance their educational experience, and enter the workforce in computer science and engineering fields. The College consists of 3 departments: Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.  Academic criteria for the scholarships include high GPA, strong letters of reference, and a well-thought out written plan of study. Professional criteria include participation in mentoring or other service activities and student organizations. Students develop leadership skills and career goals.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The scholarships enable the best students to concentrate on studies, and reduce the time spent obtaining a degree. Recipients are encouraged to explore creative and original ideas through senior design projects, participation in regional and national contests, independent study credits, and internships. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The project is preparing qualified workers in crucial computer science and engineering areas for local companies. It benefits underrepresented minority, rural, women and disabled students. It enhances the already-close relationship with local industry, leading to improved cooperation in research technology transfer.\r\n\r\n. \r\n",
