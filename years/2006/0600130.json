 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop integrated nonvolatile memory devices based on ultrathin ferroelectric polymer Langmuir-Blodgett films for potential use in nonvolatile random-access memories. The approach is to integrate the ferrolectric films with silicon field-effect transistors and conduct experimental and theoretical studies of polarization dynamics critical to device performance and reliability.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project is the application of our specialized methods for production and characterization of two-dimensional ferroelectric polymer films to improve key properties affecting the performance of ferroelectric memories, such as spontaneous polarization, switching speed, data retention, fatigue, compatibility with integrated silicon electronics, and manufacturability. The broader impact includes the potential for widespread application of inexpensive high-performance nonvolatile memories to portable communications and computing devices, such as, cell phones, personal digital assistants, MP3 players, and smart cards. The scientific findings will advance the understanding of polarization dynamics in ferroelectric polymers. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe project will enhance the university's research, education, and outreach missions through contributions to the activities of the Center for Materials Research and Analysis and extensive interdisciplinary materials research programs, through training of undergraduate and graduate students - including students from underrepresented groups - in the inherently interdisciplinary cooperative research activities, and through numerous outreach activities the PI's group actively contributes to, such as MRSEC summer teacher fellowships, Saturday Science (elementary school science participation), Project Fulcrum (middle school science interns), the Cosmic-Ray Observatory Project (high school research).\r\n\r\n",
