 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project described in this proposal seeks to a develop a framework for generating robust\r\ncomputer vision algorithms for use in closed-loop systems. A principal goal of the research endeavour\r\nis to examine the role that control theory may play in enhancing closed-loop computer vision\r\nalgorithms.\r\nIntellectual Merit. As a sensor, the imaging system can be wrought with noise, either through\r\nthe actual sensing process or through the geometry of the imaged scene. Consequently, the computer\r\nvision process can be interpreted as a signal processing task in the presence of noise and uncertainy.\r\nThis is further compounded for closed-loop vision systems, because the control effort can induce\r\nadditional disturbances.\r\nThrough an analysis of the classical Luenberger observer for finite- dimensional systems, the PI\r\nproposes to systematically build up a similar framework for filtering of closed curves, which are the\r\nby-products of th e computer vision algorithms known as active contours. Essentially, this research\r\nendeavour involves the development of a Kalman filter algorithm for closed curves, and involves a\r\nprincipled predict and update scheme. The main investigative challenge lies in the fact that closed\r\ncurves form an infinite-dimensional space which classical state-space observer theory is not capable\r\nof handling.\r\nBroader Impact. The successful consideration of computer vision algorithms as components of\r\na control and dynamical system has the ability to tremendously increase their level of robustness,\r\nwithout severely complicating the nature of their processing. As a particular application demonstrating\r\nthe potential impact and challenges of this research avenue within a specific area, the PI\r\nseeks to study the closed-loop control and estimation of bio-membranes at the mico-scale. The observer\r\nconcept described herein has the capacity to improve the signal generated from vision-based\r\nalgorithms that form the main information pathway of a closed-loop process.\r\nThe proposed education plan incorporates many of these ideas into existing computer vision\r\ncourses, as they are essential components in the use of computer vision for feedback-driven systems.\r\nSecondly, summer research and senior-design projects are anticipated to motivate the importance\r\nof control and dynamical systems theory for computer vision.",
