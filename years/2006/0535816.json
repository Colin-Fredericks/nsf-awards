 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nThis proposal draws on existing efforts to develop measures of elementary and middle school\r\nmathematical knowledge for teaching. Different from conventional assessments of mathematical\r\nknowledge (e.g., the SAT or Woodcock-Johnson assessment), these measures investigate the special\r\nmathematical knowledge teachers use to work in classrooms with students. For instance, these measures\r\nassess not only whether teachers know that 1 3/4  1/2 = 3 1/2, but also whether they can explain what\r\nthis equation means, can construct a concrete representation or word problem which corresponds to it, and\r\ncan understand and generalize from an unusual solution method for this problem. This proposal responds\r\nto a number of challenges that have arisen while disseminating these measures to researchers.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Learning Mathematics for Teaching project (LMT) disseminates pre-piloted forms and\r\ntechnical information for evaluating teacher learning in K-8 number and operations, pre-algebra and\r\nalgebra, and geometry. Teacher learning opportunities, however, frequently focus on more narrowly\r\ndefined topic areas  for instance, rational number concepts and operations. Yet items capturing teacher\r\nknowledge of rational number compose only one component of LMT's number concepts and operations\r\nmeasures. Because these current measures include other topics, they are unlikely to be appropriately\r\nsensitive to the content and effects of such professional development.\r\n\r\nIn response, this proposal argues for the construction of evaluation modules designed to be sensitive to\r\nand allow research and evaluation in the following areas: rational numbers; proportional reasoning;\r\ngeometry; data analysis and probability. In all but the last topic area, for which LMT will create an\r\nentirely new set of items, the project will review and supplement existing items, create a form composed\r\nof items that capture key teacher competencies in these areas, pilot this form, then compose technical\r\nmaterials that support these modules' use. These technical materials will include two parallel forms and\r\npre-equated raw-score-to-standardized-score conversion tables, to facilitate straightforward scoring.\r\n\r\nThis proposal also describes plans to improve the quality of dissemination training by exploring the\r\nnature of problems that arise when outside evaluators use these measures, and describes work to improve\r\nmeasures of teachers' knowledge of student learning around content.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThis proposal grows from a well-established measures development project. At every step in this project's\r\nhistory, the provision of high-quality measures has coincided with  and in some ways, depended upon \r\nprogress in building theory about content knowledge for teaching mathematics, and exploring new areas\r\nin measurement design and scaling. This will be the case in the work proposed here, as well.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThis proposal enhances the infrastructure for research on teacher learning. These measures can be used to\r\nevaluate teachers' learning in pre-service teacher education programs; to make comparisons between\r\npreparation in traditional teacher education programs and alternative routes to certification; to judge the\r\nefficacy of professional development aimed at improving teachers' content knowledge for teaching; and\r\nto estimate the effects of curriculum materials designed to improve teachers' knowledge of mathematics\r\nand students. These measures are accessible to users with limited technical expertise, comparable across\r\nprograms and approaches to professional development, and of high technical quality.\r\n",
