 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\n\tThe long term goals of the Bejsovec laboratory are to understand how signaling molecules are distributed within developing embryos and how that distribution specifies positional information within a tissue. The lab focuses on the Wnt family of secreted growth factors, which play a central role in specifying cell fates during the development of all animal embryos.  These molecules undergo lipid-modification but are capable of promoting long-range signaling events in populations of cells distant from the source cells.  In embryos, these events include patterning of the nervous system, limbs and internal organs; in adults, Wnt signaling promotes cell proliferation in stem cell populations and inappropriate activation of the pathway is associated with human cancers, particularly colorectal cancer.  The powerful genetics of Drosophila make it an excellent model system for exploring the molecular and cellular mechanisms of Wnt distribution and signaling activity.\r\n\r\n\tIn Drosophila embryos, the Wnt homolog, Wingless (Wg), is produced in a single row of cells in each segment of the epidermis but its activity is required in all cells of the segment for proper patterning. Previous work in the Bejsovec lab has shown that Wg can be mutated to disrupt its movement without destroying its intrinsic signaling activity. This suggests a cellular mechanism for Wg distribution that is independent of its signal transduction pathway. To identify the cellular machinery responsible for Wg protein distribution, second site mutations that suppress the movement-defective mutant phenotype have been isolated: these mutations show phenotypes suggesting that they influence the Wg transport process.  Aim 1 of this application proposes to characterize the genes identified by their suppressor phenotypes and Aim 2 proposes gain of function techniques for identifying other components required for transport.  These experimental approaches will reveal details of the machinery involved in processing and propagating the Wg/Wnt signal. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: In the field of signal transduction, most work has focussed on understanding receptor activation and the subsequent intracellular events triggered by ligand-receptor interaction. Much less is known about how ligands arrive at distant target cells to trigger response, yet this is a critical problem in embryonic development where many signaling molecules have long-range effects on patterning. This project, if funded, will define the cellular machinery required for ligand transport.  Identifying and characterizing the proteins responsible for ligand movement is a crucial first step in understanding this important phenomenon.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Ligand distribution may play a part in tumorigenesis and metastasis, in addition to its fundamental role in regulating embryonic pattern formation. This work in Drosophila will identify cellular components required for ligand transport which may have homologs that play a similar role in vertebrates. These may reveal new targets of mutation during oncogenesis, and understanding their activity will provide clues for therapeutic intervention in Wnt-associated cancers. The genetic screens proposed are ideal for introducing high school students and undergraduates to basic research. This laboratory is committed to providing students, particularly women and under-represented minorities, with hands-on experience in a research laboratory. Past students have co-authored papers, demonstrating their deep involvement in the research effort.\r\n",
