 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the PI seeks to expand her research program in industrial mathematics into the biosciences at the molecular and cellular level. As part of the University's emphasis on developing programs in genomics and bioinformatics, collaborations between traditional biosciences departments and departments such as Mathematics and Computer Science are being encouraged. The PI wishes to take advantage of this trend to form new research alliances on campus, which will enhance her research career, as well as increase educational opportunities for students. Therefore part of the project is for the PI to work at the Center for Integrated Bioscience (CIB) on campus and collaborate with Dr. Daryll Dewald on modeling processes in cellular signaling. The other part of the proposal is to build a new collaboration with scientists at Idaho Technology (IT), a firm that develops fast DNA detection devices based on PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Cultivating industrial contacts, especially within Utah, is important to the vitality and effectiveness of the Industrial Math Masters program at USU, which the PI helped to create in 1999.\r\n\r\nThis IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
