 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThis proposal presents a career development plan for integrating research and education on the topic of hardware system development for trapped ion quantum information processors\r\n(QIPs). Toward this goal, critical research activities for system-level design and enabling\r\ntechnology development are proposed. System design and optimization bounded by performance\r\nrequirements and available technology should be an on-going process in this effort. It is anticipated that a MOEM system that delivers the large number of precisely tailored laser beams required for qubit manipulation will be a critical missing technology component. Experimental development of functionally integrated MOEMS technology optimized for this purpose is proposed as the main activity of the proposal.\r\nBroader Impacts. \r\n\r\nThe technology platform for integrated MOEMS will find a variety of exciting\r\napplications in other areas of science and engineering research, including integrated atomic clocks, inertial sensors, optical communication elements and integrated optical sensors. A network of researchers with diverse expertise established will be valuable source of future innovation and research initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe educational component is an attempt to introduce a new paradigm for engineering education at all levels aimed at stimulating creativity, and ultimately will enhance the career prospects of the engineering students. The undergraduate curriculum development effort will concentrate on developing project-based laboratory experience at early stages of engineering education. Fundamental topics, like quantum information, will motivate the students while the projects will be managed to expose students to non-technical topics like teamwork and leadership on top of technical contents. The graduate courses will emphasize engineering principles for integrating cutting-edge technology into a practical system design.\r\n\r\nThe PI and the institution (Duke University) has successful track record of educating female and\r\nminority engineers, and will continue to expand research and educational opportunities for them.\r\n\r\nThese activities will stimulate collaboration between physicists and engineers on this front: historically, such collaboration played a critical role in every juncture of successful application of new physical discoveries. Forming a collaborative effort among experts with various technology components to realize a QIP in the long run will also be an important element critical to the success of the program.\r\n\r\n",
