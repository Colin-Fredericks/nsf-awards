 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\n\r\nThe workshop \"Frontiers of Theoretical Statistics\" is dedicated to \r\nexploring the most recent developments in the theory of statistics. \r\nThese include saddlepoint approximation, generalized linear mixed \r\nmodels, bootstrap techniques, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, Bayesian \r\n    inference, and combinatorial optimization, among others. The \r\nworkshop will provide an assessment of the current state of knowledge of \r\ntheoretical statistics, identify the most pressing needs for future \r\ndevelopments, and foster cooperation among research workers. The 12 \r\ninvited workshop speakers are well-known leaders in theoretical \r\nstatistics. They include Jim Berger (Duke University), Peter Bickel \r\n(University of California at Berkeley), Ronald Butler (Colorado State \r\nUniversity), R. Dennis Cook (University of Minnesota), Jim Fill (Johns \r\nHopkins University), Peter McCullagh (University of Chicago), Susan \r\nMurphy (University of Michigan), Nancy Reid (University of Toronto), \r\nChristian Robert (Ceremade University, Paris, France), Michael Steele \r\n(University of Pennsylvania), Steven Stigler (University of Chicago), \r\nand Bin Yu (University of California at Berkeley). The workshop will be \r\nhosted by the University of Florida Department of Statistics, and will \r\nbe held at the J. Wayne Reitz Union of the University of Florida during\r\nthe period January 13-14, 2006.\r\n\r\nTheoretical statistics is the foundation upon which all statistical \r\nmethodologies and applications are based. Many recent advances in \r\nscience, such as in biological and medical sciences, physical and \r\nengineering sciences, are intimately connected to advanced statistical \r\nand computational procedures. Some of the goals of the workshop are:\r\n(a) To identify some of the major scientific questions and challenges in \r\nthe field of theoretical statistics that can only be studied through \r\ninteractive research. Focusing on such problems and trying to answer \r\nthem will contribute to science and humanity in a significant way.\r\n(b) To provide support to new researchers by bringing them in contact \r\nwith experienced statisticians. The 12 invited senior speakers are \r\nleading authorities on many aspects of theoretical statistics. Their \r\nparticipation in the workshop will undoubtedly help in inspiring and \r\nmotivating the young researchers.\r\n(c) To provide a platform for new collaborations on theoretical \r\nstatistics and its many related areas.\r\n(d) Given the growing interest in finding immediate and direct \r\napplications of theoretical statistics, the workshop will provide an \r\nimpetus to permeate new ideas in this direction.\r\n",
