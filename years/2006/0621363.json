 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Coordinated Information Technology and Assurance Development and Education Laboratory (CITADEL) at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (NMT) provides an intellectual high ground for the education, training, practical application of information security and assurance. CITADEL trains students to become leaders, not merely practitioners, in the increasingly important field of information assurance and security. CITADEL provides faculty enhanced opportunities to work with the best students and researchers at government agencies and coordinates the efforts of NMT's CAEIAE, Information Technology Program, the Computer Science Department, and NMT's ICASA (Institute for Complex Additive Systems Analysis) division. This continuation of the current SFS scholarship program includes a customized course sequence to match the scholar's area of interest and research in information assurance and security, research and professional development, and mentoring components. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit. CITADEL brings the expertise of NMT's interdisciplinary faculty together with talented students to address real applications of information assurance and security. Current research topics include Adaptive Control and Dynamic Systems, Agent-based Financial System Modeling & Simulation, Applications of Soft Computing, and Network Security and Performance. By participating with faculty researchers, SFS scholars are learning to address current and future applications of information assurance and security. CITADEL expands the educational program by integrating substantial student research in information assurance.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts. The CITADEL program increases the representation of Native Americans, Hispanics, and women in information assurance and security. Of the 24 SFS scholars currently participating in the NMT program, three are Native Americans, one is Hispanic, one is Asian American, and five are women. To build on this success, recruitment and retention programs are being updated to further improve on the diversity of the student body. \r\n\r\n",
