 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the research of Andrei N. Vedernikov, Department of Chemistry, University of Maryland - College Park, investigating the selective aerobic functionalization of alkanes, olefins, and arenes using water tolerant platinum complexes. These platinum complexes will employ semi-labile, facially chelating NNO-donor ligands such as di(2-pyridyl)methanesulfonates and di(2-pyridyl)- or di(2-imidazolyl)phosphinates.  Computational studies (DFT) will be correlated with the experimental observations to explore the mechanistic aspects of this complicated system. These proposed catalytic reactions, in particular, are expected to fundamentally influence the chemical and petroleum industries, enabling the production of methanol from methane, glycols from olefins and phenol derivatives from arenes, using environmentally-friendly methods. Undergraduate and graduate research students will participate in every aspect of the synthesis, characterization and reactivity studies, gaining important insights into responsible alternatives for the preparation of chemical and petrochemical feedstocks.",
