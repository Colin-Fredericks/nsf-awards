 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to address the fundamental problems preventing commercialization of the silicon carbide high-power and high-frequency bipolar junction transistor. The approach utilizes a novel low-temperature selective epitaxial growth process (LTSEG). LTSEG offers an opportunity to eliminate the problematic ion implantation and plasma etching processes in device fabrication sequence.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe low-temperature growth technique discovered at Mississippi State University enables selective epitaxy and self-aligned device fabrication that had been previously impossible for silicon carbide. The new device technology is capable of eliminating the most detrimental problem of SiC transistor - recombination-enhanced stacking fault generation causing gain degradation. Record-high p-type doping efficiency and elimination of the implantation damage will drastically improve the peripheral base resistance and emitter injection efficiency.\r\n\r\nSilicon carbide bipolar transistor is eagerly anticipated as a power switch for military and space applications. In addition, the proposed research can facilitate the attempted replacement of Si electronics with silicon carbide in hybrid electric vehicles, which is pushed by the US automotive industry as a strategy for reducing dependence on the foreign oil supply. Aggressive R&D conducted abroad threatens the leadership of the US in silicon carbide field. The proposed development brings strong competitive advantage. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe research is uniquely positioned to contribute to the industrial growth in Mississippi by offering new opportunities for collaboration between the university and a local small business spin-off dedicated to commercialization of SiC technologies. It will be an excellent tool for attracting new students into the graduate programs and creating local employment opportunities.\r\n\r\n",
