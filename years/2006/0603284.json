 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abramovich will continue studying problems in\r\nmoduli theory, in particular (1) the moduli stacks of twisted stable\r\nmaps, reductions of moduli of principal bundles in characteristic p,\r\nGromov-Witten theory of stacks, and (2) moduli spaces of \r\nBridgeland-Douglas semistable objects in the derived category of a \r\nvariety.  Abramovich will continue studying problems in birational \r\ngeometry, in particular the strong factorization conjecture and the \r\ntoroidalization conjecture.\r\n\r\n  The area of study of this project lies within algebraic geometry, the\r\nbranch of mathematics devoted to geometric shapes called algebraic\r\nvarieties, defined by polynomial equations. While algebraic geometry\r\nhas contributed applications in coding, industrial control, and\r\ncomputation, the topics of this project are more closely related to\r\napplications in theoretical physics, where physicists consider\r\nalgebraic varieties as components of the fine structure of our\r\nuniverse. This is especially true with the first topic, moduli\r\ntheory. This theory studies a remarkable phenomenon in which the\r\ncollection of all algebraic varieties of the same type is often\r\nmanifested as an algebraic variety, called a moduli space, in its own\r\nright. Thus in algebraic geometry, the metaphor of thinking about a\r\ncommunity of \"organisms\" as itself being an \"organism\" is not a just a\r\nmetaphor but a rigorous and quite useful fact. Sometimes a collection\r\nof algebraic varieties manifests itself as a slightly more general\r\nobject, called a stack, rather than a variety. Such stacks are a\r\ncentral object of study of this project. The other topic studied in\r\nthis project is birational geometry, which is devoted to a certain\r\nabstract relationship, called birational equivalence, among algebraic\r\nvarieties, which lies at the foundation of algebraic geometry.\r\n",
