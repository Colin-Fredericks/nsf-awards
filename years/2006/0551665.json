 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, investigating new sets of application-aware methods to provide customized levels of trust (specified by application) via an integrated approach involving re-programmable hardware and novel compiler methods to extract security and reliability properties, supported by a configurable OS and middleware, develops a lab to support application aware hardware for trustworthy computing. The work enables ground-breaking experimental research in creating large-scale, demonstrably trustworthy, cluster computing platforms for on-demand/utility computing and/or adaptive enterprise computing. The infrastructure augments a cluster of computers, each with hardware and software support allowing certain application functions to be executed in silicon. The facility supports innovative research in new software that takes advantage of the reconfigurable logic available from the Trusted ILLIAC system, a validation system considered the cornerstone for quantitative assessment of alternative designs and solutions. Exploring customized trust models via an integrated approach involving compiler, hardware, OS, and middleware, the cluster architecture includes programmable hardware where many designs can be tested or optimized for applications without the costs of new chips. The Trusted ILLIAC supports a rich set of research projects that span online hardware-software assessment, efficient programming environments for heterogeneous multiprocessor systems, SW bug detection, HW validation, configurable trust-providing mechanisms, automated fault management, on-line model-based adaptation strategies, middleware support for trustworthiness, application-based placement detectors, and smart card utilization.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Trusted ILLIAC represents a fundamental change in how computing is accomplished (i.e., direct representation of tasks in silicon) enabling that paradigm by merging the new architecture with existing cluster and operating system functionality. In the field of trusworthiness, it provides customizable computing technology to the broader community of students, researchers, and institutions, enabling the creation of integrated trustworthy computing testbeds. The infrastructure benefits technology transfer efforts from research to real world environments, enabling collaborations with government and industry developers to determine how trustworthy hardware assists and how software stacks can be integrated into products.\r\n\r\n",
