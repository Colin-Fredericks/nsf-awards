 "awd_abstract_narration": "Krishnan Raghavachari of Indiana University is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to carry out research that aims to develop and apply a set of hierarchical computational models for use in quantum chemical studies of the surface chemistry of a variety of materials.  First, the highly successful G3 thermochemical series will be developed and applied to materials involving heavier main-group as well as transition metals where methodologies for accurate calculations are lacking.  Second, novel cluster models with non-hydrogen termination schemes including effective potentials on the terminating atoms will be developed to overcome the limitations arising from hydrogen atom termination schemes used previously.  Third, new methods for the accurate treatment of embedded clusters including electronic coupling between the different regions will be developed.  The chemical systems to which the newly developed methods will be applied include: (1) radical chemistry at silicon interfaces, (2) metal oxide atomic layer deposition (ALD) on silicon surfaces, (3) chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on compound semiconductor interfaces, (4) surface chemistry of silica nanoparticles, and (5) catalytic mechanisms on vanadium oxide surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe continued increase in the power of computers will soon yield unprecedented predictive capability.  This project will lead to fundamental insights concerning many important classes of materials, and as well lead to novel ideas fueling future technological advances.  Computational materials chemistry, as a rapidly expanding field, is expected to attract a great deal of student interest and opportunity.",
