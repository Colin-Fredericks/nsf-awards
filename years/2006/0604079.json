Conventional liquid-phase methods to prepare these types of structures are generally slow, and the associated interfacial chemistry is material dependent.  This research involves the use of a novel approach for the synthesis of these types of composite materials in which a mini-arc plasma source produces charged nanoparticles which are then employed in a electrostatic-force-directed aerosol assembly process.   The new approach achieves a speed of synthesis, and a level of control over the coating process and the composite structure, that cannot be achieved by any conventional method using liquid-phase processing.  The specific goals of this proposed research are to employ the new synthetic method to produce silicon-nanoparticle coated CNTs, and to then investigate the physicochemical properties of this novel composite material, such as the electrostatic charge distribution.  Ultimately, these types of CNTs are likely to have a variety of applications in nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices.     \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed work is addressed by the fact that students working on the project will be educated in a novel area of nanotechnology.  In addition, the PI will participate in various K-12 educational and outreach activities through the Wisconsin Career Academy.  Finally, the innovative nature of the research that is proposed will have an intrinsic broader impact since it is focused on a new growth area in the US economy. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
