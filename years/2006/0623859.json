 "awd_abstract_narration": "The abundance of hydroperoxides (hydrogen peroxide, methyl hydroperoxide, and hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide) will be measured near Mexico City during the MILAGRO field campaign.  These species are principal end products of the active photochemistry expected in the region, and a key reactant in the formation of sulfate aerosol.  Hydroperoxide measurements will contribute to the MILAGRO campaign goals of understanding the evolution of gas-phase reactivity, in particular the potential for increased atmospheric oxidation potential on a regional and global scale.  In addition, these measurements will lead to a better understanding of gas-aerosol interactions.  Photochemical and aerosol models are widely used to understand local, regional and global impacts of anthropogenic and natural emissions.  Improved performance of such models is a major goal, as they are an important method to explore the effects of a variety of mitigation strategies and potential future scenarios.  This work will have broad positive impacts on society by providing accurate experimental data on reactive species that can be used for validation and assessment of models.",
