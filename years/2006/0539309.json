 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop improved particle detectors for monitoring of semiconductor manufacturing tools. This detection technology will increase count rates for greater than 0.2 micron diameter particles by 100 to 1000 times improving correlations between the particle detector and wafer by greater than 10 times. For smaller particles this detector will enable detection, ultimately to the nanoparticle regime (less than 25 nanometers). The intellectual merit of this proposal is that it will advance the state of knowledge in the field of engineering and physics of microplasmas. It will broaden knowledge of plasma scaling and of the behavior of particles in plasmas. This proposal will improve the performance of semiconductor process tool manufacturer's products by enabling cost-effective, real-time monitoring. \r\n\r\nCommercially, the broad economic benefit of this program will be to enhance the competitiveness of domestic semiconductor manufacturers. Particle issues account for approximately 11% of manufacturing tool downtime and are a major cause of scrap and yield losses. This technology will have spin-out benefits for the entire nanotechnology field. By enhancing the small particle performance limit of detection it will enable nanotech researchers and manufacturers to address safety issues related to nanoparticle production.\r\n",
