Vaughan, Alexander Chigogidze\r\n\r\nThe Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conferences (STDC) have\r\nbeen among the most successful and longest running annual\r\ntopology conferences in the nation, attracting an international\r\naudience.  The conference for 2006 will be the fortieth annual\r\nmeeting of STDC. The conference brings together mathematicians\r\nand graduate students working in the two core areas, and covers\r\nmost areas of topology and of topological approaches to dynamical\r\nsystems.  The conference fosters extensive interactions among\r\nadjacent research areas and their applications.  This contributes\r\ngreatly to the advancement of knowledge through communication of\r\nrecent results to a broad audience.  Further impact comes from\r\npublication of refereed papers from among those presented. The\r\nconference emphasizes participation by graduate students, young\r\nresearchers, women and under represented minority groups. We\r\nexpect the conference to attract about 200 participants. The\r\nconference activities feature hour plenary talks and half-hour\r\ntalks in two parallel sessions given by leading experts, and four\r\nspecial sessions of contributed talks. The special sessions are\r\nentitled: Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, General and\r\nSet-Theoretic Topology, and Geometric Topology and Geometric\r\nGroup Theory. It is our intention that many of these plenary and\r\nsemi-plenary talks emphasize interaction of the research agendas\r\nof two or more conference areas.\r\n\r\nTopology is a diverse area of mathematics that grew out of\r\nclassical geometry and analysis.  Its language and ideas pervade\r\nmuch of modern mathematics. Topics in topology range from the\r\nclassification of surfaces in space to limits of sequences and\r\napproximation of various mathematical objects. A dynamical system\r\nis a physical setting together with rules for how the setting\r\nchanges or evolves over the course of time (for example,\r\npopulation growth and fractals).  The area of Dynamical Systems\r\nstudies ways to predict the long-term behavior of such\r\nsystems. The language and ideas of topology, which are heavily\r\nused in the area of Dynamical Systems, are often used in many\r\nareas of science such as physics, chemistry, and computer\r\nscience. Recently, topological ideas are finding application in\r\nareas such as biology, psychology, sociology, medicine, and\r\nrobotics. The meeting of the fortieth annual STDC helps insure\r\nthe continued progress, growth and leadership of United States\r\nresearchers in topology and topological methods in Dynamical\r\nSystems.\r\n",
