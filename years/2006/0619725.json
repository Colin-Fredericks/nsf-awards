 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nThe University of Notre Dame will acquire a Hamamatsu Streak Camera for incorporation into the Nano-Optics Laboratory.   The instrument will make possible sub-picosecond time-resolved optical spectroscopy of a variety of semiconductors, and will be used in conjunction with a near-field scanning optical microscope (NSOM) system. This will enable single nanostructures to be investigated with spectral resolution of meV, spatial resolution of ~40-50 nm, and temporal resolution of fsec, at low temperature (1.4K) and high magnetic fields (12 T). This state-of-the-art facility will be used for research into a broad range of problems related to nanotechnology, among them: optical properties of the III-V nitride semiconductors, both wide and narrow bandgap (GaN, InN, and their ternary alloys), quantum wires and dots in both III-Vs and II-VIs, magnetic semiconductor compounds, and semiconductor oxides. Many of these systems will be investigated through collaboration with more than 40 research personnel, with strong coupling to DOE and international laboratories. This instrumentation acquisition will have strong educational impact for students at both introductory and advanced levels. Participation of women and under-represented minorities will be enhanced, and interaction with two small businesses made possible.\r\n\r\n Lay Abstract\r\n\r\nWith the extraordinary growth of information and communication technology made possible by the \"Silicon Revolution\"of the past 30 years, many new materials are now under intense investigation. Understanding their basic optical properties is essential for progress.  The Nano-Optics Lab at Notre Dame already features near-field optical microscopy, capable of optical studies of objects that are hundreds of times smaller than those observable with conventional light microscopes. The new streak camera adds the ability to study changes in these optical properties at sub-picosecond times (less than  a millionth of a millionth of a second), creating a unique facility for the comprehensive characterization of materials leading to semiconductor-based electronic and optical devices, and sensors for biological, medical, and environmental applications. Educational activities will be coupled to a summer \"Introduction to Engineering Program\" for high school students, a new Engineering Learning Center for first-year Notre Dame students, the Siemens-Westinghouse Science Competition that takes place annually at Notre Dame, and educational outreach currently being developed for the new \"Science Teaching Building\" (Jordan Hall) which will open for the Fall of 2006. Efforts to increase participation of women and under-represented minorities will be expanded, and interaction with two small businesses made possible.  \r\n",
