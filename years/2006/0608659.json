 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Georges Guiochon of the University of Tennessee is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program with partial cofunding from the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems in the Directorate of Engineering to conduct fundamental thermodynamics and kinetics of mass transfer research in preparative scale high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).  The objectives are to: (1) develop an accurate and rapid method of determination of the competitive isotherms of binary systems using small amounts of the pure compounds or of binary mixtures; (2) identify the source of heterogeneity of the surface of chemically bonded silicas; and (3) study the interactions between immobilized proteins and different compounds in solution with particular emphasis on the measurement of the relative strength of the interactions of these immobilized proteins and substrates competing for interactions.\r\n\r\nOptimization of the performance of preparative scale HPLC is problematic and only by obtaining a better understanding of fundamental chromatographic processess can further advances be made.  This research will benefit academia, industry and regulatory agencies, and will also train students in separation science and expose them to elements in chemistry, biochemistry, mathematics and chemical engineering. \r\n",
