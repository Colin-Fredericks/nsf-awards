 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research deals with polynomial time approximation algorithms \r\nfor a class of nonconvex quadratic optimization problems which can deliver \r\nguaranteed high quality approximate solutions. These approximation algorithms \r\nare based on interior point methods for semi-definite programming (SDP) \r\nrelaxations of the nonconvex problems, followed by some randomized rounding \r\nprocedure. The investigator of this project proposes to analyze both the \r\nworst-case and the average-case performance ratios of the SDP relaxations \r\nfor nonconvex quadratic optimization problems under some realistic probabilistic \r\nmodels arising from wireless communication. The focus of proposed research is \r\non (i) design and performance analysis of SDP relaxation algorithms for \r\nquadratically constrained nonconvex quadratic programs, and (ii) probabilistic \r\nanalysis of SDP relaxation algorithms for the binary least squares problem. \r\nThe choice of these topics is strongly motivated by the applications from \r\nsignal processing and wireless communications. The approach will be to combine \r\nthe modern interior point optimization methodology with the theory of random \r\nmatrices to estimate the asymptotic performance of SDP relaxations for large systems.  \r\n\r\nOverall, the proposed research is built on the past successes the investigator \r\nhas had in developing new and applying the state-of-the-art optimization \r\ntechniques to solve some fundamental problems in signal processing and \r\ndigital communication. The latter two areas had been relying mostly on \r\nthe gradient descent or the least squares methods in the past thirty years. \r\nWith the recent advance of highly efficient interior point methods in \r\nmathematical programming, the opportunity is ripe to use these modern \r\noptimization techniques and the related software tools to help advance \r\nthe field of signal processing and digital communication, both of which \r\nare known to have intensive computational requirement.",
