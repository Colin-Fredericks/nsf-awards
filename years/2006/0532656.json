 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  conference is on the interface between convex geometry and harmonic analysis.  The  principle lecturer is A. Koldobsky of the University of Missouri, Columbia, who will deliver ten lectures on  a number of topics of common interest to both  harmonic analysts and geometers.\r\n\r\nParticular attention will be given to applications  of Fourier analysis to convex geometry (questions involving sections and projections of convex bodies, duality problems), functional analysis and probability.\r\nThe talks will be generally accessible to analysts and geometers, including graduate and undergraduate students. Particular mention will be made of unsolved problems of general interest.  There will be two hour-length talks each day (morning and afternoon,  Saturday through Wednesday), as well as special seminars, problem and help sessions for students. In addition, there will be time slots for informal discussions, and open problem sessions to encourage collaboration between the more advanced participants.\r\n\r\nConvex geometry is similar to number theory in that problem statements may easily be understood with a\r\nminimum of prerequisites, yet a wide array of tools may be brought to bear on the questions. The subject is very old, but is of current interest because of the recent introduction of Fourier transform methods and close ties to the geometry of finite dimensional Banach spaces, functional analysis, harmonic analysis and probability theory. \r\n",
