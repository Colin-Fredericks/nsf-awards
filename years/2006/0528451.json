The UCI-MSP program is comprised of a number of innovative activities that promote the academic achievement of students beginning in the middle schools and that act as pathways to two-year and four-year college possibilities. The program is based, in part, in partnership with four local K-12 school districts, four community colleges (two-year), and six universities. The program engages students' interest and has shown significant success. Program achievements include: K-12 students (thousands) have prepared science fair projects and participated in STEM informational outreach activity and K-12 STEM teachers have participated in teacher professional development; two-year college students (hundreds) have participated in STEM training programs; undergraduates students have received research awards and have authored/co-authored papers in peer-reviewed journals; and graduate students participate in the Minority Graduate Research conference.\r\n",
