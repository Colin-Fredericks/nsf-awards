 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis award supports research in elementary particle physics over a wide\r\nrange of topics in high-energy theory and phenomenology based on superstring theory. The behavior of multi-gluon scattering amplitudes at energies comparable to the string scale will be investigated. These amplitudes can be useful for analyzing the onset of string effects if the string scale is sufficiently low to be reached at hadron colliders. They and other techniques will be used to explore the properties of a number of aspects of different superstring theories. The research will advance discovery in high energy particle physics while training the graduate students.\r\nIt will also enhance scientific collaboration with international partners in Germany, Switzerland and Italy.\r\n\r\nThis project also includes the Boston area Theorynet outreach program which aims at explaining to general audiences what theoretical physicists do --- to students in high school classrooms and to teachers in individual meetings with theorists. Its main component is the direct interaction between physicists, high school students and teachers, through question and answer sessions and presentations during regular class hour visits and after class. Theorynet activities will enhance students understanding of science and will raise their awareness of the importance of fundamental research, especially in high energy elementary particle theory and in cosmology.\r\n",
