 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research centers on accretion and outflow in rotating stars with magnetic\r\nfields. Examples of such objects include young T Tauri stars, white dwarfs in cataclysmic\r\nvariables, and neutron stars in various binary systems. Here, a theoretical and\r\ncomputational effort will be undertaken in which advanced modeling codes, including a\r\n3D program using a cubed sphere numerical grid, will be used to investigate accretion\r\nand outflow processes among such stars. Specific goals are to: (1) Better understand how\r\ndisk material interacts with stellar magnetospheres, and which instabilities are\r\nresponsible for launching the disk matter to the magnetic field lines of the star. (2) To\r\nexplore how the multipolar structure of a stellar magnetosphere influences the accretion\r\nprocess. And (3) to determine what is the dominant mechanism of launching outflows\r\nfrom magnetized stars.\r\nThe techniques and numerical methods developed here will also have general value and\r\nare applicable in other areas of science like planetary science, geophysics, earth\r\nmagnetospheric science, heliospheric science, and in engineering. Young scientists\r\n(including undergraduates and graduate students) will be trained in\r\nmagnetohydrodynamics. A research associate will also be supported who, in addition to\r\nworking closely with the Principle Investigators, will aid in the education of students.\r\nResults from this work will be incorporated into the groups outreach programs, including\r\nand exhibit at the local Science Center and in an outreach program being developed for\r\nschool children and teachers.",
