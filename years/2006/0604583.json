 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe main part of the proposal deals with the systematic development of\r\nhigher Grothendieck-Witt groups, alias hermitian K-theory, of exact\r\ncategories and schemes, from the point of view of derived categories, and\r\nof certain Waldhausen categories with duality. In particular, the PI will\r\ninvestigate how to remove the ubiquitous assumption of \"2 being invertible\".\r\nIn a second part, the wealth of known results on the structure of derived\r\ncategories will be applied to yield new calculations in algebraic\r\nK-theory, higher Grothendieck-Witt theory, stabilized Witt-theory and\r\ncyclic homology. In a third part, the relation between hermitian K-theory\r\nand A^1 homotopy theory will be investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlgebraic K-theory, higher Grothendieck-Witt theory, stabilized\r\nWitt-theory and cyclic homology are \"(co-) homology theories\" used to\r\nstudy solutions of systems of polynomial equations. Cohomology theories\r\nhave first been developed by algebraic topologists in order to study\r\nproperties of geometric objects which don't change under small\r\ndeformations. Later, in order to study systems of polynomial equations\r\n(whose properties can drastically change under small deformations),\r\nalgebraic geometers/topologists developed analogous cohomology theories\r\nin an algebraic context. They allow us to use our intuition from 3\r\ndimensional space and our experience with working with real numbers, to\r\nunderstand polynomial equations in higher dimensions, and in other number\r\nsystems, (used e.g in cryptography) where 1+1 could be equal to 0. In\r\norder to study these cohomology theories one needs to break up their\r\nvalues into simpler building blocks, which, in general, is a very\r\ndifficult problem. Frequently, however, one can observe this \"breaking up\r\ninto simpler building blocks\" on the level of derived categories, which\r\nare algebro-categorical objects attached with systems of polynomial\r\nequations. This project investigates the relationship between derived\r\ncategories and the cohomology theories mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
