 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"IPY:  Engaging Antarctica\" is an informal science education project designed to increase public awareness of Antarctic geological research and discovery during the International Polar Year. Submitted through NET Television, the project will produced a PBS one-hour television documentary for air on NOVA in fall 2008 (w.t. \"Antarctica's Icy Secrets\") complemented by a multi-faceted outreach effort.  The intended impacts of \"Engaging Antarctica\" are to:  1) enhance the general public's awareness and understanding of scientific research conducted in Antarctica; 2) create innovative collaborations for developing and disseminating Antarctic educational materials; and 3) enhance our knowledge of how youth and adults understand Antarctic research.  The documentary will illuminate geoscience research as it being accomplished throughout IPY and specifically focus on the ANDRILL project, a major focal point during the global campaign of polar education and analyses.  The program will document how scientists search for evidence to resolve conflicting hypotheses regarding ice sheet history and dynamics.  NOVA Online will create a companion site for the program.  In addition, the outreach materials include the Flexhibit, a digital package of high resolution images and files (visual and audio) accessible via the web, at no cost to the user.  These will include scientist's stories in their own words, and inquiry-based activities developed by LuAnn Dahlman, the TERC geoscience curriculum specialist.  Dahlman will work with the ARISE educators who have been selected to go to Antarctica to work with the ANDRILL science team.  Mini-grants will be given to youth organizations in low income communities to participate in the trial test of the Flexhibit activities and enable participation in the project.  Multimedia Research will conduct front-end and formative evaluation.  Summative evaluation will be conducted by Multimedia Research and Amy Spiegel, from the University of Nebraska Center for Instructional Innovation.",
