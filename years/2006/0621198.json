 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to understand the sources of contamination of mechanical components by manufacturing byproducts. This understanding will be used to establish methodologies for cleaning-conscious design feedback to product developers, improved process planning for manufacturing, and optimization of mechanical cleaning technologies.  Reducing and preventing solid particle contamination (such as detached burrs and chips from machining and sand from casting) on the surfaces of mechanical components and improving the effectiveness of cleaning will be addressed throughout the product development chain, from the early stages of product design and prototyping to finishing processes and quality assurance in manufacturing. Specifically, this research will: i. develop metrics and measurement methodologies for cleanliness and cleanability, ii. improve our theoretical understanding of geometric aspects of cleaning, validated by experimental data, iii. propose new methods for modeling and solving constrained accessibility problems, iv. develop efficient algorithms and data structures to support automated process planning for cleaning and assessing ease of cleanability (Design for Cleanability (DFC) software for designers allowing informed decisions trading off cleanability against functionality), and, v. study the trade-offs between cleanability and functionality from a component design standpoint.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will result in a methodology for addressing contamination related part design, processing and cleaning issue. The benefits will include a significant improvement in product quality, reduction in the cost of warranty claims due to residual contaminants and a substantial reduction in the consumption of cleaning related energy and consumables. Student participation at Berkeley will result in an excellent training experience and preparation for industry careers or additional study.",
