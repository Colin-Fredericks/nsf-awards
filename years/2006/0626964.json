 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research develops a unified mathematical framework for estimating the capacity and designing efficient cross-layer protocols in wireless ad hoc and mesh networks. In contrast to earlier efforts to derive analytical bounds on the capacity of random instances, the focus here is an algorithmic theory of network capacity. The mathematical programming framework guides the development of novel cross-layer protocols, and the theoretical effort is complemented by careful implementation and evaluation of protocols within existing simulation tools, such as ns-2, as well as on real rooftop wireless networks. The research consists of three basic components:  (1) mathematical programming-based formulations of network capacity and efficient algorithms for computing capacity under multiple constraints, such as latency, energy, interference, etc; (2) the design and development of protocols and associated metrics that are motivated by the mathematical programming framework, and (3) prototype implementation and rigorous statistical analysis of protocols in a simulation environment, as well as on real roof-top wireless networks. \r\n\r\nThe algorithmic theory of network capacity is useful in establishing the fundamental achievable limits of wireless networks for information transmission. New statistical techniques result in the ability to characterize the algorithmic interactions between protocols. The rigorous statistical methods for performance evaluation, combined with simulation based experiments, yield general methods for quantifying uncertainty in simulations of complex systems. The research provides students hands-on experience in building real wireless networks. New classroom courses enhance graduate as well as undergraduate curricula in numerous disciplines. \r\n",
