 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this workshop supported by the Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering, Dr. Sergio E. Ulloa of Ohio University will support the participation of a group of fifteen U.S. researchers in a two-day international workshop entitled \"Correlation Effects on Surfaces and Nanostructure systems\" in Angra dos Reis, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, December 5-8, 2005.  The group of US researchers includes postdoctoral fellows, as well as junior and senior researchers in this area.\r\n\r\nNanoscale science is a field with impact on many different disciplines.  In the present workshop results will be presented on an important and topical subfield, namely correlation effects on surfaces (by their nature, nanoscale systems) and nanostructures.  Bringing some of the top people in the area together for an intensive exchange of results and ideas has obvious importance.  The project should strengthen collaborations with foreign scientists.  This is an excellent way to make young Latin American scientists (undergraduates, graduate students and post-docs) aware of the possibilities to continue their studies in the US, and the program is well set up to maximize this.\r\n",
