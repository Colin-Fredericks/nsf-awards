 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Chemistry, the Biological Sciences Directorate and the Office of Multidisciplinary Affairs jointly fund this award to the University of Texas at Austin to establish an Undergraduate Research Collaborative within the University of Texas at Austin College of Natural Sciences. The PI for this project is Mary Ann Rankin, who will be assisted by Co-PIs Ruth Shear, Sarah Simmons and Scott Stevens. One hundred twenty students from the CNS entering freshman class will be recruited to participate in an Undergraduate Research Collaborative experience that will introduce the student to critical thinking, data interpretation, hands-on experimentation, and also increase interaction with research faculty and includes peer mentoring. After their training, students will be experienced in a broad range of techniques in the areas of chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, or nanotechnology and will be either matched with individual faculty laboratories or placed in research internships in industry to further their research training. The UT-URC model incorporates research as a means of teaching large numbers of students with the goals of (1) recruiting and retaining students in chemistry and allied sciences, (2) engaging large numbers of students in publishable research, (3) improving the success of undergraduates in their education goals and engendering lasting interest in science and research, (4) training students in research early in their undergraduate experience by incorporating authentic research experiences into a teaching setting, (5) cultivating an expanded research culture on the UT campus, (6) driving curriculum reform at the College and University levels and (7) enhancing collaboration to promote education through undergraduate research. Assessment and evaluation of the UT-URC will provide quantitative and qualitative data from both students and faculty, using control groups from within CNS. Longitudinal success of student performance will be followed using student centered survey tools and assessment rubrics that have already been developed. Special efforts will be made to reach student populations that are currently underrepresented in science and mathematics through close cooperation with the UTeach and TIP programs. When fully implemented in five years, the UT-URC will impact 2,000 students annually.",
