 "awd_abstract_narration": "Background\r\n\r\nModern high-performance systems are chronically underutilized not because their job queues\r\nare short, but because each task uses just a small fraction of the power available on each node.\r\nCompiled code simply does not achieve a reasonable fraction of the available performance, despite\r\nyears of work in academia and in research labs that aimed to improve the situation. Some of the\r\nperformance gap is due to architecture and design; however, a portion of it is directly attributable\r\nto the design of  optimizing compilers. Standard optimization techniques fail to discover and fix such problems, in part because they operate at a procedure-level granularity and in part because the remedy requires the compiler to change its approach to optimizing that part of the code to use another order or another transformation scheme. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\n\r\nIn this project, the PI will develop a feedback-driven adaptive compilation harness\r\nthat specifically targets improvements in small regions of underperformance. To make the regional\r\nscheme work, his team  will enhance and reformulate two powerful optimizations, rematerialization and\r\nreassociation, and re-scope others so that they operate on a regional rather than a global scope.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThis project will directly support graduate education at Rice. The positive research\r\nresults will be taught in a Rice graduate course on the subject; the material will reach a broad\r\naudience because the teaching materials for the course are used at other institutions. The work in\r\nthis project will add to the code base for the Rice University research compiler, which is distributed free of\r\ncharge in source-code form to others in both academia and industry. The PI will use a combination of\r\nlocal funds and directed research projects to include undergraduates directly in this work.",
