The main focus is on fluid systems for\r\nwhich a unique top-level periodic orbit of pseudo-Anosov type has\r\nbeen \"built in.\"  This work is accomplished using an integrated\r\nprogram of theoretical, numerical, and experimental research.  In\r\nparticular, the investigators (1) advance the rigorous\r\nmathematical theory underlying topological chaos; (2) use the\r\ntheory to develop an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms\r\nof mixing in several canonical fluid flows of practical interest;\r\nand (3) leverage these developments to advance current laminar\r\nmixing technology.  The mathematical/theoretical and\r\nnumerical/experimental components of this project are mutually\r\nsupporting.  The theory provides ideas and a basic framework for\r\nthe design and analysis of fluid mixing, while the fluid\r\napplications provide evidence for or against the posed\r\nconjectures and suggest ideas for additional development of the\r\ntheory.  The intellectual merit of this work includes its\r\nextensions of the Thurston-Nielsen theory, its contributions to\r\nthe fundamental understanding of fluid stirring and the role of\r\ntopological methods in global predictions of chaos, and its\r\ndetailed analysis of fluid systems of interest for practical\r\nmixing enhancement.\r\n\r\n     Laminar fluid flow systems are at the center of numerous\r\nmajor advances in medical, biological, chemical, and material\r\nprocessing applications that are important for improving human\r\nhealth, advancing scientific discovery, and maintaining national\r\nsecurity.  Fluid mixing is known to play a significant role in\r\nthese applications, and mixing enhancement is most often achieved\r\nthrough efficient stirring.  Further advances in laminar mixing\r\nenhancement are limited in part by the tools used to model,\r\nanalyze, and predict efficient stirring in laminar flows.  A\r\ntopological method based on a deep mathematical theory due to\r\nThurston and Nielsen has recently been applied to fluid stirring\r\nenhancement by the investigators and others with quite dramatic\r\nresults.  The mathematical theory, when properly applied,\r\nprovides a means to \"design for chaos\" predictively.  The broader\r\nimpacts of this work include promoting teaching and learning at\r\nthe undergraduate and graduate levels, seeking to broaden the\r\nparticipation of underrepresented groups in research, enhancing\r\ninteraction between the engineering and mathematics communities,\r\nand benefiting society by developing the techniques for mixing\r\nenhancement in laminar flow.\r\n",
