 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed that the National Science Foundation provide funding  for the meetings of the Pacific Northwest Geometry Seminar (PNGS) to be held  during the three-year period from July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2009 at University of British Columbia, Oregon State University, University of Oregon, University of Utah, University of Washington,  Portland State University, and Stanford University.  PNGS meetings generally feature  4 to 6 invited research talks by leading experts in differential geometry and  algebraic geometry. The meetings also include discussion sessions in which the speakers and participants assess the state of various areas in geometry, and highlight open problems in these areas.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of very active researchers in geometry scattered  throughout the various universities which are involved in the Pacific  Northwest Geometry Seminar. These periodic meetings bring these  researchers together for consultation, collaboration,  and  stimulation of new ideas. A significant number of research programs  have been initiated as a result of interactions at these meetings.  The PNGS is especially valuable for graduate students in geometry at  the various participating universities which have small geometry  groups. The PNGS meetings give these students an excellent  opportunity to see the broader picture of research in geometry. The  meetings are also very valuable for the growing number of geometers  working at some of the smaller universities in the region, such as  Pacific University, Lewis and Clark, Seattle University, and Idaho  State. More information can be found on the conference website located at\r\nwww.math.washington.edu/~lee/PNGS",
