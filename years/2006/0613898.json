 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers from three U.S. museums and two U.S. universities, plus a \r\nworldwide group of over 20 colleagues, will collaborate to conduct a global \r\nsurvey and inventory of the dwarf hunting spiders. These animals are very \r\npoorly known; preliminary data indicate that the 459 currently described \r\nspecies represent only about 20% of the actual diversity of the group. The \r\nteam will assemble and sort the specimens available in collections and \r\nacquire new material through 12 expeditions that will concentrate on \r\nsecuring better samples of forest floor and canopy-dwelling species. Team \r\nmembers will build Internet-accessible databases of the species, all specimen locality \r\ndata, and images; a new application will allow team members to enter descriptive \r\ndata into a multi-user database, in a highly structured format that will \r\nallow direct use of that information in formal descriptions for \r\npublication, on species web pages, in phylogenetic analyses, and in \r\ninteractive keys. Automated identification systems, using artificial \r\nneural networks, will be developed, and the accuracy of those systems will \r\nbe compared with that achieved by workers, ranging from total beginners to \r\nknowledgeable specialists, using interactive keys to the same species. \r\n\r\nOther impacts of the project include training several high \r\nschool, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students (with emphasis \r\non recruiting members of groups currently underrepresented in the science \r\nworkforce). Project outreach plans include a major traveling museum \r\nexhibition designed to focus public attention on the importance and \r\nexcitement of biodiversity discovery and preservation. Extensive \r\npublic-aimed web materials will be developed that will be useful for \r\npre-college level teaching.",
