 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using 4He/3He thermochronometry to quantify the rate and timing of Canadian Shield\r\nfjord incision\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit - The relationship between topographic relief development and climate\r\nchange has emerged as a critical topic in earth science. Linking relief generation to climate\r\nchange, e.g. the onset of the Quaternary ice age, relies on a quantitative understanding of the\r\npattern and timing of glacial erosion. Although alpine glacial erosion in active orogenic belts has\r\nbeen the focus of recent research, fjorded continental margins, arguably the sites of the most\r\nintense glacial incision, in which fjords >1 km deep have been inserted since the ice ages began,\r\nhave yet to be examined in detail. The rates and spatial patterns of fjord insertion, and the\r\nfeedbacks between ice sheet dynamics, topography, and glacial erosional processes are important\r\ncomponents of Quaternary climate and landscape change. The aim of this research is to quantify\r\nthe temporal and spatial evolution of a fjord inserted into the northern Canadian Shield by the\r\nLaurentide Ice Sheet. The research team will apply a novel tool, 4He/3He thermochronometry, to\r\nquantify the rate and pattern of formation of Clyde Inlet, a fjord on Baffin Island typical of\r\ndozens of other fjords rimming the Canadian Shield, and representative of fjords around both\r\nGreenland and Norway.\r\nSamples for 4He/3He thermochronometry will document the thermal history of Clyde Inlet,\r\nwhich in turn will constrain the long-term incision history of the fjord. Both fjord cross-section\r\nand fjord long-profile sample sets will be collected, which will potentially quantify both vertical\r\nexhumation and headward propagation rates of the fjord. The results of the proposed research\r\nrepresent a critical step toward the team's longer-term goal of improving the understanding of\r\nthe feedbacks between ice sheet dynamics and landscape evolution. The erosional history of the\r\nfjord is the key observational constraint for numerical ice sheet simulations aimed at solving the\r\ncomplex feedbacks between topography and ice sheet behavior. The erosional history of fjords\r\nexerts a significant control on ice sheet thickness and configuration, the locations of major ice\r\nstreams and their onset zones, and the overall stability and configuration of marine-based\r\nmargins of ice sheets.\r\nBroader Impacts - This research will train one early-career scientist (Briner) and will expose\r\ngraduate and undergraduate students at the Universities of Buffalo and Colorado to novel\r\napplications and exciting earth science problems. Research activities under this award will be\r\nmade accessible to indigenous peoples by translating the goals and eventual results into Inuktitut,\r\nmaking posters that describe the research, and by offering public lectures in Iqaluit, the capital of\r\nNunavut, and at Clyde River, our proposed field base. The team will continue their tradition of\r\nworking with the people of Clyde River, including guides, the Hunter's and Trapper's\r\nAssociation and high school students. In addition, Anderson will continue his efforts to educate\r\nthe broader public about glacial landscape evolution through involvement in ranger training\r\nprograms at US National Parks in which glaciers have played significant roles in sculpting the\r\nlandscape, and in generation of simulations that can serve both as educational tools in K-12 and\r\ncollege classrooms, and as dynamic content in National Park displays.",
