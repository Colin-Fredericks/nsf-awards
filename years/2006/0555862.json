 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal studies two issues within the area of \r\nquantization theory. The first issue, building on the PI's \r\nearlier work, is the holomorphic quantization of symmetric \r\nspaces. Attention will be given mainly to the noncompact case, \r\nwhere singularities arise that one does not see in the compact \r\ncase. Building on work of the PI with J. Mitchell and work of B. \r\nKrotz, G. Olafsson, and R. Stanton, the PI intends to find \r\nappropriate ways to cancel out these singularities. He intends to \r\ndevelop inversion and isometry formulas for the Segal-Bargmann \r\ntransform on noncompact symmetric spaces, with the goal of making \r\nthese formulas as parallel as possible to the results in the dual \r\ncompact case. The PI hopes to combine the approach used in his \r\nwork with Mitchell with the shift-operator method of Krotz, \r\nOlafsson, and Stanton. The second issue concerns the relationship \r\nof quantization to reduction. In work with W. Kirwin, the PI will \r\ninvestigate the unitarity (or lack thereof) of the Guillemin-\r\nSternberg map between the \"first quantize then reduce\" space and \r\nthe \"first reduce and then quantize space.\" We hope to \r\ndemonstrate that this map is not unitary, even to leading order \r\nin Planck's constant, but that inclusion of the half-form \r\ncorrection yields leading-order unitarity.\r\n\r\n     This proposal concerns quantization, namely, the \r\nconstruction of a quantum-mechanical theory corresponding to a \r\ngiven classical theory. In modern physics, the relevant theories \r\nto be quantized often have interesting geometric properties \r\ninvolving various sorts of symmetries. This proposal attempts to \r\nunderstand how this geometry manifests itself in the quantum \r\ntheory. The first part of the proposal is an attempt to extend a \r\nstandard tool in quantum theory, the Segal-Bargmann transform \r\n(closely related to the ubiquitous concept of coherent states), \r\nto more geometrically interesting situations where nice \r\nsymmetries are present. The PI's earlier work in this area has \r\nalready been applied in several different ways by workers in loop \r\nquantum gravity. The second part of the proposal concerns the way \r\nsymmetries interact with quantum mechanics. Most modern physical \r\ntheories (e.g., gravity, electromagnetism, relativity) use \r\nsymmetry in an essential way. The PI's work addresses the subtle \r\nbut important question of whether imposing the symmetries before \r\nquantizing gives the same result as imposing them after \r\nquantizing.\r\n",
