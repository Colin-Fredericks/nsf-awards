 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds on the prototype simulation environment, SimSE, and several associated simulation models that, together, provide students with a graphical and interactive experience of a variety of different software processes. That is, students can play, practice, and learn these processes virtually, in an engaging yet safe environment that encourages exploration of alternatives, provides visual feedback on choices, and fosters independent learning.\r\n\r\nSimSE contributes a new way of learning and teaching a critical and difficult subject, the software process, addressing a significant shortcoming in current undergraduate education in software engineering. As a Phase II project, the critical value of the project lies in transforming SimSE from a proof-of-concept technology to a fully-developed, strongly-supported, and conclusively beneficial classroom approach for teaching students the principles and realities of the software process.\r\n\r\nProject components include:\r\n- Broadening SimSE's technical features. \r\n- Developing a comprehensive set of simulation models. \r\n- Creating course modules.\r\n- Conducting comprehensive evaluation across multiple institutions\r\n- Developing faculty expertise. \r\n- Continuing dissemination. \r\n\r\nSimSE benefits students in gaining a broad and deep understanding of the software process, instructors in enhancing their portfolio of teaching methods, and the software industry at large in providing a diverse and internationally competitive workforce. As a Phase II project, the focus is precisely on enabling a smooth path of impact by lowering adoption hurdles, providing extensive course materials, and developing faculty expertise.\r\n\r\n",
