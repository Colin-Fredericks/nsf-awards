 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human-computer interaction (HCI), already acknowledged as an important discipline by computer scientists and those in related disciplines, will increase in importance as technology becomes even more integrated into our daily lives.  With top-notch facilities, equipment, and personnel, Virginia Tech's Center for HCI is poised to lead in the development of new interfaces and in the education of scientists and engineers who will build and use them.  Building on a long and rich history of undergraduate research, the PIs and affiliated faculty will engage students from regional schools in research endeavors.  Four regional schools that focus on women and minorities (North Carolina A&T State University, Bennett College, Hollins University, Norfolk State University) serve as partner institutions on this proposal, hosting visits and open house events to encourage their students to attend the program.  The summer experience will provide potential graduate students with a broad look at the discipline of HCI and in-depth experience developing interfaces for the latest technology.\r\n",
