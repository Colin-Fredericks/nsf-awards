This conference is the twenty-first in a series\r\nthat began at City College of New York in 1984 and has been held\r\nevery year, except 1986, at locations in the United States and\r\nabroad. There will be seven invited plenary speakers, all of\r\nwhich are international leaders in their fields. Additionally,\r\ntwo workshops will be conducted on \"Physics and Domain Theory\"\r\nand \"Selection principles in topology\", each of which will meet\r\nthree times. These workshops will provide opportunities for\r\nresearchers and students to obtain an up-to-date overview of\r\nspecific and particularly active areas of research.  Finally, six\r\nspecial sessions are planned, each of which will be organized by\r\na group of three leading researchers in the corresponding field\r\nand feature one semi-plenary speaker and more than twenty other\r\nspeakers. The special sessions are: Set-theory and Topology,\r\nTopological Groups and Semi-groups, Asymmetric Topology, Topology\r\nin Dynamical Systems, Fractals and Tilings, and Categorical\r\nTopology.  The areas of expertise of the plenary speakers reflect\r\nthe diversity of themes of the special sessions.\r\n\r\nFor more than twenty years, this series of conferences has been\r\none of the main forums for researchers in topology and related\r\nfields.  Topology is an area of pure mathematics that interacts\r\nwith virtually every other branch of mathematics in addition to\r\nmany other scientific fields. Applications of topology in other\r\nareas of mathematics, physics, and computer science have long\r\nbeen a focus of this series of conferences. The 2006 conference\r\nwill continue this tradition, as reflected by the variety of\r\nworkshops and special sessions proposed.  This conference usually\r\nbrings together over 125 researchers and graduate students from\r\nacross the United States and more than 25 other countries.  The\r\ngoals of this conference are to present participants with the\r\nleading experts and latest research in topology and related\r\nfields; foster collaborations and interactions between\r\nresearchers in topology and related fields; provide the\r\nopportunity for graduate students and underrepresented groups to\r\nbe exposed to the latest research in topology-related fields and\r\nto interact with leading researchers in these areas. The wide\r\nrange of special sessions and the types of workshops proposed\r\nwill provide the ideal environment for new interactions and\r\ncollaborations between researchers and students in different\r\nfields related to topology.\r\n\r\nFor more information see the conference Web site,\r\nhttp://www.cs.georgiasouthern.edu/faculty/mynard_f/STC06.htm.",
