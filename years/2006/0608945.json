 "awd_abstract_narration": "Martin\r\n0608945\r\nIntellectual Merit The Karst Waters Institute plans to sponsor an interdisciplinary\r\nworkshop on Research Directions in Karst Research. This workshop is designed to\r\nbring together biologists, biogeochemists, microbial ecologists, hydrogeologists, and\r\ngeomorphologists who have an interest in advancing all aspects of karst science. The\r\nworkshop will in part assess the current state of knowledge, but its primary function will\r\nbe to identify gaps in that knowledge and to describe (and write down) a road map for\r\nclosing those gaps. The workshop discussions will include questions from disciplines\r\noutside of karst science (e.g. paleoclimate, microbiology) that can be addressed in karst\r\nareas. The workshop is not intended to be a meeting at which only recent scientific\r\nfindings are discussed; instead, the workshop will be tightly structured leading to\r\nidentification of the critical science questions to be investigated over the coming decade.\r\nThe workshop is tentatively planned for three days in Fall of 2006 with tightly\r\norchestrated logistics. Following a short introductory plenary session, the participants\r\nwill be broken into disciplinary groups to discuss the important current science questions\r\nwithin their specialties. Three plenary sessions will be interspersed with the disciplinary\r\nbreak-out sessions throughout the workshop to allow cross-disciplinary discussions and\r\nintegration of topical science questions. At the end of the workshop and while still on\r\nlocation at the workshop venue, the key participants (disciplinary leaders and workshop\r\nconveners) will write the initial draft of a report outlining the state of the science in karst\r\nresearch and focus on what questions should be investigated over the next 10 years. The\r\nfinal draft of the report will be completed by the workshop conveners within several\r\nmonths of the meeting\r\nBroader Impacts The workshop should positively impact the human resources of a\r\nvariety of disciplines including karst science, hydrology, microbiology, and ecology. The\r\nfunding requested here will be used to offset travel and per diem expenses incurred by the\r\nparticipants, with the primary support going to students, junior faculty and disciplinary\r\ngroup leaders. Efforts will be made to include under-represented groups in the workshop.\r\nThe workshop will be advertised in several professional outlets including web resources,\r\nEOS, Geotimes, GSA Today, and Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America to assure\r\nbroad interdisciplinary participation. Additional funding is being requested from other\r\nagencies and KWI has allocated $10,000 toward the workshop for travel support,\r\nadvertising, publication costs and other incidental expenses.\r\n\r\n",
