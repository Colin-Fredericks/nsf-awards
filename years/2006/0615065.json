 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals initiate movements either in response to specific stimuli (such as touch, sound \r\nor light signals), or as a result of an internal change in state (such as hunger). One \r\nimportant aspect of such voluntary animal movements that has received relatively little \r\nattention is their episodic nature, with distinct beginnings and endings. Much is already \r\nknown about the networks of nerve cells that control rhythmic movements like flying and \r\nswimming, but the nervous system components that control the initiation and \r\ntermination of rhythmic behavior are largely unknown. The experiments funded by this \r\ngrant are designed to significantly advance the understanding of how nervous systems \r\nprocess information generated by brief sensory stimuli and how they thereby produce \r\nepisodic locomotion. \r\nExperiments will be conducted on isolated central nervous systems of the medicinal \r\nleech using two different approaches. One approach is electrophysiological, with \r\nexperiments to investigate connections among nerve cells that control the initiation and \r\nmaintenance of swimming movements. The second approach is pharmacological, with \r\nstudies on the neurohormone serotonin and on other messenger molecules to learn \r\nhow these substances are involved in converting the quiescent motor system into one \r\nthat is functionally active. Because there is significant functional similarity between \r\nswimming and related locomotory movements in all animals and because the \r\ntransformation of a system from quiescence to activity and back to quiescence is a \r\nfeature of all episodic animal movements, insights gained from this research will have a \r\nmajor impact on our understanding of how the nervous system controls animal \r\nmovements generally. \r\nThe activities funded by this grant have a broader impact on science by increasing the \r\nopportunities for undergraduates, primarily women, to conduct scientific research at \r\nBryn Mawr and at the University of Virginia. Also, experiments conducted in the \r\nresearch laboratory are subsequently incorporated into laboratory exercises for \r\nadvanced neurobiology courses at both institutions. Finally, training is provided to \r\ngraduate students in modern electrophysiological recording techniques, data \r\nacquisition, and analysis. Results from these experiments are widely disseminated \r\nthrough posters at scientific meetings, including student presentations at local science \r\nfairs and scientific meetings; publication in scientific journals; lectures open to the \r\npublic; and demonstrations on animal behavior at K-12 schools.",
