 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the following problems will be studied. \r\n(A) Does M(g), the moduli space of nonsingular curves of genus g, \r\ncontain complete subvarieties of dimension g-2? Does its \r\nDeligne-Mumford compactification contain large complete subvarieties \r\nnot intersecting certain boundary components? \r\n(B) The question which part of the cohomology comes from the so-called \r\ntautological classes and the problem of understanding the relations \r\nbetween these classes. \r\n(C) The problem of understanding the entire cohomology of moduli \r\nspaces of curves motivically (for low genus). \r\n(D) The problem of obtaining a qualitative understanding of the \r\nrepresentations of the symmetric group appearing in the cohomology of \r\nmoduli spaces of pointed curves (the points are ordered, which yields \r\na natural action of the symmetric group).\r\n  \tThe moduli space of curves plays a fundamental role in many \r\nareas of mathematics and in theoretical physics (string theory). \r\nResults obtained by studying the problems above will deepen our \r\nunderstanding of the moduli space itself, of families of curves, and \r\nultimately of the fibrations in curves of arbitrary spaces.\r\n\r\n One usually begins by studying curves that are well-behaved (i.e., projective, \r\nnonsingular, connected) and that are given by equations whose \r\ncoefficients are complex numbers (or elements of another algebraically \r\nclosed field). The fundamental invariant of such a curve is its \r\nso-called genus, a nonnegative integer. If one draws a real picture of \r\na complex curve, one sees a (compact and connected) surface; its genus \r\nis the number of `holes'. Often it is important to distinguish non-isomorphic curves of \r\nthe same genus and to describe the isomorphism classes of curves of a \r\ngiven genus g. The moduli space M(g) of curves of genus g is a space \r\nwhose points correspond to these isomorphism classes and it has the \r\nproperty that a family of curves of genus g over a base comes with a \r\nnatural map from the base to M(g). The moduli space of curves makes \r\nits appearance in many branches of mathematics and also in theoretical \r\nphysics. It is studied intensively and for good reasons. E.g., results \r\nabout M(g) tell us something about families of curves, thus ultimately \r\nabout arbitrary solution spaces in algebraic geometry.\r\n  \t",
