Stephan, Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, Georgia\r\nState University\r\n\r\nThis proposal would organize two one-day workshops for users and potential users of SRS restricted data in the spring of 2007 and 2008.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the workshop are threefold: (1) Exchange information among users\r\nconcerning creative uses of the data and research outcomes; (2) Broaden the base of users by familiarizing\r\npotential users with the data that is available and ways in which the data is currently being used as well as\r\nthe potential for other kinds of use; (3) Provide feedback to SRS regarding the data and ways to enhance\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThe genesis for the proposed workshops is the workshop that Stephan has organized for October 20, 2006.\r\nThis workshop, which had funds for 22 participants, attracted 53 applicants. The result is that a large\r\nnumber of current users and potential users will not be able to participate in the workshop. Moreover,\r\nincreasing the number of users is of special policy concern given new initiatives and opportunities created\r\nboth in response to John Marburger's article concerning the \"Science of Science Policy\" in Science and the\r\ndevelopment, by SRS, of a formal policy for linking the SRS micro data to other databases.",
