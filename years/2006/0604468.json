 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Center for Advancing Science & Engineering Capacity proposes to develop and execute a 3-year evaluation of the Alliance component of the NSF Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) program. The Capacity Center seeks to (1) reduce underrepresentation of women of all racial or ethnic groups and those from traditionally underserved groups (African American, Latino, and American Indian, and persons with disabilities) in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and (2) promote structural changes that grow the capacity of institutions to aid the successful entry of all graduates into postgraduate study and the technical workforce. This proposed evaluation - to be done in collaboration with the evaluation teams from each Alliance - will illuminate the wisdom of practice on \"what works\" and \"what doesn't work\" and make these lessons accessible to practitioners for their own local adaptation as alliances that sustain broadening participation in computing. It hopes to address questions such as How is BPC affecting the capacity of the community to broaden participation from education to workplace? What practices seem promising for whom and in what settings? How are relationships among partners maturing, being leveraged, and expanding the sphere of influence within the national computing community?",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn 2006-07, NSF awarded 12 Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) Alliances.  The merit of these multi-institutional projects were the innovative strategies proposed to reduce the historical underrepresentation of students&mdash;especially minorities, girls and women, first-generation college attendees&mdash;in computer science education and computing degrees.  The AAAS project was designed to assist Alliance evaluators in capturing the activities conducted to increase student, organizational, and computing community participation in the educational progression from awareness to enrollment to degrees to workforce entry in computing.  The focus was to measure and document the contributions of the individual BPC Alliances to the NSF Program goals while fulfilling NSF\u00c6s need to observe and quantify, where possible, Program outcomes.\n\nToday the 8 BPC-A projects comprise a community of evaluators who have met semi-annually to annually.  Collectively, as reflected in the final (Feb. 5, 2014) Evaluators\u00c6 Meeting hosted by NSF\u00c6s BPC-A evaluation contractor and coordinated through AAAS, they: (1) developed a protocol for reporting Alliance outcomes, called Common Core Indicators, which has been adapted to the Research Performance Progress Report system; (2) planned a case study capstone, including PI interviews and multiple (student, faculty, organizational) surveys, that links retrospective qualitative and quantitative analysis to prospective activities; and (3) formulated a framework for depicting BPC-A as a national infrastructure, resource, and spreading network.\n\nThe value of BPC-A is its impacts on the diverse populations served, the ability to formulate agendas for future action that are replicable with other populations and in different institutional settings, and its efficacy as a bulwark against the status quo and bad policy that discourages aspiration and persistence in computing.  Moving from descriptive, contextually-based evidence to quantitative measurement of participation outcomes, the AAAS project has evaluated changes in practice designed to attract, educate, and retain students at all stages on the pathway to educational attainment. \n\nSpecifically, the project has:\n\nexplained the evolution of student engagement and confidence, notably that of undergraduates, in their computing knowledge and skills, and how this feeds persistence in the major;\ncodified what has been learned in a (web-accessible and printed) 2010 brochure and a 2011 article in the computing literature;\nillustrated how institutional culture, while context-specific, constrains faculty, coursework, and pedagogy;\nshown how the multiple expertise that Alliances encompass eases the transition from school to work; and\nattested to how a community of evaluators provides continuity and understanding to multiyear interventions that don\u00c6t yield information immediately or reward PIs for such high-risk behavior.\n\n\nOverall, the project has illuminated NSF\u00c6s success, through a single program, in changing the face of computing.  It is a model of collaboration between the sponsor and awardees, as well as among PIs, evaluators, and partners recruited to support the computing community.  It has demonstrated the logic of introducing, monitoring, and sustaining systemic change in one STEM discipline.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/26/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yolanda Comedy"
