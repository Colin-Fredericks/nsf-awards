 "awd_abstract_narration": "The plant pathogenic bacterium Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii (P. stewartii) produces an exopolysaccharide (EPS) virulence factor that plays a major role in the cause of Stewart's wilt disease in maize. The EPS biosynthetic functions are encoded by the cps gene system, which is expressed in a cell density-dependent manner governed by quorum sensing regulation. Embedded within this biosynthetic locus are two genes, wceF and wceJ, whose enzyme products have a role in the measured degradation of the secreted glycopolymer. The preliminary data for this project support the hypothesis that WceF is an EPS hydrolase, and WceJ an EPS modifying enzyme, which transforms the EPS polymer into a substrate suitable for WceF-specific EPS depolymerization. Thus, the specific objectives for this project are to experimentally define and verify the enzymatic and apparent cooperative roles of WceF and WceJ as EPS degradative functions and to chemically characterize the EPS degradative products.  Additionally and importantly, this project seeks to determine the biological significance of coordinate stewartan EPS synthesis and depolymerization. The preliminary data indicate that these functions play a major role in the Stewart's wilt infection process. The project focuses on a newly recognized bacterial EPS metabolic dynamic that plays a major role in pathogenesis. This novel understanding may reveal new opportunities for disease control. In addition, this project provides excellent training opportunities postdoctoral fellows and students at all levels.",

This level of protection is significant considering that P. stewartii overwinters in the gut of an insect vector where the bacteria are exposed to a variety of bacteriophages.
