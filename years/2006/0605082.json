 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held spring and fall  since its founding in 1989, a total of 35 times.  The conference has  become an extremely successful semiannual event in the Southwest. The  next series of conferences will have six primary sponsoring  universities: The University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University,  Rice University, the University of Houston, Texas Tech University, and  Texas Christian University.  The conference is designed to enhance both  the educational and the research atmosphere of the active community of  geometers and topologists in Texas and the surrounding states.  The  conference is committed to bring researchers of national and  international stature to discuss their research and to interact with  mathematicians from Texas and surrounding states.  Summaries of talks  with notation of important results have been publicly reported for some  time and will continue similarly in the future.\r\n\r\nBy design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two  high-impact foci.  First, the conference makes it possible for the  community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states  (a huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular  basis. This both stimulates individual research and generates productive  cooperative efforts between schools.  Second, the conference is  committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base.  In order that there be no barrier to participation, the  conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there are no  registration fees.  Graduate students, junior faculty, women,  minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support. More information can be found on the conference website:\r\nhttp://www.math.tamu.edu/%7Etgtc/archive/",
