Lee, a mathematician at SUNY College at Old Westbury, has established a number of local and regional programs at his institution for mentoring students, teachers, and faculty in mathematics.  He has also shown significant commitment to mentoring individuals personally.  He has a strong focus on K-12 math teachers, which should have significant impact on the teaching and learning of mathematics in pre-college classrooms in New York. The array of programs reflects a variety of mentoring methods that have enhanced the academic experiences of minority (and majority) students on Long Island and in New York City - literally hundreds of students and teachers. \r\n",
