 "awd_abstract_narration": "The five southern California campuses of the University of California (UC) system propose an ongoing\r\nseries of workshops and seminars targeting senior academic administrators. The Partnership campuses\r\nare: Irvine (UCI), Los Angeles (UCLA), Riverside (UCR), San Diego (UCSD), and Santa Barbara (UCSB). The proposed workshops and seminars allow dissemination of lessons learned and best practices that have enabled UCI to dramatically increase hiring of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields during the ADVANCE award (September 2001-present). While excellent progress has been made in recruiting women to UCI, the Partnership will focus on strategies to retain and advance women and minority faculty. The workshops promote understanding, facilitate training, and encourage implementation of the novel programs developed at the Irvine campus and by other ADVANCE initiatives. \r\n\r\nExperts on institutional transformation and faculty diversity agree that the top administration must provide accountability for diversity for deans and department chairs to implement effective strategies for recruiting, retaining, and advancing a diverse professoriate. In order for changes to \"filter down\" to the departmental level,  higher administrators need to develop strategies for holding deans accountable for their units so that the deans will then develop strategies for holding departments accountable. Chairs are the key link between upper level administrators and the faculty. Department chairs' key role in implementing new policies, like the UC family friendly policies, coupled with the challenge of constantly shifting chairs who may not have gained the interpersonal relations and bureaucratic skills essential for equitable implementation, implies a pressing need for chairs' training.  Department chairs, as \"climate regulators\", serve an essential function in ensuring that faculty members who make use of such policies do not experience retaliation by their departmental colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe University of California is the largest public university in the United States with over 200,000 students\r\non ten campuses employing more than 8,000 ladder-rank faculty members. The system's student\r\npopulation is quite diverse, yet the faculty population remains predominantly white and male. In recent\r\nyears, many campuses have increased the rate of hiring women and minority faculty members, yet\r\nretention of these promising scholars through the rigorous review process will require that administrators\r\nare capable of implementing new policies (e.g., family friendly policies) while at the same time ensuring a\r\nwork environment that welcomes faculty from diverse backgrounds. The Implementation Team involves\r\nscholars and professionals who are diverse in terms of discipline, ethnicity, and gender. The diversity of\r\nthis team will be key in implementing a program that appeals to administrators from broad backgrounds\r\nand weaves sensitivity to gender and ethnic issues throughout the planned programming.   The expectation is that the programs for provosts, deans and chairs become a model for other institutions that care about faculty equity and diversity.\r\n",
