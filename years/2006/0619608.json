 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for the acquisition of a Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS) for research in aquatic biogeochemistry at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  The proposed instrumentation is intended to support novel research directions in organic geochemistry and marine geochemistry, including ultrahigh resolution and high mass accuracy over a broad molecular weight range, versatile ionization modes including electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), and other options for the structural elucidation of large molecules.  Applications are expected to include a broad array of projects in the general area of molecular level elucidation of the biotic and abiotic processes that govern the cycling, transformation and preservation of marine organic matter.  It will be managed as a cost center at WHOI, open to faculty, postdoctoral associates and students with technical support and/or training provided, depending on user qualifications and needs.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe planned educational initiatives specifically target research by graduate students, who will have extensive access to the facility for methods analysis and research applications, undergraduates who will have access through summer institute courses and use, and minority students for whom annual fellowships will be provided to apply FT-ICR mass spectrometry to research projects. The facility itself will be an important new capability for marine researchers, accessible to both WHOI and outside users.\r\n",
