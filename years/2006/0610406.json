 "awd_abstract_narration": "FETCH, produced by WGBH, is a new PBS television series with accompanying Web and outreach activities targeted to 6- to 10-year olds.  The program brings science learning to young children by uniquely blending live-action with animation, game show convention with reality programming, and humor with academics.  The intended impacts are to 1) cultivate in children \"scientific literacy\" -- an appreciation for and enjoyment of science, the skills necessary to become independent investigators and a broad understanding of scientific concepts; 2) provide project collaborators with content-rich activities for informal science education in a range of settings; and 3) demonstrate how media can be used to teach substantive science.  The requested funds will allow the project to expand the science curriculum with 20 new half-hour episodes and expand the Web site, focusing on three new science themes:  human body, force and motion, and earth and the environment.  In addition, funds will support new educational resources for afterschool partners and a toolkit for FETCH exhibits, which will be developed in coordination with museum partners.  Goodman Research Group will conduct summative evaluation of both the television show and the museum toolkit.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
