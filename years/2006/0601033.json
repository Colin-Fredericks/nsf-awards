 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to study some classic problems in \r\ncombinatorial and analytic number theory. More precisely, Yu will study \r\n(1) bounds for finite sets of integers satisfying some binary additive \r\nproperties, and (2) rank 0 quadratic twists of elliptic curves over the \r\nrationals. The objects in study (1) are the generalized Sidon sets and \r\nadditive 2-basis of integers. A new idea is introduced which captures the \r\nconcentration of the sumset and the difference set. Along with the classic \r\nmethods of discrete Fourier analysis, this new idea results in an \r\nimprovement for currently the best upper bounds for the cardinalities of  \r\ngeneralized Sidon sets. This new approach will also be employed to improve \r\nthe lower bound for the 2-basis of integers. In study (2), Yu will show \r\nthat, for any elliptic curve which posses a 2-isogeny over the rationals, \r\na positive proportion of its quadratic twists have rank 0; and, for a pair \r\nof elliptic curves over the rationals, there are infinitely many \r\nsquarefree integers D such that the quadratic twists of the two curves by \r\nthe same D simultaneously have rank 0. To achieve these, techniques such \r\nas the first descent, sieve methods and estimation of character sums will \r\nbe applied. Besides, Yu will try to use the similar methods to prove \r\nboundedness of the average rank of the quadratic twists of every elliptic \r\ncurve over the rationals. \r\n\r\nThe problem of bounding a (generalized) Sidon set has attracted a lot of \r\nattentions. While an upper bound for a generalized Sidon set has natural \r\nimplication in the study of Fourier series from Sidon's work back in \r\n1930's, it is also closely related to some other problems in harmonic \r\nanalysis and continuous Ramsey theory. In the first part of this project, \r\nYu studies the upper bounds for generalized Sidon sets, and use the new idea \r\ninvolved to study some related problems. In the other part of the project, \r\nYu is devoted to studying some arithmetic of elliptic curves. Yu will \r\npartially solve a longstanding problem related to the rank of elliptic \r\ncurves, and will also study some related problems. \r\n",
