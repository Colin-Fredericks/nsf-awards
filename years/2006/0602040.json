Benson.  The Center for Advanced Engineering Fibers and Films (CAEFF), an NSF Engineering Research Center with core partners Clemson University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Clark Atlanta University, will be the site for this multidisciplinary RET program for secondary science and mathematics teachers.  EFF-X will draw on expertise located in the CAEFF in engineering, materials science, mathematics, textiles, and chemistry to provide a comprehensive experience in polymer fiber and film research for up to ten teachers per year from high schools in both urban and rural school districts with high populations of minority students in South Carolina and metro Atlanta.  The teachers will become familiar with the research process, learn about polymer science and technology, and be engaged in the transfer of knowledge from the laboratory to the classroom.  \r\n\r\nCo-funding for this project is being provided by the NSF EPSCoR Program and the NSF Engineering Research Centers (ERC) Program.",
