 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator (PI) plans to organize an International Symposium on Recent Observations and Simulations of the Sun-Earth System (ISROSES) to be held in Varna, Bulgaria, from 18 to 22 September 2006. This award provides support for students and young scientists to attend the Symposium. ISROSES will include invited, contributed, and poster presentations. The invited presentations will cover solar, magnetospheric, and ionospheric physics in order to accomplish the cross-disciplinary objectives of the conference. The focused discussions will include, but are not limited to, the following topics: \r\n\r\n(1) solar cycle variations in the Sun-Earth system; \r\n(2) solar dynamics and the response of geospace; \r\n(3) production, transport, and loss of energetic particles; and \r\n(4) Sun-Earth system modeling and prediction. \r\n\r\nThe Principal Conveners, Dr. Vania Jordanova at New Hampshire and Dr. Ilia Roussev at Michigan, will be aided by a Scientific Organizing Committee (SOC) consisting of thirteen well-known international scientists who will organize and lead the four days of individual sessions. A Local Organizing Committee (LOC) consisting of eight distinguished Bulgarian scientists will plan the on-site coordination of the technical aspects of the Conference. The Conveners, jointly with the SOC, will prepare a report on the meeting for publication in the AGU Space Weather Journal. Papers of exceptionally high quality presented at the ISROSES will be published in a special issue of the JASTP. \r\n\r\nISROSES is relevant to the goals of the NSF's National Space Weather Program (NSWP) and NASA's Living With a Star (LWS) program. In this regard, the third International LWS (ILWS) General Meeting on April 24, 2005 in Vienna, Austria, approved ISROSES as an official ILWS Workshop. ISROSES topics also will address the objectives of the NSF's Solar, Heliospheric, and INterplanetary Environment (SHINE), Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), and Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) programs. In Finally, ISROSES is relevant to the goals of the NSF's Office of Polar Programs (OPP), given that the scope of the conference will include the coupling of the thermosphere with the ionosphere, and ultimately with the magnetosphere, over the polar regions of the Earth.",
