 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the ever expanding cyber community public-key cryptography is\r\ndeployed at various platforms and gateways to ensure authenticity,\r\nconfidentiality, and integrity in all kinds of communication and\r\ntransaction. Therefore the security of public-key cryptography is\r\nfoundational to the security of the cyberspace. Elliptic curve\r\ncryptography has risen in recent years to meet the challenge of\r\nconstraints in bandwidth, power, and size in wireless and mobile\r\ncommunication, and is likely to become the mainstay for public-key\r\ncryptography in the wireless arena. This research focuses on\r\ncritical issues concerning the foundational security of elliptic\r\ncurve cryptography.  A unified approach using the theory of global\r\nduality is developed to study the discrete logarithm problem upon\r\nwhich elliptic curve cryptosystems are based. This research seeks to\r\nidentify and classify weak cases of elliptic curve groups beyond\r\nwhat is currently known. The findings of this research will deepen\r\nunderstanding of the security of the elliptic curve cryptosystems in\r\ngeneral, and relative cryptographic strength of specific classes of\r\nelliptic curves in particular. The techniques and methodology\r\ndeveloped in the proposed research will provide the basis for future\r\nresearch on similar issues in curve-based cryptography.   A\r\nlong-term goal of this research is to explore the prospect of using\r\nalgebraic groups for building future generations of public-key\r\ncryptosystems. Elliptic Curve Cryptography is also an excellent\r\nsubject to integrate research and education in mathematics and\r\nengineering. Part of this project is to introduce students at all\r\nlevels and across disciplinary boundaries to research in this area\r\nthrough well-designed courses, seminars and workshops.\r\n",
