 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the Meeting of Young Researchers in Earth Sciences (MYRES) that focus on the topic: Dynamics of the Lithosphere. MYRES has the mission of gathering junior scientists from all over the world, representing many branches of geosciences in a single venue for four days to exchange formally and informally ideas, data, methods, and formulate long term projects and collaborations. The meetings are held alternatively in Europe and in the USA to facilitate international participation.  This meeting will be held in Italy and it will be co-sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the European Science Foundation. While dedicated to young scientists, the meeting is open to all scientists that can benefit from the education and collaboration-oriented focus of the subject area.  The meeting agenda will include an introduction to the chemical and physical structure of the lithosphere and its evolution; a review of deformation mechanisms processes in the interior of the Earth; earthquake generation and geodetic signals; and finally, a discussion of long-term geodynamics. Overview talks are complemented by breakout discussion sessions, hand-on training sessions, and poster sessions aimed at maximizing open interaction in a smaller group. Studies of the lithosphere are by essence interdisciplinary and this meeting will be held to improve this cross-disciplinary interactions.  \r\n\r\nThe MYRES format was designed to maximize learning and training of junior scientists by offering review talks, hands-on tutorials, and focused discussion groups. The attendees and speakers draw from various scientific specialties, countries, ethnic groups, and both genders, reflecting the diversity of our community.  MYRES also maintains a permanent Internet presence that is being built to provide a new resource for state-of-the-art, unbiased information on earth sciences. The website will be universally accessible, broadening the beneficiaries of this project to every scientist and non-scientist. The open approach is designed to increase the public awareness and understanding of the scientific process in Earth Sciences. \r\n",
