 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will address the need for reliable, low cost wireless components and ultra high speed InP integrated circuits. Under this program a novel hetero-junction bipolar transistor will be designed and fabricated that will enable high-yield, low cost InP integrated circuit production for wireless communications. Cost will be reduced by developing new processing techniques for InP-based hetero-junction bipolar transistors that utilize conventional lithographic technology while producing submicron device dimensions. Smaller device dimensions will also produce more efficient circuits, allowing for longer battery life in mobile electronics applications. These techniques will improve device yield and reliability and increase manufacturing throughput. \r\n\r\nHigher yields, larger scale of integration, improved reliability and lower cost are needed in InP integrated circuit production to allow it to compete effectively with SiGe. Production of complex (> 50,000 transistors) integrated circuits utilizing InP hetero-junction bipolar transistors will become a practical reality. By using previous generation lithographic techniques for processing of heterojunction bipolar transistors integrated circuits, development time and costs will be reduced, allowing products to reach the market faster.\r\n",
