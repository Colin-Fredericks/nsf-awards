 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Standalone WIreless Magnetometer System (SWIMS) will meet critical needs in ionosphere-magnetosphere (M-I) research by providing the technology required to create the next generation of networks consisting of more than 100 ground magnetometer stations. Geomagnetically active times are both the most important and most challenging to study and at present we do not have the infrastructure needed follow the M-I system's electrodynamics during magnetic storms. This leaves a fundamental gap in our understanding. New observational capabilities are needed that can follow ionospheric electrodynamics through highly active periods with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to resolve both the global and smaller scale features of the dynamics. The SWIMS project will develop a new, low cost, high performance magnetometer and stand-alone observatory technology that can be deployed with minimum logistical support and maintenance. A SWIMS installation would consist of up to three solar/battery powered Sensor Modules (SM) that are linked via wireless, radio frequency (RF) connection to a Central Node (CN). The CN can also be solar/battery powered and provides communication to a central data facility. The CN communicates status information and science data via land line where available or via cell phone/satellite link when necessary. \r\n\r\nThere are two technical problems that need to be solved. First, an observatory architecture is needed that is easy to install and maintain. Second, a system is needed that can tolerate and discriminate against transient local magnetic contamination. SWIMS addresses these challenges as follows. New magnetometer: SWIMS uses new Mirror Image Differential Induction Amplitude Magnetometer (MIDIAM) technology with demonstrated performance that meets the needs of ground observations of ionospheric electrodynamics. The MIDIAM sensor and electronics are readily adaptable to low power applications and production in quantity while maintaining performance comparable to existing science-grade magnetometers required for the ground magnetometer science. Wireless: SWIMS solves sensor cabling and logistical (power) constraints by using a wireless system that is self-contained, using a solar/battery power system and a low power RF link in a single stand-alone SM.  The technology will allow wireless installation over distances up to 300 yards between SMs and the CN which also communicates via wireless links to the central data facility. This completely standalone system is essential to reduce deployment and operations costs for future networks consisting of hundreds of sites. Multiple sensors: Because the MIDIAM is low cost and because each SM is wireless, SWIMS can use more than one SM at a single site to mitigate noise issues. Analysis of signals from multiple sensors allows for the removal of local noise sources, such as vehicles. \r\n\r\nUnder this project a prototype SWIMS system of three sensor modules communicating via local RF link to a CN will be developed and tested. \r\n",
