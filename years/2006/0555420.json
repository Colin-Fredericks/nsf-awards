 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nano-mechanics of Carbon Nanotube-Polymer Interfaces\r\nM. A. Haque, the Pennsylvania State University\r\n \r\nAbstract: The objectives of this research are to experimentally study and model deformation and failure of nanoscale interfaces using nanowires and nanotubes as reinforcing agents. To meet these objectives, nanoscale 'pull-out' specimens and high resolution micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) force and displacement sensors will be fabricated. Single nanowire or nanotube pull-out experiments will be performed in-situ inside the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) at up to 100,000x magnification while interfacial forces and displacements are measured. The simultaneously qualitative and quantitative information on the nanoscale interfaces will be used to model the load bearing, deformation and failure mechanics after exploring the effects of surface functionalization and accounting for adhesion and friction, which are known to be dominant at the nanoscale. \r\n \r\nThe advances in the fundamental understanding in the mechanics of nanoscale interfaces will help develop nano-composites with novel properties. The project will impact the society by integrating emerging and multi-disciplinary knowledge with education at all levels while promoting diversity. Graduate students involved with the project will be trained in cross-cutting areas of mechanics, microscopy, MEMS and nano-technology. Undergraduate and minority group students will be involved with the research through an ongoing collaboration with the Penn State Multicultural Engineering Program. The project has a strong outreach component, 'Microscopy for K-12' where local elementary, middle and high school students will remote operate a scanning electron microscope in the class rooms to observe micro/nanoscale specimens. A website will be developed with these instructional materials and the remote electron microscopy sessions.\r\n",
