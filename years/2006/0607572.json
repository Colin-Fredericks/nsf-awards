 "awd_abstract_narration": "AWARD NO: AST-0607572\r\nPI: Peter Sturrock\r\nINSTITUTION: Stanford University\r\nTITLE: Variability of the Solar Neutrino Flux\r\nOver the last decade, analysis of solar neutrino data has produced increasingly strong\r\nevidence for variability. A case is put forth that the recent statistical reexamination of the\r\nGallium Experiment/Gallium Neutrino Observatory and Super-Kamiokande data by PI\r\nSturrock and collaborators now provides a convincing demonstration that the solar\r\nneutrino flux is not constant - rather, it varies with patterns that provide insight into the\r\nunderlying nature of neutrinos and processes in the deep solar interior. The goal of this\r\nwork is to provide critical observational inputs through statistical analyses of neutrino\r\nobservations for use by the theory community, including two collaborators currently\r\ndeveloping a model in which electron neutrinos couple to a sterile neutrino through a\r\ntransition magnetic moment (thereby tying the observed flux to time-dependent magnetic\r\nphenomena, e.g., rotation). Included in this effort is a power-spectrum (for non-normal\r\nestimates) and time-frequency analyses. A second goal is to examine the relationship\r\nbetween measurements of the flux and other solar variables including measurements\r\nmade by the Michelson Doppler Imager helioseismology experiment on the Solar and\r\nHeliospheric Observatory spacecraft, since this experiment probes the deep solar interior,\r\nwhere neutrino flux modulation is believed to occur.\r\nThe results of this work and its implications will be shared with the public through\r\noutreach efforts to local groups and to the Science Explorers Club.\" The PI Sturrock will\r\nalso develop the concepts of scientific interference\" (an approach to determining the\r\nnature\" of science) both to organize arguments/evidence for and against solar neutrino\r\nvariability and to explain the principle at the college science teacher level in an\r\nappropriate journal article.",
