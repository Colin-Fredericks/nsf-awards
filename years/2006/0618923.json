Rossman, Lafayette College\r\n\r\n\r\nMRI:  Acquisition of PIV System for Study of Biological Flows  \r\n\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation grant is to acquire a Particle Image Velocimetry system to perform experiments which complement the PI's ongoing numerical analyses of the flow in blood vessels affected by aneurysm and atherosclerosis.  The PIV system consists of one Nd:YAG pulsed laser and two sensitive CCD cameras to resolve flow within complex geometries, as well as self-calibrated image correlation software.  The acquisition of the proposed equipment will have a significant impact on research at Lafayette College, enabling detailed examination of transitional flows in complex geometries: hemodynamics in diseased vessels.  Data obtained using the PIV system will supplement ongoing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies with detailed velocity data so that fluid mechanical forces may be calculated. The system will also be useful to an interdisciplinary study of fish swimming. In a collaborative effort involving the mathematics, computer science, and mechanical engineering departments, computational studies of sunfish locomotion are underway. The proposed equipment will allow researchers to obtain detailed experimental data to validate their numerical analyses. This equipment will significantly expand Lafayette College students' exposure to experimental techniques and instrumentation, and thus will contribute to the exceptional research training of Lafayette College undergraduates. Exposure to, and experience with, state-of-the-art imaging and measurement techniques will be of enormous benefit to the education and research training of Lafayette students, many of whom proceed to graduate school. The PI has a strong history of involving undergraduates of diverse backgrounds in meaningful research. Up to seven courses, enrolling approximately 130 students per year, in the civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering departments at Lafayette will make use of the proposed equipment. This system will be the only equipment of its kind at an undergraduate institution in the Lehigh Valley region. The proposed equipment will dramatically augment the capabilities of existing facilities, and will allow the above research goals to be achieved. It will also further the PI's and Lafayette College's goal of providing substantial and meaningful research opportunities for undergraduate students.\r\n",
