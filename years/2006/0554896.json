 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI investigates independence results in the study of countable\r\nconvergence questions in the class of compact spaces. Some of the\r\nquestions remain unresolved even in the presence of the Proper Forcing\r\nAxiom. The sequential order of a space is a natural ordinal invariant\r\nthat measures the complexity of a sequential space; the question of\r\nwhether there can be a finite or countable bound on this invariant for\r\ncompact spaces has only been resolved under CH. We will also study\r\ncontinuous maps on the remainder of the Stone-Cech compactification of\r\nthe integers which are finite-to-one. We will try to determine if such\r\nmaps have to be \"somewhere trivial\" and whether the range space will be\r\nhomeomorphic to the domain. This question has been fully resolved under\r\nPFA but not, for example, under MA. Two other questions about the\r\nremainder of N under PFA: can it be covered by nowhere dense P-sets and\r\ncan there be non-trivial copies of the remainder?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen one formalizes the limiting process of an infinite sequence of\r\nsteps one is naturally lead to the notion of topological space. Points\r\nin physical space can be analyzed using the notion of a converging\r\nsequence, but just as mathematics has a need for a much broader\r\nunderstanding of points (e.g. functions or processes themselves lying in\r\na space of like processes), so too has the need for a broader\r\nunderstanding of limit and topological space been developed to handle\r\nconvergence in the more general settings. The investigation into the\r\nnature of generalized convergence, connections between conditions that\r\nmay imply the existence of (the much easier to understand and apply)\r\nclassical convergent sequences,  and the behavior of the convergence\r\nstructure under deformations  is on-going and productive. These notions\r\nare very sensitive to the foundational axioms of mathematics and the\r\nquestions serve as both a testbed for foundational study and a generator\r\nof new development. One of the most famously indeterminate questions of\r\nmathematics, the continuum hypothesis (the \"size\" of the real number\r\nline) is intimately connected to these questions of convergence. \r\n",
