 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research utilizes a recently identified Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) interface on wide band gap materials, Column III-Nitride, (III-N) to address the scientific challenge of achieving Field Effect Transistors (FETs) suitable for gigascale integration (gigascale > 1billion transistors) while simultaneously providing nearly terahertz (THz = 1000 billion cycles/second)  cut off frequency performance.  These goals will be achieved by fully developing a demonstrated oxide that provides the two dimensional gas for controlled charge transport.  The performance goals will be achieved by the continued enhancement of a selective source-drain re-growth process with band gap and work function engineering techniques to this promising material system.  \r\nIntellectual merit:This will be the first demonstration of an enhancement mode MOSFET constructed out of III-N materials with turn on and supply voltages less than 0.5V.  This work will demonstrate capabilities of this new transistor to provide the basis for gigascale nano-electronics and millimeter-wave to THz circuitry:  critical technology to maintain US leadership in integrated circuit and sensor technology.  \r\nBroader impact of this research will be to utilize and further strengthen the lines of established communication with small and large companies that will guide the application of this work and identify areas for product insertion and development.  Elements of this research will be condensed in educational modules to be distributed via the 4-H, program which is effective at reaching rural and underrepresented groups cost effectively.  Based on feedback from experienced high-school and middle-school educators, these modules will be designed to provide a valuable recruitment and education tool for the next generation of scientists and engineers.  \r\n",
