 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2006 IEEE INFOCOM Conference on Computer Communications will be held in \r\nBarcelona, Spain from April 23 to April 29, 2006. This preeminent technical conference is the primary venue for presenting new research results in the area of computer communications, and is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field. \r\nAttending conferences such as INFOCOM is of paramount importance for the development of graduate students. Participants have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of others performing leading-edge research in the field. \r\n\r\nThis proposal requests funding to support approximately fifteen graduate students in theUnited States to attend this premiere conference. The travel awards will target graduate students, in particular, women and under-represented minority students, since attending conferences is an important part of their educational experience, and they often have limited travel funds.\r\n",
