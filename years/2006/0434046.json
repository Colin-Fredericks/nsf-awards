 "awd_abstract_narration": "0434046  Parker  The Water Science and Technology Board (WSTB) of the National Research Council (NRC) is the focal point for studies related to all aspects of water resources under the aegis of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. The WSTB's objective is to improve the scientific and technological basis for resolving important national questions and issues associated with the efficient management and use of ground and surface water resources. In carrying out its responsibilities and in serving the national interest, the Board responds to requests for evaluations and advice through ad hoc studies concerning specific and generic issues in water resources. \r\n\r\nIn this context, this project is an effort by the WSTB to provide advice to the scientific community, water managers, and water policy/decision makers regarding the use of underground aquifers to store water temporarily for later beneficial uses. The WSTB formed a committee to develop a consensus report on key scientific issues related to the use of underground storage of water. Specifically, the report will (1) provide an overview of the research and education needs and priorities concerning sustainable underground storage technology and implementation and (2) assess the geological, geochemical, biological, engineering, and institutional factors that may contribute to good or poor performance of such projects.\r\n",
