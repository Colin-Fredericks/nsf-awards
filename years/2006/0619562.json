 "awd_abstract_narration": "Millersville University is acquiring a remote sensing instrumentation suite that includes a portable single-wavelength micro-pulse lidar (MPL), sun-tracking photometer, and flat-array acoustic wind profiler (sodar) with a radio acoustic sounding system extension, plus four ambient aerosol particle size profilers. These instruments contribute a remote sensing capability that, in combination with balloon measurements, constitutes a comprehensive research facility for studies of the lower troposphere. This facility will support field studies of aerosol, boundary layer, and atmospheric chemistry research while involving undergraduates, and will continue to serve undergraduate research training at a fixed site when not commissioned for field research. Millersville University has a long history of including undergraduates in research as part of their educational experience; about 60 undergraduate students have been directly involved in field research since 1995. Students gain experience in all aspects of field research, and many pursue graduate studies because of the experience and training received through their research as undergraduates. The new instruments add significant capability to the existing facility, open a plethora of new research opportunities and provide students with meritorious research training, while better positioning the facility and Millersville University for participation in multi-institutional collaborative research ventures.",
