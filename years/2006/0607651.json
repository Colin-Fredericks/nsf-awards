 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research to be conducted centers on the properties of magnetars - a subclass of\r\nneutron stars with magnetic fields of strength in excess of the critical quantum\r\nelectrodynamic threshold. Here, a series of projects will be carried out aimed at helping\r\nanswer several questions of current scientific interest. Included are: (1) What is the\r\nemission mechanism of magnetars in quiescence? (2) What controls the spectrum of soft\r\ngamma ray repeater (a type of magnetar) flares? (3) How is the energy of activity of\r\nmagnetars tapped in their magnetospheres? And (4) physically, how and why are\r\nmagnetars different from conventional pulsars? Three general avenues of research will be\r\nundertaken, each with associate subprojects. The first is an investigation of resonant\r\nscattering in shaping the spectrum of anomalous x-ray pulsar spectra by refining\r\ncalculations of resonant Compton scattering in ultra strong magnetic fields and the\r\nupscattering of thermal surface photons by magnetospheric electrons. In the second, the\r\nroles of resonant Compton scattering and photon splitting in the burst spectra of soft\r\ngamma-ray repeaters will be explored. This includes developing dispersion and selection\r\nrules for photon splitting in ultra strong magnetic fields. Finally, a generalized formalism\r\nfor stochastic, diffusive, gyroresonant acceleration of particles due to magnetic\r\nturbulence superposed upon the global magnetar field structure will be developed. A\r\nmajor emphasis will be determining the shape of the non-thermal distribution and how\r\nthe maximum energy of acceleration couples to environmental parameters, which will in\r\nturn lead to useful observational diagnostics on the emission region.\r\nA graduate student will be employed and trained and will be an integral part of the work.\r\nThis student will also be exposed to undergraduate pedagogy by teaching at least two\r\nlectures per year on neutron stars. Undergraduates are expected to contribute as well\r\nthrough small, well defined tasks. Results of this work will be presented to the public\r\nthrough outreach activities at local high schools and through the Houston Astronomical\r\nSociety.",
