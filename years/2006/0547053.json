To this end, a core fibrous scaffold of poly(l-lactide) (PLL) will be coated with poly(1,8 octanediol-co-citrate) (POC) to yield enhanced elastomeric and cell compatibility characteristics.  By connecting the osteoconductive POC-hydroxyapatite composite matrix at both ends of the aforementioned elastomeric and fibroconductive scaffold, the investigator expects that this strategy will facilitate osteointegration of the bioengineered ligament graft.  In addition to the fabrication experiments, studies will be carried out to determine the mechanical properties and degradation of the elastomeric composite scaffolds (ECS).  Additionally, the in vivo biocompatibility and osteointegration of the ECS will be evaluated in a rabbit anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction model followed by mechanical and histological characterization of ECS integration in bone.  Also, the investigator will assess the ability of ECS to support adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of diverse cell types, as well as the modulation of cell function by the application of uniaxial cyclic strain.  encourage its advancement by training and educating scientists through cutting-edge, integrated research and educational plans.\r\n",
