Yet, contrary to\r\nexpectations, surveys for supernovae among such galaxies have established rates which\r\nare comparable to supernovae rates observed in more normal and/or isolated galaxies.\r\nHowever, the bulk of these surveys are also conducted at visible wavelengths where\r\nobscuration by dust associated with star formation and competition from nuclear flux\r\nmay result in observers \"missing\" supernovae. Here a supernova search program will be\r\nimplemented in the near infrared (Ks-band, 2.17 m) where the extinction by dust will be\r\nsignificantly reduced and the supernovae themselves will be brighter. The survey will be\r\ncarried out at the University of Virginia's Fan Mountain Observatory using the 31-inch\r\ntelescope and HAWAII-1 infrared camera (developed through an NSF Major Research\r\nInstrumentation grant). Fifty program galaxies, 30 with infrared luminosities in excess of 2\r\nx 1010LSun and within 32 Mpc, and 20 of the nearest galaxies more luminous than 1 x\r\n1010LSun, will be targeted and observed monthly for supernovae. Detected supernovae\r\nwill be fed to the PAIRITEL automated 1.3-meter telescope at Mt. Hopkins, AZ for\r\nsimultaneous J-, H-, and Ks-band imaging to determine light curves. Brighter supernovae\r\nwill also trigger target-of-opportunity spectroscopic observations with the TripleSpec\r\nnear-infrared spectrograph at the Apache Point Observatory 3.5-meter telescope. The\r\ninfrared spectra and light curves will allow the classification of the supernovae as a\r\nfunction of environment, which will in turn allow the progenitor populations to be\r\ncharacterized. The overall goals are a better estimate of the local supernovae rate and\r\nmore extensive observations of spectroscopic signatures diagnostic of envelope structure\r\nand interaction with the surrounding medium.\r\nThis work will support the training of a graduate student who will be responsible for the\r\npost-commissioning science program with TripleSpec using data from the imaging\r\nsurvey which the student will also lead. This student will be deeply integrated into the\r\nfinal assembly and testing of TripleSpec and its commissioning at the telescope.\r\nUndergraduates from the University of Virginia will take part in the acquisition of data at\r\nthe Fan Mountain Observatory with hope of cultivating new instrumentalists in addition\r\nto astronomical observers.",
