Hernandez-Maldonado\r\n\r\nInstitution:  \t\t\tUniversity of Puerto Rico - Mayaguez\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough this grant, the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez (UPRM) will acquire and X-ray Diffaction (XRD) unit with in Situ Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Reaction capabilities to support research and education efforts in nanotechnology, engineering materials, and environmental and energy sciences at UPRM. The equipment uses cross beam optics technology that allows to easily switch between focusing (Bragg-Brentano) and parallel beam geometries modes. This versatile apparatus permits the use of several attachments to perform a wide array of related analysis including DSC and high temperature gas phase reaction analyses. The availability of these analyses and methods will further ongoing UPRM research initiatives related to synthesis and characterization of nanostructured and nanoporous materials (including those related to adsorption and catalysis), magnetic nanostructures, nanocomposites, and polymers, among many others. \r\nThe equipment attachments will allow the researchers to make significant advancement in their respective fields by allowing fast and accurate determination of phase structures, temperature dependant phase changes, thermal stability, and synthesis mechanisms. In order to design usable nanostructured materials, accurate and detailed structural composition and topology information is required. \r\nThis acquisition will also help to grow and fortify the institutional SMET programs and research centers. Because there are no XRD units in Puerto Rico having such wide range of high precision phase- and structure-characterization capabilities, this instrument will also impact other research institutions. The equipment will be made available to other researchers in Puerto Rico and in collaborating Minority Serving Institutions through UPRM's Partnership for Research and Education on Materials (NSF-PREM) program. The acquisition will also strengthen the instrumentation base for training students at all levels. It will instantly benefit students from underrepresented groups by allowing them to get hands-on experience and learn how to use these combined nano-characterization techniques. This proposal will also provide a unique and meaningful research experience to both undergraduate students and K-12 teachers through the soon to be established UPRM's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program.\r\n",
