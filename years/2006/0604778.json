They concentrate on mathematical issues that\r\narise in recently introduced imaging methods for which there is\r\nlittle mathematical theory: Thermoacoustic Tomography (TAT),\r\nUltrasound-Modulated Optical Tomography (UOT), and\r\nAcousto-Electric Tomography (AET). \r\n\r\n     Computerized tomography has become a major method of medical\r\ndiagnostic imaging and industrial non-destructive testing.  Over\r\ntime, many modalities have been developed, such as X-ray\r\ntomography (usual CAT scan), MRI, Emission Tomography, Optical\r\nTomography (OT) and Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), to\r\nname only a few.  All of them have their advantages and\r\ndisadvantages in terms of contrast between different biological\r\ntissues, resolution, cost of devices and procedures, and safety\r\nof the patient.  For instance, cheap and safe procedures like EIT\r\nand OT are plagued by low resolution.  Recent years have brought\r\nnovel methods of imaging that intend to overcome these problems\r\nand have a high potential for becoming cheap, safe and effective\r\ndiagnostic tools.  These are Thermoacoustic Tomography (TAT),\r\nUltrasound-Modulated Optical Tomography (UOT), and\r\nAcousto-Electric Tomography (AET).  They all combine different\r\ntypes of radiation to overcome the known difficulties of methods\r\ninvolving only one of these modalities (e.g., optical tomography,\r\nultrasound imaging, or electrical impedance tomography), such as,\r\nfor example, low contrast of ultrasound imaging and high\r\ninstability and low resolution of optical and electrical\r\nimpedance imaging.  Mathematical issues are among the most\r\ncrucial in development of these methods, because images have to\r\nbe obtained by sophisticated mathematical procedures rather than\r\nby direct acquisition as in the standard (non-tomographic) X-ray\r\nimaging.  However, in all these modalities necessary analytic and\r\nnumerical tools are essentially absent or at very early stages of\r\ndevelopment.  Thus, the investigators develop mathematical\r\nanalytic and numerical techniques for obtaining images of\r\nbiological tissues, with the primary targets being TAT, UOT, and\r\nAET.  The project aids development and implementation of several\r\nnew, cheap, and safe methods of medical diagnostic imaging to be\r\nused in clinics.  Some applications for non-destructive\r\nindustrial testing are also possible.  Graduate students play a\r\nsignificant role in the project, and some of the project's\r\ntechniques and results are incorporated into graduate-level\r\nclasses.  This prepares students for work in exciting\r\ncontemporary areas at the junction of exact sciences and medicine\r\nand biology. \r\n",
