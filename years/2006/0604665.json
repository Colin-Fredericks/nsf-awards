 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI plans to establish new results concerning geometric and dynamical \r\nproperties of special subsets of the representation variety of a finitely \r\ngenerated group into a semisimple Lie group. Besides classical methods \r\nfrom differential geometry, rigidity theory and algebraic groups, new \r\ntechniques from continuous bounded cohomology will be employed in an \r\nessential way. The project builds upon previous joint work with M. Burger \r\nand A. Iozzi,in which the bounded Kaehler class, a second continuous \r\nbounded cohomology class, was used, both, to establish rigidity results \r\nfor Zariski dense representations of arbitrary finitely generated groups \r\ninto Lie groups of Hermitian type, as well as to define and study \r\nconnected components of the representation variety of a surface group, \r\nwhich give generalizations of Teichmueller space. One part of the project \r\nconcerns the study of refined geometric properties of surface group \r\nrepresentations in these special components, of parametrizations similar \r\nto Fenchel-Nielsen or shear coordinates on Teichmueller space, and of the \r\nexplicit relations between these generalized Teichmueller spaces and the \r\nmoduli spaces of Higgs bundles and of locally homogeneous geometric \r\nstructures on the surface. In a second part of the project, methods and \r\ntechniques used in the study of the bounded Kaehler class will be extended \r\nto define and investigate bounded cohomology classes in higher degree, \r\nwhich are expected to give rise to new rigidity phenomena and structural \r\nresults about representations into other semisimple Lie groups.\r\n\r\nSymmetries arise everywhere in nature and are very important in biology, \r\nchemistry, physics and mathematics. Mathematically one way to study \r\nsymmetries is to consider symmetry groups, that is groups of \r\ntransformations preserving the given symmetries. Patterns with many \r\nsymmetries are often optimal configurations and as such stable or rigid, \r\nbecause small deformations or changes destroy the symmetry. Sometimes \r\npatterns with symmetries arise in families and form so called \"moduli \r\nspaces\"; then, small or even large deformations do not break symmetry even \r\nthough they change the pattern. In this project both phenomena are \r\ndetected and studied using a special measurement for the geometric \r\ncomplexity of objects, which depends only on their symmetries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
