 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cycads (Cycadales) are one of the most ancient lineages of the existing gymnosperms, and they are one of the few insect-pollinated gymnosperms. Thus, they may be an important link to understanding the evolution of ancient insect pollination mutualisms. Because the genus Cycas is thought to be the most ancient of the cycads and has a different female structure compared with other cycads), gaining knowledge of its pollination systems is especially important in this area. Recently, the Asian cycad scale, Aulacaspis yasumatusi, a pest of cycads, was introduced into Guam. It has been rapidly devastating the highly susceptible Cycas micronesica, Guam's only native gymnosperm. This plant is considered a keystone species because of its influence on the chemistry of all terrestrial, aquatic, and marine habitats due to its interactions with nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria in the roots. Its loss may have a cascading, detrimental impact on the environment. Extinction of this cycad would mean losing this unique scientific resource not only for the study of the evolution of insect pollination systems but also for studying many ecological interactions. Only a few pockets of uninfested forest remain on Guam, and without major intervention, all plants will be lost within the next few of years. The goal is to study the pollination ecology of C. micronesica, to determine the role of insects, a fly and a moth,  and wind in the pollination process and to determine insect visitors on male and female cones from Cycas of Palau and from one other Mariana Island such as Rota. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project focus on conservation efforts on the island of Guam. Information on the pollination ecology of C. micronesica is critical to identifying priorities for conservation. In addition, results from the project will fill a current gap in our general understanding of the evolution of pollination mutualisms.",
