 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines at Colorado State University at Pueblo are cooperating to fund 20-25 scholarships of up to $5,000, renewable for four years, to financially needy and academically capable students majoring in the STEM disciplines. The available majors are Biology, Chemistry, Civil Engineering Technology, Computer Information Systems, Engineering & Mechatronics, Industrial Engineering, Mathematics, and Physics.\r\n\r\nPrimary features of this program include a) an interdisciplinary cohort of S-STEM scholars, b) expansion of existing student support activities to include S-STEM scholars and the creation of new student support activities available to non-scholars, c) a university orientation and social event targeted at the families of S-STEM scholars, d) career exploration and enrichment activities such as guest speakers, tours, and seminars, and e) scholarly, career, and support opportunities such as undergraduate research, career internships, mentoring by faculty or industry representatives, and tutoring of other students.\r\n\r\nThe S-STEM program is increasing the number of technically educated employees in areas of local, regional, and national need.  The Southeastern Colorado region lacks the technically educated workforce necessary for sustained economic growth.  The S-STEM program facilitates the recruitment, education, and retention to degree achievement of numerous students who would have difficulty reaching these goals otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe management team for this project includes the Principle Investigator, one faculty member from each of the 6 departments involved, five of whom chair their respective departments, the directors of Student Academic Services, Student Support Services, the Career Center, the Student Financial Services Counseling Manager, and the director of assessment and evaluation of the project.  The Project Management Team meets once each month during the academic year to review and evaluate the operation of the project.\r\n\r\n",
