 "awd_abstract_narration": "WAMC will produce and nationally distribute two dissemination products: Part 1) A series of eight, long-form, magazine-style radio stories about research-based strategies and methods throughout the U.S. working to inform educational practice, specifically within the effort to increase the participation of girls and women in STEM education and workforce; and, Part 2) a series of 26 two-minute radio stories about fascinating women throughout history that have overcome incredible obstacles to make significant contributions to STEM fields and education.  These two radio series will be broadcast throughout the US on WAMC's nationally-syndicated radio programs--The Best of Our Knowledge, a show about education, educational policy, innovation, and research; and 51%, a show about women and issues and policies affecting them. They will also be available for listening on WAMC's Women in STEM website (www.womeninscience.org), and distributed nationally on compact disc. \r\n\r\nWAMC anticipates the following broader impacts associated with this project:\r\n- Reaching and educating a nationwide audience of radio listeners about the national effort to close the gender gap in STEM education and careers;\r\n- Reaching and educating significant national audiences within the education community and within targeted audiences of young women, parents and organizational leaders; informing educational practices with regard to the objectives, methods, findings and impacts of gender-based research strategies and methods;\r\n- Reaching and educating a targeted audience of girls and young women (with a priority emphasis on minority and disabled populations) who will have the opportunity to learn that STEM education and careers are possible and within reach.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in WAMC's radio programming placing a national spotlight on research which specifically highlights teaching styles, curriculum designs, pedagogical approaches, etc., that have contributed to the knowledge base addressing gender related differences in learning, and have promoted educational experiences that positively affect student interest, performance, and choice of careers. In addition, intellectual merit lies in the research, production and presentation of quality radio programming that depicts the lives and work of successful women in STEM fields and careers throughout history.",
