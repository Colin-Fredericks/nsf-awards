Glenn Lipscomb, Institution: University of Toledo.\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\nFunds are requested to partially support the 2006 Membranes: Materials and Processes\r\nGordon Research Conference to be held August 6-11, 2006 at Colby-Sawyer College in\r\nNew London, NH. Professors Glenn Lipscomb (University of Toledo) and Matthias\r\nWessling (Twente University) are co-Chairs for the meeting and Professors Peter\r\nPintauro (Case Western Reserve University) and Andrew Zydney (Pennsylvania State\r\nUniversity) are co-Vice Chairs.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The program will feature the latest developments in membrane science\r\nand technology in areas of national interest including energy and water treatment. The\r\npresentations will come from a balanced slate of industrial, academic, and governmental\r\nspeakers; many of the academic speakers will be NSF awardees. Additionally, the\r\npresentations will include work supported through current national research initiatives\r\nsuch as the National Nanotechnology and Homeland Security Initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the project will be direct impact on the development of\r\nyoung researchers. The requested funding will be used to support attendance of graduate\r\nstudents, post-doctoral research associates, and young faculty from U.S. institutions.\r\nAttendance at the Gordon Conference will provide an opportunity to discuss their work\r\nwith more senior researchers and to stimulate their interest in a career in the membrane\r\nfield. Historically, the Gordon Conference has also been a fertile ground for the\r\ncultivation of new collaborations and research ideas. The conference format promotes\r\nthis by providing ample opportunity for casual interaction during meals, between\r\nsessions, and at evening social events.\r\n\r\nThe meeting is being advertised in the Journal of Membrane Science, the North American Membrane Society Membrane Quarterly, and their European, Japanese, and Korean counterparts. Information about the meeting is posted on the internet at www.membranes.org. Many students and senior researchers present their work in the very informal Gordon Research Conference atmosphere and this typically stimulates meaningful discussions between students and leaders in the field.  \r\n\r\n",
