 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modeling and reconstructing time-varying 3D fluid surfaces is a\r\nchallenging problem. First, accurately measuring 3D fluid surfaces is\r\ndifficult because their features can be highly varying in space and time,\r\nand the measuring device should not be intrusive to the fluid. Second, the\r\nevolution of fluid surfaces is governed by complex physical mechanisms\r\nthat need to be incorporated into the reconstruction methods. In this\r\nresearch, the PIs propose a novel approach for accurately reconstructing\r\n3D fluid surfaces from sampled data. This project consists of two key\r\ncomponents: a fluid surface acquisition method and a fluid surface\r\nreconstruction method. For data acquisition, the PIs propose to design a\r\nnovel experimental system using a light field camera array that can\r\nsimultaneously capture different views of a fluid surface. A known pattern\r\nis placed beneath the surface and each camera observes a distinct\r\ntime-varying distortion pattern. A sampled fluid surface can then be\r\nmeasured by analyzing these distortions. For surface reconstruction, the\r\nPIs propose to develop an iterative optimization algorithm which minimizes\r\nthe error relative to the sampled data and finds the reconstructed surface\r\nby solving the full Euler equations for 3D free-surface flows. Solutions\r\nof these equations are computed by using an efficient numerical method.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research have many applications in Fluid Mechanics as\r\nwell as in Computer Graphics and Vision, such as the validation of\r\nexisting fluid models and the integration of reconstructed fluid surfaces\r\ninto animations and film footage to reproduce realistic phenomena. This\r\ninterdisciplinary project will promote the training of graduate students\r\non mathematical modeling, laboratory experiments, and computer\r\nsimulations. The PIs will also develop courses and seminars for both\r\nundergraduate and graduate students interested in these topics.\r\n",
