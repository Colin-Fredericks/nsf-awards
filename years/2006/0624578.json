 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal, \"Students Investing in Mathematics, Engineering and Technology (SIMET),\" is a request from Jackson State University for a three-year project that outlines a year-round program that includes:  Saturday sessions, online/telephone homework support by a college-age mentor, a two-week summer residential camp, workshops for parents and internships.  The program will serve a total of 90 underrepresented students over three years, with 15 students each year in 7th, 8th, and 9th grades and 15 students each year in 9th, 10th, and 11th grades.  The year-round and summer components together will engage students in various computer and mathematical skills and concepts with a focus on mathematical concepts and computer literacy, using basic word processing programs.  The content focuses on a combination of mathematics, mathematics software and desktop applications.\r\n\r\nThe proposal outlines two levels (7-9 and 9-11) of a year-round program which consists of eight Saturday sessions during the school year, weekly on-hour sessions online with mentors, and a two-week residential summer program at Jackson State University.  During the second summer, students, both at middle and high school levels, will participate in an internship.  The internship for the younger students will take place on-campus while the older students will take place both on- and off-campus.  Participants will receive 120 contact hours a year with SIMET faculty and personnel.  Parents will engage in activities for 16 contact hours each year.  By providing intensive experience in IT and mathematical concepts, the project aims to prepare students with IT knowledge and increase the students' knowledge of STEM careers. \r\n",
