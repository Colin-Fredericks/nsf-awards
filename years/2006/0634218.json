 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, \"Transitioning Nanoscale Research to the Undergraduate Classroom at NCA&T State University,\" at  NCA&T State University, under the direction of Dr. Devdas M. Pai, will bring together a multidisciplinary team of educators and nanotechnology researchers to develop two new interdisciplinary courses on the fundamental concepts and applications of nanoscience and nanotechnology and introduce new modules on nanotechnology into several existing courses in the mechanical, industrial and chemical engineering undergraduate curricula.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: A major challenge in developing a nanoscience/engineering course is the highly multidisciplinary nature of the field. The proposing team, consisting of accomplished researchers and led by an educator with outstanding undergraduate teaching credentials, is proposing to build the elements of a nanotechnology curriculum through a three-pronged effort to share with undergraduate students the excitement and learning occurring in their labs. The first part is the development of modules for use in selected existing courses in mechanical, industrial and chemical engineering. These courses will serve as foundation to two additional courses that we propose to develop as part of this project. The additional courses will be classified as technical electives, available to senior undergraduate students and to entry level masters' students. The first course, entitled 'Fundamentals of Nanoscale Science and Engineering,' will deal with the underlying principles and fundamental concepts of nanoscience. The second one, titled 'Applications of Nanotechnology,' will provide students with broad exposure to the practical use of nanoscience in devices and systems, as well as the tools and support systems used in their manufacture and modeling/simulation.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  NCA&T is an Historically Black University which enjoys the distinction of being the nation's leading producer of African-American engineers. The project team will provide participating students with training and mentoring in the economic and intellectual powerhouse area of nanotechnology. The project will directly impact all mechanical, chemical and industrial engineering undergraduate students (~150 annually). Besides the obvious benefit of attracting the best undergraduates into graduate research, the students will also be engaged in passing on the learning downstream through helping with summer camps for K-12 educators and school visitations to help attract high-quality students from across the nation.\r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) Program Solicitation (NSF 06-538) and is being co-funded by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Design and Manufacturing Innovation (DMI), the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems (CMS), and the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC).  \r\n\r\n",
