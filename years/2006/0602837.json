 "awd_abstract_narration": "+The mathematical development of wavelet theory and the accompanied\r\ncomputational algorithms reached a mature, satisfactory, level in one\r\ndimension. The situation is far less satisfactory in higher dimensions.\r\nAs a matter of fact, the  current approaches for the construction of high-D\r\nwavelet representations scale poorly with the dimension. On the one hand,\r\nintrinsic constructions become hopelessly complicated already at relatively\r\nlow dimensions. On the other hand, the simple approach of lifting\r\nunivariate systems to higher dimensions becomes eventually immensely\r\nnon-local. As a result, the construction of effective, efficient, wavelet\r\nrepresentations in high dimensions remains a major challenge and an elusive\r\ntarget.  The premise of this proposal is that the only way to meet this\r\nchallenge is to fundamentally change the principles of wavelet\r\nconstructions. The ambitious goal of this project is to develop\r\nrepresentations that scale correctly with the spatial dimension: constants\r\nin the complexity estimates of the algorithms that are independent of the\r\ndimension; linear functionals that have limited, controlled, overlapping in\r\ntheir supports; and performance grade that does not degrade with the growth\r\nof the dimension. The project is expected to contribute in tangible ways to\r\nNSF's broad criteria. This is first and foremost due to the intrinsic\r\nimportance of the research area, and the fact that the problem attacked in\r\nthis project is a major hurdle in the relevant research area. In addition,\r\nthe initiative offers a highly valuable training and education  opportunity\r\nto mathematical science students,  education in  areas that  are at the\r\ninterface between mathematics on the one hand and science and technology on\r\nthe other hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur era is marked by breathtaking improvement in sensor acquisition\r\ncapabilities and an explosive increase in communication over wired and\r\nwireless channels. As a result of these and similar trends, the correct\r\nhandling of massive datasets is, these days, at the core of almost every\r\ntechnology that deals with scientific data.  The most fundamental issue in\r\nthis regard is the fact that the size of the dataset is merely an artifact\r\nof the acquisition technology; it is not related to pertinent information\r\nthat the data encode, nor to the actual applications that are sought for.\r\nData representation is the scientific discipline that deals with challenges\r\nlike the above.  It resolves the above problem by transforming the data into\r\na new format which allows an efficient and effective extraction of\r\ninformation, storage, transmission, and the like.  There is probably no way\r\nto overstate the importance of research on data representation: Development\r\nof novel data representations is ranked among the top scientific priorities\r\nof our nation. Indeed, the innovators in this field are richly recognized\r\nfor their contributions: even after restricting attention only to research\r\non the mathematical  and statistical aspects of data representation, one\r\nfinds, in the last eight years alone, two Medal of Science awards,  as well\r\nas five or more elections to the National Academy of Science.  The wavelet\r\nrepresentation is among the most important contributions of the data\r\nrepresentation community to science. It was introduced in order to provide\r\nan answer to the main shortcoming of the Fourier representation, i.e., the\r\nfact that the latter never provides a sparse representation to transient\r\nevents.  The research community succeeded in constructing very good wavelet\r\nrepresentations in 1D.  Those systems are computed and inverted by fast\r\nalgorithms and strike as good balance as can be between performance and\r\nlocalness. The same it not true in high spatial dimensions.  Armed with\r\nthat observation, the intent of this ambitious project is to develop novel\r\nclasses of wavelet representations that are efficient and effective in high\r\ndimensions.\r\n",
