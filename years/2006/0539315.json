 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will investigate a novel scanning mechanism suitable for non-invasive optical imaging and analysis systems similar to Optical Coherence Tomography. Conventional scanning systems typically physically translate a reference mirror through a distance comparable to the scanning range. This critically limits the speed performance and applicability of conventional non-invasive imaging and analysis systems. The proposed approach is to develop a high speed scanning solution, compatible with real-time video display, by generating multiple optical reference signals related to different depths within the target in a manner that enables simultaneously acquiring interferometric signals from multiple depths within the target. Furthermore, this will be done in a manner that allows the simultaneously acquired interferometric signals to be separated in the electronic domain. This novel scanning approach is expected to accomplish scanning ranges of the order of millimeters without the requirement of physically translating a reference mirror by a similar range. This will enable compact, rugged, low cost imaging and analysis systems.\r\n\r\nThe innovation addresses a limiting scan speed aspect of conventional interferometric scanning systems that restricts the usefulness of technologies including Optical Coherence Tomography. If successful the novel scanning technology will be implemented at different wavelength ranges making it practical for a broad range of applications. A key aspect of this technology is that it can be implemented in a highly integrated manner to provide a compact, rugged and low cost commercially viable system. This can make non-invasive high-speed imaging and analysis ubiquitously availably thus enabling routine defect analysis for quality control or routine medical screening for tissue malignancies. Specific applications include: non-destructive material analysis for quality control or defect monitoring; monitoring for skin cancer; imaging burn damage; retinal imaging; dental imaging and fiber catheter based internal medical analysis. The ubiquitous availability of low cost high performance systems can have a significant positive societal impact on health and quality of life by early detection and treatment of malignant medical conditions, with extraordinary savings in health care costs and on manufacturing quality control leading to improved commercial productivity. \r\n",
