 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the role of halogens in atmospheric chemistry at Summit, Greenland. Recent studies of chemical processing above and within sunlit snow have shown that polar regions are photochemically active and strongly oxidizing. In previous measurement campaigns at Summit, HO2 (peroxy radical) concentrations were found to be high and consistent with photochemical models; however, levels of OH (hydroxyl radical) were significantly elevated compared to steady-state model simulations. This occurred primarily during periods of high wind. This suggests two, not mutually exclusive, hypotheses: (1) episodic transport of reactive halogens from the marine boundary layer or free troposphere could lead to halogen activation in firn by heterogeneous reactions, and (2) local formation of reactive halogens in the photochemically active snow pack or on airborne ice during windy periods.\r\n \r\nThis project involves measurements of a variety of chemical species in the Summit Greenland surface layer, including O3 (ozone), NO (nitrogen oxide), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), H2O (water vapor), HONO (nitrous acid), RONO2 (organic nitrates), HCHO (formaldehyde), HCOOH (formic acid), CH3COOH (acetic acid), CO (carbon monoxide), CH4 (methane), reactive NMHCs (non-methane hydrocarbons), and a variety of halogen species, including BrO (bromine monoxide), IO (iodine monoxide), and OIO (iodine dioxide), as well as soluble gas phase bromide. Rates of photochemical reactions will be determined above and within the snow. Intensive sampling seasons are planned for summer 2007 (when sunlight is at a maximum), and spring 2008 (during rapid temperature changes). Measurements over a wide range of environmental conditions as well as transport regimes will help to discriminate the relative importance of halogens on the photochemical cycling of reactive hydrogen radicals (HOx). Field measurements will be interpreted with the aid of back trajectory tools (specifically, the FLEXPART model) and by employing a photochemical steady-state box model to determine the HOx cycling within the Summit boundary layer.\r\n \r\nIf successful, this project will produce novel insights in chemical processes in an environment typical of polar regions, and improve our understanding of fundamental processes involving halogen compounds. The project will provide opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to gain research experience. A broad program of public outreach is planned as well.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research continues a series of investigation in a new field known as \"snow photochemistry\", which began in 1998 when three different teams working separately at Summit, Greenland (site of the GISP 2 ice core at 72 N and more than 3 km above sea level), Alert, NWT on the shore of the Arctic Ocean, and the South Pole discovered that unexpectedly high levels of nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2, collectively known as NOx) formed in shallow layers of polar snow and were emitted to the atmosphere.  These early studies showed that sunlight shining on snow containing nitrate and nitric acid caused the production and release of NOx. \n\n \n\nFollow-up studies soon discovered that a range of very reactive (hence short-lived) compounds were also formed in and above sunlit snow in temperate snow packs as well as in both polar regions.  The presence of these reactive gases leads to very vigorous chemistry, more akin to what is usually found in urban areas than what was expected at these remote locations.  At Summit, the release of gases like hydrogen peroxide, formaldehyde, and nitrous acid from the snow created a mixture that was predicted to lead to very high concentrations of the hydroxyl (OH) and peroxy (HO2) radicals (collectively termed HOx).  This was important since OH in particular is involved in the breakdown (oxidation) of many of the pollutants that are emitted to the atmosphere and scientists believed there should be very little OH so far north and so high up in the atmosphere.\n\n \n\nThe first measurements of HOx at Summit were made in 2003 and 2004 and these confirmed very high levels - even higher than those found above tropical oceans where most OH on earth is formed.  However, the relative amounts of OH and HO2 could not be explained by standard models; there was much more OH than expected.  This led to the idea that non-standard chemistry might have to be considered to explain the observations, particularly bromine chemistry. \n\n \n\nIt is well known that bromine chemistry converts HO2 to OH as well as destroys ozone very rapidly and converts elemental gas phase mercury into more reactive compounds that are rapidly removed from the atmosphere.  But most evidence for the importance of bromine chemistry has been obtained from unusual locations such as the coasts of the Arctic ocean and Antarctica, near salt flats or salt lakes, and in some volcanic plumes where there are high levels of salts, including bromide.  Concentrations of salts are very low in snow at the top of the Greenland ice sheet but we speculated that there might be enough to support bromine chemistry, or that strong winds could sometimes bring air from the Arctic ocean and north Atlantic with lots of sea salt (including bromide) to Summit.\n\n \n\nThe Greenland Summit Halogen-HOx experiment was a collaboration between research teams from the University of New Hampshire, University of Houston, UCLA, Georgia Institute of Technology, UC Irvine, and NOAA ATDD, with modeling assistance provided by colleagues at NASA Langley and the University of East Anglia.  Intensive field campaigns were conducted near the highest point of the Greenland ice sheet in the summers of 2007 and 2008 to confirm the idea that active bromine chemistry was occurring at this unique site, and was vigorous enough to modify the cycling between OH and HO2 radicals, and cycling of mercury.\n\n \n\nFor the six-week campaigns during two summers at Summit, we brought three different instruments that provide direct evidence of bromine chemistry, and several techniques providing indirect evidence (an instrument to measure OH/HO2, a suite of instruments to determine elemental and reactive mercury, and whole air sampler for quantifying many organic compounds).  Both the direct and indirect techniques confirmed low levels of active bromine chemistry.  Convincing evidence was also found that most of the time conversion of bromide in the snow into active bromine was sufficient to sustain the observed chemistry despite..."
