 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: Mechanics of Biological Adhesion, Friction and Engineered Surfaces\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the mechanisms behind the exceptional adhesion and friction exhibited by animals such as geckos can potentially lead to significant technological benefits if some of nature's highly optimized solutions can be mimicked in a laboratory. Such an effort offers a rich set of challenging problems at the interface between biology, applied mechanics and micro/nano-fabrication. The proposed research and educational program attempts to contribute towards developing this new area from which practical benefits can be derived. The focus of the effort is on engineering the topography of surfaces at micron and nano scale in order to (i) understand the mechanics of biological adhesion and friction systems and (ii) develop biomimetic strategies which implement nature's mechanisms for optimized adhesion and friction. The proposed program integrates the PI's research activities and laboratory facilities with his educational plans and participating in outreach activities. Some of the specific plans are: an undergraduate student from a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) will be recruited each summer to participate in original research, throughout the duration of this project;  the PI will be a member of the Brown University team which will assist Hampton University (HBCU) in developing its Mechanical Engineering program; the PI will also develop a collaboration with the Bridgham public school (an inner city school in which 75% of the students are Hispanic, African American or Native American) in bringing the excitement of scientific enterprise to middle school students.\r\n\r\n",
