 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nThis collaborative effort will investigate the structure and properties of novel bent-core\r\nnematics (BCNs) with a view toward new materials for electro-mechanical applications using  nematic liquid crystals. The specific research objectives and scientific benefits of the project are to confirm the existence of predicted new states of matter composed of clusters of bent-core liquid crystal molecules, to study the origins and the limits of unexpected large coupling between electric polarization and mechanical distortion, including electromechanical effects and electrohydrodynamic instabilities, and to develop using molecular design new responsive and tunable rubbery polymers built up from ordered, bent-core molecules. \r\n\r\nNon-technical Abstract\r\n\r\nThis project offers the promise of significant advances in technological applications of liquid crystals. Two examples are low-cost, wearable (or potentially bio-implantable) electric generators based on enhanced flexoelectricity in BCN elastomers, and polar electro-optical switches with the processing advantages of a fluid (nematic) phase. Extensive industrial partnerships with the Liquid Crystal Institute at Kent State University will assure a high probability for knowledge transfer to industry that should ultimately provide significant benefits to the U.S. economy. The education projects have a unique emphasis on training doctoral students to be effective technical personnel in an entrepreneurial environment and to successfully address the complexities of intellectual property are critical. Undergraduates from small colleges and traditionally under-represented schools in Ohio will be introduced to cutting-edge research over periods of up to 10 weeks during either the academic year or summer. These students will have full access to the research projects and to available facilities, and they will interact closely with the graduate students. Providing opportunities for American undergraduate students to be intimately involved in the type of cutting-edge research proposed here is one of the main factors in convincing young people to pursue a career in the sciences.\r\n\r\n",
