 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anna Krylov and Wee Ling Wong of the University of Southern California, Joel Bowman of Emory University, and William Polik of Hope College are supported by the NSF Division of Chemistry, under the Cyberinfrastructure and Research Facilities Program.  This collaborative project establishes a center for computational studies of electronic structure and spectroscopy of open-shell and electronically excited species, which will (i) develop a model for efficient cyber-technology transfer from the developers of state-of-the-art theoretical methods and software to prospective users whose research will be enhanced by using novel computational tools; and (ii) serve as a testbed for larger scale computational centers by demonstrating how specific needs of a focused groups of users can be addressed.  To achieve these goals, training and state-of-the-art computational resources will be provided to diverse experimental groups whose research involves open-shell and electronically excited species, and tools will be developed to facilitate the interpretation of electronic structure calculations in terms of experimentally relevant observables and bonding paradigms.  Feedback from experimental groups will guide the center's developments.\r\n\r\nThis project will serve a diverse community of researchers and educators whose\r\nadvanced computational needs are not currently addressed by existing models of cyber infrastructure, such as general purpose lab workstations or large shared computer facilities.  With a focus on greater understanding of open-shell and electronically excited species, new theoretical methodologies will be developed and incorporated, as well as new ways of interpretating calculational results in terms of experimental observables.  Training will consist of introductory and advanced web courses delivered using novel distance-learning tools, tutorials, manuals, and case studies, as well as series of focused on-site and virtual workshops.  A streaming digital library of quantum chemistry concepts will be created and disseminated through the Web. The library can be used by teachers in preparation of courses at levels ranging from high school to graduate studies.\r\n",
