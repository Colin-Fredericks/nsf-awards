A model plasma reactor, consisting of a methyl radical source and hydrogen and nitrogen ion sources, is used to controllably grow these films.  Characterization of the films by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy is correlated with film growth parameters and the resulting growth kinetics.  These films have broad application as hard coatings in the disk drive and optics industries, and a fundamental understanding of their growth may impact these industries as well as thin film growth in general.  Multidisciplinary education of researchers in this laboratory results from these studies.  \r\n\r\nA fundamental understanding of the dependence of film growth kinetics and morphology related to the composition of growth plasmas is the goal of this research being carried out in the laboratory of Professor Fairbrother at the Johns Hopkins University.  Film characterization coupled with controlled growth conditions provides information about the mechanisms and kinetics of growth.  This information is useful in the design of processes for the production of tribological and optical films and coatings. \r\n\r\n",
