This conference is one in a well-known series held every four years that started in 1963. These meetings promote collaboration and intellectual exchange among researchers and practitioners worldwide in wind engineering and related fields. It is critical that the wind engineering community in the US be represented at this important conference. The International Wind Engineering conferences have provided an international forum for presentation of individual and national accomplishments. Future research directions are often identified through these conferences. Underrepresented minority and early career researchers will be included in this activity. \r\n \r\n\r\n",
