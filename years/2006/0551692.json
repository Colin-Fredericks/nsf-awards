WARP will be a scalable and extensible platform with three component layers: custom hardware with scalable processing and extensible I/O, platform support packages that provide seamless integration across different hardware components, and an application design environment. They will develop an open-access repository with WWW access that allows WARP users to construct wireless networks, share experiments over the Internet, and implement their networks on their own WARP hardware kits; lastly the investigators will develop a wireless development kit and make it available to other researchers and educators, conduct workshops on use of the WARP system, and host a student exchange program.\r\n\r\n",
