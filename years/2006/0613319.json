 "awd_abstract_narration": "Between 80 to 35 ka the Middle Stone Age (MSA) record of South Africa reveals episodes of inventiveness and innovation, punctuated by apparent returns to more conventional technologies. Typically, the sequence of Still Bay to Howiesons Poort (HP) to post-Howiesons Poort industries shows evidence of technological shifts between macrolithic and quasi-microlithic assemblages that remain largely unexplained. Similar repeated technological shifts can be observed in Later Stone Age (LSA) assemblages. Thus the MSA sequence prefigures sensu lato the alternations in technological behavior seen in the LSA. Formal bone tools that appear early in the South African MSA are clear examples of a tendency to develop new functional ideas, techniques or devices, along with symbolic novelties like shell beads, engraved ochre and incised ostrich eggshells.  Such inventiveness is widely viewed as symptomatic of advanced or modern behavior. LSA hunter-gatherers had a very flexible approach to lithic technology that responded to environmental changes. Were MSA hunter-gatherers behaving in similar ways? \r\nWhy are technological shifts important? Since technological change is relatively slow through most of prehistory, sudden increases in rates of technological change are thought to signal the emergence of new cognitive abilities. These evolved to cope with adaptive problems, by modifying technological behavior, at times when demographic densities had increased, thus further aiding the spread of any successful technological innovations. These are major steps in human cultural evolution.\r\n\r\nWith National Science Foundation support, Dr. Paola Villa and a small team of lithic specialists will carry out technological studies of assemblages in five Middle Stone Age sites in South Africa (Border Cave, Rose Cottage, Sibudu, Klasies River Mouth and Hollow Rock Shelter). Collaboration with Chris Henshilwood and Marie Soressi ensures access to data from the Still Bay phase of Blombos Cave. Previous NSF and Leakey Foundation grants have allowed the team to analyze some of the assemblages from those sites. However there are still many open questions concerning the pace of change and degree of continuity between the major MSA phases, the existence of regional and temporal variability within each major phase, the occurrence and significance of advanced behaviors such as craft specialization in the Still Bay phase and the inter-male exchange of hunting equipment in the Howiesons Poort phase. Detailed analyses of regional sequences are needed to understand if technological and paleoenvironmental changes coincide.\r\n\r\nThe team brings together South African archaeologists and French technologists. Studies of lithic technologies, supported by experimental replication, are an important aspect of research in Western Europe but have rarely been carried out on the South African MSA. This project provides opportunity for close exchange and scientific interaction between researchers of different countries and with different but complementary skills. The project will also broaden the participation of students from South African Universities. The PI will participate in a lithic workshop, organized by the French Institute of South Africa and the University of with teaching lithic analysis methods, using MSA materials, by the P.I. Students and researchers from other South African universities will participate. The PI will teach lithic analysis to two doctoral students (both women) at the University of Witwatersrand and the African Heritage Research Institute. Witwatersrand. The workshop will combine demonstrations of experimental knapping by skilled flint knappers with teaching lithic analysis methods, using MSA materials, by the P.I Students and researchers from other South African universities will participate.  The PI will teach lithic analysis to two doctoral students (both women) at the University of Witwatersrand and the African Heritage Research Institute.",
