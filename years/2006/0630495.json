 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is funding to support this year's student design competition (SDC), which will be part of the 2006 annual RESNA conference to be held June 22-26 in Atlanta, Georgia.  RESNA is the one organization with an international focus that is devoted solely to technology for individuals with disabilities.  Comprised of over 1,000 individual and 200 institutional members - researchers, manufacturers, clinicians, suppliers, professionals and end-users of technology devices and equipment - the organization has as its purpose to improve the health and participation of people with disabilities in mainstream society.  To this end, RESNA supports those individuals engaged in research, development, education, advocacy and the provision of technology through a number of programs and activities, which in addition to the annual conference include a credentialing program for assistive technology practitioners, suppliers and rehabilitation engineering technologists, as well as sponsored projects.  RESNA serves as the ANSI-designated national body for development of voluntary standards for products used by persons with disabilities.  The first Student Design Competition (SDC) was held in 1980 as part of the inaugural RESNA conference.  Since then, a total of over 120 designs have been identified as winning entries, chosen from more than 500 submissions by students from over 100 different universities.  SDC entries must represent the work of STUDENTS ONLY, including the documentation of the design, but both undergraduate and graduate students are eligible to submit entries.  Many past participants in the event are now leaders in service, research, and educational areas related to technology for people with disabilities.  Partial support for past SDC has been provided by nationally recognized disability organizations such as Easter Seals and Paralyzed Veterans of America, as well as by a subsidiary of the Johnson & Johnson Company.  NSF funding will enable this year's competition to be significantly expanded and enhanced, to include more entries and support for more design teams, including those from minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities.  A call for participation will be posted on the conference website, and also sent out to major colleges and universities with engineering and design schools, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  A team of 5 judges will pre-select entries with the final selections made at the RESNA Conference.  Fifteen teams will be invited to attend the conference with 5 teams ultimately selected as the final winners.  A half-day session will be held in which the 15 teams will make presentations before the judges and public audience at the conference.  Judges will have an opportunity to ask questions and make suggestions and recommendations to the design teams.  Judges will make final decisions based on criteria using numeric scoring.  After the judging contest, students will have an opportunity to exhibit and talk about their projects at the Exhibit Hall opening.  More information is available online at http://www.resna.org/Conference/Conference.php. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The annual RESNA Conference and the Student Design Competition combine to create a unique forum for interaction between working and experienced rehabilitation engineers and students who are about to enter the field.  In its new and expanded format thanks to NSF support for the second year now, the SDC is even better positioned to foster innovation and creativity, with the ultimate goal of producing technology that can contribute to the independence of individuals with disabilities.   Unique in its primary focus on undergraduates, the event will provide participants with experience and skills that assist them to be successful in their engineering and design careers, and will further encourage, support and mentor students in various disciplines to become involved in the assistive technology and rehabilitation engineering fields.",
