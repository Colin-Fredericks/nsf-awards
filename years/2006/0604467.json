The investigator studies several fundamental\r\ntheoretical problems related to these models.  In particular, he\r\nexamines:\r\n1. The structure of boundary layers of superconducting or smectic\r\nstates that are both characterized by exponentially fast decaying\r\nsolutions. For the case of superconductors this phenomenon is\r\ncalled surface superconductivity.\r\n2. The emergence of periodic solutions, known as Abrikosov\r\nlattices for superconductors and as twist grain boundaries for\r\nsmectic liquid crystals.\r\n3. The loss of stability, in the presence of a combination of\r\nelectric and magnetic field, of the normal state in\r\nsuperconductors.\r\n\r\n     Superconductors are metals that when put under a\r\nsufficiently low temperature exhibit two important properties:\r\n1. They lose entirely their electrical resistivity.\r\n2. The magnetic field is excluded from the superconducting area.\r\nSuperconductors have enormous technological potential for\r\napplications ranging from magnetic sensors, through generators of\r\nlarge magnetic fields, to high power transmitters.  Liquid\r\ncrystals contain elongated molecules whose direction and density\r\ndetermine the material's mechanical, optical and other\r\nproperties.  They are already at the heart of a large industry,\r\nparticularly in display devices, and they are being explored for\r\nfurther application in a variety of optical devices.  Liquid\r\ncrystals with uniform density are called nematics, and those with\r\nnon-uniform density are termed smectics.  The investigator\r\nstudies the behavior of the above materials when the material is\r\neither superconducting or smectic only in a thin layer near the\r\nboundary.  The project could shed light on the transition from\r\nthe normal state to the superconducting one, or from nematics to\r\nsmectics.  It can also have some industrial applications because\r\nit aims at finding the maximal current a superconductor can carry\r\nbefore reverting to the normal state where the material\r\nresistivity would cause energy losses.",
