 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technological advances in the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS), Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Systems are revolutionizing the transportation industry and supply chain management that is so essential to modern industry and lean manufacturing processes. The integration of RFID technology with GPS technologies facilitates the integration of manufacturing/distribution mapping with broader geographic management/tracking and routing mapping. This technology holds the promise of single vendor security of custody from initial entry into the supply chain management system to final delivery. Such integration occurs at the plant level or on a global scale. Growing concerns over terrorism mandate the tracking of all items entering the U.S. The educational implications of this revolution are significant. Implementation of these technologies requires workers who have skills not only in transportation and logistics principles but also in systems related to GPS, GIS, relational database management systems and RFID principles.  Currently, some skill standards and competency criteria exist in the transportation and logistics fields. However, these skill standards and competencies are neither comprehensive nor consolidated, nor do they reflect the rapidly evolving nature of the transportation and manufacturing industries. These skill standards and competencies are not linked to an educational/career pathway that includes certificates, associate degrees and baccalaureate degrees. A consortium consisting of Mid-South Community College, NorthWest Arkansas Community College, the University of Memphis, the American Society of Transportation and Logistics, and the Arkansas Association of Two-Year Colleges, in collaboration with some of the world's largest corporations, Wal-Mart, FedEx, Riceland Foods, and J.B. Hunt, are creating a valuable resource for educational institutions and business and industry. A major goal of this project is the professional development of faculty in the use of case studies, problem-based learning and the curriculum backward design process. Course guides are being produced for courses responsive to the skill standards assessment.  Inclusion of underrepresented groups, particularly African-Americans and Hispanics, is a priority in this project.\r\n\r\n",
