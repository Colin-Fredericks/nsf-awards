 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solar, Heliosphere and INterplanetary Environment (SHINE) is an affiliation of researchers within the solar, interplanetary, and heliospheric communities, dedicated to promoting an enhanced understanding of the processes by which energy in the form of magnetic fields and particles are produced by the Sun and/or accelerated in interplanetary space, and on the mechanisms by which these fields and particles are transported to the Earth through the inner heliosphere. SHINE research focuses in particular upon the connection between events and phenomena on the Sun and their relation to solar wind structures in the inner heliosphere. The goal of SHINE activities is to enrich and strengthen both physical understanding and predictive capabilities for these phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe goals of SHINE parallel those of NSF's Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) and Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) programs, and joint space weather studies are being planned with those organizations. As a community-based group supporting Space Weather research, it is allied with the older GEM and CEDAR programs within the National Science Foundation (NSF), which support space weather research in magnetosphere physics and in aeronomy and the upper atmosphere, respectively. This proposal solicits funds to continue this highly successful series of workshops for the next three years.",
