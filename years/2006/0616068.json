 "awd_abstract_narration": "Defining the machinery by which cells perceive and respond to their environment remains one of the foremost problems in biology. The recently described LIG family represents a novel component of this signaling machinery in animals. This set of transmembrane molecules is comprised of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and an immunoglobulin (IG) domain, two of the most prevalent sequence elements within animal genomes. Studies in this area, currently limited to only a few family members, support the hypothesis that LIG molecules provide unique regulatory mechanisms for diverse signaling networks. The unique domain architecture of LIGs and its strict conservation further suggests that LIGs may represent molecules for inter-network connectivity. The goal of this research is to test these hypotheses by elucidating the functions of LIG molecules and delineating LIG-modulated networks in the model system Drosophila. Detailing the mechanisms through which this novel class of molecules acts is of fundamental importance to achieving an increased understanding of signaling networks and the evolution of their regulatory mechanisms. In addition to furthering knowledge of signaling mechanisms, this work will engage students at all levels in the research experience and provide educational outreach activities for local K-12 science classes. Additionally, a web resource for the LIG family will be developed to integrate functional and sequence based data, facilitate the curation and annotation of this expanding family, and promote open access to LIG-related data.",
