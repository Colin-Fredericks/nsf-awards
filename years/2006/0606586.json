 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Small Grant for Exploratory Resesrch (SGER) is to develop a mathematical model for predicting, simulating and animating the cyclic chip formation process in metal machining.  This study involves the use of topological properties in the development of new analytical and numerical models for multi-scale (micro, meso and macro) cyclic chip formation process in machining with coated grooved tools.  By applying these methods, a systematic analysis will be made to establish the major influencing parameters of product life and product quality in cutting tools and the machined products.  Through continued simulation of the chip formation process, and refinement of these models, a combined hybrid predictive model will be developed for predicting machining performance in terms of tool-life and surface integrity, and for simulation and animation of cyclic chip formation involving chip curl and chip breaking using topological changes of the work material in the machining region.  Topological classifications of the machined and cutting tool surfaces will be made by taking account of progressive tool-wear and its effects.  Experiments will be conducted for validating the predictive model.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will open new opportunities for better modeling of other complex manufacturing processes.  This new predictive capability and the related product life predictions and enhancement will bring in significant productivity improvement in machining process planning and operations.  This novel aspect has far reaching benefits including technology transfer/applications in industry.  This project will contribute to the educational mission of the university by providing additional knowledge in this subject area to two students: one graduate student and one undergraduate student.  This project will stimulate these engineering students' interest in topology and its applications.  This project will also benefit students from underrepresented groups.",
