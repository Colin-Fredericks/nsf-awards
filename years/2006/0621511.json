 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is aimed at understanding and developing microdata storage systems, a technology which is needed for many application ares, including genome processing and radar knowledge formation.  Microdata storage systems are designed to perform well for small files (microfiles), as well as for large files (macrofiles).\r\nToday's filesystems are optimized for reading and writing data in large blocks, but they perform poorly when dealing with large volumes of microdata.\r\nThe research focuses on three promising technologies:\r\n   - Microdata storage structures, such as buffered repository B-trees, which can improve the performance of insertions and range queries of microfiles by orders of magnitude over traditional B-trees, while still preserving high performance on macrofiles.\r\n   - Cache-oblivious data structures, which provide passive self-tuning of the file organization and may actually outperform tuned cache-aware data structures for disk file systems.\r\n   - Virtual-memory-based transactional memory, which allows programmers to implement complex file structures in a straightforward manner, while providing lock-free programming and automatic crash recovery.\r\nThe investigators employ benchmarks, such as the DARPA HPC SSCA#3 benchmark (an I/O-only version of which they developed), to evaluate the impact of microdata storage systems on high-end computing.  The investigators are also developing course materials on microdata storage systems which will be made freely available under the MIT OpenCourseware initiative http://ocw.mit.edu.\r\n\r\n",
