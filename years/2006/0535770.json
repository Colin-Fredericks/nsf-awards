 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Conference on Function Spaces at SIUE will gather mathematicians working in the areas of function algebras, spaces and algebras of analytic functions, Lp-spaces, geometry of Banach spaces, and related topics. It will provide a forum to present both the \"hard\" and the \"soft\" aspects of these areas.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Conference on Function Spaces will take place at the Edwardsville campus of Southern Illinois University between May 16 and May 20 of 2006. The function spaces is a very active research area, it attracts mathematicians with very diverse interests who use similar methods or similar ideas in variety of different settings. The Conference will have abroad impact on a significant number of mathematicians by providing a forum (i) to exchange ideas between experts, (ii) to share new discoveries, and (iii) to educated graduate students. We expect that the Conference will attract 120-150 participants, a significant part of whom will be graduate students; approximately one third of the participants will be from the Midwestern states, one third from other parts of the U.S., and the remaining one third from foreign countries; the contributors will deliver 60-80lectures, and the proceedings will be published in the American Mathematical Society series Contemporary Mathematics. More information about the meeting is available on-line at: http://www.siue.edu/MATH/conference2006/.   \r\n\r\n\r\n",
