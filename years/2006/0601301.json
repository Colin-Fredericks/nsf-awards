To meet these requirements, motor control techniques have been developed that rely upon estimates of magnetic flux to optimize machine performance. However, these advanced methods use external measurements of current, voltage and rotor position to control electric motors and generators. This research will develop a fundamentally new method of designing and operating electric motors and generators by embedding magnetic field micro-electromechanical sensors (MEMS) in the rotor and stator elements.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The embedded MEMS devices will provide a direct measurement of flux levels used by advanced motor control algorithms for optimized motor and generator operation. This research includes the development of a MEMS device with wireless radio frequency communication suitable for operating inside rotating electrical machinery. Power for the sensors will be obtained from the ambient field variations present inside the electric machine. The research will focus on machine structures and sensor placement that provides sufficient accuracy in estimating the Maxwell stress tensor during machine operation. Beyond improvements during operation, the MEMS flux sensors will be sufficiently small to aid in the design and validation of electrical machinery by providing operational data at a level of detail not previously available with conventional magnetic instrumentation. A 25 kW prototype motor will be developed to confirm the theoretical work. Broader Impacts: This motor will be incorporated into the University of Arkansas solar boat entry of the ASME International Solar Splash collegiate competition. This provides undergraduate students with hands-on experience in advanced energy conversion technologies. This also demonstrates in a tangible manner to students the continuing innovation in electrical energy conversion technology.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
