 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop nanoelectronic power generators for wireless sensors and active RFID tags. These devices need long lasting power supplies that can harvest energy from the environment to enable a truly autonomous operation. The objective of this research is to demonstrate a power harvesting technology that is significantly improved due to the introduction of nanostructured materials. The technology will be based on the innovative deposition of nanoelectronics that is applicable to practical devices. Selected structures will be tested at the small device level to obtain the most realistic performance estimates. The cost of the generators will also be estimated based on the experimental results.\r\n\r\nEnergy harvesting devices can be used for applications that need small quantities of power for long times. These include wireless sensors and active RFID tags. The proposed technology will demonstrate a lower-cost and practical alternative to established methods for the deposition of nanostructured materials. It can help to provide compact, cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and long lasting power supplies for wireless sensor networks or other applications. It can be an alternative to established solar, thermal, or vibration harvesting approaches.\r\n",
