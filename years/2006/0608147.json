 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conservation biology is a field that relies upon the knowledge and tools of many disciplines to preserve biodiversity. This goal is best achieved by studies that consider both the ecological and evolutionary aspects of population viability.  Integrative studies of this type are especially important in combating the rapid, global declines of amphibians. Using endangered Panamanian golden frogs as a model system, a combination of demographic, morphological, ecological and genetic analyses will be used to identify not only the demographic factors, but also the evolutionary processes that affect sustainability in these species. \r\n\r\nSuch knowledge will facilitate the development of conservation plans poised to effectively preserve the functionality of these critical processes and hence, promote the long-term viability of golden frog populations. A comprehensive report will be submitted to the Panamanian environmental authority with recommendations for a management strategy for these frogs. By training Panamanian and North American undergraduates as field researchers, international research partnerships will be established, contributing to the training of tropical biologists, and encouraging Panamanian citizens to invest in conserving their native fauna.\r\n",
