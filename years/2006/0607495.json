Towards this end, a 2-dimensional dynamical structure\r\nand evolution code is being constructed which incorporates the interaction between largescale\r\nmagnetic fields and flows. The effects of small scale fields and flows are also\r\nmodeled through turbulence closure. Here the PI will continue developing the core\r\nnumerical algorithm (which is already producing results concerning the dynamics of the\r\nsolar radiative region) and testing the closure model (which has been successfully tested\r\nagainst experimental data for rotating shear flows). Specific tasks to be undertaken\r\ninclude: 1) Developing computational methods to extrapolate numerical results to solar\r\nvalues of the various diffusion parameters and testing them against solar observations. 2)\r\nFurther improving and extending the existing closure model to take into account turbulent\r\nenergy transport and testing the model predictions against 3D numerical simulations of\r\nrotating convection. And 3) combining the radiative zone model with the turbulence\r\nclosure model to obtain a complete numerical algorithm designed to study the magnetohydrodynamics\r\nof the interior of a solar type star, and obtaining qualitative results for a\r\nvariety of stellar parameters (structure, internal field strength, rotation rate). Future\r\nplanned work will then investigate in turn: the stability of the models obtained to various\r\nkinds of axially symmetric and non-axially symmetric instabilities; the dynamical\r\nbehavior of the model with respect to the generation of a magnetic cycle; and the careful\r\nquantitative comparison with existing data from various sources (e.g. asteroseismology,\r\nDoppler Imaging, Mount Wilson Ca-line survey).\r\nThe modeling approach being developed will include geometric aspects of the dynamics\r\n(missing from 1D models) without the heavy computational load of 3D models. Thus the\r\nwork here will be of value to many other areas of astronomy - particularly\r\nasteroseismology and studies of the solar interior where the sophistication of the\r\nobservations now demand better models. Therefore, once fully developed, these tools will\r\nbe made available to the astronomical community. This work also supports a graduate\r\nstudent who will be trained in numerical magnetohydrodynamic modeling and\r\ninterpreting/comparing these results with observations.",
