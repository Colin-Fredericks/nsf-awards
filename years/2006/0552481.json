 "awd_abstract_narration": "Giant Screen Films is planning the development of a large-format film and related educational materials to educate the public about the vast transformations Earth has endured through the ages, the causes and effects of cyclical icing, and current Earth Systems science research.  The strategic impact of the full project, entitled \"The Ice Age,\" is to provide a stimulating resource to supplement existing programs centered on public understanding of our planet's long-term climate changes.  The goal of the proposed planning phase is to develop a shooting script that effectively integrates the wide array of scientific disciplines around this topic in an engaging manner and to craft a detailed plan for an innovative array of outreach efforts to engage informal learners and underserved audiences.  The work is informed by a group of expert scientists, including Dr. Maureen Raymo, Dr. Larry Agenbroad, Dr. Todd Hinkley, and Dr. Richard Alley, among others,  and by front-end evaluations conducted by Learning Experience Design.  David Clark is film director; Mike Parfit, writer.  The National Ice Core Lab, the Joint Oceanographic Institutions, and The Mammoth Site will collaborate with the project.  \r\n\r\n",
