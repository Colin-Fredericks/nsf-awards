 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algebraic Approaches to Flow and Cycle Conjectures for Graphs.\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nThis proposed project will focus on applying certain algebraic ideas in an\r\nattempt to prove the major open conjectures about flows and cycle covers\r\nin graphs. The ultimate goal is to prove all of the major open conjectures\r\nabout flows and cycle covers in graphs, while the realistic expectation is\r\nto produce plenty of good mathematics in the attempt. Two big conjectures\r\nin this area are Tutte's 5-flow conjecture (T5FC) and the Cycle Double\r\nCover Conjecture (CDCC) of Szekeres and various strengthenings of CDCC,\r\nincluding the Orientable Five Cycle Double Cover Conjecture (O5CDCC) of\r\nArchdeacon and Jaeger, which implies both T5FC and CDCC and many other\r\nstrengthenings of CDCC. These in turn are all implied by the PI's\r\nPetersen-or-K_4 Flow Conjecture (P10vK4FC), the proof of which is the\r\nultimate goal of the proposed project.\r\n\r\nThese conjectures, which are very well known to graph theorists,\r\nespecially T5FC and CDCC, are in the same family of mathematical problems\r\nas the Four Color Theorem (4CT) which is even much more widely known to\r\nmathematicians and the general public. Most research on these problems\r\ndepends primarily on combinatorial graph theoretic techniques. The novelty\r\nof the PI's approach is to apply many algebraic, as well as topological,\r\nideas in addition to all the usual combinatorial graph theoretic ones.\r\n\r\n",
