 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to convene a two-day meeting to discuss the state and future direction of biocultural research in physical anthropology.  The specific objectives include:  1) To bring together a diverse set of scholars to survey the range of biocultural approaches currently in practice; 2) To explore the potential contribution of recent theoretical and methodological advances in biocultural anthropology, as well as ecology and evolutionary biology; and 3) To define an agenda for advancing biocultural research within physical anthropology.  After the meeting the organizers will publish a series of summary position statements that will encourage further dialogue on the state and future of biocultural research.  A holistic approach to understanding human diversity and human origins has been a foundational contribution of anthropology, and a strong tradition of biocultural research continues to exist despite current trends toward specialization and divergence between biological and cultural anthropology.  This meeting will contribute to defining the cutting edge of integrative physical anthropology, and will facilitate the development of complex models for understanding human behavior, physiology, and health, and the application of innovative methods for measuring biology in relation to cultural end ecological contexts.  Broader impacts include contributions to developing the infrastructure of science, particularly through the inclusion of a diverse set of scholars, many of whom represent groups historically under-represented in science.  \r\n\r\n",
