 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI plans to work on three related projects involving the combinatorics\r\nof Macdonald polynomials and the space of diagonal harmonics.  The first\r\nis an attempt\r\nto build on recent joint work between Haiman, Loehr and the PI which gives a\r\ncombinatorial formula for type A nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials.\r\nThe existence of this formula in the type A setting suggests that similar\r\nformulas exist for other root systems; the discovery of such formulas\r\nwould open up the subject significantly, as very few explicit identities of\r\nany kind have been discovered beyond the type A case.  The second project\r\nattempts to build on\r\nthe combinatorial formula for (type A) symmetric Macdonald polynomials,\r\nwhich was discovered empirically by the PI and proved in subsequent joint\r\nwork\r\nwith Haiman and Loehr.  The main open problem in this regard is to find\r\na combinatorial formula for the coefficients in the\r\nSchur expansion; as a step in this direction\r\nthe PI describes a new conjectured formula for the special case of\r\naugmented hook shapes.\r\nThe third project involves trying to prove a conjectured\r\nformula for the monomial expansion of the\r\ncharacter of the space of diagonal harmonics, due to Haiman, Loehr, Remmel,\r\nUlyanov and the PI.  This conjecture,\r\nwhich led the PI to the empirical formula for symmetric\r\nMacdonald polynomials mentioned above,\r\nhas a number of implications to enumerative combinatorics and\r\nrepresentation theory.\r\n\r\nOrthogonal polynomials are families of polynomials which satisfy an\r\northogonality condition, typically meaning that the integral of any\r\ntwo different elements of the family,\r\nagainst some given weight function, is zero.\r\nThe study of orthogonal polynomials is several centuries old,\r\nand they have quite a number of applications throughout mathematics and\r\nscience.\r\nSymmetric functions are polynomials in several variables which are\r\ninvariant under any permutation of the variables.  They have a large number\r\nof applications to several branches of mathematics such as representation\r\ntheory and\r\nthe roots of polynomial equations.\r\nIn 1988 Macdonald introduced a new family of orthogonal polynomials,\r\nwhich depend on a set of variables X and two extra parameters q,t.  They are\r\nsymmetric functions in the variables X, and\r\ncontain most useful symmetric functions as special cases.\r\nThey were immediately recognized as being important to several area of\r\nmathematics\r\nincluding combinatorics and special functions.\r\nIn 2000 Haiman proved they have a complicated interpretation in terms of\r\nan advanced,\r\nabstract and theoretical branch of\r\nmathematics known as algebraic geometry.\r\nMacdonald's construction is indirect however, and neither it nor\r\nHaiman's interpretation\r\ngive a way of easily describing these polynomials.\r\nRecently the PI discovered, and with Haiman and Loehr proved, a simple\r\ncombinatorial formula for Macdonald's polynomials.  The PI is trying to\r\napply this result to answer some of the open questions surrounding them.\r\nMacdonald and Cherednik now have a much more general construction which\r\ncontains almost all\r\npreviously studied symmetric functions and orthogonal polynomials as\r\nspecial cases.\r\nThe PI, in collaboration with Haiman, is trying to extend the\r\nsimple combinatorial formula to this more general construction.\r\n",
