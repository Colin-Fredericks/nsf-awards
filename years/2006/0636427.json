 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop and deploy educational modules on a specific\r\nform of CyberInfrastructure (CI), statewide across an EPSCoR state\r\n(Oklahoma), regionally among several EPSCoR and non-EPSCoR states, and\r\nnationally, targeted initially at scalable bioinformatics education and\r\nresearch efforts, but also accessible and applicable to education and\r\nresearch across all science and engineering disciplines. By leveraging\r\nexisting CI and bioinformatics software technologies (Condor and\r\nBLAST), as well as PCs that are already in service for desktop use,\r\nthis CI-TEAM project will: enable CI education and research; train\r\ntechnicians in CI deployment, configuration and management; enable\r\nbioinformatics education and research by providing BLAST over Condor;\r\nenable education and research across the full spectrum of science and\r\nengineering. This project will use BLAST as a kickstart application, to\r\nengage the interest of potential additional collaborators. In addition,\r\nthis project will support a large number of projects unrelated to\r\nBLAST, including microarray data analysis, statistical inference,\r\nphylogenetics, computational evolution, genomic and proteomic bioarray\r\nanalysis, genetic algorithms, brain region modeling, high performance\r\nnetworking, high energy physics, cyberinfrastructure development and\r\ndeployment, nanotechnology, heat transport, flood forecasting, weather\r\nradar data mining and analysis, robot learning, scientific data\r\nrepresentation, distributed scheduling, unfolding neutron spectra,\r\ngravity simulation, laser tweezer manipulation. \r\n\r\nThis project will advance discovery and understanding in Grid computing, bioinformatics and a wide variety of other disciplines. It will broaden participation by including participants from minority serving, high school, 2-year, 4-year, Masters-granting and PhD-granting institutions, most of them in EPSCoR states. The Condor pool will enhance infrastructure by providing resources to dozens of scientists at the participating institutions. Dissemination will include the University of Oklahoma's annual Oklahoma Supercomputing Symposium, which attracts hundreds of academic, government and industry representatives from over a dozen states; the project team will also give talks at other conferences and will establish a website. Education will be enhanced not only by the Condor and BLAST education modules, but also because several of the research projects that will use the Condor flock have substantial education components, and some are entirely focused on education.\r\n",
