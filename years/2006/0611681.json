 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerical computations in multiple space dimensions have traditionally been \r\nbased on structured grids (e.g. finite differences or spectral methods) or \r\non unstructured grids (e.g. finite elements). Even in the latter case, \r\nthere is structure in the sense that one needs to work out which subsets of \r\nnodes should be connected into local triangles, tetrahedra, etc. Aspects \r\nassociated with such grid generations can at times consume as much or even \r\nmore computer resources than do the subsequent computations on the grid. \r\nFurthermore, it has been all but impossible to achieve high (spectral) \r\ncomputational accuracy on such grids without resorting to extensive use of \r\ndomain decompositions. Numerous mesh-free methods have been proposed \r\nrecently. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) approach stands out in several \r\nrespects, most notably in that it generalizes traditional spectral methods \r\nto entirely mesh-free settings. Furthermore, implementations are usually \r\nremarkably simple. For example, 20-30 lines of Matlab typically suffices \r\nfor solving an elliptic PDE on an irregular 3-D domain, to spectral \r\naccuracy. Both pseudospectral (PS) methods and RBFs were first proposed in \r\nthe early 1970's. The superior performance of PS methods for solving many \r\nPDEs was demonstrated early on. A NSF proposal by the present investigator \r\nabout 5 years ago was the first time RBFs were presented  in terms of being \r\na direct replacement for the traditional basis functions in PS methods. \r\nRecently, significant progress has been made both on overcoming the high \r\ncomputer cost and the numerical ill-conditioning that earlier were thought \r\nto severely limit the RBF approach. Recent NSF-DMS supported work by the \r\npresent investigator has opened up numerous further opportunities in this \r\narea, which will now be pursued. These include combining spectral accuracy \r\nwith local node clustering in a fully stable way, a new stable algorithm in \r\nthe extremely high accuracy flat basis function limit, developments towards \r\nfaster algorithms, and the application of RBFs to PDEs in the geometries \r\nthat are most relevant in astro/geophysics, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the last several decades, computational methods have become an \r\nincreasingly essential part of how science and engineering are conducted, \r\npartly because of a rapid evolution of computer hardware, but equally much \r\nthanks to improvements in computational algorithms. Very often, the task to \r\nbe solved, when formulated in mathematical terms, require the solution of \r\npartial differential equations (PDEs), often in irregularly shaped regions \r\nin several space dimensions. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) methodology, \r\nwhich is the subject of the present grant, opens entirely new opportunities \r\nin this regard, combining very high accuracy with unsurpassed geometric \r\nflexibility. One of several application areas of particular interest \r\n(pursued in collaboration with scientists at NCAR and NOAA) concerns \r\ngeophysical and astrophysical modeling in spherical geometries, which are \r\ncritical issues for effective climate modeling and for studies of solar \r\ndynamics.\r\n\r\n",
