This method, reduced to practice by Hipps, provides fundamental electronic structure information about single molecules adsorbed on solid surfaces.  Phthalocyanines, porphyrins, and polyacenes adsorbed on metal and semiconductor substrates are being examined.  Such site specific molecular level information is crucial to developing an understanding of the operation, and the development of the design principles for, organic electronic devices.  This research project provides an excellent training platform for students interested in this important interdisciplinary area. \r\n\r\nResearchers in the Hipps group at Washington State University are using a novel technique known as Orbital Mediated Tunneling Spectroscopy to examine the electronic properties of adsorbed organic molecules one molecule at a time.  The fundamental information gained from these studies will help to design the next generation of molecular electronic devices.  This interdisciplinary work also serves as an excellent training ground for a broad range of graduate and undergraduate students. \r\n\r\n",
