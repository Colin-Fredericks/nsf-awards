This shrinking of system size accompanied by growth in functionality creates a critical situation where projected heat fluxes for high performance electronic systems are escalating beyond the capabilities of current thermal management techniques. Thermal issues are now critical at all levels of the electronic product hierarchy, from the chip to the system, resulting in a significant interest in ultra-compact high heat removal thermal management approaches. New and innovative thermal management techniques which will allow the development of next generation electronic equipment need to be systematically investigated. Recent advances in microscale thermal systems and progress in the understanding of nanoscale thermal transport hold promise and must be carefully scrutinized. THERMES 2007 will provide a unique opportunity for the community to focus on these thermal challenges to the electronics industry, an area that is fast becoming the leading obstacle to the continued growth of this trillion dollar industry.\r\nIntellectual Merit:  THERMES 2007 is a workshop/conference which will focus on two main themes in electronics cooling: a discussion of the expected future demands in the next 10-15 years on thermal management systems and the many possible solutions to these increased demands and the dissemination of the significant advances in thermal management and characterization schemes which have been developed and implemented in the five years since the highly successful initial THERMES conference. Invited talks in selected emerging areas will be complemented with contributed papers from both industrial and academic researchers. Numerous panel discussions focusing on technology, market trends and identification of research challenges will enable highly interactive discussions. The conference is expected to well-attended, drawing leaders in the field from both industry and academics.\r\nBroader Impact:  Support from the National Science Foundation will subsidize the participation expenses primarily of graduate and undergraduate students who will be presenting papers and of early career and under-represented faculty. Student participation and attendance at this conference will expose them to the issues at the leading edge of thermal management technology and allow them to interact with both industrial and academic leaders in the field. This interaction will provide background and knowledge that classes could not duplicate. As we anticipate that many of these students will enter the field of thermal management and lead the next generation of technology development, we hope that their attendance at this conference will kick-off their life-long participation at the leading edge of research and that the broader impacts of their participation on the enhancement and development of the U.S. knowledge-based workforce will be immeasurable.\r\n",
