 "awd_abstract_narration": "(1) This project will focus on certain geometric questions from classical \r\nanalysis which have their origins in the well-known Kakeya problem: find \r\nthe minimum dimension of a subset of d-dimensional space which contains a \r\nline segment in each direction. Of particular interest to the p.i. are \r\nestimates from below for the Hausdorff dimension of sets which have large \r\nintersections with certain collections of lines, planes, or spheres (or, in higher \r\ndimensions, with certain collections of k-planes or hyperspheres). A theme of this work \r\nwill be to explore the scope and limitations of a particular method, due \r\nto the p.i., for treating the averaging operators which arise in the study of \r\nthese problems. \r\n\r\n\r\n(2) This project is concerned with the structure of certain complicated \r\nsubsets of higher dimensional spaces. The study of these sets, while of \r\ncompelling intrinsic interest, should properly be viewed as a test of our \r\ncurrent understanding of certain objects called averaging operators. The \r\nrelevant averaging operators here are of two kinds: spherical averaging \r\noperators and Radon transforms. Spherical averaging operators are basic to \r\nour understanding of the propagation of waves through fluid media such as \r\nthe ocean or the atmosphere. The Radon transform and its relatives are \r\nessential, for example, in problems of tomography such as those which \r\narise in the field of medical imaging. \r\n\r\n",
