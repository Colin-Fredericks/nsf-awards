 "awd_abstract_narration": "GaAs MOSFETs with Ultrathin Atomic Layer Deposited (ALD) High-k Gate Dielectrics\r\n\r\nPeide Ye, Purdue University and James Hwang, Lehigh University\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research includes GaAs metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistors and complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor integrated circuit technology based on these transistors. The approach is mainly based on Al2O3 gate insulator formed by atomic layer deposition.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research includes the requirement to strengthen the fundamental scientific understanding and engineering foundations of dielectrics formed by atomic layer deposition on compound semiconductors, as well as novel device structures and processes of GaAs metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistors for digital applications. Different conditions for surface preparation, growth initiation, atomic layer deposition, and post-deposition annealing of Al2O3 and Ga2O3 on GaAs will be investigated. Detailed material characterization techniques such as Rutherford backscattering, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and atomic-force microscopy will be used to understand the deposition process and the resulted nanostructure, including the interface between the insulator and the semiconductor.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts resulting from this research include continued scaling of the integrated circuit technology toward smaller size, faster speed, and more sophisticated functionality. The PI and co-PI are committed to integrated research and education. Special efforts will be made to recruit underrepresented groups to participate in this research. An educational program for high school and undergraduate students will be developed as part of a virtual nano- and bio-devices analysis lab that will be available through World-Wide Web. The protocols developed will be also included as part of the NSF-supported Nano-Hub Network at Purdue.\r\n",
