A p-n junction is traditionally formed by diffusion or implantation of a dopant into a semiconductor. The approach in this proposal does not involve any dopant, but atomic-scale engineering of a semiconductor surface to eliminate surface states. When a metal with a low work function is in contact with a p-type semiconductor of this kind, its surface is turned into the opposite type and a p-n junction is formed without doping.\r\nA p-n junction is an indispensable part in most modern semiconductor devices, which are the building blocks in the information technology. This research could fundamentally change the way semiconductor devices are fabricated today and enable new semiconductor devices with unprecedented features. A Small Business Innovation Research Phase I proposal has been submitted to apply this technique for energy-efficient manufacturing of semiconductor devices. Preliminary results suggest that such a doping-free p-n junction is possible. The research activities proposed include characterization and understanding of doping-free p-n junctions and methodology for demonstrating a negative Schottky barrier.\r\nThe educational activities proposed include curriculum development by the principal investigator, student participation in this research, and services to semiconductor industry. The proposal describes a detailed plan for these activities, including incorporation of results from this project to the electrical engineering curriculum; a book chapter on this subject as supplemental reading materials for students; supervision of PhD, MS, and undergraduate students' research, with a special effort to recruit undergraduate students, many of whom are from underrepresented groups; and contribution to economic development of the community through university-industry collaborations.\r\n",
