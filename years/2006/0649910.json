It has served as a theoretical basis for the development of new technologies and has stimulated many new research interests in applied mathematics. Analytical and computational techniques developed in nonlinear mechanics have often and successfully been applied to engineering systems. Since the ICNM-IV held in Shanghai, 2002, the nonlinear mechanics has been experiencing further rich and varied advances, in particular in the areas of material technology, micro-and nano-technology, and biotechnology. The Fifth International Conference on Nonlinear Mechanics (ICNM-V) will be held under the auspices of IUTAM Bureau in Shanghai, China from June 11-14, 2007. The conference aims to provide a forum to bring scientists all over the world to present their latest research results and to enhance academic exchanges. They will discuss and share developments and innovations in nonlinear mechanics. The conference scope will cover many topics in modern mechanics, including nonlinear continuum mechanics, micro- and nano-mechanics, multi-scale modeling, defects in materials, phase transitions and microstructure evolution\r\nin materials, structure-fluid interaction, and engineering applications.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe research on nonlinear mechanics will have significant impacts on many engineering applications, including fluid turbulence, micro- and nano-fluidics, biomechanics, damage and fracture mechanics. China now is among the world fastest economical growth regions. It is expected that the ICNM-V will provide a direct platform for American researchers to exchange ideas on nonlinear mechanics with scientists from the world and to foster collaborations with Chinese scholars. \r\n\r\n",
