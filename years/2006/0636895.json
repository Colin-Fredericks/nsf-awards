 "awd_abstract_narration": "Applications for computer simulations include many research areas such as weather prediction, tracking the location and concentrations of contaminants in groundwater, oil recovery, studying disease processes, designing experiments, and developing medications.  In these and several other applications, it is desirable to achieve speedup of numerical code.  Current work in speeding up numerical simulations has several disadvantages.  Considering the various disadvantages of each method, project will develop methods that increases the speed and (1) does not require rewriting an existing algorithm, although could be improved even further by making minor coding modification, (2) does not require algorithms written in traditional languages to be rewritten in other language, (3) executes portions of the code in parallel but does not suffer from the overhead of either a single microprocessor or multi-processor architecture, and (4)does not require time and effort to engineer and implement a special circuit for different types of numerical algorithms.  This work proposes to develop such a technology using flowpaths where, starting with a C (or potentially FORTRAN) description of a numerical algorithm,  a compiler will generate an executable that can be downloaded and will run on the Power PC embedded in an FPGA with parallel flowpaths to speedup the bottleneck loops in the numerical algorithm  automatically.  \r\n\r\nWith such a speed-up, some simulations that require real-time execution that can not currently be achieved by a PC will be able to run at a higher speed and achieve a real-time pace.  The success of this research will result in future investigation including deriving optimizations for the compiler and resulting circuits, improving numerical schemes for optimal implementation in hardware and enhancing the compiler to support other popular languages.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research project from a scientific computational standpoint lies in the discovery of new coding techniques that make optimal use of flowpaths in order to achieve higher simulation speeds.  The intellectual merit in hardware design for speedup lies in the unique use of flowpaths for creating special-purpose processors for new and existing numerical code, automatically.  This project serves as a novel interdisciplinary approach, combining expertise in scientific computation of numerical algorithms and high-speed embedded systems for significantly increasing the performance of numerical code, with impact both in software as well as in hardware technologies.\r\n",
