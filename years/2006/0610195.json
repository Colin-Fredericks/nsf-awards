 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tami Lasseter Clare, Philadelphia Museum of Art, is a Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellow for the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 academic years. Dr. Clare's research will focus on developing nanostructured, super-hydrophobic, protective coatings for use in the field of art conservation, specifically coatings for metallic art, such as bronze sculptures.  The project also includes designing and implementing a workshop based on chemistry and art for high school students, particularly the highly diverse student population in the Philadelphia public schools.  \r\n\r\nThis Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.",
