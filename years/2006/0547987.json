 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER focuses on advancing theory and practice in the design, modeling, and control of low-field magnetic resonance experiments. The research will lead to practical methods for increasing the sensitivity of low-field magnetic resonance experiments and a deeper understanding of the information that can be gained about samples in low fields. The theory and applications of low-field magnetic resonance will be investigated through nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR). The key innovative claims of the research are 1) the project will demonstrate that the effective strength of the dipolar coupling between a spin-1 nucleus and a spin-1/2 nucleus, which is normally quenched at zero magnetic field, can be increased significantly under various types of resonance conditions and 2) multi-pulse sequences, which continually refocus the signal from a sample, serve not only to increase the detection sensitivity in NQR, but also to probe the internal magnetic and electric fields. The educational objectives are to integrate experimental research methodologies and demonstrations into the physics teaching curriculum and to increase the participation of women in the sciences.  This latter will be fostered through a mentorship program for female high school students in the summer and through the establishment of a networking group for women in the sciences to expose female undergraduates to the experiences of women engaged in science-related careers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) is a type radio-frequency spectroscopy, which can serve as a very useful tool to probe the local electric and magnetic environment of a quadrupole nucleus, for example nitrogen.  Because of the abundance of nitrogen in many explosive substances, NQR can also serve to detect explosives.  One of the main hindrances to the widespread use of NQR, both as a diagnostic and a detection tool, is the low signal-to-noise ratio of the technique.  A straightforward solution for this problem is the averaging over repeated data acquisitions.  Unfortunately, for many samples of interest, the necessary wait time between acquisitions is prohibitively lengthy.  For example, in ammonium nitrate, a typical fertilizer bomb material, this wait time is on the order of a quarter of a minute.  One of the reasons that this wait time can be lengthy is that magnetic dipolar coupling between unlike nuclei, for instance between hydrogen and nitrogen, is quenched, or essentially turned off, at zero field.   By applying a combination of small static and radio-frequency magnetic fields, we can match the Zeeman resonance frequency of the hydrogen atom to the NQR frequency of the nitrogen atom, resulting in increased cross-polarization between the two nuclear species.  We have found for ammonium nitrate that we can decrease the wait time by a factor of ten using cross-polarization under such double-resonance conditions.\n\nFurthermore, we have found, both theoretically and experimentally that the cross-polarization time is relatively fast, on the order of 10 milliseconds for ammonium nitrate, and so the magnetic field can be swiftly swept through the correct double-resonance condition.  Therefore, the homogeneity requirements on the field are not strict and the implementation of the method is relatively simple.  The faster detection of explosives is important for the safeguarding of our society on many fronts.\n\nAnother method of increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in NQR detection is to apply a series of closely spaced excitation pulses, which permit echoes of the original signal to appear, thus extending the signal out in time.   We found that the amplitude of these spin echoes depend not only on the characteristics of the excitation pulse (frequency, strength, shape, repetition rate), but also on the physical mechanisms that determine the inherent linewidth of the sample.   Therefore the optimal echo excitation sequence is very sample dependent; our work permits the scientific design of the echo sequences tailored to the particular substance of interest.\n\nOne of the surprising results of our NQR spin-echo research is that under select pulsing conditions, there emerges a rapid decay of the echo train; the time constant of this decay reveals the strength of the magnetic dipolar coupling between like quadrupole nuclei.  The strength of the dipolar coupling depends strongly on the structure of the material, in particular the distance between nuclei.  Therefore, the easy measurement of the dipolar coupling is significant for obtaining structural information. \n\nSuch information can also be found using conventional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), but quadrupole nuclei are often difficult to detect using NMR because their interaction with the local electric field gradient broadens their linewidth, making them difficult to measure.  Nuclear quadrupole resonance instead takes advantage of this nuclear quadrupole interaction, but historically has been limited as a materials characterization tool due to the difficulty of working with a single crystal and the obscuring nature of working with a powder sample.  In contrast, our new way of measuring dipolar coupling is valid for a powder sample, thus making this technique very versatile.  Furthermore, knowing the strength of the dipolar coupling is essential for optimizing detection pulse sequences, as this coupling is one of the principle contributors to the inherent linewidth of the sam..."
