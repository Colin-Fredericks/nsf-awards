 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator intends to study problems from the theory of local\r\ncohomology that arise in interacting areas of algebraic geometry,\r\ncommutative algebra, and through combinatorial aspects of the theory\r\nof partial differential equations.  These problems include questions\r\nthat relate to structural properties of rings and modules, as well as\r\nthose aimed at obtaining quantitative results. A common link to the\r\nproposed study is local cohomology, a concept that ties together\r\nalgebraic geometry, D-module theory, and commutative algebra. The\r\ninvestigator will specifically explore the interaction of certain\r\nnon-vanishing local modules with the structure of the solutions of\r\nA-hypergeometric systems, with a view towards jump phenomena. A\r\nrelated study is aimed at understanding the Bernstein--Sato polynomial\r\nand jump loci of local systems along hyperplane arrangements. In a\r\ndifferent direction, the investigator will study a basic question of\r\nLyubeznik addressing finiteness properties of local cohomology.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a computer-aided project in the mathematical area known as\r\nalgebraic geometry. During the 20-th century, algebraic geometry has\r\nchanged its nature from analytic geometry into a much more complex\r\nscience. The result is a complicated but powerful method for studying\r\ncurves, surfaces and other geometric objects defined by\r\npolynomials. This modern approach to geometry allows mathematicians to\r\nuse geometric techniques and intuition in many other situations,\r\nincluding (but not restricted to) robot motion planning, computer\r\nvision, statistics, and computer security. The methods used in\r\nalgebraic geometry are of a very wide range. The investigator's work\r\nconcentrates on the applications of differential calculus and computer\r\npower to the subject, thus combining geometry, algebra, calculus and\r\nmodern technology in his work. As he continues to uncover the\r\ninterplay of these objects by theoretical and computational means,\r\nalgebraic geometry is becoming ever more valuable as a tool in other\r\nparts of mathematics, physics and engineering.\r\n",
