In the case of compilers, although much progress has been made, there are still a vast number of open problems with solutions that may have dramatic economic impact.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThe PI requests funds to support the organization of a workshop that will congregate some of the leading researchers in compiler technology to define an agenda for compiler research in the next decade. The main goal of the workshop will be to identify the great challenges and opportunities that our times present to compiler technology and assess the likelihood of success. \r\nSome areas of discussion will be:\r\n-Program optimization strategies\r\n-Compiler support for parallelism.\r\n-Compiler analysis for correctness\r\n\r\nThe final outcome of the workshop will be a report to the National Science Foundation and a paper that the workshop organizers will write and expect to publish in a widely read magazine such as IEEE Computer or the Communications of the ACM. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\n-Workshop participants. We expect to congregate a few of the leading researchers\r\nand practitioners in the area of compilers mainly from the US, but will also like to\r\ninvite a few, probably three or four, international researchers. We will make the\r\nnecessary effort to distribute participants across generations, gender, race and\r\ngeographical origin within the US. \r\n-Contributions from the community at large. We plan to request contributions from the community at large in the form of white papers. The authors of white papers with the most interesting ideas will be invited to participate in the workshop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
