 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work here is motivated by the need for accurate physical properties of massive stars\r\nof varying metallicity in order to understand their evolution, star formation processes, and\r\nfeedback mechanisms into the interstellar medium. Of particular interest is temperature,\r\nwhich plays a key role in transforming observations (spectral type and photometry) into\r\nphysical properties (effective temperature, surface gravity, bolometric luminosity, radius,\r\nand inferred mass). In this project, an improvement of the effective temperature scales for\r\nboth hot (30,000 to 50,000K) main-sequence and cool (3,000 to 4000K) evolved (red\r\nsupergiant) massive stars will be undertaken This will be accomplished using high quality\r\noptical spectra (plus infrared photometry in the case of the cool giants) and the latest\r\ngeneration of stellar atmosphere models at both temperature extremes. Of particular\r\nimportance is that these calibrations will be developed as a function of metallicity and\r\ntherefore applicable to other studies of high mass stars throughout the local group.\r\nUndergraduate students will be involved in this work through the NSF sponsored\r\nResearch Experiences for Undergraduates and MIT Field Camp programs. The students\r\nwill be full collaborators and take part in data acquisition, analysis, writing, and the\r\npresentation of results at scientific meetings. This research will also be featured in public\r\ntalks given through the Lowell Observatory visitor program and at other venues. The data\r\ncollected here will also be made public once accepted for publication.",
