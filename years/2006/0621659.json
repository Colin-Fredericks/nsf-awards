The workshop addresses the field of ion exchange-- is a broadly applicable science that  relates to catalysis, drug delivery, sensors, bioseparation, membranes, ore beneficiation, metallurgy, food purification, polymer synthesis, inorganic materials, biorenewable energy, water treatment, environmental processes, nanotechnology and several others. The primary thrust of the workshop is to serve as a vibrant inter-disciplinary\r\nplatform for sharing new knowledge in the field of ion exchange by bringing together\r\nresearchers and professionals from diverse areas of science and engineering. Seven invited speakers have been identified from U.S. academic institutions as invited speakers/discussers for the workshop. The travel grant provides  partial\r\nfinancial support for the travel, lodging and registration of the seven invited U.S.\r\nspeakers.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe workshop will bring together researchers from academic institutions and industries, graduate students and postdoctoral scientists, and provocative scholars, in a setting that will promote cross-fertilization of ideas, thereby enriching seemingly disjointed professional areas. More specifically, the cross-disciplinary workshop will help:\r\n(1.) Provide the most recent developments and breakthroughs in diverse areas\r\nrelated to ion exchange; (2). Identify scientific hurdles in different areas and allow collective participation for\r\ntheir solution.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nKnowledge acquired by researchers from their counterparts in other areas may provide\r\nnecessary tools leading to innovation or discoveries in their own areas. For example, the\r\nmechanism of controlled drug delivery in the area of medicine may well be incorporated\r\nafter necessary modification for nutrient delivery for environmental remediation of\r\nhazardous waste sites. Post doctoral and graduate students will be appropriately\r\nexposed to other disciplines, thus offering them opportunities to move into other\r\nprofessional areas. It is also likely that the university professors will be inspired to teach\r\ncross-disciplinary courses in their own academic institutions. Specific industry-academic\r\nresearch opportunities are also likely to evolve from the workshop.\r\n\r\nThe 1414 program will provide $4,000, and the 1415 program will provide $3,000 to support this workshop all in FY 2006. \r\n\r\n",
