The idea is to make \r\ntopological models for the limit sets which could\r\narise in connection with deformations of surface\r\ngroups into Lie groups and then use the models\r\nto study actual deformations of surface groups into\r\nLie groups.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, Schwartz' research deals with\r\nthe geometry of infinite repeating patterns.\r\nA crystal lattice is an example of an infinite\r\nrepeating pattern in Euclidean space.  Analogous\r\npatterns exist in curved spaces, and often\r\nthe curvature of the space allows for the\r\nexistence of more exotic and geometrically rich patterns.\r\nSchwartz is interested in the studying these\r\nexotic patterns when they are generated by a simple\r\nmechanism which has a finite description.\r\nFor example, one can place several mirrors in\r\na curved space and look at the pattern generated\r\nby the images of an object which is reflected\r\nendlessly in the mirrors.\r\nThe central question is:  When does the finite\r\nmechanism of generation lead to an infinite\r\ndiscrete pattern? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
