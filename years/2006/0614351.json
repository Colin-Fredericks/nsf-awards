 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nMicrotubules (MTs) are key subcellular structures that are dynamic polymers of alpha- and beta-tubulins.  MTs  play a number of structural and motility-related roles that are critical for the survival of eukaryotic cells.  Eggs and embryos of the frog, Xenopus laevis, contain several microtubule (MT)-associated proteins (MAPs) that have been postulated to modulate MT organization and dynamics. One of these, XMAP215, is a member of the evolutionarily ancient MAP215/Dis1 family of MAPs required for MT organization and cell division in eukaryotes. XMAP215 promotes MT assembly and dynamics in vitro and antagonizes the destabilizing effects of the kinesin-family member XKCM1. Results from recent studies suggest that XMAP215 plays important roles in the structure and function of centrosomes and spindle poles, and thus in the organization and function of spindles during cell division.   XMAP215 is hyperphosphorylated during M-phase, and previous results demonstrated that XMAP215 activity is regulated by CDK1-dependent phosphorylation in vitro. However, the role of phosphorylation in regulating XMAP215 function, and thereby MT assembly and dynamics, in vivo has not been systematically studied. Computational predictions suggest that XMAP215 might be phosphorylated on as many as one hundred different sites. In this project, a variety of biochemical, biophysical and cell biological methods will be used to study the regulation of XMAP215 activity in vitro and in vivo by phosphorylation, focusing on the roles of three kinases known to regulate MT organization and the cell cycle: CDK1, Aurora A, and MARK. The following specific questions will be addressed: 1, is XMAP215 phosphorylated by CDK1, MARK, and/or Aurora A kinases in vivo? Mass spectroscopy will be used to map and sequence phosphopeptides of XMAP215M, providing the first \"inventory\"  of the sites phosphorylated on XMAP215 in cells; 2. does phosphorylation of the predicted CDK1 target sites in XMAP215 regulate MT binding and/or function in vivo? Site-directed mutagenesis will be used to probe the in vivo function of the two predicted CDK1 targets found in XMAP215, in Xenopus tissue culture cells, oocytes and embryos; 3, does phosphorylation by Aurora A modulate XMAP215 activity? A combination of in vitro phosphorylation, in vitro functional assays, and site-directed mutagenesis will be used to probe the role of Aurora A-dependent phosphorylation in regulating XMAP215 function in vitro and in vivo; and 4, does phosphorylation of the predicted MARK and/or Aurora A targets regulate XMAP215 centrosomal targeting and/or XMAP215 function in vivo? Site-directed mutagenesis will be used to probe the role of MARK and Aurora A-dependent phosphorylation in the targeting of XMAP215 to centrosomes and MTOCs in Xenopus tissue culture cells, oocytes and embryos. \r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT: Results from the experiments outlined above should answer a number of the outstanding questions regarding the regulation of XMAP215 by protein kinases and phosphorylation, and should provide a map of sites phosphorylated in vivo and functional analysis of the role those sites play in regulating XMAP215 localization and activity. This information will, in turn, provide new insight into how XMAP215, and other members of the evolutionally ancient MAP215/Dis1 family of microtubule-associated proteins, regulate MT assembly, organization, and function during the cell cycle and development. \r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT: The proposed project will benefit education and development of human resources by providing training and education for at least one graduate student, two or more undergraduate students, and one or more secondary school teachers (through the University of Utah College of Science's Masters of Science for Secondary School Teachers program).  Indirect educational benefits will also be provided through Dr. Gard's substantial contributions to undergraduate and graduate teaching and University outreach programs.\r\n\r\n",
