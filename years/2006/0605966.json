Our objective is to understand and solve outstanding physics problems that are both basic and essential to practical applications. We will explore the time dependence of magnetization reversal and the existence of intermediate switching modes, in a variety of nanostructures beneficial to theoretical modeling and application. We will also develop a spintronic metrology technique based on a nanoscale magnetic tunneling junction device. It is anticipated that our research will lead to both scientific understanding and potential applications. The research will benefit the high-tech industry by overcoming roadblocks that impede the evolution towards smaller, faster, and cost-effective devices. Nanoscale spintronics is important for the future competitiveness of the U.S. semiconductor industry. With the investment from NSF, we will train graduate and undergraduate students in the forefront areas of materials science.\r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\nThis project is expected to elucidate the micromagnetic properties of the magnetic/electronic nanostructures most relevant to spintronics, an emerging field that employs the spin degree of freedom to enable new and unique functions in electronics. Our goal is to explore the time dependence of magnetization reversal and the existence of intermediate switching modes, in a variety of nanostructures beneficial to theoretical modeling and application. We will also develop a spintronic metrology technique based on a nanoscale magnetic tunneling junction device that we will design and construct to possess high sensitivity, wide frequency response, and good thermal stability.
