 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for the development of a \"Genemeter,\" a portable or desktop device for rapidly detecting and quantifying arrays of specific DNA targets at low concentrations. This instrument will use Charge-Perturbation Detection (CPD). CPD involves electronic detection with operational amplifiers circuitry, which lends itself to miniaturization of the device. The goal is to develop a user-friendly device that can also be used by non-experts, for example, in high school educational activities. A desktop version of the device with a 6x6 array will be developed by integrating a replaceable 6x6 electrode array sensor and an automated, computer-controlled reagent dispensing system. Combined with a desktop PC containing the appropriate hardware and software for signal data acquisition, analysis and user interface, this system will lay the groundwork for a more portable system developed at a later stage. The label-free electronic detection method integrated into the proposed multiple-electrode system will provide rapid and sensitive detection of genetic mutations and identification of DNA sequences in a sample. The CPD detection system is predicted to be superior to comparable detection systems in terms of speed, sensitivity, and cost. This will be a robust and effective biosensor for many molecular research applications and will constitute a major breakthrough in DNA-based biosensor technology. \r\n\r\nThe Genemeter has the potential to profoundly influence the rapidly growing field of molecular diagnostics in both academic research and healthcare practice. Development of the Genemeter will be coupled with outreach in several ways.  Device prototypes will be tested in graduate and undergraduate molecular biology courses at the university and at local Community Colleges. This wider exposure of the instrument will give more students an opportunity to learn about molecular biology and how the integration of multiple research fields can produce exciting new technologies. In addition, some of the discoveries in genomics and proteomics will be vividly displayed to high school students through the integration of this low-cost Genemeter into laboratory curricula, cultivating their scientific interests and helping to ensure the vitality of the people-power pipelines needed for the nation's scientific enterprise.",
