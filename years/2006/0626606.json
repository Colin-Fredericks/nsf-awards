 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes novel algorithmic and combinatorial optimization research with the goal of developing efficient search engines for locating mobile information (mobiles)  in current and future wireless networks using a new paradigm of mobile directories. The mobile directories are composed of profiles that reflect certain and statistical knowledge about locations of mobiles under various conditions. When the network searches for a mobile, it applies the appropriate profile. The profiles could either be created by the network based on past history or be given by the users. In either case, the issue of mobiles' privacy level as a tradeoff for search efficiency will be explored. The project goals are to design efficient search strategies for given profiles, optimize the consumption of resources, and construct profiles that best predict the whereabouts of mobiles while maintaining some privacy requirements.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive solution for location management of mobile information (or users) in wireless networks is one of the major challenges for such networks for which advances in systems will not suffice to accommodate future demands and there will be a great need for advances in algorithms and implementations. Wireless systems that can answer sophisticated queries to find mobile information will benefit the networks and their users in times of emergency and peace. The developed search techniques can be beneficial to some Internet search engines when there is some uncertainty about where to find answers to queries. The project puts emphasis on the privacy preserving issue which is a paramount concern for mobile users.\r\n",
