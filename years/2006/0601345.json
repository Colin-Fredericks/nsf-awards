 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe objective of this research is to create a new type of biosensor with luminescence wavelength dependent on analyte concentration.  This fundamentally new type of biosensor will be analogous to the litmus paper pH test know for reliable and simplicity.  Analysis of biomolecules often carried out in turbid and heterogeneous media, such as tissue, causing strong fluctuations of intensity.  Wavelength transduction can be the only dependable method of sensing in such conditions.  The approach is to engineer such sensors from nanoparticles-nanowire superstructures connected by polyethylene glycole oligomers bound to an antibody.  Binding of a protein results in the change in the gap between the nanowire and nanoparticles, and therefore, in the change of the emission wavelength. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit of this project will be the (1) development of biosensors based on energy of emission (not intensity) and (2) understanding the rules of interactions between the nanoparticles and nanowires. \r\n\r\nBroader impact of this project is an enabling technology for the fields of microfluidics and biosensing, which will lead to the development of new potent drugs and new diagnostic tools.  The proposed devices will also help to carry out more sophisticated water quality control, and new tools for biomedical research.    Additionally, the project has educational efforts associated with the sensor research with middle/high school students and exposing them to the fascinating world of nanotechnology.  Both PIs have a long record of volunteer outreach work with K-12 students.\r\n",
