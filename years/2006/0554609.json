 "awd_abstract_narration": "South Dakota proposes a research infrastructure improvement project to\r\nstrengthen the state's research in Photo-Activated Nanoscale Systems (PANS).  PANS reflects the interface between nanotechnology and photo-active materials, an area that holds great promise for research development and commercial applications.  Two research components will be supported under this award: 1) third generation photovoltaic devices based on spectral conversion of solar radiation and 2) photo-active nano-inks for direct-write electronics fabrication.  The third generation photovoltaic research will focus on a new strategy for manipulating the solar spectrum to match  photovoltaic devices  as alternative sources of energy generation.  The photo-active nano-inks research is targeted on new electronic device fabrication by using nanoscale-based inks that are enabled by photo-active methods.  Both research areas are of interest to the federal government and private industry and lend themselves to commercial development. Participating universities include South Dakota State University (SDSU), University of South Dakota (USD), South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT), Black Hills State University (BHSU) and Sinte Gleska University (SGU).  Results of PANS research is expected to advance knowledge and development of alternative sources of energy generation, new electronic device fabrication and environmental protection and remediation.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the investments in scientific research, the project also includes significant investments into institutional infrastructure improvements at Sinte Gleska University, a tribal university.  Among several activities to strengthen the communications and research capacity at the university, this award will establish high-speed internet connections as well as an Access Grid that will enable research and educational interactions among SGU students and faculty with their colleagues across the state and the nation.  Other programs to stimulate and support the participation of Native American students will also be funded. Consistent with South Dakota's S&T Strategic Plan to establish the state as an innovation-driven economy, this award will also support a variety of programs to stimulate interactions among the universities and the private sector, enhance technology transfer and promote an entrepreneurial culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
