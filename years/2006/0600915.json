 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe theme of this proposal is the strong relationship that exists between \r\nthe questions of how the geometry of a domain can be recovered from the \r\nregularity of its harmonic measure, and free boundary regularity problems. \r\nRemarkably the analogies become more apparent when examined under a \r\ngeometric measure theory magnifying glass. The core of this proposal \r\naddresses the question of describing in detail the singular set of the \r\nfree boundary in problems which are similar to the optimal design question \r\ndescribed below. The PI and N. Wickramasekera propose to use tools from \r\ngeometric measure theory, which have been very successful in similar \r\nsituations in geometric analysis. They have remarked that Weiss' new \r\nmonotonicity formulas yield similar information to the one provided by the \r\nmonotonicity formulas for energy minimizing harmonic maps and area \r\nminimizing surfaces. The proposed program follows the schemes which have \r\nlead to the successful resolution of these 2 major problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo-phase free boundary regularity problems arise naturally in physics, \r\nchemistry and engineering. In optimal design and optimal control problems \r\nwithin the context of electrochemical machining with threshold current, \r\nthe surface between the anode and the electrolytic solution plays the role \r\nof the free boundary. In the symmetric plane flow model of jets with two \r\nfluids the outer jet is surrounded by air, so the flow region has two free \r\nboundaries: the boundary of the outer fluid and the boundary between the \r\ntwo fluids. The central problem of characterizing the regularity of the \r\nfree boundary has been studied by many authors. Over the last 3 years the \r\nPI and C. Kenig have studied the case in which one has information about \r\nthe ratio of the speeds of the two fluids at the free boundary. This \r\nquestion had not been addressed before. They found a global criteria which \r\nguarantees the regularity of the free boundary. One the themes of this \r\nproposal is the study of several free boundary regularity problems using \r\nthese new tools. The proposed research provides a different outlet for \r\ngeometric measure theory (GMT), a field of Mathematics that has \r\ncontributed greatly to the development of the calculus of variations and \r\ngeometric analysis. The success of the project would provide a road map \r\nfor a new generation interested in applying GMT techniques to more \r\nconcrete problems. An important feature of the proposed work is that, \r\nwhile some results have already been obtained, there is great potential \r\nfor expansion. In particular, we expect the active participation of \r\ngraduate students and junior mathematicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
