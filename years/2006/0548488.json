 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Divisions of Chemistry and Undergraduate Education, the Biological Sciences Directorate and the Office of Multidisciplinary Affairs jointly fund this award to the University of Colorado Boulder to conduct a study to quantify the benefits of the undergraduate research experience at research universities. The PI for this project is Sandra Laursen, who is assisted by Co-PIs Anne-Barrie Hunter, Elaine Seymour and Heather Smith. This work builds upon previous research by the same group, examining undergraduate research at predominately undergraduate institutions known for success with undergraduate research. The purpose of this study is to identify the structure of undergraduate research offerings in the sciences at a sampling of 10-12 public research universities, identifying the range and types of undergraduate research experiences at these institutions. The goal of this research is to develop a composite picture of undergraduate research as it is typically encountered by the majority of undergraduates in public research universities. This information will be useful to students in the STEM disciplines, the universities who provide facilities where the research is conducted and the agencies who provide funding for undergraduate research.",
