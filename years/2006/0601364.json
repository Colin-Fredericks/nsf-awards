 "awd_abstract_narration": "The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) continues a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site.  This REU Site has been in operation since 1992.  The theme of the proposed REU site is Biomolecular Science and Advanced Materials.  Ten to fifteen undergraduate students are recruited nationwide each year from the nations Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Institutions, and Tribal Colleges and Universities (HBCU/MI/TCUs) for a 10-week summer experience.  Research projects span many areas including (but not limited to) biosensor design and engineering, three-dimensional analysis of materials, development of high strength low alloy steels, bio-fuel cells and energy harvesting, and novel optical materials processing to generating wireless LAN packets.  The REU participants conduct research under the mentorship of researchers in the NRLs Center for Bio/Molecular Science and Engineering (CBMSE), the Materials Science and Technology Divisions (Multifunctional Materials Branch, Materials and Sensors Branch), Chemical Dynamics and Diagnostics Branch, and other Divisions at NRL.  In addition to participating in individual research projects, students are required to attend seminars (topics such as presentation skills, graduate school, job search skills, ethics training), participate in field trips to scientific research centers, and attend social activities.  At the conclusion of the summer research experience students must complete a final written report as well as deliver a 15-minute oral presentation on their summer research.  This REU site also encourages the continuation of research at the students home institution during fall and spring sessions.  \r\n",
