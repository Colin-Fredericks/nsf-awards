 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the acquisition of a liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometer for chemical, biochemical, and environmental analysis in research and research training for a university that is currently without any capability of liquid chromatographic mass spectral analysis. The faculty that will benefit from the new instrumentation are engaged in multi-disciplinary research in the areas of bio-organic, biochemical, bio-inorganic, and environmental research. Data is currently collected at universities that are over 80 miles away, which is entirely inadequate for carrying out research employing mass spectrometry on a routine basis and is not productive for education of students. Two of the five major faculty users are new faculty members.\r\n\r\nThis award goes to a predominantly undergraduate institution that has a rigorous program in undergraduate research. The acquisition of this instrumentation will strengthen the undergraduate and graduate research infrastructure in multiple departments through advanced research and training. Collaborations with local, state and federal agencies will result in an increased understanding of the identification and fate of important biochemical and environmental metabolites in the east central portion of rural Tennessee. Most of the department graduates plan careers in biotechnology or environmental science and ultimately go on to attend graduate school or professional school. Finally, the acquisition of this instrumentation will help the three female Co-PIs to serve as mentors and role models in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) fields.  \r\n",
