 "awd_abstract_narration": "Decomposition is a primary process by which carbon and nutrients are re-cycled in terrestrial ecosystems, generally by microbes. Photodegradation, the chemical breakdown of compounds by sunlight, may contribute substantially to decomposition of surface litter where it is exposed, such as in grasslands or tundra. However, few studies in terrestrial ecosystems have quantified the contribution of photodegradation to overall decomposition rates or have investigated the mechanisms by which photodegradation may affect the cycling of carbon and nitrogen. The proposed work will use a series of laboratory experiments aimed at separating direct and indirect effects of photodegradation and understanding how photodegradation may interact with microbial activity to affect overall decomposition rates. Results of this project may be integrated into models of decomposition and will have important implications for understanding changes in the magnitude of photodegradation in response to changes in climate, atmospheric composition, and land use.\r\n",
