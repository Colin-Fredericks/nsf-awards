It is defining existing resources for research that meet the needs of the faculty and students; identifying research models that suit the needs of community college faculty and students; identifying faculty and administrators who are supporting research through leadership roles; outlining relevant issues regarding undergraduate research; and establishing a professional development institute. \r\n\r\nThe long term results of this project are a \"how-to\" book on undergraduate research at community colleges and a new professional development institute on undergraduate research in community colleges that is offered on a regular basis. \r\n",
