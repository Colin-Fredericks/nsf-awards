 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is providing scholarships for students in the disciplines of biology, chemistry, math, computer science, physics, and engineering majors through four distinct types of support, each with its own criteria based on four predictors: i) Academic performance, ii) Engagement in STEM, iii) Involvement in STEM, and iv) Tenacity in STEM. This multi-faceted approach is based the institution's experience with its all-female student population who exhibit a variety of economic and personal circumstances, differing degrees of academic preparation for STEM course taking, and varying depths of knowledge about STEM careers and how such career paths intersect with their abilities and interests. Two key student support services underpin the scholarship awards: a drop-in science center and Case Study workshops, both of which are creating a supportive infrastructure and community and are helping students better understand STEM careers. Furthermore, the Case Study activities have a value-added component in the form of outreach to local grade 9-12 students helping them learn about STEM careers. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its provision of more defined avenues for STEM involvement and success than traditional approaches through the individualized approaches to awarding scholarships. The broader impacts of this effort are felt through the scholars' participation in the institution's science center where students are strongly supported in their STEM pursuits, creating a more technically aware population and increasing the pool of future students.",
