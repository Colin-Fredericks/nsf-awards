 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nAn inventory of the Mexican lichen family Parmeliaceae is planned in this megadiverse country. Many new discoveries are anticipated due to the expertise of five U.S. and Mexican lichenologists, and a natural product chemist. Field excursions are planned from the Yucatan to the Pacific and throughout the major mountains. Specimens will be deposited in both Mexican and U.S. institutions and revisions of the Parmeliaceae published.  A database of parmelioid collections from Mexico will be made available at Arizona State University and a computer based identification program will also be provided on WWW. Although the emphasis is on discovery, collaboration is made with an international group revising the generic delimitation within the Parmeliaceae.\r\n\tPromotion of lichenology will occur in the US, Mexico and Latin America through postdoctoral training, holding of a major Parmeliaceae workshop and an international symposium, and by training graduate and undergraduate students. The Parmeliaceae are often used in ecological investigations and air pollution investigations, and have unique secondary products that are important to the pharmaceutical industry and medical profession. Accurate knowledge of the species involved as well as the ability to readily determine them will thus benefit a much broader community than just lichen specialists.\r\n\r\n",
