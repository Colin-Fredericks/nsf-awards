In the past few\r\nyears, advanced 3D time-dependent radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of the solar\r\natmosphere and subsequent formation of forbidden O I and OH absorption features have\r\npointed to a reduction in the recommended solar oxygen abundance of nearly a factor of\r\ntwo. This revision brings the solar value near that expected from the present-day\r\ninterstellar medium and nearby B stars. However, because of the role of oxygen as a\r\nsignificant interior opacity source, such values are in severe conflict with models of the\r\nsolar interior and their excellent agreement with helioseismology. Moreover, recent\r\nstudies of carbon monoxide rovibrational bands in the thermal infrared have raised\r\nquestions concerning the validity of the 3-D convection models in the mid-photosphere\r\nand support an oxygen abundance more consistent with previous high values.\r\nHere further independent observational tests of the photospheric convection simulations\r\nwill be developed, primarily in the thermal infrared where the important continuum and\r\nline opacity sources have a different, simpler, but complementary character to those in\r\nthe visible. A secondary objective is to continue exploration of the outer boundary of the\r\nphotosphere, the so-called Magnetic Transition Zone, where plasma control in the deep\r\natmosphere gives way to magnetic dominance in the higher layers. In this enigmatic\r\nregion, the 4.66 micron CO bands indicate the surprising presence of ultra-cool (T ~ 3500\r\nK) gas protruding into what should be the warm, molecule-hostile chromosphere.\r\nUnderstanding this puzzle is essential to the full description of heat balance and energy\r\ntransport in the outer atmosphere. New advances in solar IR spectral imaging technology\r\nwill enable the observational studies that have been carried out in prototype for a decade.\r\nIn addition, current thermal profile modeling will be extended to new tracers such as OH\r\nand Ca II, and a unique opportunity to coordinate IR imaging spectroscopy with a NASA\r\nsolar UV sounding rocket flight will be exploited.\r\nThis project will advance our knowledge of the Sun's atmospheric structure and energy\r\ntransport, which is relevant to space weather. Beyond this, the composition of the Sun is a\r\ncrucial baseline for many other areas of astronomy. Furthermore, the high-altitude\r\nCOmosphere\" provides a laboratory for the study of processes associated with\r\nmolecular cooling catastrophes.\"\r\nThe work here will provide graduate training and the associated instrument development\r\nwill serve the broader National Solar Observatory user community. In addition to\r\ndissemination through professional publications and conference proceedings, a variety of\r\noutreach projects and community service activities relevant to the NSF mission will be\r\ncarried out in connection with this work.",
