 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project covers a range of important\r\nproblems in extremal combinatorics, principally those motivated by the\r\nTuran problem, which has led to many developments in the theory of graphs\r\nand hypergraphs. Here the ultimate goal is to determine the Turan numbers\r\nof complete hypergraphs, an open problem that mathematicians have battled\r\nwith for over sixty years. Recently there has been a lot of progress in\r\nthis area, so it is an exciting topic for future research. The PI is\r\nconsidering a variety of ways to extend the scope of this area, such as\r\nthe study of rainbow Turan numbers, which not only have natural\r\ncombinatorial motivations, but also have impressive potential applications\r\nin additive number theory. Another direction is investigating an old\r\nconjecture of Erdos on the number of edges one must delete from a\r\ntriangle-free graph to make it bipartite. A second area being studied is\r\nthe theory of set systems with restricted intersections, which has a rich\r\nhistory in combinatorics, and has also found applications to computer\r\nscience, particular in the theories of complexity and communication. The\r\nPI is continuing his study of the structural properties of large\r\nintersecting systems, and investigating a conjecture of Ahlswede, Cai and\r\nZhang on cross-intersecting systems. The concepts of trace and\r\nVC-dimension play a central role in many areas of statistics, discrete and\r\ncomputational geometry and learning theory. The quantitive character of\r\nthese problems is poorly understood, and this project addresses a\r\nconjecture of Anstee and Sali that offers some hope of improving this\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nAs an area of pure mathematics, extremal\r\ncombinatorics is in the happy position of being relatively accessible to a\r\nwider audience. It also finds a wide number of direct applications both to\r\nother areas of mathematics and other academic disciplines, and thus makes\r\nits influence felt indirectly as these disciplines in turn apply the\r\ntheoretical power of combinatorics in more practical settings. Its impact\r\non computer science is particularly striking, and its ideas also make\r\ncontributions to such diverse areas as physics, electrical engineering,\r\nbioinformatics, economics, and internet modelling. The proposed project\r\ncovers a range of important problems in extremal combinatorics,\r\nprincipally those motivated by a question of Turan, an open problem that\r\nmathematicians have battled with for over sixty years, which has led to\r\nmany developments in the theory of graphs and hypergraphs. Recently there\r\nhas been a lot of progress in this area, so it is an exciting topic for\r\nfuture research. The PI is considering various ways to extend the scope of\r\nthis area, including a rainbow variant that has impressive potential\r\napplications in additive number theory. A second area being studied is the\r\ntheory of set systems with restricted intersections, which has a rich\r\nhistory in combinatorics, and has also found applications to computer\r\nscience, particular in the theories of complexity and communication. The\r\nconcepts of trace and VC-dimension play a central role in many areas of\r\nstatistics, discrete and computational geometry and learning theory. The\r\nquantitive character of these problems is poorly understood, and this\r\nproject addresses a conjecture of Anstee and Sali that offers some hope of\r\nimproving this situation. In addition to research, the PI is conducting\r\neducational activities in his role as an instructor in mathematics at\r\nCaltech, including developing and teaching courses to disseminate\r\ncutting-edge research techniques in combinatorics, and mentoring students\r\non their own projects.\r\n\r\n",
