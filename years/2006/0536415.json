 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59)\r\n\r\nThis project is improving the undergraduate manufacturing engineering educational experience by developing an innovative model using hands-on minds-on experiences that significantly improve both cognitive learning and student motivation.  The PIs are developing both computer simulations and hands on experiments that address manufacturing machining operations.  The computer simulations represent specific machining problems, such as the prediction of cutting forces.  The students are collecting experimental data via hands on laboratory exercises and using this data as input to the simulation model.  Using the simulation results, the students are performing a second set of experiments and validating the simulation model output.  Based on both theoretical and mathematical results, the students are modifying the mathematical model utilized in the simulation program, thereby increasing the predictive accuracy of the simulation model.\r\n\r\nUsing this methodology, the PIs are integrating the computer simulations with the laboratory experimentation.  This approach is increasing student understanding of the complex relationships among manufacturing process variables that are difficult for students to truly comprehend from classroom lectures alone.  This project is involving the students in a cyclic learning process as well as providing them with a significant research experience.\r\n\r\nFormative evaluation of this project includes assessment of the student interaction with computer simulations, lectures, and course material for each module.  Summative evaluation activities are documenting the success of the curriculum and the pedagogical model through post-testing.  The project results are being broadly disseminated to both academic and industrial manufacturing environments via CD and web formats.",
