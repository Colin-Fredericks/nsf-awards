 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Brazil workshop award will support the travel of 20 junior researchers from US institutions to the XVth International Congress on Mathematical Physics, August 5 - August 11, 2006, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  This is one of a long-standing series of top-level conferences sponsored by the International Association of Mathematical Physics that is held every three years in locations around the world.  The ICMP conference aims at covering the most important recent developments in all areas of mathematical physics, and a substantial number of the researchers in mathematical physics from all over the world attend the meeting.\r\n\r\nThe conference focuses on topics of considerable importance and current interest to mathematical physics.  The Young Researchers Symposium immediately preceding the main congress will provide junior participants with a series of overview lectures on mathematical physics topics that expose them to high quality international research and enhance the educational experience for these young attendees.  Particular attention is paid to funding the travel for members of underrepresented groups.  This award is supported by the Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering, the Analysis and Applied Mathematics Programs of the Division of Mathematical Sciences, and the Theoretical Physics Program of the Division of Physics.\r\n",
