 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanisms underlying hadron physics in terms of bound states of \r\nquarks and gluons are investigated.   The particular approach used here is a \r\nnonperturbative modeling of hadrons and hadronic processes based on the \r\nDyson-Schwinger equations of the underlying field theory.    It has\r\nparticular advantages when the substructure of subatomic particles is probed\r\nby the high energy scattering and significant recoil of beams of electrons; \r\nthe demands of relativity, important broken symmetries, and the \r\nnon-observation of quarks and gluons are easily incorporated.   Established \r\nperturbative behavior of the field theory is also preserved.   This research \r\nwill extend the current reach of such an approach, and critically examine  \r\nshort-comings, through an exploration of a number of topics.   These include\r\nthe quark mass dependence of observables up through the charm quark region, and an \r\nanalysis of lattice-QCD results for intermediate elements, such as\r\nquark propagators and quark-gluon vertices.   An improved description of the \r\nquark-gluon vertex is of primary interest since it controls the corrections \r\nto the common ladder-rainbow approximation.    The momentum scale at which the \r\npion charge form factor gives way to perturbative behavior is also of major\r\ninterest.    Other topics include an analysis of quark propagators from \r\nfull-QCD lattice simulations, the use of an algebraic model to estimate the \r\nstrange quark content of the magnetic moment of the nucleon and to\r\nexplore high order corrections to ladder-rainbow approximation, the quark \r\nmass dependence of meson structure observables, radiative transitions of \r\nheavy quark mesons, and the extraction of nonperturbative physics from \r\nquark current correlations.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the program include the cross-fertilization of nuclear \r\nand particle physics, a return on the investment in the experimental \r\nfacilities of subatomic science, integration of research and teaching, and \r\nwide dissemination of scientific results.  PhD students working on this \r\nproject contribute to undergraduate education through their teaching of \r\nundergraduate laboratory or recitation sections.  We foster interactions \r\nbetween the PhD students and experienced researchers as a contribution to \r\nthe nation's research and education infrastructure.   The PI uses examples \r\nfrom this research program to illustrate key elements of core graduate \r\nclasses in Quantum Mechanics and Nuclear and Particle Physics.   The PI \r\nand a colleague supervise an informal seminar course for graduate students \r\nand postdoctoral associates to discuss and present aspects of QCD and \r\nfield theory that are outside graduate coursework but nevertheless \r\ncentral to cutting edge research.   The PI is also active in a \r\nre-structuring of the local undergraduate physics curriculum for majors; \r\na particular interest is the development of a freshman seminar course to \r\ndiscuss current events of discovery and breakthrough in physics and \r\nrelated science.  \r\n\r\n",
