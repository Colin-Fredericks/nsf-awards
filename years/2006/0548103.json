The project has both observational and theoretical components, using a range of wavelengths and radiation transfer codes.  The goals of the research are to: 1) probe the birth environments of natal star clusters; 2) determine basic properties about their embedded stellar populations; 3) characterize the physical compositions and structures of their birth \"cocoons\"; 4) constrain star formation efficiencies; 5) estimate time scales that are involved; and 6) draw connections to Galactic star formation. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the project is focused on K-12 science teacher development, as well as graduate student teacher training.  The Dr. Johnson has training in faculty development, and this proposal will leverage this background.  The PI will participate in, and help to expand, a workshop for teachers in grades 4-9, grade levels at which there are significant astronomy standards.  Additionally, Dr. Johnson has developed a number of workshops, as well as a semester long seminar on pedagogy, that she will offer at the University.   In addition, she will take over responsibility for teaching assistant training, and provide individual consultations to both students and faculty in the Astronomy Department.\r\n\r\n",
