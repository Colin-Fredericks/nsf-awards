 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cole-Dai\r\n0538553\r\n \r\nThis award supports a project that will contribute to the US West Antarctica Ice Sheet Ice Divide ice core (WAIS Divide) project by developing new instrumentation and analytical procedures to measure concentrations of major ions (Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, Na+, K+, NH4+, Mg2+, Ca2+).  A melter-based, continuous flow, multi-ion-chromatograph technique (CFA-IC) has been developed recently at South Dakota State University (SDSU).  This project will further expand and improve the CFA-IC technique and instrumentation and develop procedures for routine analysis of major ions in ice cores.  In addition, training of personnel (operators) to perform continuous, high resolution major ion analysis of the deep core will be accomplished through this project. The temporal resolution of the major ion measurement will be as low as 0.5 cm with the fully developed CFA-IC technique. At this resolution, it will be possible to use annual cycles of sulfate and sea-salt ion concentrations to determine annual layers in the WAIS Divide ice core.  Annual layer counting using CFA-IC chemical measurements and other high resolution measurements will contribute significantly to the major WAIS Divide project objective of producing precisely (i.e., annually) dated climate records. The project will support the integration of research and education, train future scientists and promote human resource development through the participation of graduate and undergraduate students.  In particular, undergraduate participation will contribute to a current REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) chemistry site program at SDSU.  Development and utilization of multi-user instrumentation will promote research collaboration and advance environmental science. NSF support for SDSU will contribute to the economic development and strengthen the infrastructure for research and education in South Dakota.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
