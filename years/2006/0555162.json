 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis proposal is concerned with estimates of wave equations on (both compact and non-compact) Riemannian manifolds, possibly with boundary.  We are interested in how the geometry, the boundary and the regularity of the metric influence certain basic estimates.  Problems of this kind arise in the study of harmonic analysis on manifolds, the study of local and global solutions of nonlinear wave equations and in the study of eigenfunctions in quantum chaos.  Although these topics are widely separated in their physical and historical origins, the relevant mathematics is closely related.  Techniques and insights in the various areas cross-fertilize each other in a fruitful way.  In particular, a common theme of much current research (and the problems in this proposal) is to try to understand and exploit the mass concentration of eigenfunctions and solutions of linear and nonlinear wave equations. The basic estimates that we have in mind are Lebesgues-space estimates (both linear and bilinear) in space for eigenfunctions and quasi-modes, and (local or global) Strichartz estimates in space-time.  The main questions center around how the geometry and especially the presence of a boundary affects the estimates and the kinds of solutions that saturate them.  The latter issue is closely related to the much studied (but still not well understood) questions of concentration, oscillation and size properties of modes and quasi-modes in spectral asymptotics.  In the non-compact setting it is also closely related to the distribution of resonances and their relations to trapped geodesics.\r\n\r\nThe above problems arise naturally from interactions between mathematics and areas in physics that include general relativity, quantum mechanics, and quantum chaos.  The techniques employed include stationary phase and the study of propagation of singularities.  There is a very active group of researchers in quantum physics groups at major universities studying high-energy eigenstates, and I am especially interested in making further contributions to this area.\r\n\r\n",
