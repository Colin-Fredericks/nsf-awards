 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: Cooperative Control Under Communication Constraints\r\nSummary Statement\r\nIntellectual Merit: The fields of cooperative and networked control are on the verge of a technological\r\nrevolution. Emerging applications in national security, transportation, communication, and\r\ncommerce require distributed networks to be capable of multi-user communication, collaborative\r\nsignal and information processing, sensor fusion of multi-modal data, and, distributed computation,\r\nactuation, and control.\r\nThese information rich applications place specific demands upon networks: the networks must\r\nscale gracefully to a large numbers of agents; the agents may be geographically distributed, often\r\nrequiring communication over noisy, bandwidth-limited channels; the networks may consist of heterogeneous\r\ncomponents, including embedded systems with limited computational power; and, the\r\nnetworks architecture may be decentralized, requiring local coordination amongst the agents.\r\nThere has been quite a bit of recent activity in exploring graph-based, multi-agent cooperative\r\ncontrol. In this proposal the PI will examine how the addition of realistic communication channels,\r\nwith noise and delay, can effect the cooperative control performance. For noisy channel situations\r\nit is no longer reasonable to assume that each agent has perfect knowledge of its neighbors states.\r\nWe will examine the question of local versus global knowledge. This project will build on the PIs\r\nextensive research on control with communication constraints, graphical models, and information\r\ntheory. In systems with large numbers of weakly coupled agents statistical mechanics tools, like\r\nmean-field approximation, can be used to determine the qualitative behavior of the system. If\r\nthere is stronger coupling between agents then there is the possibility of multiple phases in these\r\nengineered systems.\r\nOur main objectives in carrying out this research are: (1) Fundamental limits and tradeoffs.\r\nThis aspect of the project considers the qualitative scaling behavior of large cooperative control\r\nsystems. In addition, the PI will consider the fundamental limits and tradeoeffs between the quality\r\nof the communication and the resulting control performance. (2)Algorithm development. The\r\nproposed research will develop reinforcement learning techniques for solving large factored Markov\r\ndecision problems. (3) Educational development.\r\nBroader Impact: In order to develop a useful theory that can explain the advancements in\r\ncooperative control one needs to view communication and control as two sides of a coin. On the\r\none hand Shannon theory tell us what can be communicated and on the other hand control theory\r\ntheory tell us what should be communicated. Tools from information theory, graphical models,\r\nprobability theory, and statistical mechanics will be used to develop a formal framework for treating\r\nstochastic cooperative control problems. This framework will allow us to realistically model the\r\ncommunication between agents and allow us to understand the interaction between information\r\nand control.\r\nThe proposed research project blends tools from many disciplines. The PI plans to encourage\r\nundergraduates, graduate students, and practicing engineers to contribute to this interdisciplinary\r\nresearch program. Course curriculum, talks, and projects will be designed to encourage this participation.\r\nTo promote a unified view of the theory and algorithms under development and to provide a\r\ntestbed for the evaluation of ideas we will focus on the following driving applications: distributed\r\nestimation and actuation in sensor networks, distributed optimization, multi-agent decision making,\r\nmessage-passing algorithms, and multi-user information theory. Undergraduate and graduate\r\nstudents will be called on to perform various experiments and simulations to validate the algorithms.",
