 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multiscale systems abound in science and engineering.  Their comprehensive treatment requires\r\naccurate mathematical modeling of processes at the fine scales and a mathematical framework for\r\nflow of information across scales.  This proposal addresses this problem in the context of heterogeneous\r\nexplosives.  These have a complex microstructure with fragments of the energetic material, voids and\r\npores existing within the granular aggregate.  When subjected to a sufficiently strong shock, a detonation\r\nis initiated.  Although the crystalline homogeneous explosive has a high ignition threshold, relatively\r\nweaker stimuli are sufficient to initiate the heterogeneous aggregate.  This is caused by the appearance\r\nof discrete sites, or hot spots, where burning commences and then spreads to consume the entire bulk.\r\nThe multi-scale nature of the system is a daunting obstacle in the way of any attempt at ab-initio modeling\r\nof the detonation phenomena, at least at the present time.  Two major approaches to mathematical\r\nmodeling have been proposed.  Both generate continuum equations at the macro scale, wherein a certain\r\ndegree of homogenization is implicit and fine-scale processes have been included as subgrid models.\r\nThe first approach, typified by the ignition-and-growth model, treats the explosive as a homogeneous\r\nmixture of two distinct constituents, the unreacted explosive and the products of reaction, at pressure and\r\ntemperature equilibrium.  To each constituent is assigned an equation of state, and a single reaction-rate\r\nlaw is postulated for the conversion of the explosive to products.  The second approach explicitly\r\nrecognizes the two-phase character of the explosive mixture.  The resulting model has separate\r\nbalance laws of mass, momentum and energy for each phase, plus a rule that allows compaction of\r\nthe solid phase driven by pressure difference between the phases.  Terms representing interfacial\r\nexchange of mass, momentum and energy appear, corresponding to the nonequilibrium processes of\r\nreaction, drag and heat transfer. These models are systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations\r\nthat can be considered as generalizations of the Euler equations of gasdynamics.  This proposal is aimed\r\nat studies of existing continuum models as well as the investigation of fine-scale phenomena.  The primary\r\nobjective will be to study how the strength and distribution of hot spots depend, in a quantitative way,\r\nupon the constitutive properties of the explosive and the size of the igniting stimulus, thus providing\r\nimportant information that can be used in attempts at multi-scale descriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany areas in science and engineering, including weather, combustion, pollution, and biological systems,\r\namong others, involve behavior at the scale of observation that is determined by the events occurring at\r\nmicro scales.  A thorough treatment of such systems requires, on the one hand, a fundamental\r\nunderstanding and accurate mathematical modeling of processes at the micro scales, and on the other, development of a theoretical and computational framework that would facilitate flow of information\r\nacross scales, so that behavior at the scale of observation can be predicted reliably and accurately.\r\nAttention to such systems is particularly timely and apt in the context of science-based stewardship of\r\nexplosive devices, and it is problems from this arena that form the core of this proposal.\r\n",
