 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will to develop a process-control oxygen sensor suitable for harsh conditions present in petrochemical production, oil and gas refining, and boiler systems for power generation. The proposed nanomaterial-based sensor stimulates and then monitors the infrared emission of singlet molecular oxygen to measure oxygen concentration to ppb levels in the presence of strong solvents, corrosive acids and flammable mixtures at elevated temperatures. This is a novel application of a long known phenomena that heretofore has been almost exclusively used in biomedical applications. Unlike other optical oxygen sensors, the proposed method is suited to trace analysis since the measured signal is directly proportional to oxygen concentration. Trace measurements can be accurately made against a \"zero background.\" \r\n\r\nMeasurement and control of oxygen is crucial for efficient operation of industrial processes including: production of petrochemicals, petroleum refining, plastic and polymer materials manufacture, semiconductors processing, ceramics, gas separation. The competitiveness of the these multi-billion dollar industries in the US relies on continued process improvements of production efficiency, cost savings, product yield and quality. Innovations and improvements in commercially available process oxygen sensors have lagged the potential applications. \r\n\r\n",
