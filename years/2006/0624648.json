Minn) and Peter Fox (NCAR)\r\nThis proposal requests funds to help support travel and meeting costs for students and\r\nearly career scientists at U.S. institutions to the 26th International Conference on Mathematical\r\nGeophysics Coupling in Earth Systems: Solids, Fluids, Life to be held in\r\nJune 4 - 8, 2006 near Tiberias, Israel on the Sea of Galilee. The conference website is\r\nhttp://www.weizmann.ac.il/conferences/CMG2006/.\r\nIntellectual merits This conference brings together Earth scientists from across the disciplines\r\nwith physicists, applied mathematicians, and computational scientists to discuss\r\nadvances in mathematical and computational techniques for understanding properties and\r\nprocesses in the earth. This years meeting emphasizes understanding coupled systems\r\nsuch as coupled convective systems (ocean-atmosphere, mantle-lithosphere), coupled fluidsolid\r\nmechanics, interactions between the biosphere and geosphere, and in particular, interactions\r\nbetween humans and the earth through natural hazards. Many, if not all, of\r\nthese problems require techniques for investigating, multi-scale, multi-physics problems\r\nand the meeting will emphasize both analytical and advanced computational methods for\r\nsuch problems. This meeting provides a single multi-disciplinary forum for the exchange\r\nof ideas and techniques across the disciplinary boundaries in the Earth Sciences. Funds\r\nare requested to support travel costs for 20 students, post-docs and early career scientists\r\nwhich is approximately half the number attending past meetings.\r\nBroader Impacts This meeting is highly interdisciplinary and international in nature and\r\nprovides an important opportunity for U.S. students and early-career scientists from across\r\nthe earth sciences and applied mathematics to interact with senior scientists in a small informal\r\nsetting. This year there will also be an increased emphasis on mathematical aspects\r\nof natural hazards in an attempt to understand how to merge fundamental knowledge of\r\nearth processes with risk management and societal needs.\r\n",
