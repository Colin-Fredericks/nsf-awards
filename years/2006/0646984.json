The workshop would be attended by internationally known experts from industry, government, and academia to discuss soot formation issues related to related to ambient air quality. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nEmphasis will be on the issues related to soot as a major contributor to PM23 and to the number density of ambient fine particles, both of which have been implicated with a number of adverse health impacts. The forum will consist of overview presentations by experts, workshop sessions, panel presentations and discussions, and focus meetings. The expected outcomes are:\r\n \r\n1.  review of the current status of understanding of soot formation mechanisms, new data and methodologies, and advances in the application of soot models to solve practical problems\r\n2.  discussion and identification of areas of discrepancy and the priorities for future research\r\n3.  development of plans for collaboration in the soot community.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will impact soot research over the next decade by addressing the key experimental, theoretical and modeling issues in understanding soot formation. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\n\r\nThe problems related to soot formation are global and as such require global solutions, through global collaboration. The workshop will be attended by a global community. The invited speakers are among the top experts from various sectors, selected to cover various angles of this topic from an international and multi-disciplinary perspective. Important outcomes of the proposed Forum include international research partnerships and collaborative team efforts in the theme areas of the meeting. Special emphasis will be given to recruit and facilitate the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering (e.g., underrepresented minorities, women and persons with disabilities). The results of discussion will be summarized in a book which will be published by the Karlsruhe University Press. In addition, presentations and discussions will be made available online through the World Wide Web.",
