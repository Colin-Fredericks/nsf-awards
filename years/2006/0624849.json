 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators and their colleagues study the problem of dynamic\r\nresource management in large scale and reconfigurable clusters and develop\r\na novel stochastic framework for modeling, analysis, resource\r\nallocation, and strategy adaptation of parallel applications.\r\nThe framework features three key innovations. First, it introduces the\r\nmethodology of sequential optimal stopping times into the field of parallel\r\nprocessing for designing optimal scheduling strategies. It relies on a\r\nworkload evolution model that captures both dynamic load changes and\r\nserver capacity variations in a unified structure.  Second, the framework\r\ncontains an aggregation method that utilizes cluster structures to reduce\r\ncomputational complexities, based on treatment of two-time-scale Markovian\r\nsystems developed recently.  Since the Markov decision processes for\r\nremapping problems require control actions be stopping rules,\r\nthe proposed techniques constitute a new paradigm\r\nof stopping rules in two-time-scale Markov systems and make\r\na broader impact on the theory of Markov decision\r\nprocesses. Third, the framework includes a novel learning methodology that can\r\nupdate scheduling strategies recursively to accommodate time-varying\r\nuncertain environments in which statistical properties are not available\r\na priori. The methodology integrates projection and truncation\r\nalgorithms into the Q-learning procedures to enhance its implementation\r\nefficiency, state bounding, and speed of convergence. This project\r\nestablishes asymptotic properties of the algorithms, which may shed new light\r\nto the studies of Q-learning theory. In addition to convergence of the\r\nalgorithm under random truncations, rates of convergence are also\r\nascertained using an associate diffusion process.\r\n \r\nAn overwhelming majority of today's supercomputers are constructed\r\nby aggregating a large number of processing nodes to overcome the\r\nbarrier of processor speed. Engineering such systems\r\npresents key challenges, including coordination of the behaviors of the\r\nprocessing nodes to achieve high sustainable performance in real applications\r\nand reconfiguration of the systems in response to node/link failures\r\nto provide fault-resilient services. Current practices often rely on\r\nheuristic approaches to the issues and offer little insights into the\r\npotential and limitation of large scale clusters. This study intertwines\r\ntoday's discoveries of cluster computing principles with advances in\r\nmathematical sciences.  Not only does it develop new knowledge about enabling\r\ntechnologies of next generation of high-end computers, but also\r\nit advances mathematical models and theories in new applications.\r\nMoreover, it motivates graduate and undergraduate students of diversified fields to participate\r\nin interdisciplinary research in both computer and mathematical sciences.\r\n",
