 "awd_abstract_narration": "Core material recovered from the Lomonosov Ridge during the 2004 IODP Arctic Coring Expedition (ACEX) will be used to reconstruct the history of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean through application of the iron oxide fingerprinting technique.  This method permits researchers to trace the origin of detrital sediments to specific regions of the circum-Arctic Ocean.  Hypothesizing that seasonal ice and perennial ice deliver sediments to the Lomonosov Ridge from different locations and distances, the researchers will conduct exhaustive analyses of continuous core sections dating back to 15-17 Ma and other core sections that cover the period from ~44 Ma back to Paleocene time to infer the patterns of perennial and seasonal ice represented in the cores.   The results will provide constraints not only on Arctic sea ice history and paleoclimate, but also on paleocirculation patterns.  Such information is critical for more accurate reconstruction of paleoclimate scenarios and better prediction of future climate change.  Broader impacts include the critical contributions this research will make to Arctic climate history and the analysis of the unique IODP ACEX cores, collaboration with Canadian and European researchers, and training of undergraduate and graduate students.",
