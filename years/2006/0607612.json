 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dynamical determination of the masses of young stars and brown dwarfs will be\r\ncontinued through an extensive observational program using a variety of tools and\r\ntechniques. The work is motivated by substantial uncertainties in theoretical mass\r\nrelations for substellar masses, the lack of empirical calibrations (temperature,\r\nluminosity, etc.) for very low mass/young stars, and uncertainties the distribution of mass\r\nratios in clusters. The goal is to obtain dynamical masses to within 10% for stars of mass\r\n1 to 0.5 that of the Sun, and to within 20% for those of even less mass. Four specific\r\nprojects will be undertaken: 1) The orbits of young visual binaries, including low mass\r\npre-main sequence stars, will be improved using Keck and Gemini Observatory laserguide\r\nstar Adaptive Optics systems and Hubble Space telescope Fine Guidance Sensor\r\nobservations. 2) The mass ratio distribution in the Hyades will be explored using the\r\nInfrared Telescope Facility and the Cryogenic Echelle Spectrograph to observe\r\nspectroscopic binaries. 3) Masses of two pre-main sequence stars will be improved by\r\nobserving the rotation of circumstellar disks in the 13CO line where the ambient cloud\r\nbrightness should be lower (extended emission from the cloud was a source of\r\nuncertainty in previous 12CO measurements). 4) The dynamical masses of brown dwarfs\r\nwill be determined from observations of brown dwarf binaries, which will be used to test\r\ntheoretical mass-luminosity relations.\r\nThis work will directly support the training of graduate students in contemporary\r\ninstrumentation and collaborative investigations. Both students in the NSF supported\r\nResearch Experiences for Undergraduates program at Stony Brook and Stony Brook\r\nundergraduates will also participate through independent research projects. Results of the\r\nwork will be disseminated to the public through an ongoing monthly \"Open Nights in\r\nAstronomy\" program and talks to local amateur astronomy groups.",
