 "awd_abstract_narration": "A big theme in number theory in the last 50 years has been the relationship \r\nbetween automorphic forms, Galois representations and objects from algebraic \r\ngeometry. There is an extensive web of extraordinary conjectures (for instance \r\nthe Artin conjecture, the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture, Langlands' conjectures, \r\nSerre's conjecture and the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture) linking these three \r\nseemingly very different subjects (which relate to analysis, algebra and \r\ngeometry respectively). Progress on these conjectures is currently very \r\nexciting (particularly recent work of Kisin and Khare-Wintenberger). The PI proposes \r\n(with K. Buzzard and T. Gee) to prove the Artin conjecture for odd, two dimensional \r\nrepresentations of the absolute Galois group of the rational numbers. He \r\nalso proposes to investigate generalisations of Ihara's lemma to higher rank \r\nunitary groups. As the PI (with L. Clozel, M. Harris and N. Shepherd-Barron) has \r\nrecently shown, this would imply the Sato-Tate conjecture for rational elliptic \r\ncurves with multiplicative reduction somewhere. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis circle of ideas is the one that led to Andrew Wiles' celebrated proof of \r\nFermat's last theorem after over 300 years. They fall into the general area of \r\narithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of \r\nmathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved \r\nextraordinarily fruitful. Among its many consequences are new error correcting \r\ncodes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and \r\ncompact disks.",
