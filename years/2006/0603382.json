 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the issue of increasing the pool of qualified engineers, technicians, technologists, and scientists by increasing the interest of secondary school students from traditionally underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields. To reach out to students in public schools, the project is: establishing technology clubs at regional secondary schools; developing, coordinating and delivering  engineering/technology seminars for students and parents; sponsoring summer technology camps; conducting engineering and technology competitions; providing training, workshops and experiential learning opportunities for secondary school teachers and counselors/advisors; and actively involving parents, teachers and career counselors/advisors. Community college and university student chapters of professional societies provide mentors for secondary school students and, whenever possible, technology club coordinators are selected from underrepresented groups to serve as strong role models.\r\n\r\nThis project includes an awareness program to affect a new appreciation in the community for the career and education opportunities that exist in STEM professions. Secondary school math and science teachers and counselors are attending workshops that address issues and provide proven strategies related to encouraging underrepresented students interested in math and science studies. Expertise and assistance are provided in the development of pre-engineering courses for delivery at the high school level. Parents receive information about STEM careers, participate with their children in activities focused on STEM professions, and become cognizant of methods to encourage and prepare their children to pursue math and science studies. A comprehensive web site includes information for students, teachers, counselors and parents.\r\n\r\nAt the collegiate level, project leaders are collaborating to enhance alignment of the technology curricula between the community colleges and UNC Charlotte to better prepare students to achieve a BS or higher degree.  Because college students mentor and advise secondary school students, these students are encouraged to consider careers in academics and become more actively involved in the profession. Internships, technical classes, and shadowing experiences for high school teachers are improving math, science, and technology content in the high school. The project is being assessed for student participation and learning through quantitative and qualitative measures, both through internal mechanisms and through the services of an external evaluator. Enrollment in technology clubs and science and math courses in the high schools measure participation, and high school testing and college entrance exams measure knowledge of STEM fundamentals. All stakeholders have an active role in the evolution of the project through formal and informal feedback mechanisms.\r\n\r\n",
