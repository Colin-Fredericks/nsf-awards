To compound the situation, very little information is available on the status and operational margins of existing power lines, resulting in very conservative deployment and utilization of utility assets. The PIs propose the concept of a distributed sensor network that can provide distributed and continuous on-line monitoring of transmission lines to allow system operators to optimally utilize the power line ratings, and to provide them with early reports on potential problems that could result in cascading failures such as the August 2003 blackout. The individual sensors would be clamped around the power line itself, floating electrically and mechanically on the power line. The sensor would couple power from the line to provide power for its sensing and would communicate this information with the area control center. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This research offers better understanding of how to implement a robust and self-tuning network of sensors that can reliably estimate which span of a power line is the critical span, and how much dynamic capacity the line has at any given point in time. Continuous on-line monitoring of transmission lines using low-cost sensors offers the ability for early detection of insulator-breakdown, ice build-up and local thermal overload. Broader Impact: The research has the potential to reduce grid congestion, improve T&D asset utilization, lower the cost of electricity, and require fewer new power transmission lines. In addition, the work holds promise for improved reliability and power system operation under contingencies and avoidance of widespread blackouts, such as, August 2003 Northeast blackout instability might have been averted if a power line overload could have been detected. The PIs have a strong working relationship with utilities that will facilitate transfer to industry practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
