 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earthquakes are the result of rapid movement of crustal\r\nblocks on faults, which are marked by a narrow fault zone\r\n(FZ) with a width of several hundred meters.  Most\r\nearthquake rupture models, including the asperity and\r\nstick-slip paradigms, suggest that FZ structure (geometrical\r\nand material properties) controls earthquake rupture\r\ninitiation, propagation, and termination.  However,\r\ndetermining FZ structure at seismogenic depths where\r\nearthquakes nucleate and the majority of slip occurs has\r\nbeen shown to be extremely difficult.  In this project,\r\nseismologists at Saint Louis University use high-frequency\r\nbody-wave waveforms from aftershocks near the FZ to\r\ndetermine fine-scale.  Waveform characteristics\r\nenables them to design a new strategy in which the FZ width\r\nand velocities are determined separately, thus eliminating\r\nthe trade-off between the two.  Furthermore, by using FZ\r\nreflected waves, they can pinpoint the locations in the FZ\r\nwhere they have obtained FZ width and velocity parameters.\r\nThis gives them a unprecedented high depth resolution of FZ\r\nstructure.  In addition, they are able to relocate\r\naftershocks with an accuracy of a few tens of meters\r\nrelative to the FZ boundaries.  They plan to apply the\r\nmethod to data sets of various fault zones in California,\r\nincluding the Landers, Hector Mine, San Jacinto, and San\r\nAndreas Fault at Parkfield to determine FZ parameters\r\n(strike, width, velocity and density drops, and Q) and\r\npossible temporary variations.\r\n  Broader Impacts:  The information obtained is crucial\r\nto developing models of the earthquake source.  Experience\r\ngained in this study will help design future FZ seismic\r\nexperiments and the methodologies developed can be easily\r\napplied to other regions and data sets, such as those from\r\nthe on-going USArray.\r\n",
