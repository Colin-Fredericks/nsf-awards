Reid\r\n\r\nThe project is a workshop on 3-dimensional topology that will be held at\r\nthe International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh, UK, in\r\nMarch, 2006. Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, which has guided\r\nresearch in 3-dimensional topology for almost three decades, has now\r\nbeen established, and consequently there is a need to set out a program\r\nfor future research in the subject. This is the objective of the\r\nworkshop. The program will be centered around five series of three\r\n1-hour lectures, given by Jeff Brock, Dave Gabai, Marc Lackenby, Peter\r\nOzsvath, and Peter Shalen. There will also be nine additional invited\r\n1-hour talks by other leading researchers. Among the recent important\r\ndevelopments in 3-dimensional topology that will be discussed, with a\r\nview to illuminating the theory of 3-manifolds beyond Geometrization,\r\nare: the proofs of the Tameness and Ending Lamination Conjectures,\r\nHeegaard Floer homology theory, various approaches to the virtual Haken\r\nConjecture, and the connection between 3-dimensional topology and the\r\ntheory of word hyperbolic groups.\r\n\r\n3-dimensional topology is a large and active subject within the general\r\nfield of pure mathematics. Its goal is the study of all possible\r\n3-dimensional \"spaces\", and of the various objects that can be situated\r\nin them, such as knots. Over the last 30 years or so this subject has\r\nseen many exciting developments, revealing connections to many other\r\nbranches of mathematics as well as quantum physics and (in the case of\r\nknots) even to the behavior of DNA. The guiding light of the subject\r\nduring this period has been the Geometrization Conjecture, put forward\r\nWilliam Thurston in the mid 1970's, which asserts that hyperbolic\r\ngeometry, the non-euclidean geometry discovered by Lobachevsky in the\r\n19th century, plays a key role in the description of these 3-dimensional\r\nspaces. This conjecture was recently proved by Grisha Perelman. It seems\r\ntimely, then, to take stock of the subject, identifying the major\r\nproblems that remain and indicating potential techniques and directions\r\nfor future work. The core of the program will be five series of three\r\n1-hour lectures, given by five internationally renowned experts in the\r\nsubject. It is expected that this will make the workshop especially\r\nuseful to young researchers.\r\n\r\nThe conference web site is\r\nhttp://www.icms.org.uk/meetings/2006/3-manifolds/index.html.\r\n",
