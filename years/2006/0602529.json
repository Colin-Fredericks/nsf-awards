Existing techniques do not offer non-invasiveness, spatial accuracy, and temporal accuracy at the same time. The proposed Lorentz Effect Imaging (LEI) technique promises real-time, non-invasive, and direct imaging of neuroelectric activities with spatial accuracy. Here, interaction between ion movement along axonal and dendritic processes and the strong magnetic fields of the MR scanner induce minute Lorentz forces upon the neural conductors. These forces apparently induce local stresses and strains within the cellular substrate that gives rise to local, detectable, MR signal loss. Unlike existing techniques, the LEI technique would allow characterization of the conductivity and functionality of the white matter/nerves affected by disease. Traditional imaging methods generally only reveal anatomical differences and provide no functional information regarding nerve conduction. Importantly, the LEI technique has potential to determine the flow of information between various activated brain areas, providing great potential for identifying the functional organization of the brain.\r\n",
