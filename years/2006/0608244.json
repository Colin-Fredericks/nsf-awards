 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine interactions of the parasitic trematode Crepidostomum farionis and the cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarki virginalis (Rio Grande cutthroat) in high elevation streams in northern New Mexico.  It will specifically test the hypothesis that pathogen infectivity is negatively related to migration between trout populations, as predicted by recently developed theory. Crepidostomum farionis is a generalist that uses multiple fish hosts, including cutthroat and non-native brown trout, Salmo trutta. Genotypes of individual cutthroat will be determined at a gene locus involved in resistance to parasites, microsatellite, and mitochondrial genes.  Migration and gene sharing will be estimated.  Likewise, gene sharing between populations of the pathogen will be quantified using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers.  This is a new approach in studies of pathogen population dynamics.\r\n\r\nStudies of host movement, host resistance, and pathogen infectivity have broad potential to reveal how wildlife diseases are spread and maintained in natural populations.  This project will also offer volunteer opportunities for undergraduate participation in a multi-disciplinary study.  Finally, researchers involved with this project will participate in public education activities organized by both state and federal agencies designed to highlight the status and management of native wildlife within the State of New Mexico.\r\n",
