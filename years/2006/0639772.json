 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will combine a number of existing models of Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere into a comprehensive geospace model (CGM). Specifically, the CGM will comprise the OpenGGCM magnetosphere model, the CTIPe thermosphere-ionosphere-plasmasphere model, the Comprehensive Ring current Model (CRCM), the Rice Convection Model, and the Fok Radiation Belt Model (RBM). A substantial part of this effort is devoted to verification and validation of the CGM. A number of ground and space based data sets will be used to establish metrics and skill scores. CGM will be able to perform in real time on currently available computer systems, and it will be run for at least one month in real time mode for verification. The CGM will be delivered to the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) at NASA/GSFC, for additional testing in preparation for transition into operations. The model will have the capability to follow the geospace response to time-dependent variations in the forcing from the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field. The important space weather effects predicted by the model include: magnetospheric convection and auroral precipitation responsible for electrojet currents, radiation belt electron and ion fluxes, sub-auroral polarization streams and their impact on plasma density at mid-latitude, mid and low latitude plasma restructuring by the interaction between the penetration and dynamo electric fields, specification of the background neutral and plasma context for forecasting irregularities, and thermospheric neutral density responsible for satellite drag, and the O/N2 ratio, which is important for ionospheric production and loss. The CGM will contribute many important new and unique aspects to the modeling and characterization of the Geospace domain. In particular, the development of the unified potential solver coupling the electrodynamic components will accommodate both symmetric and asymmetric elements of the inter-hemispheric interactions. CGM will also have a realistic topside ionosphere and plasmasphere, which is essential for the correct treatment of plasma redistribution at mid and low latitudes, and the emptying and refilling of the plasmasphere. It will have the potential to respond to realistic dynamical forcing from the lower atmosphere, which is responsible for much of the geomagnetic quiet day-to-day variability. The radiation belt module will also have the capability to respond to time-dependent magnetic and electric fields, and covers both ions and electrons over the entire relevant energy range. In addition, the model will assimilate data for ionospheric and magnetospheric convection, will include multiple species in the plasmasphere and the magnetosphere, and will accommodate multiple solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field monitor. The project will include the education of graduate students in the next generation of space weather models. The project will provide specification and forecast of space weather for power companies, the satellite industry, and communication and navigation users. The project is also in line with the objectives of the International Heliophysical Year in its efforts to explain the unifying physical processes involved in the coupling between the geophysical domains.",
