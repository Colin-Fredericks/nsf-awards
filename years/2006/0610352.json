 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Liberty Science Center (LSC) will develop \"Science Now, Science Everywhere (SNSE),\" a three-year project using mobile phones to expand exhibit learning at three LSC exhibits.  Goals of the project include conducting intensive research on the capabilities of mobile phones for exhibit learning; developing methods with mobile technology to sustain and expand informal learning beyond the science center; investigating the effectiveness of mobile learning, as a means to engage wider audiences and underrepresented groups in science learning; and inspire new generations of technology users to participate in informal science learning.  \"SNSE\" research will greatly expand upon limited findings on pedagogical and technological issues associated with mobile learning.  Results will be disseminated to the field at professional conferences, via the project's website, and at the Association of Science and Technology Centers' RAP Sessions at the Liberty Science Center.  An online resource and planned symposia for ISE professionals will be hosted by LSC on the \"SNSE\" process with review of the research and guidance on how to utilize project prototypes.  Collaborators include Caterpillar Mobile, the Center for Mobile Communication Studies at Rutgers University, the Institute for Learning Innovation, and Verizon Communications.",
