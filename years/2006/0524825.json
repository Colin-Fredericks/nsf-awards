 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a two-year study to understand the dynamics of electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) wave generation in the outer morningside magnetosphere and the role of these waves in the transfer of energy from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere. Wave-particle interactions in the Earth's magnetosphere provide an important mechanism for the transfer of energy and momentum between various plasma populations and from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere. The proposed work will focus on proton ion-cyclotron interactions in the morning sector outer magnetosphere, a spatial region that is known to be conducive to EMIC wave growth. The study will examine under what magnetospheric conditions the waves are generated and role that these waves play in inducing precipitation of low energy (< 5 keV) protons into the upper atmosphere. \r\n\r\nA multi-spacecraft approach will be employed combining local measurements of EMIC waves and associated particle distributions available from the Polar spacecraft along with global observations of the proton aurora provided by the IMAGE spacecraft. The proposed investigation will quantitatively correlate observations of the proton aurora with the occurrence of waves in the equatorial magnetosphere. The contribution of protons to auroral energy input will be quantified at times when wave-induced scattering is occurring. \r\n\r\nThere are several broader impacts of the proposed research. First of all, the research will be carried out by a young, woman scientist and thus serves to broaden participation and enhance diversity in NSF programs. The proposed work relies heavily upon the assimilation of data from multiple institutions and builds upon previous successful collaborations with industry (Lockheed-Martin), government laboratories (Los Alamos) and among universities. Strengthening these partnerships will promote the education and training of a young scientist and ultimately benefit the scientific community.",
