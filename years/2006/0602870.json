 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a collaborative research effort between the University of Kaiserslautern (UKL),  Kaiserslautern, Germany and the University of Rochester (UOR). The objective of the experimental program is to resolve fundamental questions regarding spin relaxation, spin-dependent transport, spin injection, and magnetic phenomena at interfaces with organic semiconductors (OSC).  The focus is mainly on spin injection across the interface between an inorganic solid and organic materials.  For these studies, measurements will be carried out using spin- and time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect, photoemission and inverse photoemission spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy and magnetic force microscopy. Both teams (UOR and UKL) have unique facilities complementary to each other but all are important for the success of this project.  The UKL team is well recognized in the study in spin dynamics and is the pioneer to develop spin- and time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.  The UOR team has more than a decade of experience in interfaces in organic semiconductors.  A strong collaboration between both teams is essential. The collaboration also offers students and postdoctoral associates the opportunity to gain an international research experience.  The proposed study introduces innovative approaches to address fundamental issues important for the future development of organic spintronics. \r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n",
