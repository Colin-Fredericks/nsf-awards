 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hampton University HBCU-UP Targeted Infusion Project will develop a new Forensic Chemistry Concentration for students.  There has been a wave of interest and desire among young people to pursue careers in forensic science in recent years. The wave of interest in this field is an opportunity to attract more minority students into this and other scientific disciplines. \r\n\r\nThe Hampton University Forensic Chemistry Concentration will be a modification of the existing chemistry curriculum to incorporate selected courses in Criminal Justice System, Criminology, Statistics, and Micro-techniques. New courses in Forensic Chemistry and Physical Methods in Forensic Chemistry will be developed along with an accompanying laboratory manual. A Forensic Chemistry Laboratory will be established to support teaching and research in forensics. Capstone activities will be an integral part of the program. This will be accomplished by two Summer internships that students will be required to take during the summer following the sophomore and junior years, respectively. A designated chemistry faculty member will serve as coordinator of the program. It is expected that the graduates of this track will be well prepared to enter advanced degree programs and subsequent research careers in forensics, or join entry-level jobs in crime laboratories, law enforcement agencies, criminal investigations, government agencies, or private laboratories. When this concentration is fully implemented, it is expected that within five years the total chemistry enrollment will rise from the current enrollment of 69 to about 100 students. This project will serve as a model for others interested in implementing similar concentrations. A similar concentration is planned in the Biology program at Hampton in subsequent years.  This project stands to contribute significantly to the diversification of the forensic science workforce as a whole.  \r\n",
