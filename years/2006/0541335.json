 "awd_abstract_narration": "Background\r\n\r\nA typical compiler is designed to apply its optimizations to built-in types of the language it is compiling. Although built-in general-purpose optimizations might be generally beneficial, they cannot be directly applied to user-defined types because their correctness cannot be determined a priori. Extending a compiler to optimize some particular userdefined type would be useful for that particular type, but this approach becomes burdensome if the compiler must be extended on a type-by-type basis. A more powerful approach would be to enable compiler optimizations that are generic, i.e., that can be applied to any type (built-in or user-defined) that meets fundamental semantic requirements.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\n-Formal concept definitions. The PIs propose to integrate concept-based optimization with their research on         formalization of concepts for generic programming.\r\n-Language support for concepts. Concept-based optimization will leverage and inform our on-going research    on direct language support for concepts and generic programming.\r\n-Compiler support for concepts. The PI's initial efforts incorporating concepts into the GNU C++ compiler will     be extended to support concept-based optimizations.\r\n- Concept-based optimizations. The PI's will leverage generic programming mechanisms to define optimizations      using concepts so that such optimizations apply to user-defined types, simply by stating that the types      model (i.e., meetthe requirements of) particular concepts.\r\n-Deployment and library evolution. Selected generic libraries, including the Standard Template Library, the\r\n  Boost Graph Library, and the Vector, Signal, and Image Processing Library will be upgraded to take     advantage of language extensions for generic programming and to take advantage of concept-based optimization.\r\n-Evaluation suite. The PIs will collect optimizations for a suite of high-level benchmarks that can be used to evaluate concept-based optimizations. An important benchmark in this regard will be to demonstrate that     generic optimizations offer the same performance benefits when applied to built-in types as do traditional     type-specific optimizations.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe proposed research will have:\r\n- Direct impact on the future development of mainstream programming languages that support generic    programming (e.g., C++, C#, and Java), and on their standard libraries. \r\n-Support for  generic programming in these languages that will provide valuable high-level information about   user-defined types,making high-level and concept-based optimization more widely applicable. \r\n\r\nThis project will directly train graduate students and post-doctoral researchers in the emerging field of   generic programming. Results from our research will be integrated into graduate programming coursesand into textbooks.",
