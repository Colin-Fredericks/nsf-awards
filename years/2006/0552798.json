The program emphasizes the preparation of students for careers in science and engineering through one-on-one collaboration with faculty who are experienced undergraduate student research mentors. Over a dozen research projects are offered ranging from solar system studies, to work with short- or long-period variable stars and cataclysmic variables, to target of opportunity observations of supernova remnants, active galactic nuclei, and gamma-ray burst optical counterparts. Twelve REU students will use the SARA Observatory in Arizona during the course of their summer research activities. At the conclusion of the summer all students will present a talk on their summer research topic and prepare a paper for publication. Students will have support to present their results at a national meeting during the following academic year. \r\n\r\nThe NSF/REU summer intern program is the core of SARAs effort to become a center for undergraduate education and research in astronomy for the southeastern U.S. Recruiting encompasses the entire U.S., and includes a commitment to attract minority applicants, and provide for gender equality and student diversity.\r\n\r\nThis site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n",
