 "awd_abstract_narration": "Summary\r\n\r\nThe project objectives are to broaden participation in computing doctoral\r\nprograms by providing a year-round research experience that will immerse\r\nundergraduates into the activities and culture of a research lab. The activities\r\ninclude a summer research experience and an academic year experience\r\nintroducing students to computing research methodologies and a broad array of\r\ncomputing research disciplines. \r\n\r\nStudents will receive support from peer and faculty mentors. Students will\r\ntake a GRE prep course and will be shown how to apply to and succeed in\r\ngraduate school. The targeted student participants are women and\r\nunderrepresented minority students who are rising juniors,\r\npredominantly from non-doctoral institutions. The intended impact is that a high\r\nnumber of REU students will apply to computing doctoral programs.\r\n\r\nNTELLECTURAL MERIT \r\nProject merit resides in the contributions to computing research that will be\r\nproduced by the undergraduate students participating in the REU Site.\r\nAdditionally, the program evaluation will inform efforts to recruit undergraduate \r\nstudents to doctoral programs by demonstrating the success and challenges of this\r\nREU Site structure for motivating students to apply to doctoral programs in computing.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACT \r\nThe PIs  anticipate increased numbers of students from underrepresented populations in\r\ncomputing who successfully participate in research and who apply to and are accepted into graduate \r\nprograms in computing.",
