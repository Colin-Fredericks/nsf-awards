 "awd_abstract_narration": "Central Michigan University is a charter member of a collaboration of 10\r\ninstitutions that worked together to construct a million dollar, high\r\nefficiency neutron detector for use at the National Superconducting\r\nCyclotron Laboratory.  The Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) is a critical\r\ninstrument in the study of nuclei far from stability. One of the unique\r\naspects of the collaboration is that many of the members of the\r\ncollaboration are from primarily undergraduate institutions and the\r\ninvolvement of undergraduate students is fundamental goal of the project. \r\nIn the MoNA collaboration undergraduate students from Central Michigan\r\nUniversity have play integral roles in the construction and operation of\r\nMoNA; they have built detector bars, wired electronics, written code, sat\r\nshifts, and done both on- and off-line data analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MoNA collaboration has been remarkably successful at involving\r\nundergraduate students in front-line research. This proposal will permit\r\nthe PI and his undergraduates from Central Michigan University to continue\r\nto participate in the experimental program. In addition, the proposal\r\npresents a model for not only sustaining the momentum of an active\r\ncollaboration based on students and faculty from undergraduate\r\ndepartments, but also moves the collaboration to more actively involve\r\nundergraduates in all the experimental runs and in data analysis. If these\r\nmeasures are successful, they will provide a prototype for involving\r\nundergraduates in cutting-edge experimental physics at user facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
