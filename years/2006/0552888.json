 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bioinformatics Program at Loyola University of Chicago will offer an integrated and comprehensive learning and research experience to ten undergraduates distributed across the disciplines of biology, biochemistry, computer science and statistics.  Seventeen Loyola faculty members from the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, and Statistics are engaged in research utilizing or developing the tools of bioinformatics or the statistical evaluation of these applications, and students will be matched with a mentor whose research area most closely corresponds to their stated interests or background.  Through a nine-week program of hands-on research, workshops, seminars, regular group meetings, field trips, and other shared experiences, students will be exposed to the major disciplines that drive bioinformatics, and the unique challenges that bioinformatics scientists face.  They will learn to appreciate the power of the innovative integration of tools from diverse scientific cultures to answer previously unresolvable questions. The program will culminate with a trip to the National Center for Biotechnology Information in Bethesda, MD, followed by preparation and presentation of their findings to their peers, faculty mentors, and the Loyola science and math community in a formal conference setting.  Students from institutions with limited research opportunities, and women and minorities are particularly encouraged to apply. For additional information contact Dr. Howard M. Laten at hlaten@luc.edu or 773-508-3640, or visit the program's web site: http://reu.cs.luc.edu.",
