The graduate student fellows will bring their discoveries and excitement for investigation into classrooms to improve content knowledge and provide opportunities for inquiry learning for teachers and students.  Graduate students will participate in courses, reflective seminars and classroom experiences to provide them with the knowledge of learning processes and opportunities to encourage and support inquiry learning related to their research interests.  Cooperating teachers will participate in summer seminars, research internships and reflective seminars.  As a team, the fellows and teachers will design and implement lessons designed to spark the interest of students in science and related careers.\r\n\r\n",
