The U.S. principal organizer, Gary Balas of the University of Minnesota, will work with international partners, Jozsef Bokor at the Budapest Technical University and Francesco Borrelli, from the Italian University del Sannio in Benevento, to conduct a workshop focused on problems associated with algorithms for design, implementation, verification and validation of safety systems.  Discussions should benefit from U.S. expertise in robust control theory and implementation of adaptive control algorithms and from European strengths in power plant fault detection and isolation, vehicle control systems, and embedded control software design.  Results are expected to address questions at the nexus of hybrid and robust control and lead participants to identification of common theoretical and computational issues that, with further research, could yield novel approaches to real time control for hybrid systems.  Success would have implications for safety critical systems, ranging from aircraft flight control, to medical devices and nuclear power plants.  \r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary workshop fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.   Broader impacts include early career introduction of junior U.S. faculty and graduate students to leading control theorists and engineers in the international research community.",
