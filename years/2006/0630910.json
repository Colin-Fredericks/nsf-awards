 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on women students from rural settings.   Viterbo is actively recruiting academically able, financially needy women from its rural service area.  The program is addressing the challenges many rural students face, deficits in high school preparation and lack of knowledge about potential science careers.  Selection criteria for CLASS Scholars include a GPA of at least 3.3, a minimum ACT score of 24, and documented financial need equal to at least 50% of Viterbo's cost of attendance. Two cohorts of 10 are receiving initial $5,500 scholarships, renewable to $21,500 over four years.\r\n\r\n The project is leading to increased enrollment of women students to study chemistry, biochemistry and biotechnology at Viterbo University. Scholarship students are receiving academic support in order to overcome the deficits in preparation. Relevant service learning experiences being offered are helping scholarship students develop qualities of ethics and leadership.  Well-prepared science students are graduating within the program and obtaining employment or further education in their field. CLASS Scholars live and study in a Community of Learners, promoting academic motivation and social support. Other interventions include aggressive math and study skills remediation and active mentoring by faculty advisors and others.  Service learning opportunities involving summer research experiences and Career Services assistance are preparing the students for employment or graduate programs.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed project is adding to our knowledge concerning working with talented but underprepared students. It is thoroughly planned and well organized.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project is leading to increased participation of women in the chemical sciences, where they are underrepresented. It is benefiting society by increasing the number of well educated and skilled scientists to meet the national need.\r\n",
