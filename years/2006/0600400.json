 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 0600400\r\nMatthew Boylan\r\n\r\nIn the last few decades, modular forms have been studied intensely.  They naturally occur as generating functions for many diverse objects of arithmetic interest such as L-values (in arithmetic geometry and \r\nelsewhere), representation numbers of positive definite quadratic forms, and partitions.  Most prominently, modular forms were key players in \r\nWiles' recent proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.  In this proposal, the \r\ninvestigator proposes to study a variety of arithmetic objects whose \r\ngenerating functions have modular properties.  For example, he expects to \r\nstudy the congruence properties and distribution in residue classes of \r\npartitions, algebraic parts of central critical values of modular \r\nL-functions, singular moduli, values of Gaussian hypergeometric functions, class numbers of number fields, and certain invariants attached to \r\nelliptic curves and motives.  In doing this project, he expects to use, \r\nfor example, p-adic techniques and techniques involving Galois \r\nrepresentations and combinatorics.\r\n\r\nThe area of the proposed research is in number theory.  Number theory is a classical subject; some of the objects of interest to the investigator were also studied by Euler and Gauss.  One such object, the partition function, is particularly simple to define: it counts the number of ways to write a positive integer as a sum of smaller positive integers. However, as is often the case in number theory, many of the natural questions on the arithmetic of the partition function have proved to be rather difficult.  Major advances in our understanding of this function rely on sophisticated modern techniques in modular forms, such as those suggested by the proposed research.\r\n",
