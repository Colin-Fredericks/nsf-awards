 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal aims to  develop novel numerical methods in porous media.\r\nInitially the Darcy model is examined under the framework of a\r\nPetrov-Galerkin enriched method (PGEM). The method consists in\r\nenriching differently trial and test funtions. The test function\r\nenrichments resembles residual-free bubbles, with zero condition\r\nfor the normal compoenent of the velocity. This allows for\r\nstatic condensation and computation of the enrichment for the\r\ntrial function. It turns out that this enrichment is a variation\r\nof the Raviart-Thomas. This is eliminated at the element level,\r\nso that the computational formulation of the current method is\r\nin fact that of the original spaces span by continuous piecewise linears\r\nand piecewise constants. A detailed study for the P1/P0 element\r\nand other higher order elements will be pursued along with their\r\nerror analyses.\r\n\r\nThe methods developed in this work are key to simulate intricate\r\nlarge heterogeneuous domains which is a major challenge in porous\r\nmedia field, as in oil reservoir, contaminant transport and water\r\nresource problems, just to cite a few of them. The methods proposed herein\r\ncontribute to decrease large scale computations since the matrices\r\nare no longer semi-definite. The methods are also competitive since\r\nthe support of the unknows is equal to the original Galerkin method.\r\nIn summary, we are pursuing more efficient methods that can overcome \r\ncomplex mixed methods which has dominated the field over many decades.\r\nThe problems we are addressing have impact on environmental, energy\r\nand are of use to DOE.\r\n",
