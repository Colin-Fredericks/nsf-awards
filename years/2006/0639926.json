 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmental Engineering, Infrastructures and Environmental   Justice: Project Summary\r\nWith the exception of natural disasters, environmental impacts to the human population and\r\necosystems in the nineteenth, twentieth and twenty first centuries can be traced directly to\r\nindustrial engineering systems and the built environment. The types of wastes produced by these\r\nengineering systems radically changed with the rise of the petrochemical age after World War II\r\nand have been shown to have had a disproportionate impact on the environment and health of\r\nminority and poor communities in the United States and in developing countries. Intellectual\r\nMerit: Making Environmental History Making More Inclusive The intellectual merit of the\r\nproposed work is that it will advance the fields of environmental history, the history of\r\ntechnology, history of science, history of public health and African American history by\r\nproducing histories that elucidate the diverse (racial, ethnic, class based and gendered) human\r\nexperiences with industrial technologies developed after World War II and the concomitant\r\nenvironmental pollution and environmental health problems associated with them in the United\r\nStates. This proposal is directed at initiating research that will begin to fill an important\r\nvoid in all of these disciplines.   The objective of this project is to research and document the\r\ninterrelationships between the history of waste water treatment systems and municipal sanitary\r\nsystems on the one hand,  and the claims of environmental injustice by African American communities in the Great Lakes region on the other hand. Although environmental pollution is color blind, this work, along with studies by other scholars will demonstrate how such developments have had a significant and disproportionate  impact on racial and class minorities.  Broader Impacts: Understanding Engineering Design and  Environmental Disparities . The broader impact of the proposed work is that it will give policy makers, grassroots activists, educators and academics from multiple fields (i.e. sociology, law, urban planning and public health) a historically grounded understanding of the interrelationships between the development of engineering systems and claims of environmental justice. The research data gathered from studying these interrelationships will also be critical in helping to resolve environmental justice debates (past, current and future) that are taking place locally,  nationally and internationally.\r\n",
