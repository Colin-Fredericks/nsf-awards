 "awd_abstract_narration": "The DeBakey Institute at Texas A&M University offers a unique opportunity for ten undergraduate students (5 engineering and 5 life sciences) to explore basic cardiovascular research in a 10-week summer program.  The DeBakey Institute is home to the only colony of bats in the world dedicated to microvascular research.  Advances in the basic science of mechanobiology (the interaction of mechanical forces and biological processes) require the computational approaches of engineers as well as the experimental approaches of life scientists.  In the first week, students will attend Bat Boot Camp to learn about possible projects and receive intensive training in microvascular biology, research ethics, measurement methods, and abstract and poster preparation.  Students will choose one of five projects and join interdisciplinary project teams that include both life science and engineering researchers.  In the 2nd week, each team will address the project problem using the experimental tools learned in Boot Camp under the guidance of faculty mentors.  Students will then conduct hands-on experiments guided by engineering and life sciences faculty members.  Students will learn the use of especially designed tools to control the microscope from a remote location via the Internet.  By the end of the 10-week period, the students will prepare an abstract for presentation at a conference.  After completing the program, students may continue their research from their home institutions, using remote Internet-based access to the microscope and computer-mediated communication tools to maintain the network ties arising from the program.  Students will be selected based on 1) a statement of interest, 2) fulfillment of at least two semesters of biology, 3) a description of prior research experiences, and 4) a faculty recommendation. Applications from students with limited opportunities for research or from groups under-represented in science are especially encouraged to apply. More information is available by visiting http://ebat.tamu.edu/reu or by contacting Dr. Christopher Quick at cquick@tamu.edu or 979-845-8460.",
