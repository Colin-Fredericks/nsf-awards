Here \"strong\" refers to effects that substantially change\r\nthe overall dynamics of the fluid system when compared to the\r\nstandard deterministic setting.  In general, wave-mean\r\ninteraction theory describes the nonlinear interactions between\r\nsmall-scale waves and the large-scale mean flows on which the\r\nwaves are propagating.  There exists a substantial body of\r\nclassical wave-mean interaction that is based on deterministic\r\nwaves, but very little has been done on the stochastic version of\r\nthe problem.  The present work combines a number of projects\r\naimed at extending the classical theory in this direction. \r\nExamples include the use of stochastic theory for wave dynamics\r\nand nonlinear wave breaking, for two-dimensional wave-vortex\r\nturbulence, and for the derivation of effective mean-flow\r\nequations for stratified flows subject to high-frequency\r\noscillatory forcing. \r\n\r\n     Interactions between waves and mean currents include the\r\ndriving of long-shore currents and vortical motions such as rip\r\ncurrents by breaking waves on a beach (important for civil\r\nengineering and naval operations), the creation of clear-air\r\nturbulence by breaking waves in the stratosphere (important for\r\naviation and the environment), and the driving of the global air\r\ncirculation by breaking waves in the mesosphere, above 60km\r\naltitude or so (important for climate evolution).  These\r\nprocesses are far too small in spatial scale to be resolvable in\r\nnumerical models for atmosphere-ocean dynamics, which means that\r\nin these models their impact must be put in by hand based on\r\ntheory and observations.  This is called the \"parametrization\"\r\nproblem for unresolvable processes, and even on the biggest\r\nsupercomputers it will remain a bottleneck problem for decades to\r\ncome.  Now, in the classical \"deterministic\" theory in this area,\r\nthe prevailing conditions are assumed to be simple and perfectly\r\nknown.  However, in reality, the prevailing conditions are often\r\ncomplex and poorly known.  Stochastic theory addresses this by\r\nallowing for uncertain, or random, components of the situation. \r\nThis project brings modern stochastic theory to bear on the kind\r\nof wave-mean interaction problems that are relevant to\r\natmosphere-ocean science.  There are two principal project aims:\r\nfirst, finding new effects that are missed by the deterministic\r\ntheory; and second, laying the foundation for a more realistic\r\nrepresentation of wave-mean interactions in numerical models for\r\nuse in climate prediction, aviation, and near-shore civil\r\nengineering. \r\n",
