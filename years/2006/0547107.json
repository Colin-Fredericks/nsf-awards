 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marr   0547107  Intellectual merit. The intellectual merits of this project are that it will provide a new tool for the quantification of air pollutant emissions, that it represents the first direct measurement of  anthropogenic fluxes of nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and fine particulate matter to the atmosphere, and that it will significantly enhance understanding of air pollutant emissions. This method is a significant advance over the current approach, which relies on engineering estimates to predict emissions. These measurements will provide significantly improved data for the advancement of air quality science and management.\r\nBroader impacts. Ultimately, this research will lead to more effective air quality control strategies and cleaner air through both science and education. New air quality regulations are expected to cost over $6.5 billion per year and potentially save $120 billion in health-related expenses. Accurate measurements of emissions will ensure that efforts to reduce air pollution are optimized for cost effectiveness. The projects integrated educational components will have at least two significant impacts. First, introducing K-12 students to our field measurements will excite them about science and engineering and will encourage more of them to enter technical fields of study. Second, through the combination of new wireless classroom technology and active learning techniques, undergraduate students will gain a deeper understanding of environmental engineering and will be more likely to retain the knowledge throughout their careers. This technology may especially aid minority and female students to overcome cultural, gender, and social barriers that inhibit them from participating more actively in traditionally taught classes. A larger pool of better educated scientists and engineers will improve our ability to successfully tackle air pollution and other environmental challenges in the coming decades.\r\n",
