 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Forensics Advanced Technology Education (CFATE) project is a regional collaboration of four Massachusetts community colleges (Middlesex, Bristol, Bunker Hill and Northern Essex) and the University of Massachusetts Boston (UMass Boston) to meet the regional need of law enforcement for trained computer forensics (CF) technicians. The programs uniquely combine the disciplines of Information Technology (IT) and Criminal Justice (CJ) and are tailored to the needs of each institution.\r\n\r\nCFATE focuses on achieving three goals. The first is to create computer forensics programs that align with law enforcement, public safety, private industry and homeland security needs to ensure consistent, current and flexible training. CFATE works with local/regional law enforcement agencies and industries to determine the needed skill set. Faculty workshops are being conducted to facilitate integration of CJ and IT into courses and expedite curriculum development on a consortium wide basis. CF experts work with the colleges to ensure that materials are rich in real world content. UMass Boston is developing baccalaureate programs that accept community college graduates and provide them with career pathways. In addition, CFATE is developing stand-alone courses and programs for IT professionals and CJ practitioners. The second goal is to offer regional professional development opportunities for educators to develop expertise needed for teaching these programs. In addition to workshops on CJ and IT integration, extensive workshops on CF and the use of state-of-the-art software are being offered. Curriculum development workshops emphasize learner-centered pedagogy that give students needed skills. CF experts work individually with faculty and mentor them as they deliver CF courses. The third goal is to expand the capacity in the region to attract students from diverse backgrounds to CF programs at each institution and support them in gaining employment in related positions. CFATE is creating recruitment materials such as CDs, brochures, and interactive websites to reach local schools and local and regional community organizations. This is combined with targeted personal outreach to schools and organizations.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project is developing programs in which students learn CF technology, security practices, operating systems and information processing in conjunction with investigative procedures, applicable criminal law, and the nature of the CJ system. These programs integrate IT and CJ throughout and are prototypes of IT education in the context of another discipline. The programs are being developed by \"backward design\" in which the required skill sets (outcomes) are identified first and then the curriculum and assessments are developed. An evaluator assists CFATE in developing assessments of student learning. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: By developing programs at four different institutions, CFATE is creating a model that can be widely exported to other institutions. Presentations, workshops and posted curriculum disseminate the program. The five CFATE institutions serve communities with large diverse populations. CFATE targets community organizations and high schools to recruit students and increase the diversity of the technical workforce.",
