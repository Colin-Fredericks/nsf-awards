 "awd_abstract_narration": "High Pressure research is growing and very active in many fields of condensed matter such as physics, chemistry and materials and planetary science and even biology. Understanding simple matter at extreme conditions has been made possible by new synchrotron beam lines that allow quick identification of new high pressure phases and materials with yet unknown properties. New neutron sources allow the structural studies of light materials. Advances in computational science allow predictions of new structures and material properties at the extreme conditions of planetary interiors. The Gordon Conference on Research at High Pressure is one of the few conferences that allows for an intense interaction between younger and older scientists. The presentations at the 2006 meeting are a balanced mix of the latest results from both experienced key researchers and younger promising scientists. Sessions include topics of interest to the diverse fields using high pressure as a tool. The Gordon Conference is therefore a platform for new inspirations, cross-fertilization of ideas, and collaborations. The requested funds will be used predominantly to support US students, post docs and junior faculty who would not otherwise be able to attend the conference. This award receives support from the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Earth Sciences.",
