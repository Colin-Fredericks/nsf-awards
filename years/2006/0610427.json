 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Minnesota Zoo and Educational Web Adventures will design and develop \"WolfQuest,\" an online, 3-D, multiplayer videogame based upon the behavior, biology and social structure of the gray wolf.  This dynamic interactive experience will allow learners to become a virtual wolf (avatar) to explore gray wolves within an authentic virtual replication of wolf habitat and social structure.  The scientifically accurate graphic representations of the virtual environment will afford rich and robust learning of wolf behavior, biology and habitat ecology.  Participants are intended to emerge from the learning experience with a clear understanding of wolf conservation issues in the real world.  \"WolfQuest\" is supported by a website that will function as a self-sustaining community of learners who will participate in discussion forums with wolf experts, and receive ongoing gameplay information and interaction with other participants.  Additionally, the project website will provide educational guides for parents and teachers, interpretive materials, incentives to reward participants' achievements acquired through \"WolfQuest\" gameplay and provide a link to informal environmental organizations throughout the country.   The national informal education network will afford regional customization of \"WolfQuest,\" as well as provide social interaction among participants and organizations.  The national participant network will disseminate and promote the \"WolfQuest\" game and wolf-related science programs.  Two kiosk installations will be deployed at the Minnesota Zoo and the International Wolf Center for extended learning opportunities at those sites.  Project assessment will aggregate data on learners' content acquisition, attitudinal change, game engagement and will yield guidelines for the field on effective practices in development of science education games, along with appropriate methodologies for evaluating game-based learning.",
