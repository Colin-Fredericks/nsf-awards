 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 7th Usenix Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI) is scheduled for November 6-8 2006. OSDI and its \"sister symposium\" SOSP have been the leading forum for innovative research in operating systems for over 30 years.  OSDI 2006 brings together researchers from around the world to present and discuss the latest results. Topics include the performance, functionality, and security of kernels, file systems, and networks, ubiquitous and mobile computing, sensor networks, overlay and peer-to-peer communications, and power management. This NSF proposal requested funding to support the attendance of 25 US-based graduate students. Participation in leading conferences is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work. The support requested in this proposal makes possible the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend. Particular attention is paid to directing support towards underrepresented minorities including women, African-Americans, and Native Americans.\r\n",
