 "awd_abstract_narration": "The insects and spiders of Thailand, one of the most \r\nbiologically diverse countries in the world, will be sampled and \r\ninventoried. Various traps will monitor these arthropods in 30 of \r\nThailand's National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries over a three year \r\nperiod. These collections will be identified to the family level and \r\nshipped to The University of Kentucky, where they will be further \r\nidentified and then shipped to about 100 collaborating scientists around \r\nthe world. Access to conduct research on Thailand's biodiversity is \r\navailable at an unprecedented level, making previously mysterious habitats \r\navailable to investigation. A window of opportunity has opened that may not \r\nexist for a prolonged period, due to political decisions, and habitat \r\ndestruction caused by rapidly growing populations.\r\n   \r\n     Products of the grant will be disseminated broadly through \r\ntraditional publications, databases, and web products, which will be \r\nwritten in both Thai and English. Bridges between the international \r\nscientific community and Thailand will be built to the mutual benefit of \r\nboth, and the resulting research will be of importance to Thai conservation \r\nresearch, and the many applied sciences that depend on good taxonomy such \r\nas the biological control of forest and agricultural pests. Products will \r\ninclude species checklists, new species descriptions, interactive \r\nidentification keys, bigger and better collections, and an increased \r\nability to identify insects that are a threat to the international \r\ncommunity as invasive pest species. The research programs of all of the 100 \r\nor more collaborating scientists will be enriched with new biological \r\ndata.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in biodiversity \r\nmanagement both at the University of Kentucky and in Thailand.\r\n",
