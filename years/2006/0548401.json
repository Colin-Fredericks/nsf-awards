Strategies for change focus on structural reform, broad faculty awareness and engagement, and decision-maker accountability. A Faculty Affairs Office (FAO) will serve as a sustainable structural focal point for policy revision and a portfolio of programs designed to foster awareness, seek solutions, and disseminate project actions and outcomes. A competitive awards program will engage academic units to examine the status of women, including women faculty of color, and develop creative approaches for the specific needs of the unit. The FAO will be located in the Provost's Office to facilitate administrative accountability for making gains towards ADVANCE goals.\r\n",
