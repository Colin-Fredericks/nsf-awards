Adams, Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Kentucky\r\nAbstract\r\nThis CAREER proposal outlines an integrated research and education program designed\r\nto provide significant advances in the tools, methods, and applications of high fidelity\r\nelectromagnetic simulations in order to meet the challenges presented by existing and\r\nemerging technological needs.\r\nIntellectual Merit. The state-of-the-art in time-harmonic computational\r\nelectromagnetics (CEM) will be advanced through the development and implementation\r\nof a novel framework for modular, fast, direct electromagnetic simulations. The central\r\nconcept underlying this effort is a new, physics-based organizing principle for\r\nsimulations of electromagnetic phenomena. The organizing principle consists of\r\nrepresenting electromagnetic solution operators in a complete basis of localized solution\r\nmodes which satisfy global boundary conditions. These modes are referred to as LOGOS\r\n(local-global solution) modes. The proposed research activities will develop algorithms\r\nand tools based on the LOGOS expansions for CEM applications. The resulting\r\nframework and algorithms will provide contributions to the field of CEM not afforded by\r\nexisting technologies.\r\nBroader Impact. The simulation algorithms resulting from this research effort are\r\nexpected to impact many areas of computational physics outside the EM field. To further\r\nbroaden the educational and societal impacts of this effort, local resources will be used to\r\nattract undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented populations. These\r\nstudents will in turn be asked to participate in outreach activities to regional high schools,\r\nthus providing role models to students in underrepresented STEM populations.",
