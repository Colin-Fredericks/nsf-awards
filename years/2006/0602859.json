 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical\r\nOrganic materials present new opportunities for both scientific and technical advances due to a nearly limitless combination of carbon-based compounds. The present work explores the nature of specific \"low dimensional\" organic materials where the phenomena of electrical conduction and magnetism occur in either linear chains or two-dimensional planes. Under these conditions organic materials can exhibit important physical properties - superconductivity, transistor-like switching in electric or magnetic fields, and situations where electrical and magnetic processes can communicate. Powerful experimental methods including neutron scattering, magnetic resonance, high magnetic fields, and hydrostatic pressure can be used reveal the electronic and magnetic structures that control these materials. The diversity of physical systems investigated and methods employed provide an interface with a broad scientific community through association with the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. This flexibility allows the group to host visitors, students, and teachers through scientific exchange and educational outreach programs. The project will open new vistas for organic materials studies, and will train students in advanced techniques.\r\n\r\nTechnical\r\nThis work explores the nature of interacting electronic and magnetic structure in low dimensional organic materials. The interaction between localized spin chains and delocalized electron conducting chains produces coupled metal - insulator, magnetic,  or superconducting ground states at low temperatures. Particular attention is given to materials where high magnetic fields, pressure, or electric fields produce fundamental changes in the ground state properties and dynamics of charge and spin. Powerful experimental methods including electrical transport, magnetic resonance, high magnetic fields, and hydrostatic pressure are used reveal the electronic and magnetic structure that controls the physics of these materials. Group activities, due to the diversity of both physical systems investigated and methods employed, allow an effective interface with the broader condensed matter community through association with the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. This flexibility allows the hosting of visitors, students, and teachers through a variety of scientific exchange and educational outreach programs. High risk pilot projects in neutron scattering and photoemission will open new vistas for molecular materials studies, and will train students in these advanced techniques.",
