 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nAbstract\r\nMirkovic\r\n\r\nThe proposal is  directed towards  the geometry underlying the\r\nLanglands program. A major and expanding influence are the ideas from \r\nquantum field theory. The ``Critical Quantization'' program aims to develop a \r\nformalism, that would unify approaches to modular representation theories\r\nand to representations of affine Lie algebras at a critical level, and\r\nshould have wide including the study of derived categories of coherent \r\nsheaves.\r\nThe  ``Quadratic Koszul Duality'' project attempts to give a\r\ngeometric approach to a family of dualities that\r\nappear throughout representation theory, culminating with the Cherednik\r\nFourier transform.  Finally, we propose\r\ncertain ``completely algebro-geometric'' approach to Class Field Theory \r\nand Langlands program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project aims towards relating and unifying developments in mathematics\r\n(representation theory, algebraic geometry, number theory)\r\nand theoretical particle physics (quantum field theory and in \r\nparticular string theory). The main development in mathematics\r\nin the last decade was the influence of predictions derived  from \r\nQuantum Field Theory. This has  resulted in some inroads and I expect \r\nthe direction to reverse with mathematics contributing \r\nessentially to the understanding  of particle physics and the \r\n``Grand Unification'' project of giving a consistent description of known \r\nphysical forces.\r\nThe main goal of the project is to take certain steps in this direction\r\nby explaining mathematically certain elements of String Theory and \r\nQuantum Field Theory in general.\r\n\r\n",
