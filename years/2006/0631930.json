 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates whether responding to student uncertainty over and above correctness improves learning during computer tutoring. The investigation is performed in the context of a spoken dialogue tutoring system, where student speech provides many linguistic cues (e.g. intonation, pausing, word usage) that computational linguistics research suggests can be used to detect uncertainty. Intelligent tutoring systems research suggests that uncertainty is part of the learning process, and has hypothesized that to increase system effectiveness, it is critical to respond to more than correctness. However, most existing tutoring systems respond only to student correctness, and few controlled experiments have yet investigated whether also responding to uncertainty can improve learning.\r\n\r\nThis research designs and implements two different enhancements to the spoken dialogue tutoring system, to test two hypotheses in the tutoring literature concerning how tutors can effectively respond to uncertainty over and above correctness. The first hypothesis is that student uncertainty and incorrectness both represent learning impasses, i.e., opportunities to improve understanding. This hypothesis is addressed with an enhanced system version that treats uncertainty in the same way that incorrectness is currently treated (i.e., with additional subdialogue to increase understanding). The second hypothesis is that more optimal responses can be developed by modeling how human tutor responses to correctness change when the student is uncertain. This hypothesis is addressed by analyzing human tutor dialogue act responses (i.e. content and presentation) to student uncertainty over and above correctness in an existing tutoring corpus, then implementing these responses in a second enhanced system version. Two controlled experiments are then performed. The first tests the relative impact of the two adaptations on learning using a Wizard of Oz version of the system, with a human (Wizard) detecting uncertainty and performing speech recognition and language understanding. The second experiment tests the impact of the best-performing adaptation from the first experiment in the context of the real system, with the system processing the speech and language and detecting uncertainty in a fully automated manner.\r\n\r\nThe major intellectual contribution of the research is to demonstrate whether significant improvements in learning are achieved by adapting to student uncertainty over and above correctness during tutoring, to advance the state of the art by fully automating and evaluating user uncertainty detection and adaptation in a working spoken dialogue system, and to investigate any different effects of this adaptation under ideal versus actual system conditions.\r\n",
