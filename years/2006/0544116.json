 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award combines research on low-dimensional conductors with\r\neducational activities for university and high-school students.\r\n\r\nSince future nano-devices will operate in the presence of time-dependent fields and in\r\nother far-from-equilibrium conditions, an understanding of non-equilibrium transport on\r\nthe nanoscale is crucially important. Thus, a realistic description of quantum wires raises\r\nthe difficult problem of non-equilibrium effects in the presence of electron interactions.\r\nSolids always contain impurities, and hence an understanding of mesoscopic transport is\r\nimpossible without an understanding of the interplay of disorder and interaction. The\r\nresearch will employ a combination of systematic analytical and numerical \r\nmethods to investigate interaction effects in far-from-equilibrium transport in quantum\r\nwires and the interplay of interaction and disorder in low-dimensional mesoscopic\r\nconductors. The research will focus on the following problems:\r\n1. Non-equilibrium transport in Luttinger liquids. In the ratchet effect, a dc current is\r\ngenerated by an external ac field in a spatially asymmetric system. This effect is expected\r\nto help in the development of future nano-diodes, nano-switches, and nano-transistors. The\r\nexisting theoretical studies of the ratchet effect have focused on Fermi-liquid systems and\r\nsimplified models of non-interacting electrons. However, the electronic interaction is\r\nsignificant and results in the formation of a Luttinger liquid in quantum wires. The\r\nproposed research will include a systematic investigation of the ratchet effect in Luttinger\r\nliquids using the Keldysh technique, bosonisation, renormalization group, large-N mean-field\r\napproach, and numerical methods.\r\n2. Spin transport far from equilibrium. There is growing interest in the physics of spin\r\ntransport in mesoscopic systems. An important part of this development is the investigation\r\nof possible ways to produce a spin current. The proposed research will include a theoretical\r\nstudy of the spin ratchet effect in Luttinger liquids.\r\n3. Transport in quantum Hall systems. Recent experiments on interference and tunneling\r\nof fractionally charged quasi-particles raise new fundamental questions concerning quasiparticle\r\ntransport which cannot be answered by standard methods. The proposed research\r\nwill combine an approach which treats a 2D electron gas as a system of interacting\r\nquantum wires with the bosonization procedure and with the methods developed in the\r\ntheory of soft matter systems with quenched disorder. The approach can help to solve the\r\nproblem of QHE plateau transition.\r\n\r\nEducational activities will include the development of an introductory\r\ncourse in nanoscience targeted primarily at freshmen; integration of recent developments in\r\nthe fields related to the grant into the regular physics curriculum; participation of\r\nstudents and postdocs in research and related activities such as a journal club; and outreach\r\nto Providence inner-city high schools. An internet-based high-school-level tutorial will be\r\nprepared on the basis of the freshmen course.\r\n\r\nOn intellectual grounds, the proposed research will advance the knowledge about\r\nstrongly correlated electronic systems. The basic laws of quantum mechanics have been\r\nknown for a long time, but emergent properties of many-body systems still constitute a\r\nfield full of puzzles and surprises. Progress in this field is of fundamental importance. The\r\nproposed research will benefit the emergent field of far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body\r\nsystems. The proposed work will employ analogies between low-dimensional electron\r\nsystems and soft condensed matter and thus bridge the existing gap between hard and soft\r\nmatter physics. The proposed research will also have broader impacts. A theoretical\r\nunderstanding of transport in quantum wires is critical for nanocircuitry. Thus, the results\r\nof this proposal will be important for the multi-disciplinary nanoscience community. The\r\neducation component will advance discovery and understanding of nanoscience while\r\npromoting teaching, training and learning at different levels and broaden the participation\r\nof underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nNon-technical abstract:\r\n\r\nThe research focus is on the fundamental properties of materials in confined geometries as are found on the nanoscale.  At these scales the theories we usually use have to be modified to account for confinement and this brings issues like disorder and interactions between electrons to the forefront.  The research will study these fundamental issues that may form the basis for future nanoscale devices (nanoelectronics).  The principal investigator will develop and teach an introductory course on nanoscience for college freshmen.  He will also participate in outreach to high school students through the internet and in person.  Research results will be integrated into course material.\r\n\r\n",
