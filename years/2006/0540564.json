 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML) proposes a collaboration with The Revolving Museum and Lowell High School that uses project-based learning to introduce students to computing. The projects will leverage existing technologies, including small processing boards for building robots and moving objects, computer game software, and an interface board that allows a variety of sensors to be used to provide input to a computer. This technology will be packaged with on-line and print support materials as \"projects-in-a-box\" that are given to students. These kits will initially be designed by the PIs, but will be modified and extended by student participants. Projects will include computer games with novel interfaces, story telling, and interactive art projects. Student workshops will culminate in exhibits at The Revolving Museum.\r\n\r\nStudent participants will be in college, high school, and middle school. UML undergraduates from outside the major will be recruited into a new course, called CS0, that will introduce computer science using our materials in a project-based context and prepare the students to be mentors. The undergraduates will assist in workshops held at The Revolving Museum for Lowell High School students. With additional instruction from the museum staff, students will develop technical art projects for public exhibit. This community context will dispel the notion of the asocial programmer, and provide positive, realistic experiences in teamwork, design, and programming. Students will learn that computing can be used in a variety of ways as a part of many disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the program are to increase the participation of women and minorities in computing through the sue of innovative and interactive technologies, to broaden student understanding of the field of computing, to introduce computing to the public through art exhibitions of the projects, and to build community with mentoring opportunities for students. The project will be disseminated through two summer workshops. Participants will be recruited regionally and nationally from universities, high schools, and community groups.\r\n",
