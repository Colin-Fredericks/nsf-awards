 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes an energy harvesting technology for widely disbursed wireless sensor networks. These sensors need long-lived power supplies that can harvest energy from the environment to enable a truly autonomous operation. It is an objective of the proposed Phase I research effort to demonstrate the components of a very compact and low cost power generation technology. The technology will be based on the generation of fuel from biological substances for the operation of fuel cells. Nanotechnology and biotechnology components will be integrated into the new devices. The biotechnology, materials science, and electrochemistry experience of three organizations will be combined in a cross-disciplinary effort. Cost and performance of the generator will be estimated based on the experimental results.\r\n\r\nEnergy harvesting devices can be used for applications that need a small quantity of power for a long times. These include wireless sensors. The proposed technology can help to enhance America's security by providing compact, cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and long-lived power supplies for widely disbursed wireless sensor networks or other applications. It can be an alternative to established solar, thermal, or vibration harvesting approaches.\r\n",
