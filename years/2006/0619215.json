 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nTexas Tech University will develop an in situ high-pressure, high-temperature Raman scattering system for research and education.   The system will have the following technical features: Raman scattering measurement in situ under high pressure and high temperature, high pressure capability to megabar, high temperature laser heating to thousands of degrees, computerized temperature and sample platform control.  The state-of-the-art microscope will be used for research of a broad range of problems related to novel materials, including physics and chemistry of elemental molecules and diatomic molecular solids, phonons and phonon decay in GaN and AlN, high P-T behavior of the fullerene and inorganic fullerene cluster, single crystalline bulk ScN crystals and alloy, high P-T phase transition and super hard material synthesis, biocompatibility of orthopedic materials, chemical biocompatibility of hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers for intraocular and intrastromal implants, design and optimization of catalysts to achieve higher catalytic outcomes for organic reactions.  The microscope will also be used for an extensive set of outreach and educational programs.  The establishment of this system will foster further scientific collaborations worldwide in our studies to address broad fundamental issues of minerals, semiconductors, catalysts, and biological materials. The proposal brings together a diverse group of researchers. The system will be used for training of postdoctoral researchers and students at all levels through research and directly related courses. It will also be used in an outreach program targeting the local community in an effort to motivate K-12 students to pursue careers in science and engineering.\r\nLay Abstract\r\n\r\nThe in situ high-pressure high-temperature Raman scattering system plays a very special role in high pressure science and technology. Much of the current scientific and technical breakthrough relies on the understanding of the novel high-pressure and high-temperature properties of materials. The proposed in situ high-pressure, high-temperature Raman scattering system provides an unprecedented capability to the local community in an effort to interest K-12 students in science and engineering careers of high-pressure research and thus will lead to a new method to discover new properties and new applications of materials. The new system to be developed at Texas Tech University will greatly enhance an existing program in the area of high pressure science and technologies.   The development and establishment of the system will also contribute greatly to outreach and educational programs, especially through the existing Texas Tech University outreach program emphasizing targeting the local community in an effort to motivate K-12 students to pursue careers in science and engineering. The system will also be available to scientists worldwide to facilitate research collaboration in areas such as high-performance computer chips, micro-machines, high-efficiency catalysts, and better understanding of human body. The technology will also be used to enhance the capabilities of synchrotron facilities in national laboratories.\r\n",
