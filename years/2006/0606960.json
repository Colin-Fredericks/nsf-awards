It has long been known\r\nthat thermal energy charge transfer plays an important role in determining the ionization\r\nstructure, thermal structure, emission spectrum and absorption spectrum for a range of\r\ncosmic plasmas. These include photoionized gas found in planetary nebulae, H II regions,\r\nWolf-Rayet nebulae, luminous blue variable nebulae, Lyman alpha clouds, and the\r\nintergalactic medium; shocks in supernova remnants and Herbig-Haro objects; and\r\nprimordial gas clouds during the epoch of protogalaxy and first star formation.\r\nUnfortunately, many theoretical calculations carried out during the past 25 years in\r\nresponse to the demand for reliable thermal energy charge transfer data are reliable to\r\nonly a factor of 3-10. And while the latest state-of-the-art calculations are expected to be\r\nmore reliable, such efforts are less common and can still be off by a factor of 3 when not\r\nbenchmarked against experiments. However, few laboratory measurements exist despite\r\nthe demand from the community.\r\nTo address this need, an ongoing series of laboratory measurements of thermal energy\r\ncharge transfer will be continued using the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ion-atom\r\nmerged-beams apparatus. Here, measurements will be made of the thermal energy charge\r\ntransfer of C2+, O+, O2+, Se3+, and Kr2+. Reliable charge transfer data for the\r\ncosmically abundant C2+, O+, and O2+ are needed for modeling planetary nebulae and H\r\nII regions as well as shocks in supernovae remnants and Herbig-Harrow objects. Data for\r\nSe3+ and Kr2+ are needed to analyze planetary nebula spectra in order to study both\r\nnucleosynthesis via the slow neutron capture process and convective dredge-up in the\r\nplanetary nebula progenitor stars. These results will be used to produce rate coefficients\r\nwith an estimated accuracy of * 20% and will provide fits for plasma modeling. Modern\r\ncharge transfer theory will also be benchmarked against these results. Finally, the\r\nlaboratory apparatus will be modified so that the metastable fraction in the ion beams can\r\nbe measured and controlled. For beams with a significant metastable fraction, this will\r\nallow the extraction of absolute cross sections for both the ground state and metastable\r\nions in the beam. This new capability will further increase the uniqueness of the Oak\r\nRidge National Laboratory ion-atom merged-beams apparatus.\r\nThe training and professional preparation of a graduate student will be supported. This\r\nstudent will carry out a large portion of the project in partial fulfillment of the\r\nrequirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. The results of this research will be\r\npresented via seminars and colloquia to colleagues in academia, government, and\r\nindustry. Reports at national and international conferences will be given and published in\r\nthe appropriate journals. In addition, this work will further enhance the Columbia/Oak\r\nRidge National Laboratory infrastructure for research and education. Prof. Gary Ferland\r\nat the University of Kentucky will input the new rate coefficients into CLOUDY which is\r\none of the most commonly used codes for modeling photoionized gas.",
