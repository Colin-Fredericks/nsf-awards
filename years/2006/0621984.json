 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop a flexible neural microelectrode array platform technology that is impervious to aqueous solutions and thus suitable for long-term (~ 20 year) medical implants. The approach is to develop a silicon carbide thin film technology suitable for polymer substrates using these films as mechanically-durable, biocompatible, hermetic coatings. The films will be deposited with a precursor used in integrated circuits but has not been developed for biomedical microsystems. Device prototypes will be evaluated for mechanical durability, chemical and hermetic integrity, dielectric quality and biocompatibility using a battery of conventional tests. Finite element modeling will be used to develop improved designs based on testing results.\r\nFrom the materials perspective, this research pushes the extremes of silicon carbide deposition technology by focusing on temperature-sensitive substrates. From the technology perspective, this research addresses a critical issue facing next-generation neural implants; hermetic sealing of mechanically flexible microelectrode arrays equipped with electronics and wireless telemetry. \r\nIn addition to neural prosthetics, this project will impact the development of other implantable microsystems that suffer from moisture absorption, such retinal prostheses, urologic and cardiac sensor systems, as well as non-medical applications, such as flexible displays and portable power. This research compliments an effort by the Department of Veteran's Affairs to develop microsystem technologies for disabled veterans, specifically those that suffer from paralysis and limb loss. Such technologies will also benefit the non-veteran population. This research will positively impact the nation's technology workforce by involving students from underrepresented groups and local high schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
