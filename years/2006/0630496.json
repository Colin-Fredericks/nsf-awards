Participation of graduate students\r\nand young investigators is especially encouraged by devoting a\r\nlarge component of the budget to supporting their travel\r\nexpenses.  The conference themes address mathematical and\r\nphysical aspects of the interaction between thermal, electric,\r\nand mechanical properties in novel crystalline and soft matter\r\nsystems.  The systems addressed include ferroelectric liquid\r\ncrystals and polycrystals, and elastomers.  Applications include\r\nelectro-optical switches for video displays, actuators, sensors\r\nand miniature pumps designed to exploit electro-mechanical\r\ninteractions.  These are important state-of-the-art applications\r\nthat present significant mathematical challenges in their\r\nanalyses.  The speakers are mathematicians and physicists who\r\npresent their research on analysis, modeling, and simulations for\r\nthese systems.  Several common themes are highlighted.  The\r\nnatural setting for these systems is in the form of films,\r\nfilaments, and thin strips.  One theme is the application of\r\ngamma-convergence and compactness techniques to capture\r\nlower-dimensional models.  These systems all have complex energy\r\nlandscapes with many meta-stable states.  A second major theme is\r\ndeterministic and stochastic investigations of dielectric and\r\nferroelectric switching between such states.  A third theme is\r\nthe investigation of flows in these materials. \r\n\r\n     The Society for Natural Philosophy Conferences have a\r\nhistory of being cross-disciplinary endeavors and that spirit is\r\ncentral to this meeting.  The conference is advertised to the\r\nscience community and the list of speakers includes physicists\r\nand engineers.  A goal of the conference is to expose students\r\nand young researchers to the challenges and open problems in this\r\narea.  This is accomplished by supporting the travel expenses for\r\nthese people, having young researchers as speakers, and by\r\nholding a session on future directions. \r\n\r\n",
