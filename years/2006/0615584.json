 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI), jointly supported by the NSF and Department of Energy (DOE), will take place in Cordoba, Argentina in August of 2007, on the topic of interfacial fluid dynamics, from mathematical theory to applications.  Organized by Dr. Lou Kondic of the New Jersey Institute of Technology and George M. Homsy of the University of California-Santa Barbara, the institute will involve approximately 35 participants from the United States and Latin America including graduate students and junior and established investigators, and about 12 instructors (internationally recognized scientists, active in the field).   The activities will consist of a combination of tutorial lectures, advanced-topic presentations, round table discussions, and poster sessions, with the goal of providing the participants with an up-to-date review of this field of research.  \r\n\r\nIn the last decade, there have been significant developments in the fields of micro and nanofluidics, where interfacial issues are crucial.  In addition, the more traditional areas, such as oil production and other energy related applications have taken on new importance due to the current concern about fossil fuels. The PASI will cover a variety of topics relevant to modern interfacial fluid dynamics, including analytical, computational, and multiscale methods, physical models and experiments, and engineering-oriented issues in the range from nano- and microfluidics, and bioflows, to a variety of coating applications. The wide range of applications and materials will impart a significant interdisciplinary nature to the institute, and should foster the cross-fertilization of new ideas to advance the field and, ultimately, increase relations between Latin American junior and senior investigators and their counterparts in the U.S.  Materials presented at the Institute will be posted in a designated web site for further dissemination to the scientific community and the public at large. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
