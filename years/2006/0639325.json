Indeed, cryptography\r\nis a multidisciplinary field.  Designing secure communication\r\nprotocols is a complex issue, requiring considerable training and\r\nresearch in a wide range of topics, including abstract number\r\ntheory and computation.  Consequently, major centers in\r\ncryptography worldwide feature strong links between mathematics\r\nand computer science.  Research in this area requires skills from\r\nboth fields, and this presents a major challenge for young\r\nresearchers coming from either background alone.  This program is\r\ndesigned to help students in mathematics gain the necessary\r\nskills so that they can succeed in their subsequent graduate and\r\npostgraduate career.  Participating students are required to take\r\na comprehensive program of study which (a) prepares them for\r\ngraduate work in mathematics, (b) gives them the necessary\r\nfoundation in number theory and cryptography, and (c) enables\r\nthem to use computers in their research, including writing\r\ndistributed programs that operate on large numbers -- a special\r\nrequirement of the central research theme of this project. \r\nSecond, participating students take part in a year-long research\r\nproject, such as the following: implementation and analysis of\r\nnew cryptosystems, distributed attacks on existing or developing\r\ncryptosystems, discovery through computation of numbers with\r\nspecial properties (e.g., large pseudosquares), or computational\r\nexperiments to verify research conjectures in cryptography\r\ntheory.  All research projects revolve around computation. \r\nMoreover, the projects stem directly from the research efforts of\r\nthe principal investigator and her colleague. \r\n\r\n     Each student participating in this project prepares for\r\ncomputationally-intensive mathematical research.  As a group, the\r\nstudents also participate directly in such research, exploring\r\nbasic questions about cryptography and related areas.  After\r\nparticipating in the program, the students are well prepared to\r\npursue graduate school in mathematics or cryptography.  They also\r\nare able to perform research in others of the many branches of\r\nmathematics where computation plays a significant role.  In\r\nshort, the program helps strengthen the kind of education that\r\nprepares students for professional as well as academic careers in\r\ncryptography and the burgeoning field of information security and\r\nprivacy.  The project is supported by the MPS Division of\r\nMathematical Sciences, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary\r\nActivities, the EHR Division of Undergraduate Education, and\r\nNSF's EPSCoR program. \r\n",
