 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will review the efforts of ESIE that contribute to NSF's investment in cyberinfrastructure (CI) during the four-year period from January, 2002 until December, 2005.  As noted, NSF defines CI in such a way that it includes high performance computing; data, data analysis and visualization; collaboratories, observatories, and virtual organizations; and education and workforce development.  It is the contention of the PI that ESIE has contributed to each of these through programs and projects.  Since NSF is likely to make a substantial investment in CI in the next few years, it is critical that ESIE capture relevant information about its current portfolio as a foundation to planning future efforts that are more concerted within EHR and symbiotic with other directorates.  This project will produce a summary of the current work characterizing the ESIE investment in cyberinfrastructure.  It will be reported in narrative and database form and presented in various forums.",
