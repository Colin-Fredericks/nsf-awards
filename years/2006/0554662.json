The interface of family and work is a fundamental issue impacting the effectiveness of individuals, institutions and economies.  During the planning visit PIs will (1) jointly refine the validity of constructs and measurement modalities, (2) jointly train surveyors for second phase data collection, and (3) finalize the sampling frame and administrative requirements for the tertiary phase of the project.  \r\n\r\nThe project provides unique educational opportunities for graduate students at both institutions to obtain a cross-cultural research experience.  The planning visit will broaden participation of underrepresented persons, including U.S. graduate students in NSF programs, and the anticipated research project has the potential to benchmark work-family interface and impacts in China, a fast-changing economic and social environment. \r\n\r\n",
