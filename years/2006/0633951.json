The research questions involve the processes by which students become able to use resources across contexts (such as between mathematics and physics), how ideas in math and physics form a resource network, and what mechanisms trigger individual resources or coordinated networks.  \r\n\r\nThe researcher will conduct clinical interviews, small group interviews, and statistical analysis of survey questions as well as videos from classroom and help sessions.  The data being collected would be analyzed for purpose of describing the development of students as they refine skills in mathematics and physical reasoning.  A small group of students (15) at the University of Maine will be the subject of the study.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this project is expected to be a \"better model of student reasoning and learning\".   The reviewers were particularly interested in the possibly useful observations about the connections between mathematics and physics learning.  Papers would be prepared for all education research associations, including physics.  \r\n\r\n",
