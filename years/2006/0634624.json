 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is an increasing national need for biologists and mathematicians who are able to apply mathematical analysis to solve complex biological problems. The goal of this project is to address this opportunity by involving faculty from mathematics and biological science departments and research institutes in the creation of an interdisciplinary undergraduate research program in mathematical biology integrated with coursework. It is a cooperative effort of faculty from the College of Natural Sciences and the Pacific Biosciences Research Center.\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of this project are to:\r\n1.  Increase the mathematical sophistication of large numbers of biology majors, and increase the knowledge of biomathematics for mathematics majors, by exposing both to biological applications of mathematics and to modeling.\r\n2.  Inspire the best mathematics and biology students to enter graduate programs in biomathematics and related areas where strong quantitative biology skills are key.\r\n3.  Provide an intense research experience for a small cohort of select mathematics and\r\nbiology students each year.\r\n4.  Provide recognition in the form of a Certificate in Mathematical Biology to students from the cohort, and others with similar research experience, who satisfy standards of cross-disciplinary study of mathematics and biology.\r\n5.  Enhance cooperation among faculty. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Students are being immersed in ongoing research projects by participating in their mentors' projects. The project is also improving the mathematical training of undergraduates in the life sciences by increasing the coherence of the curriculum, introducing new coursework in mathematical modeling into biology programs and providing an undergraduate certificate in mathematical biology. This project provides a model for the interdisciplinary training of mathematics and biology students.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The institution is a federally recognized minority institution with a large number of under-represented minority students. These students are benefiting from strengthening of both the mathematics and biological science programs, and have increased opportunities to participate in an undergraduate research project. Participants are being prepared to continue their education, either as biomathematicians or mathematically trained biologists. The cooperation of the mentors in this project is leading to collaboration on other research projects.\r\n\r\n",
