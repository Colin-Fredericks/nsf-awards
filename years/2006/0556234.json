 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our group continues to play a leadership role in experiments to \r\n> elucidate the underlying structure of protons, neutrons, and other \r\n> exotic particles at the Jefferson Laboratory, in Newport News, \r\n> Virginia.  In particular, over the next several years, we will be \r\n> focused on a new experiment whose aim is to further our understanding \r\n> of the quark spin structure of the proton.  This experiment will \r\n> measure the spatial distribution of charge and magnetization inside \r\n> the proton - a topic which is currently of intense theoretical \r\n> interest in the community.  As well, we continue to be involved in the \r\n> research and development efforts for experiments which will be carried \r\n> out following the planned energy upgrade of the Jefferson Lab \r\n> accelerator.  These experiments will strengthen our quantitative \r\n> understanding of the observed phenomenon of quark confinement in nature.\r\n>\r\n> Education of undergraduate and masters-level graduate students is a \r\n> central component of our group's research program.  We are strongly \r\n> committed to this pursuit, and will continue to provide meaningful and \r\n> useful research experiences to our students; indeed, our association \r\n> with Jefferson Laboratory provides us with a unique opportunity to \r\n> accomplish this goal.   Our major projects provide a multitude of \r\n> opportunities for our students in the areas of pure and applied \r\n> physics, computer engineering, and computer science, and also provide \r\n> excellent training in such topics as design, instrumentation, \r\n> simulation and modelling, analysis techniques, and critical judgment.\r\n>\r\n",
