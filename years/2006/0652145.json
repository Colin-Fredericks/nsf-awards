Barcilon, and Ming Cai, Florida State University.\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThis project will explore the interaction between synoptic scale transients and lower-frequency planetary scale flow anomalies, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation, Antarctic Oscillation, and Pacific North American anomaly. This involves sets of equations for the slowly varying flow and the anomalies superimposed upon it, and includes a closure scheme for the eddies. A hierarchy of dynamical models, including quasi-geostrophic and primitive equation models, together with reanalysis data sets, will  be used  to systematically study the proposed synoptic eddy and low-frequency flow  feedback and the dynamics of the low frequency modes. Building upon the success of the dynamical closures of this feedback mechanism, the atmospheric response to the sea surface temperature anomalies, and the role of extratropical air-sea interaction in the persistence of the low frequency modes, particularly the North Atlantic Oscillation, will be studied.\r\n\r\nThe low-frequency variability of the atmosphere has important consequences for the everyday life of citizens and the fate of businesses, corporations, and ecosystems, and this project is expected to benefit all these communities. Support is provided for one post-doctoral associate.\r\n\r\n",
