The maser pumping mechanism itself is still the subject of debate with both\r\ncollisions and radiation being suggested. Moreover, the variability seen among maser\r\nemissions from Miras may be the result of shocks passing through the extended\r\natmospheres of these stars.\r\nThe goal of this project is to allow the continuation of an ongoing observational program\r\nusing the remote observing capabilities of the Haystack Radio Astronomical Observatory\r\nin Massachusetts to follow the maser emissions of Miras. The result will be an SiO maser\r\ndata set of approximately six years duration with high phase coverage and velocity\r\nresolution for the stars Mira and R Cas. The data will provide the basis for an improved\r\nunderstanding of the SiO maser pumping mechanism and the dynamics of the\r\ncircumstellar region in which the masers originate. The extended duration of the\r\nobservations is important to reduce the effects of random variations that occur during\r\nindividual phase cycles in maser locations and velocities. A second goal is to complete a\r\nre-survey of stars previously observed in 1983. Comparisons between these and new\r\nmeasurements will be made to statistically describe the variations in the velocity centroid\r\nover time. Large shifts in the velocity centroid may indicate the presence of a binary\r\npartner. Stars discovered to have large shifts will be monitored in a search for the orbital\r\nparameters of the system. Finally, the orbital parameters of at least two SiO maser\r\nsources, R Aql and Mira, will be determined using published and archive data along with\r\nnew observations of the maser emission as a velocity probe.\r\nUndergraduates will be trained through direct involvement in the data acquisition,\r\nanalysis, and interpretation. Students will further be expected to co-author and present\r\ntheir results in publications and conferences. The work will also be included in a variety\r\nof undergraduate courses as an example of astronomical concepts, data analysis, the\r\nquantum mechanics of maser emission, the physical parameters of the circumstellar\r\nenvironments that generate SiO masers, and binary stars. Moreover, the research\r\nproposed here is expected to considerably enhance the research climate at the University\r\nof Minnesota Morris and in a physics department recognized for a traditionally high\r\nfraction of women graduates.",
