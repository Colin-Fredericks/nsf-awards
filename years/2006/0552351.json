 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for Cooper, Rory A., EEC-0552351\r\n\r\nThis REU Site award entitled \"ASPIRE\" (American Student Placements and Internships in Rehabilitation Engineering) will provide undergraduate students in engineering or technical fields insight into rehabilitation engineering (RE) research, and product design and development with the overall goal of improving the lives of individuals with disabilities. The objectives of program are to: (1) enroll undergraduate students from engineering and technical schools outside of Pittsburgh, PA and those schools that do not offer a program or research experience in rehabilitation engineering (RE) or assistive technology (AT); (2) engage undergraduate students from diversified areas of engineering (e.g., mechanical, electrical, biomedical); (3) expose engineering students from underrepresented groups (such as women, students with disabilities, and students of African American, Hispanic, and Native American descent) to the area of RE and AT research; and (4) provide education and research training in the area of RE through the completion of research projects, critical thinking exercises, and close interactions with an interdisciplinary research team consisting of faculty, engineering, scientists, and clinicians.\r\n\r\nThe students will be exposed to the many different aspects of RE and disability research by participating in a summer intern lecture series covering a range of topics on disability and technology, social impact and responsibility, design and research practices, scientific writing and presentation of research findings. One of the lectures in this series will also introduce students to careers and advanced education in rehabilitation engineering and technology.   In addition, the participants will have the unique opportunity to attend the international Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America's (RESNA) annual conference where they will attend the many RE research symposia, hands-on workshops, preview the latest developments in assistive technology, and network with other students and professionals. At the end of their research experience the students will submit a three-page scientific paper and deliver a presentation of their project to ASPIRE faculty, staff and students at a research meeting.  \r\n",
