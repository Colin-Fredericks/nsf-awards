 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Acquisition Program, the Department of Chemistry at Mississippi College will acquire a single crystal X-ray diffractometer.  The Chemistry Department  at Jackson State University will partner with Mississippi College to support teaching and research at both institutions.  The diffractometer will also support  research and education at other institutions: Alcorn State University, Belhaven College, Millsaps College, Tougaloo College, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Mississippi University for Women, University of Southern Mississippi, University of Ohio, University of Louisiana, University of South Alabama, University of Tennessee  Chattanooga, University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez and Loyola University New Orleans.  Research problems will be investigated in all areas of chemistry, materials science, and biological chemistry. \r\n  \r\nThe X-ray diffractometer allows the determination of  accurate and precise bond distances and angles between atoms in a molecule.  It essentially maps out the three dimensional structure of a molecule, and the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.  The composition of a solid material is fully described by analyzing the diffraction pattern.  This equipment will allow the institutions to better train students across the chemical sciences at both the undergraduate and graduate levels with a modern diffractometer system and software.   \r\n",
