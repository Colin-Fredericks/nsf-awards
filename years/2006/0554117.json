 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nThis project proposes to use autonomous airships as a mobile cell phone network for\r\ntemporary communication restoration in the case of large-scale disasters such as a flood,\r\nearthquake, hurricane, or terrorist attack. The Nonlinear Control Research Laboratory\r\n(NCRL) will study attitude and formation control of the airships when used in a cell\r\nphone network along with the necessary equipment and technologies needed to convert a\r\ngroup of airship to a mobile cell phone network.\r\nThe NCRL is currently developing the mathematical model of a candidate airship\r\nalong with the simulation environment for formation control research. This mathematical\r\nmodel is based on flight test data that was generated using the Gait Analysis and\r\nInnovative Technologies Laboratory. The research being proposed in this project will\r\nencompass three tasks that will extend our current research effort over a one-year period,\r\n1. Modeling and Airship Design\r\n2. Formation Control and Attitude Stability Design Airship implementation and\r\nvalidation\r\n3. Cell Phone Network Simulation and Small-scale implementation\r\nIntellectual Merit: Upon accomplishing the objectives of the present research,\r\nsignificant advances will be made in the understanding of autonomous airship control\r\nusing model predictive control techniques while configured to operate as a temporary\r\nmobile cell phone network. The use of model predictive control for aerodynamics is a\r\nnew area of research due to the fast dynamics encountered on aircraft. The results of our\r\nresearch will make significant advances in applying model predictive control to the\r\nproblem of autonomous airships and in aerodynamics in general.\r\nBroader Impact Statement: The following are the broader impact to society that this\r\nresearch would bring to society: 1) The implementation of an autonomous airship cell\r\nphone network will allow for the temporary restoration in an area that has suffered\r\ndamage to its communication infrastructure. 2) Control and stability issues will be\r\naddressed which will have wide-ranging applications in the area of autonomous vehicles\r\nthat are operating in a cooperative formation. 3) The proposed study will help train and\r\nsupport undergraduate students whose research interest is focused mainly on autonomous\r\nairships. 4) The results of this study will be disseminated through presentations at\r\nnational and international conferences and publications in peer-reviewed journals.",
