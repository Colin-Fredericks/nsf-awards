Removal of these ions by ion exchange and selective adsorption attracts particular attention. The prior NSF project was focused on the synthesis of high capacity adsorbents for heavy metal ions by surface functionalization of ordered mesoporous silicas (OMSs) with multifunctional ligands. The main objective of the current project is to develop the so-called periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs) with incorporated multifunctional bridging groups that show high affinity and selectivity towards heavy metal ions such as mercury and lead. In addition, the mesopore surface of these PMOs can be decorated with other multifunctional ligands to increase their selectivity and adsorption capacity. More specifically, we propose to synthesize new PMO-based adsorbents for removal of mercury ions and other heavy metal ions by designing their framework with multifunctional bridging groups such as tris[3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl]isocyanurate and bis[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl] tetrasulfide as well as decorating their surface with (3-mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane and diphenylthiocarbazone ligands. The performance of these adsorbents will be critically evaluated for removal of mercury and lead ions from aqueous solutions and the best combination of the surface functionality and porous structure will be established. In addition, the possibility of regeneration and reuse of the PMO-based adsorbents will be explored. \r\n",
