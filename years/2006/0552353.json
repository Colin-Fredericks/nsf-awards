 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ten students are selected from an application competition to participate in a 13 week research program. The students work directly with research principle investigators, post-doctoral staff, graduate students, and other undergraduates in fields of their selection, including Atmospheric Airglow, Atmospheric Science, Space Plasma Physics, Ionospheres, Magnetosphere, Air Pollution Transport, Planetary Atmospheres, and Lidar. Fabrication and calibration of Ground-based and space flight instrumentation are included in this hands-on research participation, and students may also choose to construct and utilize software packages to solve analytical expressions, analyze space flight data, or manipulate large data bases.  In addition to the laboratory and field work, students attend weekly seminars, prepare a written progress report to their mentors (which may be published), and orally present descriptions of their research to faculty, staff, and colleagues. The site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",
