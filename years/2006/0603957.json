Dr. Hofer's project is concerned with the study of\r\nfundamental aspects of symplectic geometry, its applications to\r\ndynamical systems, as well as the development of mathematical\r\ntechnology to address analytical problems arising in the\r\nfield. One part of the project is devoted to the study of\r\nSymplectic Field Theory (SFT) which currently is the most general\r\nand most comprehensive theory of symplectic invariants.  Another\r\npart develops a general approach for studying certain classes of\r\nnonlinear elliptic partial differential equations as they occur\r\nin SFT. These methods potentially should have other applications\r\nin nonlinear analysis as well. A third part is devoted to the\r\napplications of the theory to dynamical systems.  The aim is the\r\ndevelopment of mathematical infrastructure, based on a\r\ncombination of Floer theory and the theory of finite energy\r\nfoliations due to Dr. Hofer and his collaborators. This research\r\naims at the understanding of long-term behavior of iterated\r\narea-preserving disk maps with its numerous applications.\r\n\r\nMany physical systems like the flow of an incompressible ideal\r\nfluid, the movement of a satellite under the gravitational forces\r\nof celestial bodies, or the movement of charged particles in a\r\nmagnetic field, to name a few, are examples of so called\r\ndynamical systems.  The mathematical theory of dynamical systems\r\nprovides tools to understand their complex behavior and allows to\r\nmake predictions.  The particular examples mentioned above are of\r\nso-called Hamiltonian nature and have an intricate structure\r\nleading to extreme complicated dynamical behavior. Stabilizing a\r\nbeam of particles in a partic= le accelerators, or sending a\r\nprobe on an interstellar journey, or understanding the dynamics\r\nof a stationary flow of an incompressible ideal fluid are\r\nproblems whose mathematical underpinnings are touched by the\r\nresearch proposed in this project. Some of the methods developed\r\npotentially have application to larger classes of partial\r\ndifferential equations of relevance in physics.\r\n",
