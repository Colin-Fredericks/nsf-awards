 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mechanical Response of Individual Living Epithelial and Endothelial Cells \r\nto in situ Biochemical Signal Exposure and direct Drug Delivery\r\nThe mechanical properties of living cells play an important role in cell function and health. By applying recent advances in coupled optical and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), the nanomechanical properties of individual cells and cell junctions will be uniquely investigated. Specifically, the mechanical properties of endothelial cells (e.g. those lining blood vessels) will be characterized during in situ exposure to VEGF, a cell signal known to break down intercellular adhesion. Separately, HaCaT keratinocytes (skin cells) will be measured during exposure to EGF, known to promote cell growth and proliferation. Finally, targeted 'drug delivery' will be demonstrated by attaching biotinylated VEGF to the AFM tip for direct delivery of this cell-signaling molecule to specific positions within epithelial cells. This novel local biochemical delivery will eventually be extended to other growth factors and ligands, including signaling pathways for semaphorins and peroxisome proliferators.\r\nThe nanomechanical measurements of living cells will provide insight into the processes, and potentially the mediation, of human diseases such as acute and chronic inflammation, diabetic retinopathy, tissue damage following stroke and myocardial infarction, and the proliferation and metastasization of cancerous cells. They will be performed with academic and clinical collaborators at UConn, NIH, and elsewhere. More immediately, the 'NanoVan' outreach effort involves preparing and showing mobile, hand's on demonstrations of nanoscale concepts at local schools, museums, libraries, etc. Interactive virtual reality lessons ('Nanimations') will also be presented for internet distribution, teaching atomic force microscopy and its use in bio-mechanical measurements and drug delivery.\r\n\r\n",
