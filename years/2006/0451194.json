 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator plans to study three problems in the area of stochastic\r\ndifferential geometry. The first problem concerns the Gauss-Bonnet-Chern\r\ntheorem. The investigator has proved a generalization of this theorem valid\r\nfor an oriented even-dimensional Riemannian vector bundle over a closed\r\ncompact manifold, equipped with a metric connection. The investigator would\r\nlike to simplify his proof, replacing the use of the Splitting Principle,\r\nwhich constitutes a key step in his argument, with a more elementary and\r\ntransparent stochastic argument. The second problem concerns the derivation\r\nof integration by parts formulae for the law of a diffusion process on a\r\ncompact manifold. The investigator has recently found a new method for\r\nobtaining integration by parts formulae in the case where the diffusion is\r\nstrictly elliptic. He plans to use his method to study the analogous problem\r\nfor degenerate (non-elliptic) diffusions.  He believes he will be able to\r\nprove a dichotomy theorem giving conditions very close to necessary and\r\nsufficient for the existence of integration by parts formulae, for a large\r\nclass of vector fields in the degenerate case.   In the third problem, the\r\ninvestigator in collaboration with Elton Hsu, will use ideas in two papers\r\nof Hsu to give a simplified stochastic proof of the Gauss-Bonnet-Chern\r\ntheorem for manifolds with boundary. They will use the expertise they gain\r\nfrom this work to study the index theorem for the Dirac operator on spin\r\nmanifolds with boundary.\r\n    The proposal combines two areas of mathematics, stochastic analysis, the\r\nstudy of randomness, and differential geometry, the study of shape. Both\r\nareas have close connections with the physical world. For example,\r\nstochastic differential equations, a central theme of the proposal, are\r\nwidely used to model physical systems subject to the influence of random\r\nnoise.  Examples include the flow of heat in a material, weather systems,\r\nthe trajectory of a spacecraft, and the pricing of stock options. Curved\r\nspaces are often the natural setting for these phenomena, e.g. if one wishes\r\nto study the heat at various points on a cylindrical pipe. A deeper\r\nunderstanding of the mathematics underlying physical systems is often\r\ncrucial in developing good mathematical models of these systems. Thus,\r\nalthough it is of a theoretical nature, the research outlined in this\r\nproposal may prove useful in many areas of applied science and technology.\r\n",
