 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop a novel, organic-based electrically pumped plasmonic amplifier, utilizing the strong coupling of surface plasmons and excited molecules observed only at nanoscale distances. The approach is to build resonant plasmon cavities with nanoscale metallic patterns. The cavities will serve as a basis for two devices that enable the conversion of signals between the electrical and plasmonic domains. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed work consists of: 1) characterizing the coupling of electrically pumped molecular excitations to guided surface plasmons in nanostructured metal films, 2) demonstrating nanopatterned ring structures for high-quality in-plane plasmon resonators, 3) achieving gain in these plasmon resonators, and 4) investigating the potential of utilizing surface plasmon gain to achieve electrically-pumped stimulated emission of plasmons. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this work will be the realization of either an electrically-pumped plasmon amplifier or an electrically-controlled plasmon source. These may enable a radically new type of integrated circuit that can help extend Moores law beyond the limitations of current integrated circuit technology. Tailoring the decay mechanisms of electrically excited molecules in resonant cavities can contribute to the realization of organic lasers and the general field of molecular electronics. The PIs will involve graduate students as well as undergraduate students and high school students in their research though a recently established program with Green Hills High School, encouraging female and underrepresented minority participation. Past participation in this program has demonstrated high levels of interest among K-12 teachers and students. \r\n\r\n",
