 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award supports for a network of automatic data buoys to monitor synoptic-scale fields of surface air pressure, air temperature, and ice motion throughout the Arctic Ocean, an activity that was recommended by the National Academy of Sciences in 1974.  APL initiated the program in 1978 and became the International Arctic Buoy Programme in 1991 to provide meteorological and oceanographic data for real-time operational requirements and research purposes including support to the World Climate Research Programme and the World Weather Watch Programme.  Thus the program fits extremely well into the RSL program Long-term observations component.\r\n\r\nThe IABP is composed of 20 different research and operational institutions from 9 different\r\ncountries (http://iabp.apl.washington.edu/Participants.htm). The IABP is funded and managed by\r\nParticipants of the program. Management of the IABP is the responsibility of the Executive\r\nCommittee, and operation of the program was delegated to the Coordinator of the IABP, Ignatius\r\nRigor.\r\n\r\nThis award renews NSF funding of the IABP through the USIABP. Funds from this proposal will be used for the Coordination, Data Management and deployment of enhanced buoys by the USIABP. The IABP provides long-term observations from the Arctic Ocean which are essential for Arctic forecasting and research\r\n\r\n\r\n",
