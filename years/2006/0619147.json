 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Acquisition Program, the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at California State University - Los Angeles (CSULA) will upgrade their NMR facilities by replacing an old spectrometer with a 400 MHz spectrometer, upgrading another 400 MHz spectrometer to work in parallel, and purchase accessories for a 600 MHz spectrometer.  The spectrometer will be used in various research investigations such as the study of gas hydrates, transport in chromatographic columns, intracellular iron release in E.coli, singlet oxygen in arylphosphines, and ecologically important signal molecules.  \r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most widely used tool available to chemists and biochemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown substances and to provide information on the arrangement and connectivity of atoms in molecules.  Dynamical information is obtained providing insight on the motions of molecules.  This award will provide essential analytical capabilities to faculty and students at CSULA.  The instruments will be used in research, research training and education projects by undergraduate and master degree students.  It will have a significant impact on laboratory courses taken by students in a wide variety of courses and fields of study.   \r\n",
