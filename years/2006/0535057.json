We are continuing development of the 5S (Streams, Structures, Spaces, Scenarios, and Societies) approach as both a formal foundation and a practical base for pedagogy and DL implementation. With the assistance of our Advisory Board and students in doctoral consortia, we are planning and developing approximately 12 lesson/modules, to be evaluated by DL experts.\r\n\r\nThese and other educational materials will be made available through the National Science Digital Library (NSDL), after refinement and field testing at VT and UNC-CH as well as diverse cooperating universities, and cataloging with metadata. Programs in CS, as well as LIS, at any institution with any degree of interest in DLs, may draw upon project deliverables, to enhance existing courses, add DL (related) courses, or even deploy a DL curriculum. Students will learn about the 5S framework, and may learn to use 5S as a base for modeling, designing, implementing, and improving DLs.\r\n\r\nPresentations at key DL, CS, and LIS conferences will expand awareness of the work. Future CS and LIS graduates focusing on DLs will have a sound basis to continue in the field, as practitioners, educators, researchers, and developers. DL users will benefit from the improved understanding of those who build the next generation of DL systems.\r\n",
