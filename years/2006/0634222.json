 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, \"NUE: Teaching Nanoscale Engineering Across Undergraduate Disciplines\" at North Carolina  State University, under the direction of Dr. Mark A. Johnson, will bring together a cross-disciplinary team from the Colleges of Engineering and Education to translate emerging nanoscale research at the College of Engineering into meaningful undergraduate learning opportunities for students in multiple disciplines specifically targeting increased understanding of structure, process and design considerations related to physical phenomena at the nanoscale.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is to develop new curricular content based on nanoscience research within the College of Engineering, and to develop a new nanoscience course for non-majors, as well as to research the learning outcomes for the three different groups of students.\r\n\r\nAs a broader impact, research on students' understandings of nanoscience and engineering concepts will be measured and compared for three populations (all engineers, materials science majors, and K-12 science teachers) through pre- and post- course surveys, selected interviews (pre, mid, and post) and outcome evaluations conducted by nano-education researchers.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) Program Solicitation (NSF 06-538) and is being co-funded by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems (CMS) and the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC).",
