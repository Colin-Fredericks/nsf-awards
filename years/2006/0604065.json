 "awd_abstract_narration": "McKenzie will investigate algorithmic\r\nquestions which involve properties of finite algebras determined by the\r\nvarieties and quasi-varieties they generate, and\r\nstructural questions which involve the necessary algebraic properties\r\nthat must be true throughout a locally finite variety or quasi-variety \r\nas a consequence of that class possessing some natural property defined \r\nthrough logical or set-theoretic means.  \r\nThe outstanding algorithmic questions:  Is there an algorithm to\r\ndetermine if the quasi-equations valid in a finite algebra  F  \r\nare finitely based?  Is there an algorithm to determine if the \r\nquasi-variety generated by  F  possesses a natural duality?  \r\nIs the class of finite algebras possessing a finite equational basis \r\nrecursively enumerable?  Is the class of finite algebras generating \r\na residually large variety recursively enumerable?  \r\nAmong the important structural questions:  What collection of algebraic\r\nproperties is necessary and sufficient for a finitely generated variety to\r\nbe finitely decidable, or to have few models?  \r\nHe will work on an algebraic conjecture that, if proved, would establish an\r\nimportant case of the\r\ndichotomy conjecture for the constraint satisfaction problem of\r\ntheoretical computer science:  every finite algebra  F  in a meet semi-distributive\r\nvariety has finite relational width.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator believes that research\r\ninto the interplay between, on the one hand, the existence or nonexistence\r\nof algorithms to recognize fundamental properties of finite algebras, \r\nand on the other hand, the levels of structural complexity manifested \r\nin the algebras---what this project is all about---has the potential \r\nnot only to expand our understanding of the structural possibilities in \r\nfinite algebraic systems (which it has already done), but to produce\r\nfundamental breakthroughs in theoretical computer science.\r\nThe most likely place for this to occur soon is in the algebraic approach\r\nto the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP).\r\nSpecific instances of the constraint satisfaction problem, \r\nincluding graph homomorphism problems,\r\nare ubiquitous in many areas of artificial intelligence, computer\r\nscience, database theory, scheduling, networking, hardware verification, etc. \r\nThe algebraic approach puts some of the most developed areas of\r\nuniversal algebra, especially the machinery of tame congruence theory\r\ndeveloped by the principal investigator, to work in the study of combinatorial problems \r\nrelated to the CSP;\r\nand it may have potential applications\r\nin the study of other computational paradigms, such as approximation \r\nand randomized algorithms, and quantum computation.",
