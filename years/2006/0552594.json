 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective is to stimulate talented undergraduate students to pursue graduate work\r\nin sciences and mathematics by providing accessible and challenging research problems in basic\r\nmathematics. Five faculty members will be involved in the three year program. Three faculty\r\nmentors will coordinate the effort each summer. Students will work in groups of two or three with\r\none faculty mentor. Students will make presentations of their progress during weekly seminars.\r\nEach student will submit a written report at the end of the program. Students will be encouraged\r\nto publish their work and make presentations at professional meetings. Every effort will be made\r\nduring recruitment process to attract applicants from students in under-represented groups.\r\nThe students will be provided stipend, housing costs, meal allowance, and support for travel to\r\nthe REU Site, and travel support for conference presentations. Central Michigan University will\r\nprovide access to classrooms, the campus library, computer labs, notebook computers, printing and\r\ncopying services, and recreational facilities. To complement the research experience a number of\r\nsocial enrichment activities have been planned.\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is based in the challenging mathematical problems students\r\nwill attempt to solve. The students will tackle unsolved problems whose solutions (or partial\r\nsolutions) will improve human understanding of the very structure of mathematics. The broader\r\nimpact of the proposed project include training undergraduates in research in basic mathematics,\r\nincreasing the participation of women and minorities in science and math activities, and involving\r\nundergraduates as young professionals in the broader disciplinary field.",
