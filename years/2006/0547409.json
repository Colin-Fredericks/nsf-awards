Specifically, two research tasks are proposed: Task A will develop a kinetic model to simulate the evolution process of wrinkle patterns in hard films on soft substrates, and Task B will develop a mathematically similar model to simulate self-assembly of quantum dots in heteroepitaxial systems. The objective is to develop a quantitative understanding of the pattern evolution dynamics in both systems and to explore novel engineering techniques to control the patterns. The proposed research will have a significant impact on the making of devices for technological applications. The proposed education activities include curriculum development, new tools for education, research experience for undergraduates and students from underrepresented groups, outreach activities directed to K-12 students and teachers as well as the general public. \r\n",
