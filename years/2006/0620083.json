 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hunter College Gender Equity Project will partner with the City University of\r\nNew York's (CUNY) central administration on two initiatives that will involve 8 CUNY\r\ncampuses. First, a series of workshops modeled after those developed through Hunter's\r\nADVANCE award will address gender and race schemas; integrate material on the\r\nimpact of gender and race on careers of faculty; and discuss how to develop individual,\r\ninstitutional, and discipline-level solutions to the underrepresentation of women and\r\nminority-status scholars. Second, comprehensive grant-writing assistance in conjunction\r\nwith a course release (funded by CUNY) will be offered to 6 women a semester.\r\nAnalyses of curricula vitae for participants and comparison non-participants will allow Hunter to determine the effectiveness of both programs.\r\n\r\nPresently, little is known about the determinants of scholarly productivity at teaching-intensive institutions and very little about how to develop scholars. Analyses of productivity have focused on faculty at research-intensive institutions. Whether the variables that predict productivity at those institutions operate similarly at teaching-intensive institutions is not known.\r\n\r\nThis award represents an effort to do more for women faculty, faculty of color, and underserved students at the largest and most diverse public urban university system in the United States. CUNY is a teaching-intensive institution where faculty have difficulty conducting research and obtaining external funding. Since students' opportunity to engage in research at the undergraduate level predicts their future participation in science, supporting CUNY's current scientists will produce more women and minority-status scientists in the future.\r\n",
