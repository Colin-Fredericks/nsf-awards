 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laura Gilliom, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is a Discovery Corps Senior Fellow for the 2006-2007 academic year.  Gilliom plans to partner with a University of California  project, \"California Teach\", a large state-wide science teaching initiative, to define a research-track professional development option for early career teachers.  She also plans to coordinate \"Research Experience for Teachers\" sponsors for about 80 K-12 teachers in Summer 07 (RET funding from a variety of other sources), and to develop metrics and evaluation strategies for RET to improve the teachers' professional development, retention, and classroom effectiveness. \r\n\r\nThis Discovery Corps Senior Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.",
