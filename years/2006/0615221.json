 "awd_abstract_narration": "Storage systems are exploding in size, complexity and popularity, and\r\nas they grow, they expose themselves to a variety of failures.  As\r\nsuch, the software that supports these systems must be able to\r\ntolerate a growing number of failures.  Erasure coding is a technique\r\nthat allows storage nodes to be enriched with extra coding\r\ninformation so that if one or more nodes fail, the original data may\r\nbe recovered from the survivors.  While erasure codes have existed\r\nfor decades, there is a considerable gap in understanding\r\nconstructions, performance and properties of codes that tolerate\r\nmultiple failures.  This project's mission is explore, design,\r\nevaluate and disseminate erasure codes for multiple failures that\r\nsignificantly improve the performance and failure coverage of current\r\ncodes.  The research component is centered around unifying disparate\r\ntechniques from classical coding theory, disk array technology, and\r\nasymptotic graph theory.\r\n\r\nThis work will impact all applications where multiple storage nodes\r\nare used in tandem, and the risk of one or more nodes failing is\r\nsignificant.  New, efficient codes will be developed and evaluated\r\nwith respect to the best currently known codes.  Additionally, the\r\nimplementations of these codes will be disseminated to the community\r\nof systems programmers that need them, and tutorial material will be\r\ndeveloped so that the codes may have wide impact.  This is a serious\r\nissue, as most current codes are presented in a theoretcially formal\r\nway that puts them beyond the reach of the programmers who need to\r\nimplement them.  Finally, erasure codes will be used as the basis for\r\nmotivational programs on math and science at K-12 schools in East\r\nTennessee.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe as a society rely heavily on computer storage for personal videos, news feeds and scientific data sets.  While our data is of utmost importance, it is a fact of life that hard disk drives fail, and those failures expose us to the loss of data.\n\nToday's storage systems are made up of multiple disks, and until recently, these have been designed to tolerate the failure of any single disk.  Techniques to tolerate multiple disk failures have not been explored as thoroughly, and heretofore their performance has not been good.  This research project, funded by the NSF, is to design, analyze and implement techniques called erasure codes to tolerate multiple disk failures with high performance.\n\nA major outcome of the research project has been the discovery of multiple techniques for tolerating double-disk failures in large storage systems.  These techniques have filled important gaps in the theory and practice of erasure codes and have already received attention from both academia and industry.  A second outcome of the project has been the development and support of an open-source programming library called Jerasure that allows storage system developers to utilize the most recent and best performing erasure coding techniques to protect their systems from multiple disk failures.  This library and its constituent techniques are patent-free, and therefore may be leveraged by both academic and industrial projects, striving to keep our nation's data safe from failures.\n\nA final outcome of the project has been a detailed assessment of the performance of a variety of open-source erasure coding libraries, not only to provide information on how these libraries perform on current hardware, but also to give an idea of how theoretical performance maps to real implementations.\n\nIn addition to the outcomes above, this award has funded ten Undergraduates from the University of Tennessee to perform research on erasure codes.  This provides them not only with tools and experience to help them in their future careers, but gives them a first-hand glimpse into the excitement that Computer Science research can offer.  The majority of these students have decided to pursue research with graduate study in Computer Science at the University of Tennessee and elsewhere.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/25/2010\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James S Plank"
