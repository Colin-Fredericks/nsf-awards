 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal submitted by the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission seeks to create a center of excellence for research in molecular biometrics-the automatic recognition of individuals through processing, storage, and comparison of digital records derived from measurable traits, which are adequately unique for a given application (e.g., fingerprints, iris, face, DNA).  An outgrowth of previous research on physiological biometrics initiated by the 2002 RII (EPS 0314742), the proposed research investment is aimed at increasing the State's R&D capacity and level of competitiveness at the state, regional, and national levels by building on the combined strengths of nanotechnology and biometrics research at West Virginia University (WVU); molecular and cellular research at Marshall University (MU); and increasing the participation of underrepresented students through West Virginia State University (WVSU), an HBCU.  The proposed project is fully aligned with the continuing state priority of strengthening academic and economic capacity in the selected research area.  \r\n\r\nIn order to achieve its goal, the WV EPSCoR plan identifies four specific objectives: (1) to organize discovery and innovation around the functional building blocks with which to construct integrated molecular recognition testbed devices; (2) to build and link crosscutting faculty teams through strategic cluster hires, and development of early career faculty and hires of postdoctoral associates both at WVU and MU; (3) to build strategic collaborative relationships with regional academic and industry partners to bridge capability voids, complement their strengths, and accelerate targeted research; and (4) to enhance, institutionalize, and continually improve the shared facility and academic environments necessary to promote the discovery and learning activities of these groups and the institutional initiatives these groups have precipitated.  \r\n\r\nAn education, human resources development and outreach component is proposed to: (1) integrate RII research and education efforts, (2) transform the academic culture and environment in a way that increases retention and graduation rates of STEM students, and (3) enhance the educational skill-set of faculty in molecular biometrics, and promulgate the most successful efforts to other WV institutions.  This component includes a new partnership with WVSU, a HBCU, through which underrepresented students and faculty will be recruited for the emerging technology workforce as the State's economy evolves\r\n\r\n",
