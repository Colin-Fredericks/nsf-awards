 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent decades many new diseases have emerged, often because a pathogen jumped to a novel host. The jump of the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum from domestic poultry to House Finches is one such case that is amenable to facilitating the development of general models of disease dynamics. This project will explore the effects on disease dynamics of multiple hosts that differ in competence and transmissions routes that differ in disease expression. By combining experimental work, studies of free-living bird communities, and mathematical models, it is possible to determine under what conditions epidemics will arise, and hence how they can be halted. \r\n\r\nA variety of broader impacts will result. Thousands of members of the general public participate in monitoring the disease among wild birds through a citizen science program. Because the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology routinely communicates research results and their relevance to the general public through a newsletter that reaches over 40,000 households, members of the public are educated about the process and products of this research. By formally involving postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduates in the research a large number of students are trained in interdisciplinary research that is the hallmark of studies in disease ecology. Many of these belong to minorities currently under-represented in biological research.\r\n",
