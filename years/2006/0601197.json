 "awd_abstract_narration": "E. Mukhin plans to continue his studies of the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz\r\nmethod in the relation to the non-homogeneous Gaudin, XXX, XXY and\r\nother models.  The main problems to be addressed are: develop an\r\napproach to the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz based on populations of\r\nsolutions of Bethe Ansatz equations; use the populations to solve the\r\nBethe Ansatz equations explicitly; use populations to study the number\r\nof solutions of the Bethe Ansatz equations; prove the (modified) Bethe\r\nAnsatz Conjecture which claims that the Bethe vectors form a basis in\r\nthe space of states for generic values of parameters, in the case of\r\nsl(N).\r\n\r\nDiagonalization of Hamiltonians of many models of mathematical physics\r\ncan be performed if the corresponding system of algebraic equations\r\ncalled Bethe Ansatz equations is solved.  It was shown that the\r\nsolutions of the Bethe Ansatz equations naturally form families which\r\nare called populations.  In the case of the Gaudin model associated to\r\nsl(N), the populations are in one-to-one correspondence with the\r\npoints of intersection of appropriate Schubert cycles and with the\r\nscalar differential operators of order N which have only polynomial\r\nsolutions. Thus the sl(N) populations are given by N-dimesnional\r\nspaces of polynomials in one variable with prescribed singular points and\r\nexponents.  E. Mukhin hopes that the study of the spaces of\r\npolynomials can make the Bethe Ansatz approach more tractable and resolve\r\nseveral old problems in this area.\r\n",
