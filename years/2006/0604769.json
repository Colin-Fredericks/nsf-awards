These form very interesting groups,\r\nwhich one can try to understand from a topological/algebraic\r\nviewpoint as well as a geometric viewpoint.  McDuff has been\r\nstudying their structure for several years, and proposes to\r\ncontinue this work.  One project is to extend her analysis (in\r\nprevious joint work with Abreu) of the symplectomorphism group\r\nfor rational/ruled manifolds of dimension four to similar\r\nmanifolds in higher dimension.  Many new problems arise here\r\nbecause the manifold is no longer fibered by pseudoholomorphic\r\ncurves.  She proposes to study the internal structure of\r\nsymplectic manifolds (such as spaces of embedded symplectic balls\r\nor Lagrangian tori), to see how this is reflected in the\r\nstructure of the group of symplectomorphisms.  She also proposes\r\na joint project with Hofer, which would develop a theory of\r\nbranched manifolds that could be used in an equivariant version\r\nof the new polyfold theory.\r\n \r\n \r\nIn order to understand our physical world it is important to\r\ndevelop a variety of ways of measuring objects in space.  The\r\nmost familiar is the measurement of distances and angles, which\r\nleads to the usual notions of geometry.  This proposal concerns a\r\ndifferent kind of geometry, called symplectic geometry, that is\r\nbased on measurements of two-dimensional objects.  As first\r\ndiscovered by Hamilton over 150 years ago, many spaces of\r\ninterest to physicists have this kind of structure.  For example,\r\nit underlies the equations of motion of energy-conserving systems\r\nsuch as the planetary system, since here each position coordinate\r\nis paired with a momentum coordinate to form a basic\r\ntwo-dimensional object.  Symplectic geometry also has much\r\nrelevance to modern theories of physics such as string theory and\r\nmirror symmetry.  In recent years there has been a very important\r\nexchange of ideas between mathematics and physics that is largely\r\nexpressed in symplectic terms.  Hence it is very important to\r\nfurther our understanding of the fundamentals of symplectic\r\ngeometry.  This project will develop our basic knowledge in this\r\narea, concentrating particularly on understanding the properties\r\nof the group of motions that preserve this geometry.  It will\r\nexploit the new invariants coming from physics (such as quantum\r\ncohomology and symplectic field theory) in order to understand\r\nthe topological structure of these groups.  Besides its\r\ntheoretical interest, the new symplectic geometry has led to the\r\ndevelopment of better methods for computing Hamiltonian motions\r\nsuch as the orbit of a satellite.\r\n",
