 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for support of a study by the National Academy of Sciences to perform an independent assessment of the proposed Rare Isotope Accelerator, specifically, the science that would be enabled by that project.  The study will address the role that RIA will play in the future core activities of nuclear physics, considering the field broadly, but placing emphasis on its potential scientific impact on nuclear structure and fundamental symmetries.  However, the study will also assess the importance of RIA to the broader areas of science that nuclear physics addresses, such as nuclear astrophysics, especially in the context of the creation of the heavy elements, stockpile stewardship and other national security areas.  In addition, it will assess the importance of RIA to the future availability of scientific and technical personnel.  Finally, the need for such an accelerator will also be addressed in the context of international efforts in this area.",
