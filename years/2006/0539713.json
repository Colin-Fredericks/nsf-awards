 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate three-phase nanocomposite films for embedded capacitor applications. There is demand for an embedded capacitor technology that addresses the need for miniaturization and increased functionality of electronic systems. The proposed three phase nanocomposite artificial dielectrics have the potential to have high dielectric constant (>300), low leakage current, and high breakdown voltage while maintaining the adhesion, processability, and flexibility of polymers. The shape, size and orientation of nanoparticles in the polymer matrix will be controlled in order to tune the particles' behavior as dielectric enhancers in the insulating matrix. Nanoparticles having spherical, cubic, and wire geometries and dimensions in the range of 5 - 100 nm will be dispersed into polymer resin and formed into thin film capacitors for testing.\r\n\r\nPolymer matrix nanocomposites have potential as dielectrics for the next generation of\r\ncapacitors. Embedded capacitors are needed in order to meet the projected trends in electronic device miniaturization. Currently, the majority of the board surface is occupied by passive components (70%), with most of these being capacitors (60%). If the capacitors can be embedded in the board itself, the size of the device can be reduced significantly with additional benefits in performance, functionality, and cost. Such practical, high-capacitance materials (>20 nF/cm2) will enable embedded capacitors for printed circuit board applications. In addition, high energy density capacitors (>1 J/cc) are needed for temporary backup power and pulsed-power in electronics and hybrid vehicles. \r\n",
