 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, \"An Interdisciplinary Program in Nanotechnology Integrating Undergraduate Coursework and Research,\" at the University of Kansas (KU), under the direction of Dr. Judy Z. Wu will implement the latest advances at the interface between nanoscience and bioscience into an undergraduate course, \"Introduction to Nanotechnology,\" that is open to all relevant disciplines in science and engineering.  Based on the experience generated by teaching this course, KU will establish a minor degree curriculum in Nanotechnology.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed project is in the implementation of the latest advances at the interface between nanoscience and bioscience into an undergraduate course entitled \"Introduction to Nanotechnology\" that is open to all relevant disciplines in science and engineering.  Based on the experience generated by teaching this course, KU will establish a minor degree curriculum in Nanotechnology.  New interdisciplinary nanoscience research projects crafted specifically for undergraduate students will be initiated along with the development of an interdisciplinary team with critical expertise in and long-term dedication to undergraduate education in nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed project include not only forefront education for the next generation in nanoscience, but also novel interdisciplinary research topics in nanoscience and engineering.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) Program Solicitation (NSF 06-538), and is being funded by the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE).",
