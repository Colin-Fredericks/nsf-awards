Weinstein\r\n\r\nWe propose to support travel to Japan for US participants\r\n(primarily graduate students and postdocs) at the conference\r\nPoisson 2006, to be held in Tokyo June 5-9, preceded by a\r\npreparatory \"school\" of three days in length.  The aim of the\r\nmeeting, whose full title is \"Poisson Geometry in Mathematics and\r\nPhysics,\" is to bring together mathematicians and mathematical\r\nphysicists with common interests in Poisson geometry and its\r\napplications.  With roots in classical mechanics about 200 years\r\nago and work of Sophus Lie about a century ago, the subject of\r\nPoisson geometry crystallized through work of Lichnerowicz and\r\nKirillov in the 1970's.  Its influence now extends to a wide\r\nvariety of areas, including symplectic geometry and topology,\r\ndeformation theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry,\r\nintegrable hamiltonian systems, and field theory.\r\n\r\nSpeakers at the school and conference have been chosen not only\r\nfor the importance of their results but also for their ability to\r\ncommunicate them to a broad audience of mathematicians and\r\nphysicists.  Proceedings will be published in a manner which\r\nmakes them accessible at low (or no) cost to a wide readership,\r\nin order to stimulate further study and research in the rapidly\r\ngrowing area of Poisson geometry.\r\n\r\nDetailed information about the activities may be found at the\r\nwebsite: http://www.u-bourgogne.fr/monge/g.dito/poisson2006/.\r\n",
