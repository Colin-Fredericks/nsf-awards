 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will demonstrate the operational feasibility of a new solid-state hydrogen storage material, which will meet safety standards for general commercial uses while providing high energy density. Hydrogen generation will be triggered by a temperature-gated reaction resulting in the identification of solid mixtures with hydrogen storage capabilities ranging from 2000 to 3250 Wh/kg and from 2000 to 2850 Wh/L on a materials only basis. The proposed research includes identification of preferred energy dense mixtures, development of knowledge of reaction kinetics, thermodynamics, and overall energy balances, and measurement of the mixtures' stability and tolerance to environmental conditions to gauge safety. \r\n\r\nCoupled with a hydrogen fuel cell, this new hydrogen source is sufficient to provide 2 to 3 times the runtime offered by state-of-the-art Lithium-ion batteries of the same weight and volume. The proposed concept will meet the critical performance and safety measures required for market adoption of fuel cell technology. The results will significantly advance the state of hydrogen storage technology, and may be extended to larger scale hydrogen storage applications. \r\n",
