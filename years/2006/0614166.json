 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tHabitat degradation and species introductions are increasing the opportunity for hybridization between species.  When hybrids have poor survival, pairs of species can sometimes develop mate choice mechanisms to prevent interbreeding.  This research uses mathematical models to examine how two biological factors affect whether mate choice divergence will occur.  Some animals that mate multiple times disproportionately use the sperm of members of their own species, a phenomenon called conspecific gamete precedence; mathematical models and computer simulations will assess whether different forms of conspecific gamete precedence can prevent divergence in mate choices.  Many animals also have a learned, as well as genetic, component to mate choice.  The remainder of the research will analyze how learning can affect the likelihood of mate choice divergence.  \r\n\tPortions of this project will be undertaken by undergraduates as part of a mathematical track being developed by the PI at the University of North Carolina. The goals of this track are twofold, to increase the mathematical literacy of biology majors in general, and to increase the participation of women in mathematical biology. Students will distribute their findings on a website developed for use by biology teachers and students.  Participating in this research enables the students to further our understanding of the processes that produce and maintain biological diversity.\r\n",
