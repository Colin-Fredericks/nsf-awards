 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diego Troya of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University is supported by a CAREER award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for research into the theoretical understanding of the dynamics of gas/organic-surface reactions.  The work is focused on developing a consistent methodology to generate potential energy surfaces for the description of adiabatic gas radical/organic-surface reactions  The method is based on using QM/MM (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) techniques in which the QM portion uses semiempirical Hamiltonians that are both more accurate than some first principles methods and orders of magnitude faster.  The work is having a broader impact both on our understanding of basic chemical reaction dynamics and through Troya's involvement with several Hispanic  serving institutions in Florida and Texas.  This educational project has two parts: the development of computational modules for use in chemistry labs in these institutions, and the inclusion of Hispanic students from these institutions in a summer research program at Troya's home institution.",
