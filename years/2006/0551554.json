 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, enabling infrastructure to capture speech, motion, expressions, and gaze, supports research in collaboration and Human Computer Interaction (HCI). Current interests in Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) include understanding how people collaborate across multiple tasks with multiple partners, designing systems that interrupt users intelligently, supporting gestures and other types of nonverbal behavior in remote collaborations, and creating tools that can interpret meetings and other social behavior. The work contributes to the observation and analysis of fine details of human behavior, uses data for understanding human collaboration, especially the mechanics of face-to-face interaction in co-located and remote CSCW. A focus of fine details of human behavior, including facial expressions, body positions, gestures, and movements, is common to these projects, motivated by the belief that in depth analysis of behavior is necessary to move CSWC research and development into the future. CSWS is necessary for understanding the mechanics of face-to-face interaction, for identifying those aspects of face-to-face interaction that are most important to provide remote collaboration, and for programming intelligent collaborative systems. The infrastructure for a multimedia laboratory for research on computer-mediated collaborative behavior consists of the following four elements:\r\n\r\n-Motion capture system, Mobile eye-tracking,\r\n-Multichannel video and audio recording.\r\n\r\nThe components, used independently or in combination, contribute to investigate a wide range of topics in human behavior. Examples include: large-scale collaboration in medical setting, interruptibility, tools for remote gestural communication, and multiple task performance. The enabled research should lead to an improved understanding of fundamental dimensions of interpersonal interaction, including the dynamics of group behavior, interruptibility and awareness, and interrelationships among gaze, gesture, speech, and actions. HCI, computer supported cooperative work, communication theory, social psychology, and organizational behavior might benefit from this work.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The general public is expected to benefit by the creation of new tools to enhance collaboration in fields such as medicine and security. Additionally, the infrastructure contributes in the training of students and enhancing education in pertinent areas.\r\n\r\n",
