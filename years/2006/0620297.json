 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the 1970s began a sustained interest in the rich and technically demanding control of partial differential equations (also referred to as control of distributed parameter systems or infinite dimensional systems).  The growth of this part of control theory has gone hand in hand with modern developments in evolutionary partial differential equations, both linear and nonlinear, requiring all the technical apparatus of the field.  The goal of this conference is to summarize the state of the field and highlight future directions and emerging applications.  At the heart of the program are the distinguished invited speakers who will speak for 50 minutes plus discussion.  The confirmed speakers include Hector J. Sussmann, Rutgers University; Suzanne Lenhart, University of Tennessee; Boris S. Mordukhovich, Wayne State University; Irena Lasiecka, University of Virginia; Roger W. Brockett, Harvard University; Roberto Triggiani, University of Virginia; and Jiongmin Yong, University of Central Florida.  The final session will be a panel discussion, in which the panelists will discuss the future of the field.  The audience will have a chance to participate with questions and comments to the panel.  A poster session will precede the conference dinner and give all interested participants an opportunity to present their work.  Participation in this poster session will be competitively based on a review of abstracts and will be expected of the supported junior participants.\r\n\r\nControl of partial differential equations is a modern branch of mathematics that is at the center of many applications in engineering, biology, chemistry, physics, and economics.  Its purpose is to economically control physical or other such systems by causing them to behave in a useful and unnatural way, e.g., to cause the propeller of a helicopter or ship to produce less noise and vibration both internally and externally.  The two-day workshop will present a summary of the state of the field of control of partial differential equations culminating in a panel discussion on future directions and emerging applications.  The conference, to be held on the campus of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), October 28-29, 2006, will include distinguished speakers, a panel discussion and a poster session.  Technological advances in experimentation and engineering applications have made this field vitally important to the national science base and facilitating the exchange of ideas is imperative to keeping the United States predominant in this area of research.",
