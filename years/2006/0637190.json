 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create the Computing Community Consortium (CCC), a proxy organization for the computing research community.  The CCC will support visioning activities designed to identify potential major opportunities, set priorities, and establish grand challenges for the computing field. These visioning activities will be based upon proposals by members of the computing research community as well as ideas generated by the CCC itself. \r\n\r\nThe CCC will be a mechanism to promote continued innovation by enhancing the ability of the computing research community to pursue long-term, computing research goals. Innovations in information technology are responsible for the majority of the gains in economic productivity in the U.S. over the past decade. Underlying those innovations is prior decades of computing research investments, much of it funded by NSF and other government agencies. The CCC will work with the scientific community to formulate research programs to realize large-scale, shared research facilities that change the scope and nature of the field. The CCC will partner with NSF and other funding agencies to open up new sources of funding for initiatives with exceptional long term impacts, to a greater extent than current funding mechanisms permit. This effort will lay the foundation for new ways in which information technology will continue to improve the quality of life and standard of living for people in the U.S. and worldwide.\r\n",
