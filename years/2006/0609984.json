 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bradley Miller, American Chemical Society, is a Discovery Corps Senior Fellow for the 2006-2007 academic year.  Miller proposes to initiate and sustain exchange and collaboration between U.S. and Brazilian chemistry researchers, particularly those with expertise in biofuels and biorefining.  His project includes a two-week site visit to Brazil by a group of US scientists, joint US-Brazil symposia to be held at the respective national professional meetings, and two web-based seminars on the chemistry of biorenewables. \r\n\r\nThis Discovery Corps Senior Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and the Office of International Science and Engineering. The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.",
