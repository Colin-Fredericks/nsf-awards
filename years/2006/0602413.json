Many types of RNAs are involved in key cellular functions in all living cells.  Among all known bio-organic molecules within living cells, RNA molecules are the only ones that store genetic information and act as catalysts.  In the course of this research, Dr. Limbach and his group at the University of Cincinnati will develop new strategies for the sensitive, accurate, and rapid characterization of RNAs; a database of appropriate signature products for tRNAs from several model systems; new strategies for the relative and absolute quantification of RNAs; and fundamental insights into RNase digestion. These will provide enabling advances for RNA researchers and can be translated to related areas of nucleic acid analysis (e.g., xenobiotic modifications).  The project will \"bridge the gap\" between RNA genomic data and RNA functional studies by readily identifying and quantifying complex mixtures of RNAs.  Moreover, it will provide researchers with additional tools that can examine transcription and translation processes, complementing existing genomic and proteomic strategies.  Students will be educated and trained in key areas of biological mass spectrometry.  Dr. Limbach will strive to expand the number of underrepresented minorities engaged in science in general, and mass spectrometry in particular, and will develop a peer-to-peer mentoring program for young girls to encourage their participation in math and science.\r\n",
