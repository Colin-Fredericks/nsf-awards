 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the class of Low Density Parity Check (LDPC)\r\ncodes.  LDPC codes come equipped with an iterative message-passing\r\nalgorithm which operates on a certain bipartite graph associated to\r\nthe code.  The algorithm acts locally on the graph, and this results\r\nin both its greatest strength (low complexity) and its greatest\r\nweakness (nonoptimality).  The PI's focus is on understanding this\r\nweakness.  Because the algorithm acts locally, it cannot distinguish\r\nif it is acting on the graph itself or on some finite unramified cover\r\nof the graph.  This leads to the notion of \"pseudo-codewords\", which\r\narise from codewords in codes corresponding to the covers and which\r\ncompromise the decoder.  Thus to understand the performance of LDPC\r\ncodes, we must understand these pseudo-codewords; most of the problems\r\nthe PI considers stem from the desire to understand pseudo-codewords\r\nof LDPC codes.  In previous joint work, the PI has given two\r\ncharacterizations of the pseudo-codewords of an LDPC code: via the\r\nso-called \"fundamental cone\" and via the edge zeta function of a\r\ncertain graph attached to the code.  While the fundamental cone\r\ncharacterization is valid for all LDPC codes, the zeta function\r\ncharacterization is satisfactory only in the special case of cycle\r\ncodes.  The PI will further her study of the fundamental cone and the\r\ndevelopment of a zeta function characterization for pseudo-codewords\r\nof general LDPC codes.  Additional targets of study are non-binary\r\nLDPC codes and their pseudo-codewords as well as the connections\r\nbetween LDPC codes and another class of graph-based codes: turbo\r\ncodes.\r\n\r\nWhenever information is transmitted across a channel, errors are bound\r\nto occur.  By adding redundancy to the data, many of these errors can\r\nbe corrected.  If the information is thought of as strings 0's and 1's\r\nof fixed length, then the codewords are strings of 0's and 1's of\r\nlength some longer length, where the difference in lengths represents\r\nthe amount of redundancy which was added.  A collection of codewords\r\nis called a code.  A large part of classical coding theory is\r\nconcerned with finding the trade-offs between three fundamental\r\nparameters of a code: its length, its number of codewords, and its\r\nminimum Hamming distance, i.e., the minimum number of positions in\r\nwhich any two distinct codewords differ.  While any code can correct\r\nall errors of weight at most rougly half its minimum distance, most\r\ncodes can correct many errors of substantially higher weight.  It is\r\nthe goal of modern coding theory to find those representations of\r\ncodes that admit decoding algorithms that allow for correction of all\r\nthe error patterns that the code can correct --- not only those which\r\nhave weight at most roughly half the minimum distance.  One of the\r\ngreatest achievements of modern coding theory so far is the discovery\r\nand subsequent development of the class of Low Density Parity Check\r\n(LDPC) codes.  The usefulness of these codes stems from the fact that\r\nthey come equipped with a very efficient decoding algorithm which\r\noperates on a certain bipartite graph associated to the code.  The\r\nmain goal of this project is to further the understanding of the\r\ntheoretical performance of this decoding algorithm, especially through\r\nthe study of the so-called \"pseudo-codewords\" which arise from codes\r\nassociated to finite covers of the bipartite graph.\r\n",
