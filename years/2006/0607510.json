 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST-0607510\r\nChen\r\n\r\nDamped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs), traditionally found along the sightlines toward background quasars, probe neutral gas regions that resemble the disks of nearby luminous galaxies, that is, they are the gas reservoir that fosters star formation at high redshift.  However, identifying the stellar counterpart of the DLAs is difficult because the quasars outshine the faint galaxies in the foreground, so understanding the nature of DLA galaxies requires a new approach.  This program will identify a new sample of DLAs along the sightlines toward gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, whose brightness makes them a sensitive probe of intervening gas, but which do not interfere with studies of absorbing galaxies once the afterglow has faded.  Early-time, high-resolution spectroscopy of GRB afterglows together with deep, late-time imaging and spectroscopic surveys along the sightlines offers a novel way to study the DLA galaxies and their interstellar medium.\r\n\r\nData obtained will be archived and made available to the community, and will be useful for a broad range of scientific studies.  The work will educate a graduate student, and inspire undergraduates and other young scientists, through participation in observations and short courses.  Exquisite imaging and spectroscopic data will be combined with computer simulations to produce animations and posters for public education, through collaboration with the Adler Planetarium.",
