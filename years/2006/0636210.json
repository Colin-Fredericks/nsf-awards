 "awd_abstract_narration": "The science of Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI) focuses on the development and use of advanced information technologies, including methodologies, models and algorithms, infrastructure, systems, and tools for national/international and homeland security related applications through an integrated technological, organizational, and policy-based approach. ISI also encompasses the areas of terrorism research, biosurveillance, and intelligence analysis as well as security-related public policy. The ISI conferences have been instituted to provide an intellectual forum for discussion among disparate and often separated communities: academic researchers in information technologies, computer science, public policy, and the social sciences; local, state, and federal law enforcement and intelligence experts; epidemiologists and other public health community members; and information technology industry consultants and practitioners.\r\n\r\nThis grant will support  the 2006 International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI-2006) May 23-24, 2006, in order to bring together noted informatics, computer science, and policy researchers as well as members of the public health, law enforcement and security communities to engage in dialogue and explore potential avenues of collaboration. ISI-2006 will be co-located with the 7th Annual National Conference on Digital Government Research and will be  cosponsored by the US intelligence agencies and Dept. of Homeland Security. This should  further broaden the possibilities for participation in this still-emerging scientific discipline. Additional events and meetings may be held both before and after the conference to facilitate planning and community dialogue. The meeting will solicit high-quality research papers of relevance to intelligence and security research, which will be peer reviewed by both researchers and practitioners for presentation as well as publication. The expectation is that active intelligence and security informatics research will improve knowledge discovery and dissemination, and enhance information sharing and collaboration across law enforcement communities.",
