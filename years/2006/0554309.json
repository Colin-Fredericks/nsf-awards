 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds on a very successful program of summer institutes for mathematics teachers, graduate students and university faculty at the Park City Mathematics Institute (PCMI) run by the Institute for Advanced Study and supported in part by Boston University and EDC.  In this project they will produce, publish and disseminate a strong mathematics content curriculum for in-service secondary mathematics teachers and prepare a group of specialized teacher-leaders to deliver this curriculum across the country.  The program works on the theory that an immersion experience moves teachers to a higher order of understanding; formality and precision are crucial in mathematics; and teachers thrive in a mathematical community.  Important components of this project are that expert teachers will ensure that the mathematics is relevant to the professional lives of secondary teachers and mathematicians will be core members of the development and review team.  The materials produced for these courses contain ingredients for a problem-driven curriculum connecting advanced mathematical knowledge with the mathematics used by secondary teachers, in and out of their classrooms.  Mathematics courses that connect upper-division university mathematics to secondary mathematics are not typically available to teachers.  This program uses very well respected mathematics and mathematics educators to prepare content rich materials that will be tested at a prominent facility with teachers.  They will also be working with presenters at this time to prepare facilitators guides for the materials.  The developers currently have five three-week courses.  The proposal will allow them to 1) add exposition and detailed commentary for facilitators; 2) add courses where there may be gaps in the mathematical topics and 3) prepare teachers who will work with mathematicians to develop and teach the materials to their colleagues using the PCMI professional development approach.\r\n\r\n",
