 "awd_abstract_narration": "Miles College, a four year Historically Black liberal arts instition in Birmingham, Alabama aims for an increase in the production of well-prepared, competitively trained minority graduates who enter the workforce or pursue graduate studies in STEM disciplines.  In order to attain this goal, Miles will utilize HBCU-UP funding to 1) develop an effective recruiting college bridge program; 2) develop a comprehensive STEM undergraduate research infrastructure and 3) develop and implement an effective graduate bridge program.\r\n\r\nThe HBCU UP project at Miles will include several bridge programs.  The Summer Science Enrichment Academy will be aimed at high school students and will strengthen their academic base.  The Summer Science Institute will be aimed at Freshman and Sophomore undergraduates, and will include academic courses as well as research techniques.  The most innovative is a summer bridge program for students from Lawson State Community College, also an HBCU.  The institutions have existing articulation agreements, and this bridge program will serve to strengthen the relationship.  Students will be afforded scholarships and research training.\r\n\r\nThe Miles College HBCU-UP project will benefit from collaborations with the LS-AMP project, especially in the implementation of graduate school preparation activities.",
