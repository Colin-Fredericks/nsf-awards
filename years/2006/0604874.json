Via Gromov-Witten theory, string theorists have made\r\ncompletely unexpected predictions concerning counts of complex\r\n(holomorphic) curves in algebraic manifolds. Some of these\r\npredictions have been verified mathematically, but most have\r\nnot. Many connections between Gromov-Witten theory and\r\nenumerative geometry have been discovered independently of string\r\ntheory as well. However, many others remain to be found. The most\r\nfundamental object in the Gromov-Witten theory is the moduli\r\nspace of (pseudo-) holomorphic maps.  The PI has developed an\r\napproach for studying its local structure using analytic\r\ntechniques of symplectic topology and a separate topological\r\napproach for recovering global information from the local data.\r\nCombined together, the two approaches have led to a variety of\r\nresults, in enumerative geometry and in symplectic topology, for\r\ncounts of curves of low genus, primarily zero and one. Among them\r\nis a geometric relation between genus-one invariants of a\r\ncomplete intersection and those of the ambient projective\r\nspace. One objective of this project is to verify the\r\nlong-standing mirror symmetry conjecture for counts of genus-one\r\ncurves in the quintic threefold, using this geometric\r\nrelation. Another objective is to apply the results to counting\r\ngenus-one curves in projective varieties.  However, the primary\r\nobjective is to extend the detailed description of the moduli\r\nspace of genus-one maps already obtained to higher-genus cases,\r\nespecially genus two.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project is potentially far\r\nranging. Its aim is to advance the fundamental understanding of\r\nthe Gromov-Witten theory, which in turn should lead to new\r\napplications in symplectic topology and enumerative\r\ngeometry. Furthermore, it should open a way for testing a number\r\nof mathematical predictions of string theory. If some of these\r\npredictions were shown to fail, string theory would require at\r\nleast some modification, perhaps with implications for\r\nunderstanding physical phenomena.\r\n",
