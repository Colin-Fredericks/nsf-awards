 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference is held at the University of Florida, from \r\nMarch 9th through the 11th, 2006.   It is referred to as Ord06/UF\r\n\r\nThis conference is the ninth in a series initiated in 1998; these\r\nconferences have involved some aspect of Ordered Algebraic Structures. \r\nOrd06/UF concentrates on the role of frame theory in the subject. \r\nOrd06/UF, like its predecessors in the series, brings \r\ntogether 25 to 30 mathematicians from various parts of the globe, \r\nincluding graduate students and those who have recently received \r\ntheir PhD degrees. A published proceedings of Ord06/UF is planned.\r\n\r\n\tFor as long as there has been academic training of \r\nmathematicians, research and instruction have sought to abstract \r\nas a means towards understanding of the concrete and the particular. \r\nThus, the arithmetical properties of numbers became abstracted to \r\nthe theory of groups and rings, these being algebraic constructs \r\ninvented to ``explain'' why the real numbers, for example, behave \r\nthe way they do. Another school of researchers seized upon the \r\ngeometric notion of distance between numbers or points in space to \r\ndevelop the abstract concept of a topological space, which establishes\r\na sense of proximity without measurement of distance. In both of these \r\ngeneralizations the aim has consistently been to capture a greater \r\ncatalogue of phenomena by the act of abstraction, and not to create \r\nan esoteric replica of the instance that prompted the abstraction. \r\nIn this spirit the Ordered Algebraic Structurist has taken the \r\nnatural ordering of real numbers, together with its arithmetical \r\nand topological aspects, and developed the lattice-ordered group \r\nand ring. The contributors to Ord06/UF, broadly, have in common \r\nan interest in how a lattice-ordered group may best be described by \r\nfunctions which take on most of their values in the real numbers, and \r\nin which features of the construct are carried over to the algebra of \r\nfunctions. In this tracking of properties, topological spaces and \r\ntheir generalization to frames have increasingly played an important \r\nrole. The notion of an algebraic frame, in particular, has a dual \r\nidentity, enabling one to simultaneously capture topological and \r\narithmetical properties, and, moreover, how one set of properties \r\ninfluences the other.\r\n",
