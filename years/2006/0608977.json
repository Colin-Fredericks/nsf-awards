 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intellectual merit of this project focuses on the functionalization of hollow zeolite structures and the subsequent self-assembly of nanostructures (DNA, gold nanorods) in the hollow zeolite structures. These materials will then be developed for applications in areas such as gene delivery, photonics, catalysis, and optical sensing. The general approach is to prepare and surface derivatize the zeolites with a functional amine group spaced by a cleavable disulfide linkage. The functionalized, nanoporous zeolite tubes will then be utilized as a platform for evaluating gene delivery applications and novel hybrid zeolite-metal building blocks that self-assemble using specific receptor-mediated biological interactions. This highly interdisciplinary project will generate data that establishes the limitations and potential of functionalized, nanoporous zeolites in biological applications. The three main objectives are to: 1) synthesize and selectively functionalize hollow zeolite structures with thiol and amine groups 2) demonstrate the self-assembly of metal nanorods (gold) in the interior of the functionalized zeolite tubes and 3) prepare a gene delivery system  based on the self-assembly of plasmid DNA in zeolite structures.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project include: 1) engaging students from diverse backgrounds in a cross-cutting research program involving chemical engineering, chemistry, materials science, and pharmaceutics, 2) integrating research and education in undergraduate and graduate courses through the development of education materials for undergraduate chemistry courses and interdisciplinary graduate courses and 3) recruiting graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to participate in the research project.\r\n",
