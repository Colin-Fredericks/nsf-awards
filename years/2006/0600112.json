 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problems comprising the project are (1) to study moduli spaces in\r\nreal algebraic geometry as real hyperbolic orbifolds, which this is\r\npossible, with particular emphasis on the real forms of the\r\nDeligne-Mostow quotients of the complex hyperbolic space; (2) to prove\r\nthat the moduli space of K3 surfaces with a polarization of given degree\r\nhas contractible universal cover, and a similar result for the\r\ncomplement of the complex hyperplane arrangement associated to an arbitrary Coxeter group; (3) to try to construct complex hyperbolic\r\nreflection groups in arbitrarily large dimensions, or prove that they do not exist; and (4) to see if the monster simple group manifests itself in a certain simple way in terms of a certain quotient of complex hyperbolic 13-space.  The common thread in these projects is the role in\r\nalgebraic geometry of discrete groups acting on Hermitian symmetric\r\nspaces like the ball and the type IV domains.  Besides these discrete\r\ngroups, there are a number of other important groups involved, like the\r\nfundamental groups of hyperplane complements, and certain quotients of\r\nthese fundamental groups (perhaps including the monster).\r\n\r\nThe study of symmetry is called group theory; a group is the collection\r\nof all self-transformations of a picture, pattern, etc., that leave the picture, pattern, etc. alone.  The focus is on the transformation, for example, the act of rotating a picture around a\r\npoint in the plane.  If the picture looks exactly the same before and after the rotation, then it has rotational symmetry.  To emphasize this point of view we say that the group \"acts\" on the picture.  There are lots of different sorts of objects with group actions, including some\r\nthat are difficult of visualize but are still very important in physics and mathematics.  One of these difficult-to-visualize objects is called\r\ncomplex hyperbolic space, and the possible ways that groups can act on\r\ncomplex hyperbolic space have been studied by many mathematicians since\r\nthe 19th century.  The easiest-to-understand transformations of complex\r\nhyperbolic space are called \"complex reflections\", which (despite the\r\nname) are a sort of rotation around an axis. Groups that are generated\r\nby this kind of transformation play a privileged role in the field of\r\nalgebraic geometry, helping to explain certain patterns which appear\r\nwhen studying some important objects, including what are called \"binary\r\nquantics\" and \"K3 surfaces\".  The investigator has also noticed some\r\nmore patterns, currently unexplained, which may connect complex\r\nreflections to a famous group called the \"monster\" simple group.  The\r\nspecific technical problems to be addressed by the project all attempt\r\nto advance our understanding of groups generated by complex reflections,\r\nacting on complex hyperbolic space.\r\n",
