 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL EXPLANATION\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to synthesize new materials in mixed molten metal solvents. It focuses on two classes of materials, intermetallics and suboxides. Synthesis in molten metals allows for low reaction temperatures, which can result in the formation of unusual new metastable phases. The proposed research will investigate the effects of combining two different metals to act as a mixed solvent for the synthesis of intermetallics and suboxides. New intermetallic phases will be synthesized by combining elemental reactants in low melting metal mixtures such as a calcium-zink eutectic or a cerium-nickel eutectic. The products will be structurally characterized using X-ray crystallography, and they will be tested for potential hydrogen storage applications and magnetic ordering. In the exploration of suboxide compound synthesis from oxide precursors, the molten metal flux will act not only as a solvent, but also as a reducing agent toward the oxide reactants. Flux mixtures of a strongly reducing metal (such as sodium, magnesium, calcium, aluminum, or lanthanum) and a more inert metal (such as tin, indium, gallium, or bismuth) will be prepared in varying ratios to control the extent of reduction of a given oxide reactant. By controlling the electrochemical power of the flux mixture, it may be possible to tailor a subvalent product with a desired ratio of ionic and conducting structural moieties, and thereby design specific electronic properties such as band gap and work function. The resulting materials will be characterized using X-ray crystallography, solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, and optical measurements. \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a number of intellectual advances resulting from this grant will make possible a wide range of new materials, with new structures and potential uses such as hydrogen storage alloys, magnetic compounds, and optical sensors. This research is part of the developing focus on materials science at Florida State University (FSU), and will thereby result in a broader impact on students and the scientific community. Through this project and the related establishment of a materials science curriculum at FSU, students at a variety of skill levels (high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral) will be trained in this highly interdisciplinary field. This will enable them to interact productively with scientists in a variety of areas (such as chemistry, physics, materials science, and engineering), and to better understand the increasingly complex nature of modern science and technology.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nThis research project involves the exploration of molten metals as solvents for the growth of new alloys and intermetallic phases.  In particular, mixed metal fluxes have been investigated, in order to take advantage of the lowered melting points available by formation of eutectic mixtures, and the increased range of reactants soluble in two-component fluxes.  These mixed metal fluxes have proven to be versatile synthesis media for discovery and crystal growth of new intermetallics with complex structures and interesting properties.  For instance, large crystals of magnetic materials such as the spin-glass La21Fe8Sn7C12 and ferromagnet La6Mn10Al3 can be grown from reactions in La/Ni flux.  Possible hydrogen storage phases have been grown from melts containing alkaline earth metals; Ca/Li flux mixtures are excellent solvents for CaH2 which can react with other added elements to form new complex hydrides such as LiCa2C3H and LiCa7Si3H3.   In addition to allowing discovery of new phases, this project has also improved our understanding of reactivities of certain elements in these metal fluxes.  For instance, iron dissolves readily in La/Ni (or any other rare earth/late transition metal flux) and often forms products containing iron dimers, clusters, or layers capped by light elements such as Al or C if they are present.   These iron cluster building blocks are of great interest for their potential magnetic properties.   The ability to predict and control the occurrence of specific building blocks growing in flux reactions may eventually allow for design of product phases with desired properties. \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nThis 5-year project has provided research experience and training in solid state chemistry to 7 undergraduate students, 8 graduate students (yielding 3 doctorates and 1 masters degree thus far), and 1 postdoctoral researcher.  The interdisciplinary nature of this research (which involves working with physicists and engineers for characterization of our products) has fostered collaborations and strengthened both the materials chemistry program in our department and the new materials science and engineering doctorate program at Florida State  University.  In addition to educational impacts, the project benefits researchers in other fields, including metallurgists, who will gain more information about secondary phases which may grow during alloy formation.  These adventitious phases are often responsible for improved materials properties; for instance, CaMgSi is known to occur in magnesium alloys containing Ca and Si additives, increasing the tensile strength of the alloy.  Flux chemistry facilitates the growth of crystals of such phases, allowing for better study of their properties.  Physicists will also benefit, as some of the products of our reactions provide examples of unusual magnetic or electronic phenomena (spin-glass behavior, metal to insulator transitions). \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Susan E Latturner"
