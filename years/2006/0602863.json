This ICFDM is emerging as a premier international conference discussing frontier issues in the field of design and manufacturing.  The intellectual merit is on the learning and exchanging of novel ideas and new research results from top researchers around the world.\r\n\r\nThe conference has traditionally been able to create broad impacts not only for US researchers and students participating in the conference but also for participants from China and other countries in the world.  The co-sponsors of this conference include the National Natural Science Foundation of China, National Science Foundation (USA), Shien-Ming Wu Foundation (USA), the Guangdong Provincial Department of Science and Technology, American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME), Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society (CMES), and Guangdong University of Technology.  \r\n\r\n",
