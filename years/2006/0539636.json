 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will examine the use of a novel, ultrasonic materials consolidation technology as a means to embed Bragg intracore grating, fiber optic strain sensors as part of a real-time asset monitoring information system.  The embedding process for strain sensors using ultrasonic consolidation will be the focus of an extensive analysis of the nanoscale materials processing, structure and properties relationship. For example, the bonding of the ductile, metallic embedding environment with the ceramic devices and the bonding of the devices with a bridge, building, or dam will likely require the development of nanoscale engineering of the metal/ceramic or metal/metal interfaces. The ultimate focus will be on combining the information technology of optical fiber structural analysis with the nanoscale engineering of ultra-sonic consolidation to produce rugged, embedded, real time measurement of strain.\r\n\r\nThe convergence of these technologies could produce unparalleled capability for retrofitting structures to allow visibility into continuity, integrity, stability and damage assessment using real time transmission of information.  Structural health monitoring is a critical need not only to utilize prognostic analysis on a rapidly or gradually failing structure, but to provide tactical situation analysis from a site that may have experienced a significant trauma event. For example, structural asset visibility would allow large complexes, such as a dam, to anticipate future failure events as trend-based strain data would highlight potential system irregularities. In addition to this, the proposed solution would also provide first responders with that same real-time structure health data had there been some form of singular attack or natural disaster. In both cases the embedded sensor technology would be providing value to the site on both an economic and security basis.\r\n",
