 "awd_abstract_narration": "NIRT:  Semiconductor Nanowire Electronics\r\nPI:  J.M. Redwing\r\n\r\n\r\nObjective  \r\nThis NIRT proposal focuses on an investigation of fundamental issues in the physics and fabrication of group IV (Si, Ge, SixGe1-x) semiconductor nanowire-based devices.  The studies focus on two specific device types: field-effect transistors and axial p-n homojunction diodes which will be used as diagnostic structures to study scaling effects on device performance.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe research tightly couples device modeling and simulation with detailed experimental studies to extract carrier mobility and depletion effects in nanowire devices.  This capability will be used to study scattering mechanisms and the effects of orientation, surfaces, interfaces and impurities on carrier mobility in nanowire field-effect devices in the low-field regime and probe the transition from bulk to 1D behavior as the wire diameter is scaled down.  Similar studies will investigate changes in diode properties with decreasing wire diameter in axial p-n homojunctions.  Synthesis experiments will be combined with nanoscale characterization tools to examine size-related effects on nanowire growth and processing.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe research results are anticipated to be broadly applicable both to scaled Si CMOS technology and the rapidly emerging field of nanowire-based devices. Potential areas of impact include future generation logic devices, high speed transistors, resonant tunneling devices, chemical and biological sensors and devices for solar and thermal energy conversion. An industrial internship program is planned with Intel Corporation to provide graduate students working on the project with the opportunity to gain firsthand exposure to manufacturing and development issues in nanotechnology implementation. Undergraduates will participate in the program through REU sites and special programs at Penn State targeted at female and minority students.  A sustained mentoring program for middle school/high school girls will be developed providing hands-on workshops, field trips and career exploration activities designed to build confidence in math and science and exposure to careers in science and technology.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The research in this NIRT project focused on an investigation of semiconductor nanowires for nanoscale electronics. Fundamental issues pertinent to the synthesis, processing, integration, testing and physics of nanowire-based devices were examined. \nThe nanowire synthesis work focused on the use of metal-catalyzed vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth for the fabrication of silicon, germanium, silicon germanium, gallium nitride and gallium antimonide nanowires.  In the VLS process, nanowire growth occurs from a liquid in contrast to thin film deposition processes that involve only a vapor and solid.  Our studies therefore examined the role of the liquid phase in the growth process to understand potential limitations in the fabrication of abrupt interfaces and p-n junctions.  This work revealed that interfacial abruptness in nanowires is limited by the high solubility of dopants or alloy atoms in the liquid phase. Fundamental processing studies including thermal oxidation and silicide formation were examined in silicon nanowires.  This research demonstrated a diameter-dependent thermal oxidation rate that arises due to increasing compressive stress in small diameter nanowires.  In addition, it was found that the small size of nanowires alters the particular silicide phases that form during metal-silicon thermal annealing as compared to thin film materials. To facilitate the synthesis and processing studies, nanoscale metrology techniques were developed to enable detailed structural and chemical analysis of nanowires.  This included the development of a workbench that incorporated an electron transparent window for in-situ transmission electron microscopy analysis of metal-semiconductor reactions in the nanowire geometry.  A technique was also developed to prepare nanowire samples for atom probe tomography which was used to analyze the concentration and spatial location of aluminum dopants in silicon nanowires.  This work revealed that a portion of the aluminum was present in the silicon nanowires as nanoscale metal clusters which can degrade carrier mobility. \nThe results of the synthesis, processing and characterization studies were used to demonstrate nanoscale electronic devices based on VLS-grown silicon nanowires.  Axial modulation doped n+-p--n+ silicon nanowires were used to demonstrate wrap-gate field-effect transistors that operate in a \"normally off\" mode.  Scanning capacitance measurements were used to study the doping profile of p+-n+ axial junctions in silicon nanowires.  These studies demonstrated a significant increase in the junction width in the nanowires after thermal oxidation due to dopant diffusion.  The axial nanowire diodes were then used in combination with electrostatic doping to demonstrate tunnel field-effect transistors which operate based on band-to-band tunneling. The physics of nanowire electronic devices was also explored by experimental characterization analyzed by a \"top-of-the-barrier\"/Landauer model. More extensive theoretical studies were conducted to explore the differences in nanowire transistor physics as compared to conventional, planar 2D transistors and to explore other potential applications &ndash; primarily thermoelectrics. These studies relied on the Landauer approach as the basic analytical tool and the non-equilibrium Green\u00c6s function approach to quantum transport when detailed, numerical simulations were necessary.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/13/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joan Redwing"
