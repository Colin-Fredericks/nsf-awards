Orr\r\n\r\nThe Graduate Student Topology Conference will provide graduate student\r\ntraining and create opportunities via student talks, via communication\r\nof recent advances, and by introducing students to others within their\r\nfield.  We accomplish this with the participation of established\r\nresearch leaders who will give plenary talks and interact with\r\nstudents, and through graduate student talks. Vaughan Jones from UC\r\nBerkeley and Dusa MacDuff from SUNY Stony Brook will give keynote\r\npresentations. A winner of the 1990 Fields Medal, Jones is a member of\r\nthe National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and\r\nSciences.  After celebrated work in von Neumann algebras, Jones\r\nestablished a new paradigm for knot theoretic research with his\r\nbreakthrough discovery of the Jones Polynomial.  Dusa McDuff is a\r\nmember of the United States National Academy of Sciences, the American\r\nAcademy of Arts and Sciences, and is a fellow of the Royal Society of\r\nLondon. She has numerous honors including the Satter Prize of the\r\nAmerican Mathematical Society in 1991.  Graduate students will present\r\na range of topics from elementary introductions of fundamental topics\r\nto ongoing research.\r\n\r\nTopology is an abstracted form of geometry studying the aspects\r\nof geometric objects which are unchanged through continuous\r\ndeformation.  Of particular interest to geometric topology is the\r\nclassification of manifolds, that is, spaces which near each\r\npoint look Euclidean.  One often solves a geometric topology\r\nproblem by relating it to other algebraic problems that are more\r\ntractable.  The algebraic tools so developed have substantial\r\nindependent interest within algebraic topology.  Topology is a\r\ncentral field of theoretical mathematics having broad\r\napplications to physics and other sciences.  The conference takes\r\nplace at the Bloomington, Indiana campus of Indiana University on\r\nApril 1 - 2, 2006, and will encourage essential communication and\r\ncollaboration among graduate students working in the area of\r\ntopology, and pertaining to their research initiatives.\r\n  \r\nThe conference web page is http://www.indiana.edu/~gstc/.\r\n",
