Seventy-one (71) international researchers and a ten-member program committee will meet to discuss current research in engineering education and associated disciplines, implications of research for practical applications, and future directions. Extensive assessment, ethnography, and literature analysis is planned to study and evaluate influences of this meeting by addressing the research question: To what extent can external interventions catalyze and accelerate emergence of engineering education as a recognized discipline?\r\n\r\nThis project will greatly enhance the infrastructure for engineering education research and understanding, on an international scale. Networks and partnerships will be built through the selection of participants representing a diversity of disciplines, countries, and research areas relevant to engineering education.  Dialogue proceedings, including contributed papers and summaries of the assessment and ethnographic research, will be archived and disseminated widely via a CD distributed in conjunction with an issue of the Journal of Engineering Education as well as a widely accessible web site.\r\n",
