AgReserach is an independent, Crown-owned research and development company.  They report to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Crown Research Institutes.  The visit will facilitate development of a collaborative plan on plant and ecosystem responses to global change.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the 21st century, atmospheric CO2 concentration will be double the current levels unless dramatic emission reduction measures are implemented.  Given the importance of CO2 for plant growth and development, there is considerable effort to predict the fate of native vegetation to this projected rise in CO2.  Responses to increased atmospheric CO2 at the whole plant level are the product of a complex set of processes that result from coordinated interaction between root and shoot.  Plant metabolism of carbon and nitrogen are so tightly linked that any change in uptake and assimilation of one is likely to affect the uptake and assimilation of the other.  The state of knowledge in this area is highly \"descriptive\" with predictive model development lagging far behind.  The collaborators will address parameters that are needed for the development of more robust mechanistic models designed to predict the future fate of terrestrial vegetation.  The availability of a unique setting (combination of short-term manipulative experiments and long-term CO2 natural springs) in New Zealand is an ideal situation for the project.    It is also anticipated that this project will provide unique training and educational opportunities for a U.S. postdoc and graduate student to obtain a global research experience.  It is anticipated that these collaborations between the scientists and students from each country will lead to long-term collaborations that will benefit all the institutions.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
