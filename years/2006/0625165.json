 "awd_abstract_narration": "Allen University is a private, liberal arts, historically black university located in Columbia, South Carolina.  The HBCU-UP project, Enhancing Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics at Allen University (ESTEM-AU) will 1) revise course contents and integrate technology into STEM curricula and instruction; 2) develop undergraduate research program and improve critical transition activities for recruitment and retention and 3) broaden and strengthen the research program for faculty.\r\n\r\nTo achieve its goals, the ESTEM-AU project will institute a variety of course modifications in mathematics, chemistry, biology and physics.  Among the approaches that will be utilized are 1) an Integrated Instructional Delivery System in freshman and sophomore level courses which include multimedia electronic lecture notes, tutorials, online testing and online assignments; and 2) Discvery Learning Approaches.  Equipment and professional development activities will strengthen the integration of technology into STEM instruction and curricula.\r\n\r\nAllen University will develop activities to increase the involvement of undergraduate students in research during the academic year and summer months.  The summer internships will rely on collaboration with major research institutions.  In addition, they seek to increase the preparation of incoming freshman students through a summer bridge program.\r\n\r\nFaculty will be supported in their ESTEM-AU efforts through professional development workshops, faculty exchanges, and collaboration with visiting scientists and research institutions.",
