 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mapping, Analyzing and Problem Solving (MAPS) using Geographic Information Science (GIS), implements an embedded GIS curriculum in a broad range of undergraduate science and technology courses and provides a three-course entry-level GIS sequence.  GIS knowledge and skills are critical to a broad range of occupational areas and academic disciplines. MAPS GIS addresses workforce needs by combining an experiential, modular, learning approach with the visual/spatial nature of GIS to attract more students to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs and technical careers. A two-pronged, multi-disciplinary approach is employed: (1) MAPS embeds GIS concepts and applications as modules within primary disciplines that employ GIS; and, (2) MAPS develops and implements a three-course sequence for entry-level GIS knowledge and skills that articulates with GIS courses at four-year universities. Students engaging in MAPS curriculum gain valuable problem solving and collaborative skills while becoming aware of potential GIS career paths. The project is developing GIS modules to be embedded in existing courses; developing the GIS course sequence; training faculty how to use the GIS technology, developing modules for their courses; and providing dissemination that enables other learning institutions to adopt the MAPS model. The MAPS project is strongly supported by industry and government employers, GIS academic leaders, and Lane's top administrators and key instructional managers.",
