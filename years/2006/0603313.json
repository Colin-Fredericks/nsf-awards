 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project team aims to educate a well-trained biotechnology workforce for the growing pharmaceutical and related industries in Puerto Rico.  The goals of the project are to provide student training in industrial biotechnology, to develop a campus laboratory space to be functionally equivalent to an industrial setting, and to design laboratory instructional materials.  The local pharma manufacturing industry is experiencing growth and is in the midst of a technological shift, transitioning from a traditional chemical manufacturing base to a biotechnology base.  The skills required to operate a biomanufacturing plant differ substantially from those currently taught by the college, thus the need for programmatic change.  Local industry is deeply involved in the design of the new technical instruction to be given at the college. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit\r\nThis project enhances the curriculum for an Associate Degree in Biotechnology Operations by acquisition of necessary equipment and training of faculty involved in the project.  The proposed activities have the potential to advance knowledge, improve student learning, and enhance technical training in the area of biotechnology operations, an area of expertise demanded by biotechnology companies in Puerto Rico, which is currently third among the world's leading biotechnology manufacturing centers.  The establishment of this degree is unique in Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts\r\nBecause the project is implemented at an Hispanic-serving institution, the project activities broaden the participation of minority students and increase diversity in the workforce.  The dissemination plan includes usage of the ATE Center Bio-Link.  The participation of an industry advisory board contributes to the identification of current and future needs for technicians.  Project evaluation focuses on improvement of laboratories, increased recruitment of students, and enhancement of faculty expertise in biotechnology.",
