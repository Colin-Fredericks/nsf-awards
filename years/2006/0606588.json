Part 1 of the project,\r\njoint with Hofer and Zehnder, develops an analytical framework\r\nfor Symplectic Field Theory. It is devoted to a general nonlinear\r\nFredholm theory, which takes place on new spaces of locally\r\nvarying dimensions called polyfolds. The second theme of the\r\nproject is the outgrowth of research of Wysocki and collaborators\r\non finite energy foliations. In one of the subprojects he will\r\nuse the theory of finite energy foliations to prove that\r\nstar-shaped energy surfaces in four-dimensional space carry at\r\nleast two Hamiltonian periodic orbits. A long-term behavior of\r\narea preserving disk maps will be investigated in a joint\r\nsubproject with Hofer. To understand this behavior, the Floer\r\ntheory will be combined with the theory of finite energy\r\nfoliations. In another part of the project, Wysocki will use\r\nfinite energy foliations to study the uniqueness of symplectic\r\ncapacities of convex domains in four-dimensional spaces. \r\n\r\nThe problems studied in symplectic geometry were motivated by\r\ncelestial mechanics. For example, the motion of the planetary\r\nsystem can be described by a system of nonlinear differential\r\nequations called Hamiltonian systems. The flow lines of\r\nHamiltonian systems follow very complex patterns. This project\r\nwill provide new tools for studying complexities of this behavior\r\nand will lead to a better understanding of the structural aspects\r\nof Hamiltonian flows on star-shaped energy surfaces. The new\r\ngeneral Fredholm theory aims at providing the rigorous analytical\r\nfoundations of Symplectic Field Theory. These ideas should also\r\nbe applicable to nonlinear partial differential equations arising\r\nin mathematical physics.",
