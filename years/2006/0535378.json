 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs will facilitate the U.S. Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics (GLOBEC) Northeast Pacific (NEP) Coordinating Office for an additional three years (through March 2009). The NEP Coordinating Office is responsible for the coordination of the many, diverse research activities that have occurred in the California Current System (CCS) and Coastal Gulf of Alaska (CGOA). The NEP CCS and NEP CGOA are in the synthesis phase of U.S. GLOBEC and the NEP Coordinating Office will be responsible for integration and dissemination of synthesis activities.  The role of the NEP Coordinating Office in facilitating synthesis is four-fold: Coordination, Liaison, Data and Information Management, and Outreach.  The PIs have developed a strategic framework to perform the duties and functions necessary to organize this phase of the programs.   The broader impacts for the NEP Coordinating Office include ensuring data access, providing opportunities for interactions, and general coordination of research activities.  In addition, results of the synthesis phase will provide guidance for future ocean observing systems in the NEP.  Synthesis results will be disseminated through web sites, publications, presentations, and other written media (GLOBEC International and PICES newsletters, etc.). These results will also be incorporated into educational materials, such as high school curricular material presently being developed by the OSU Science and Math Investigative Learning Experiences (or SMILE) program, which encourages minority and rural youths to pursue careers in science.",
