Bernstein, Univ. of Notre Dame\r\n\r\nSummary- The availability of high-performance systems is no longer limited by device performance, but rather by the cost of advanced technologies and the packaging performance.  In particular, 50-to-75 GHz wireless links have been demonstrated linking fiber-based and wireless networks, but this is not available commercially due partly to the cost of integrating the various components into compact and cost-efficient systems. Here, novel interface technology to improve the performance of high-speed systems at lower cost is presented.  \r\nTypically, signals flow from one IC through a wire or bump, into a lead and onto a substrate or board and then the reverse to another IC.  The proposed novel technology creates a vastly improved electrical circuit path directly between ICs through the use of IC structures that allow chips to be edge-to-edge interconnected, resulting in the highest possible bandwidth and lowest possible losses.  The PIs call this \"Quilt Packaging\" because the resulting mosaic of dice is reminiscent of a sewn cloth quilt.  \r\nThe PIs will build on their experience fabricating \"quilts\" of silicon ICs to include compound semiconductor microwave and optoelectronic circuits.  Signals propagating among chips with bandwidths in excess of 100 GHz will be demonstrated.  MEMS structures will be built on the edges of dice, and connected to effect the novel transmission paths that allow very high frequencies with minimal losses.\r\nQP interconnects will be used to demonstrate high performance, compact, and inexpensive optical-to-RF wireless communication links as a demonstration vehicle comprising three ICs, namely a photodetector, simple signal processor, and transmitter. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts- Quilt Packaging technology has the potential to make a significant impact in the hybrid integration of microwave and optoelectronics circuits.  Advantages of QP include:  heterogeneous integration of ICs using various materials, high bandwidth, reduced power, reduced system cost, and smaller chip area.  Lowering the cost of packaging while improving performance will bring many communications systems within reach of consumers.  In the area of network communications, this could have a significant impact on narrowing the technology divide between economic classes as well as developing and third-world countries.  The PIs also plan to use their experience in teaching Freshman engineering classes to bring these concepts, as well as the social implications of developments in information technology, to budding engineers.  The benefits to society and the aspect of high-technology demonstrated by this program will be used to excite entering engineering students.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit- Many intellectual challenges are presented by this work that, when solved, will form a contribution to the field of microwave, optoelectronic, and hybrid packaging and systems development.  These include new ways of looking at signal transmission between ICs, tradeoffs in terms of power, bandwidth and cost versus reliability and process development, and others.  The development of ultra-fast chip-to-chip communication may ultimately lead to new system architectures to take full advantage.  Finally, new manufacturing techniques will have to be developed to allow direct chip-to-chip systems to be feasible in the consumer market.\r\n",
