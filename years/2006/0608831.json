 "awd_abstract_narration": "The workshop took place on January 13-20, 2006 at the McGill University Bellairs Research Institute in Barbados. A series of workshops has been organized by faculty from McGill and from other universities. This year the workshop is interdisciplinary, with half of the participants from Biology, Chemistry, Biophysics and Mechanical Engineering. Activities involve formulating mathematical and algorithmic problems derived from applied fields. Current research interest is in geometric problems arising from biology: protein folding, NMR structure determination and protein flexibility modeling. The goal is to highlight open problems and ongoing challenges to the field, with the intention that formalized statements of open problems will help form a catalyst for new investigations and innovative solutions, while motivating new researchers, particularly students, to engage in attacking some of the interdisciplinary research questions that rely on discrete and computational geometry. The results of the workshop will be widely disseminated by means of the internet, with talk abstracts and a detailed list of open problems raised.",
