 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is creating the University and Community Alliance for Mathematics and Computer Science (UCAMCS) with the goal of providing scholarships to encourage and enable academically talented, but financially needy, students to complete their baccalaureate degree in mathematics or computer science, and to enter the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce. In mathematics and computer science programs at the college, this project is (a) increasing the number of graduates, (b) increasing college enrollment of under-represented minority students; (c) improving educational opportunities for students; (d) increasing retention and graduation rates; (d) improving student access to and utilization of support programs available at the university; and (e) strengthening partnerships between the university, local school districts, local STEM educational organizations, and local STEM industries. The program is working collaboratively with the Honors Program at the university. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Program activities provide important opportunities to advance knowledge and understanding relative to effective support and enhanced advising for undergraduate students in the STEM disciplines and opportunities to recruit and place new graduates in STEM enterprises. The use of innovative academic advising and mentoring models using an organizational development tool along with subsequent evaluation fosters tight integration of education and research.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project focuses on support for undergraduate students in the STEM disciplines while improving the quality of teaching, training and learning university wide. Activities broaden the participation of underrepresented groups and involve recruitment, retention, graduation, and placement in STEM-related areas. The project promotes institutionalized and systematic change in the infrastructure of the institution for advising, mentoring, networking, and partnerships. It is strengthening the social, economic, and intellectual fabric of the Southeastern region of North Carolina.\r\n\r\n",
