 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacteria belonging to the phylum Acidobacteria are ubiquitous and abundant in\r\nsoil. Despite this, we know very little about soil Acidobacteria; only a small\r\nportion of the genetic diversity within the phylum has been surveyed and the\r\nphylogenetic relationships of acidobacterial taxa have not been adequately resolved. In\r\naddition, the physiological characteristics of Acidobacteria and their ecological roles in\r\nsoil remain largely unknown. One major reason for this is that Acidobacteria are poorly\r\nrepresented in soil culture collections as they are difficult to culture using traditional\r\nculturing strategies. This project has two objectives: 1) to survey and describe the\r\ngenetic diversity of soil Acidobacteria, and 2) to improve methods for the cultivation of\r\nsoil Acidobacteria in vitro so their physiological characteristics can be assessed. To\r\nmeet these objectives, we will collect six distinct soils from across the United States and\r\nbuild acidobacterial-specific clone libraries from extracted DNA to describe the\r\nphylogenetic diversity of soil Acidobacteria. We will then use a PCR-based screening\r\napproach to identify the specific conditions, or set of conditions, under which\r\nAcidobacteria are most efficiently cultivated from soil. Our goal is to isolate and culture\r\nthose Acidobacteria which, from the results of the soil clone libraries, are found to be\r\nnumerically abundant in the collected soil samples. Since our previous work suggests\r\nthat soil Acidobacteria are strongly oligotrophic, we expect that Acidobacteria can be\r\nmost effectively cultured with nutrient-poor media and prolonged incubation times. Once\r\nsoil Acidobacteria can be successfully isolated and cultured in vitro, their physiological\r\ncharacteristics can be assessed in-depth. With this project, we will significantly expand\r\nwhat we currently know about soil Acidobacteria; we will describe the genetic diversity of\r\nthis under-surveyed taxa and, by obtaining pure culture isolates, we can begin to\r\ninvestigate the ecological roles of soil Acidobacteria. This project will provide a graduate\r\nstudent with training in both conventional microbiology (strain isolation and cultivation)\r\nand molecular microbiology (rDNA sequence analysis).",
