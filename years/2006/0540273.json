 "awd_abstract_narration": "WGBH will produce and distribute 10 new episodes of the award-winning television series \"PEEP and the Big Wide World ,\" which is targeted to preschoolers.  In addition, the project will expand the PEEP Web site, and develop and evaluate an online multimedia tutorial to help educators engage preschool children in science.  The project's three intended impacts are to (1) engage preschoolers in science explorations that promote positive attitudes and inquiry skills, (2) empower parents to encourage and support their children's science activities, and (3) provide educational resources and professional development for preschool educators via a curriculum that contributes to the emerging field of preschool science education.  The project's innovative deliverables include a television show that has a unique style and content, a Web site that is navigable by non-readers, and outreach activities that fulfill an important need for preschool science education.  The series is produced by WGBH and broadcast on TLC and Discovery Kids.  The project's collaborators, which include organizations such as Head Start, the National Education Association, Countdown to Kindergarten, American Library Association, and Boston Children's Museum, help promote the series' educational goals across different platforms, maximize resources, extend impact and reach underserved audiences.  The Goodman Research Group will conduct the project summative evaluation.",
