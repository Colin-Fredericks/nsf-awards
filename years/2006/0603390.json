 "awd_abstract_narration": "The SMART Project is building regional capacity in schools and colleges in Southeastern Massachusetts and providing students (grades 8-14) with clear and supported pathways to careers in civil, environmental, and marine technology fields. The SMART partners, including four high schools, three higher education institutions, and numerous governmental, private industry, and nonprofit organizations, are working together to expand, improve and sustain ATE in this region beyond the expiration of the grant by leveraging fiscal and political support. Partners are collaborating in the design of the technical education programs and are receiving technical assistance and shared equipment to implement the SMART certificates.  \r\n\r\nThis project is developing and strengthening course and program articulation with area high schools through the introduction of three SMART technology certificate programs that begin at the secondary level and transition qualified students to associate of science degree programs at Bristol Community College (BCC) and Cape Cod Community College. The SMART Project also supports activities that increase the retention of matriculating engineering technology students at BCC, prepares students for licensure and facilitates their entry into the workforce and/or baccalaureate programs. At the middle school level, the project provides career awareness activities. At partner high schools the project is embedding articulated college-credit courses leading to SMART certificates and strengthening learning by supplying  laptops and software. \r\n\r\nCurriculum is being aligned with industry, state, and national standards. SMART classes emphasize contextual-learning through summer internships and cooperative education. Existing courses are being revised and clustered to provide three new SMART technical skill certificates: the Environmental Technology Certificate, the Marine Technology Certificate and the Geographic Information Systems Technology Certificate. Several new courses are being developed for the Marine Technology Certificate.\r\n\r\nThe SMART project employs a range of evidence-based strategies to engage and retain students in ATE including well-structured technical career exploration activities and expanded dual enrollment options. Professional development activities bring teachers, faculty, industry and other partners together to collaborate on planning courses, lab and field experiences, internships, and cooperative education. The refinement of the cross-functional technical skill and knowledge components of the SMART \"core\" curricula is extending the knowledge base of convergent technology education. This project supports economic development of the area and responds to employers' growing need for licensed technicians and operators. The project also recruits and supports women, minorities and people with disabilities who are currently under-represented in engineering.\r\n",
