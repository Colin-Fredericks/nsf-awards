 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. David W. Pratt of the University of Pittsburgh and his graduate and undergraduate research students will conduct high resolution spectroscopic measurements of gas phase biomolecules.  His group will look at a variety of \"push-pull\" molecules, the chromophore of green fluorescent protein, short peptide and nucleic acid sequences, and water clusters of the above.  Some of the specific techniques to be used include Stark spectroscopy and chirped-pulse Fourier-transform microwave spectroscopy.  The ultimate goals of these studies are to gain a deeper understanding of the photophysics of prototypical biomolecular species and to provide accurate data for theoretical chemists interested in biomolecular problems.\r\n \r\nBesides the broader scientific impacts of the research being supported, Prof. Pratt continues to provide excellent scientific training to his undergraduate and graduate research students, and he is actively involved in developing curricular materials for undergraduates not majoring in the sciences and he is working with the University of Pittsburgh's Learning & Research Development Center, the School of Education and the Pittsburgh Board of Public Education to provide professional development opportunities for middle school science teachers.\r\n",
