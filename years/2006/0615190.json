 "awd_abstract_narration": "CSR-PDOS-Collaborative: Virtual Machines Meet Application Clusters: A\r\nHighly Responsive Global Utility Computing Platform for Internet\r\nApplications\r\n\r\nWith the omni-presence of Internet applications, service-oriented computing\r\nincreasingly plays a dominant part in global computing.  Thus,\r\nunderstanding how to build efficient platforms for service-oriented\r\ncomputing is critical in supporting continued Internet proliferation.  The\r\noverriding goal of this research is to gain such understanding, and in\r\nparticular to investigate basic principles in building a global Utility\r\nComputing for Internet Applications (UCIA) platform that is highly\r\nresponsive in resource reallocation, provides resource isolation to\r\ndifferent applications, and supports heterogeneous execution environments.\r\n\r\nThis research encompasses a number of specific directions.  This includes\r\nstudying tradeoffs between different architectures for resource sharing in\r\na global UCIA platform and investigating efficient algorithmic approaches\r\nto request distribution and application placement that account for the\r\ncomputational cost of executing the algorithms and the interaction of these\r\ntwo policies.  It focuses in particular on the interaction between two\r\nfoundational technologies in global UCIA, wide-area application clustering\r\nand virtual machines.  By leveraging these technologies in a novel way,\r\nthis research promises a significant speed-up in resource redistribution\r\namong applications.  To quantify its findings, this project utilizes a\r\nwide-area testbed running a sample of off-the shelf Internet applications\r\nand emulating several data centers.\r\n\r\nInternet applications are transforming the Web from an information system\r\ninto a global service-oriented computing platform.  By improving our\r\nability to build highly responsive, global utility computing platforms for\r\nInternet applications, this research will support continued progress in\r\nthis important direction.\r\n",
