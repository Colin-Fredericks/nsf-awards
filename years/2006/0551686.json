Improvements will include a new simulator architecture, new models for wireless networks, provide for software encapsulation, and integration of the tools with virtual network testbeds. The changes will enhance scalability, extensibility, and new application program interfaces that open the simulator to open source networking software. Emulation capability will be improved to allow integration with testbeds.Wireless modules will be rewritten to track advances in wireless networking. Educational scripts will be facilitated in the enhanced version. The Network Simulator is heavily used in research; these improvements will allow it to continue to be a leading resource for \r\n",
