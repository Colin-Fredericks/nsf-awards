 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research. The research topics in this proposal are: 1) Fundamentals for the wiretap channel:\r\nerror control codes for reliability and security, 2) Opportunistic wireless physical-layer security, 3) Highly\r\nreliable and secure distributed data storage. In all areas the focus is not only on theory but on practical\r\nalgorithms to achieve the very high levels of security and reliability promised by information theory.\r\nThe PI and collaborations: About half of the work in this proposal will be done with collaborators\r\nin Europe connected to the Georgia Tech Lorraine (GTL) campus in Metz, France where the PI was\r\nformerly Director of Research and currently Deputy Director. In March 2006, the PI and his colleagues, in\r\npartnership with the French Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), established a joint research\r\ncenter dedicated to international collaborations in secure networks and advanced materials, the first such\r\ncenter of its kind in France. This center hosts fifteen people and ten projects from four institutions. The\r\nwireless portion of this proposal will be done in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Porto (J.\r\nBarros) and Cambridge University (M. Rodrigues). The international component of our project creates\r\nopportunities and challenges. For example, the landscape for recruiting and educating graduate students\r\ntoday is characterized by i) decreases in the students applying to US universities, particularly from China\r\nand India, and ii) a lack of US students getting meaningful engineering educational and research experience\r\noutside the US. We believe this project, coupled with the GTL campus in France, can address some of\r\nthese challenges and help create future engineers, educators and researchers with a more global perspective.\r\nThe broader impact of this project has two dimensions: i) global connections with a pathway to\r\ncommercialization of new wireless security concepts; and ii) new models for training graduate students\r\nacross national boundaries. The students and faculty would participate in new and long-lasting international\r\nresearch and educational activities. These students will have a much more global perspective, have the\r\nopportunity to interact on a long-term basis with European students and faculty, and the project would\r\nserve to identify (for companies, universities and government agencies) outstanding people with a global\r\nperspective. This model addresses the changing landscape and needs of student and faculty in the US and\r\nabroad.\r\nThe intellectual merit is in new approaches to physical layer communications, from both theoretical\r\nand practical perspectives. The notion of a highly secure and reliable physical layer has the potential to\r\nsignificantly change how people think of the physical layer. The error control codes in this work will have\r\nthe dual roles of reliability and security, adding a new dimension to a subject that has been studied\r\nextensively for more than 60 years. We believe the research presented here will result in changes in how\r\nclassical communication systems are perceived and used, and is the next natural step in higher\r\nperformance, physical layer communication systems.",
