Sobolev spaces\r\nof weakly differentiable maps appear naturally in the solution of\r\nvariational or differential equations problems, but the\r\nfundamental theorems on Sobolev spaces of maps between regions in\r\nEuclidean spaces are not necessarily reproduced for maps between\r\nmanifolds.  Topology in the domain and range of a mapping space\r\ncan prevent approximation of an arbitrary Sobolev map by smooth\r\nmaps and can force singularities to appear in solutions to\r\nvariational problems.  The principal investigator's work aims to\r\nunderstand the analytical description of some of these\r\ntopologically forced singularities.  Some particular topics\r\ninclude the rectifiability of defect measure of a general Sobolev\r\nmap, Ginzburg-Landau type approximation for maps which are not\r\nweak limits of smooth maps, gap phenomena, extension of maps with\r\nenergy control, travelling waves in planar antiferromagnets, and\r\nsingularities of minimizing p-harmonic maps.  Tools include\r\ngeometric measure theory, analytical techniques for simplified\r\nGinzburg-Landau models, differential topology, and homotopy\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nPhysical problems often admit formulations that seek to minimize\r\nenergy or some energy-like quantity over a large family of\r\nallowable configurations.  For example, the path of a beam of\r\nlight follows the shortest route between two points, minimizing\r\ntime and distance.  An important mathematical device for solving\r\nsuch \"variational problems\" is sometimes called the direct\r\nmethod: a sequence of realizable configurations that drive energy\r\ndown toward a lowest possible value is used to construct a\r\ngenuine minimizer, usually by picking out a subsequence that\r\nconverges.  To make this process work mathematicians tend to work\r\nin enriched environments such as the Sobolev spaces cited above.\r\nThese make convergence easier to establish, and then one has to\r\nshow that the candidate minimizer is actually present in the\r\noriginal setting.  It is a relatively recent discovery that this\r\nprocedure sometimes fails if the domain and range of the maps\r\nbeing studied has a bit of topological complexity, and the\r\nprincipal investigator's projects seek to analyze the nature of\r\nthese occasional failures.\r\n\r\n",
