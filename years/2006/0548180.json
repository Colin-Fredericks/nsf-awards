Additionally the PI will undertake a survey of chemical abundances in the Galactic thick disk, an analysis of the differential chemical depletion in the Milky Way, spectroscopy of gamma-ray burst afterglows, and abundance analyses of a modest sample of high redshift DLA systems. These projects will allow Dr. Prochaska to establish a comprehensive program for studying nucleosynthesis and galaxy formation during the first few Gyr of the universe.\r\n\r\nDr. Prochaska will also undertake a science education program designed to promote inquiry-based learning in high schools. The context for the program will be astronomical spectra, which provides for an integration of the research tool he and his colleagues use with his educational efforts. The program will have two main activities: 1) inquiry-based learning in several Santa Cruz high school classrooms; and 2) teacher symposia in inquiry learning held on UCSC campus\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe formation of heavy elements (e.g. carbon, oxygen, iron; also referred to as \"metals\" by astronomers), including the ingredients of life, is known to occur in stars which themselves have formed in galaxies over the past 10 billions years.  The actual timing of this enrichment and an understanding of the contributions of various processees of nucleosynthesis is not well understood.   As such, it is a highly active area of research in modern astrophysics.\n\n\nThe focus of this program was to assess the chemical enrichment of gas in the early universe, primarily in young galaxies.  Our experiment is unconventional: we obtain spectroscopy of the most distant, intrinsically luminous sources whose light coincidentally travels through gas in a galaxy (between us and the light source).  The hydrogen and heavy elements in this gas absorb a fraction of the light, imprinting signatures in the spectrum that reveal the gas' enrichment, chemical patterns, and other valuable physical diagnostics.  \n\n\nThis project primarily funded new observations with the Keck 10m telescopes on Mauna Kea, Hawaii of distant quasars -- supermassive black holes that shine with terrific luminosity.  Analysis on the high resolution spectroscopy of these quasars yielded a terrific set of results on the enrichment of gas in the young universe.  The primary results of this research included: (1) at early times, heavy elements are produced by stars at a rapid rate such that the enrichment of galaxies doubles approximately every billion years; (2) the youngest galaxies studied are usually highly deficient in heavy elements (e.g. 1/100 that of our Sun) but surprisingly are never entirely devoid of metals.  This implies a very early episode of stellar nucleosynthesis; (3) although very rare, pockets of primordial (metal-free) gas do exist and have properties consistent with modern theories of the nucleosynthesis that occurs just a few minutes after the Big Bang; (4) There is a rare but valuable set of galaxies just a few billion years old that are as chemically mature as our own galaxy.\n\n\nThe other main research of this program was to study the light from the explosions of massive stars in young, star-forming galaxies.
