 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is now understood that neutrons and protons, the constituents of the atomic \r\nnucleus, are themselves composed of quarks. A major question in nuclear \r\nphysics is how this quark substructure is manifested in observables in \r\nnuclear physics. To reveal these quark effects, we concentrate on approximate \r\nsymmetries. These are symmetries of nature that are nearly, but not completely,\r\nobeyed. Studying how these symmetries are violated, and by how much, allows us \r\nto examine quark effects in nuclear physics. We focus particularly on charge \r\nsymmetry; this would be an exact symmetry if there were no differences between \r\nprotons and neutrons. We concentrate on effects of breaking charge \r\nsymmetry at high energies, where the quark structure of matter is more evident.\r\nWe also propose to study details of the strong interaction, the interaction \r\nthat holds the atomic nucleus together. We are currently concentrating on \r\n\"exclusive\" reactions (scattering reactions where all of the final products \r\nare observed). We are trying to determine the most efficient of two equivalent \r\nways of describing these reactions. Another area of proposed study is an \r\nexamination of effects that occur when particles move in extremely small \r\ntwo-dimensional systems. It has long been known that particles like atoms and \r\nmolecules possess both particle and wave properties. In most cases the \"wave\" \r\nproperties of matter are small, subtle effects. In certain systems, the wave \r\neffects can dominate observed properties. These effects are seen in \"nanoscale\"\r\nsystems (with dimensions roughly those between atoms in a solid) with visible \r\nlight, or by using microwaves in systems with dimensions in centimeters. We \r\ncarry out numerical simulations in collaboration with a physicist who conducts \r\nexperiments on microwave systems. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts involve training of scientists in high-tech fields. We \r\ncarry out research with undergraduates, grad students and postdocs, who \r\nbecome expert in complex systems with applications in technology, pure \r\nresearch, defense, communications and finance. Recent postdocs have included \r\nseveral women, and this trains new women scientists. The principal \r\ninvestigator (PI) provides seminars on recent advances in physics for \r\nnon-scientists; these talks increase scientific literacy in the general \r\npopulation. The PI and his students volunteer for a children's science museum \r\nin Bloomington, Indiana. He is currently a participant in a multidisciplinary \r\nstudy of \"Science and American Public Democracy\" at the Indiana University \r\nPoynter Center for Ethics and Public Institutions.  \r\n\r\n",
