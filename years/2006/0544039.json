 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Malpighiaceae are a large family of tropical flowering plants, most diverse in the New World but represented in the Old World, from Africa to the Philippines, by seven evolutionary groups, each more closely related to a neotropical group than to other paleotropical groups. Previous molecular studies have shown that the family is descended from a single ancestor in the New World, where the distinctive morphology of the flowers is related to their pollination by oil-collecting bees. Those bees did not accompany the plant species that migrated to the Old World, where the floral morphology is more diverse. The three specialists collaborating in this research combine training and experience in both traditional systematics and modern molecular and analytical techniques, and many years of work in the systematics and evolution of the Malpighiaceae. They plan a set of four interlocking projects: 1) additional molecular sequencing to resolve the worst remaining problems in the family's phylogenetic tree; 2) use of DNA sequences, fossil evidence, continental history, and present geographical distributions to address the question of the path(s) followed by the ancestors of those seven paleotropical groups in their migration from the New World to the Old World; 3) application of morphological studies of disparity to paleotropical species and their neotropical relatives to evaluate hypotheses on the evolution of floral morphology; and 4) a revision of the generic taxonomy of the family and the placement of the resulting classification on a website, with phylogenetic trees, interactive keys, nomenclature, descriptions, illustrations, photographs, and distribution maps.\r\n\r\nThis study will bridge the gap between molecular studies and traditional morphological techniques. The resulting synthesis among investigators will be a paradigm for a new approach to systematics that will serve the needs of all those around the world who rely on systematists for the best, most modern classifications of tropical organisms: conservationists, ecologists, foresters, and laypeople. The website will provide a way to convey all the results of this work in a timely manner, and will allow for constant updating and amplification of the information provided. The studies of the relationships between New World and Old World species, and their migration routes, will be of great interest to biologists grappling with similar problems in other groups of plants and animals. Studies of morphological disparity will allow biologists to understand better how morphological stasis is maintained in the tree of life. At least one Brazilian botanist will visit the United States for advanced research under this grant, which will contribute to the integration and cooperation between scientists in the United States and Brazil, the largest and most important country in South America. There will also be participation in this research by both undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\n",
