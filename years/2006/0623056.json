 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary: SHOT 50th Anniversary Workshop\r\nThis proposal seeks NSF assistance in developing a workshop to mark the 50th anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the Society for the History of Technology (SHOT). The workshop, to take place the\r\nday before the annual meeting in Washington, DC in the fall of 2007, will be hosted by the\r\nNational Academy of Engineering. Workshop sessions will examine and discuss scholarly\r\ntrends and patterns and new approaches to the field. The goal is to enable the Society to encourage its members and other scholars working on the history of technology to pursue work in the newest directions using the newest approaches and insights. Since technology is a vital and omnipresent element of modern society, SHOT also seeks to press beyond the internal and professional questions about the state of the field and extend the reach of our scholarship, connecting to the widest possible external audience. Thus the workshop will be structured and conducted in ways that help make our understandings of technology accessible to other groups that share an interest in, and concerns about, the interactions of technology and society. Thus the workshop has both scientific merit and broader impact, as the NSF expects.\r\nScientific Merit\r\nThe scientific merit of this project lies in the effort to assess and evaluate the main contours of the\r\nhistory of technology, by devoting an entire day to discussions before the regular annual meeting.\r\nThis arrangement allows the largest possible participation by historians of technology. Presenters\r\nwill represent the full diversity of the Society, as the workshop seeks to present exciting\r\nscholarship in terms of approaches and subjects. The participants will include both beginning\r\nand senior members of SHOT and visitors and guests from outside the history of technology. The\r\nSociety will strongly encourage participation by graduate students through its travel grant\r\nprogram. The primary intent is to delineate promising areas and outstanding examples of\r\nscholarship as SHOT and its members enter a sixth decade of existence.\r\nThe Broader Impact\r\nThe broader impact of this workshop resides only partially in the educational opportunity that\r\ninevitably will result from the participation of a significant number of the Societys attendees in\r\nthis special event. As important is the Societys effort to reach out to scholars and experts in\r\nother fields of academic and in other professional organizations who share an interest in\r\ntechnology but who have not been connected to SHOT specifically. The workshop will continue\r\nthe Societys attempts to renew and strengthen linkages to engineers and engineering, building a\r\nbridge to the National Academy of Engineering, which will host the meeting. SHOT also will\r\nstrengthen linkages to scholars in other areas of history and the social sciences and to policy\r\nmakers. As one SHOT member put it, our target audience (outside SHOT) should be that small\r\narmy of academics and intellectuals who are dealing with the real problems of the world and need\r\nthe kind of historical perspective that only we can provide. Or as another historian observed,\r\nthis workshop is designed to explore the relevancy of the history of technology in the modern\r\nworld. To further this goal, the Society will produce an edited volume including the best papers\r\nfrom the workshop as a special issue of its journal, Technology and Culture. Moreover several\r\nsessions will be videotaped so that they may be streamed on the Societys web page as part of\r\nSHOTs expanding outreach effort using the WWW.\r\n",
