 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nWhile, tropical forests support perhaps 60% of all flowering plant species and 50% of all terrestrial NPP and carbon stored in terrestrial biomass, few long-term studies of tropical forests have been conducted, particularly studies of factors affecting flowering, seed production and seedling establishment, growth and mortality. Knowledge of the forces that maintain diversity during the reproduction and regeneration life history stages is critical to understanding and maintaining tropical forest diversity. The absence of long-term, quantitative studies of reproduction and early regeneration of tropical forest plants has made it difficult to identify relationships with natural climate variation as well as possible long-term trends caused by anthropogenic forcing. The research will maintain long-term quantitative studies of plant reproduction and seedling establishment in three Neotropical forests varying in disturbance regime, seasonality and diversity.  Ecuador, Panama and Puerto Rico vary in the influence of climatic forcing by the El Nino Southern Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation, hurricane disturbance and the potential effect of anthropogenic global change. These data on temporal and spatial patterns of seed rain and seedling recruitment allow tests of hypotheses concerning causes of interannual variation and roles of different mechanisms in facilitating species coexistence including recruitment limitation, competition-colonization trade-offs, density-dependence and regeneration niche differentiation; all mechanisms hypothesized to be important to species coexistence and forest dynamics. This LTREB project will support the training of undergraduate and graduate students, provide new data to the scientific community, and inform the general public on the importance of global change research. Publishing all data and associated analyses on a web site here will insure maximum societal benefit from the data collected. \r\n",

This means that hurricanes and land use signatures may interact to produce novel or non-analogue forest species compositions.  Finally, a third study showed that trade-offs in competitive..."
