 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical:\r\n\r\nThis research award builds on unique expertize and experimental\r\nfacilities at the University of Maryland to discover the properties of\r\nrotating fluid flow in water and liquid helium. Turbulence in similar\r\nflows is important in engineering (in jet engines and pumps), stars, and\r\nin understanding the Earth's atmosphere and outer core.  This project\r\nwill also explore a strange type of motion at low temperature known as superfluid\r\nvortex turbulence. The overall goal of the research is to advance our\r\nunderstanding of rotating fluid turbulence. The mentoring and training of\r\nyoung researchers, as undergraduate and graduate students, is a critical\r\npart of this project. They will obtain professional skills as\r\nresearchers, preparing them for advancement as independent scientists to\r\nwork in industry, national laboratories, or in research universities.\r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\n\r\nThis research award builds on unique experience and experimental\r\nfacilities at the University of Maryland to probe shear driven flows in\r\nthe presence of rapid rotation in Newtonian fluids and superfluids.\r\nTurbulent flows with global rotation arise in engineering, astrophysical,\r\nand geophysical situations.  This research funding allows work on\r\ndirectly visualizing superfluid vortex turbulence, in addition to\r\nexperiments in more easily diagnosable water flows.  The overall goal of\r\nthe research is to advance our understanding of a broad class of\r\nphenomena involving the interaction of nonlinearity, rotation and, in\r\npart, quantum fluids. The mentoring and training of young researchers, as\r\nundergraduate and graduate students, is a critical part of this project.\r\nThey will obtain professional skills as researchers, preparing them for\r\nadvancement as independent scientists.",
