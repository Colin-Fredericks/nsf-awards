 "awd_abstract_narration": "Design-based science pedagogy presents students with a design challenge that requires them to use targeted science content to design and build a working artifact.  It can be an especially effective method to help learners develop mental models of how things work, understand scientific concepts, and develop scientific reasoning.  This project focuses on identifying software design principles and instructional principles for supporting science concept learning through design-based exercises.  Two technologies for promoting science learning will be integrated into design-based learning environments: simulation and modeling software, and software to support construction of explanations and predictions.  The pedagogical focus of this project is the science of force and motion at the middle school level.\r\n\r\nSoftware design research issues of this project include understanding (i) the functions simulation and modeling software should have when integrated with physical design activities so as to promote more effective concept learning from design activities, (ii) needed functionality in software that supports explanation and prediction construction in such an environment, (iii) design guidelines for integrating these two kinds of software, and (iv) guidelines for designing interactions between learners and the software to promote easy use, personal connections, and curiosity.\r\n\r\nPedagogical research issues include identifying practices for (i) interweaving design and testing in the physical world with simulation and modeling and (ii) interweaving prediction and explanation with designing and modeling, such that students learn targeted science concepts deeply, including the ability to use them for prediction and explanation of real-world phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
