 "awd_abstract_narration": "The State University of New York Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (SUNY LSAMP) Phase III educational research project focuses on student support services and graduate issues.  The project employs a mixed method research plan, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, to answer questions pertaining to undergraduate and graduate level student attainment into the professoriate and to work toward models of best practices.  \r\n\r\nThe study will examine such questions as:\r\n\r\n1)\tWhat are the elements of a successful tutoring program?\r\n2)\t Variations in staffing and the delivery of services:  what are the principal benefits and challenges in undergraduate research?\r\n3)\tWhat is the relative importance of various motivations on underrepresented minority students as they complete college and look toward the future?  \r\n4)\tWhat factors lead minority graduate students to aspire to or reject careers in the professoriate?  \r\n\r\nProject results will identify successful approaches and the reasons for the success.  A model will be developed for planning academic and personal support as well as successful strategies to encourage progression to graduate study for minority students in a variety of settings.\r\n\r\nThe results of the study will be disseminated through scholarly articles, presentations at conferences, via relevant websites and through the National Center for Inclusive Education at Stony Brook University.  The 33 other National Science Foundation Louis Stokes Alliances will be direct beneficiaries of the dissemination results using a number of different forums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
