 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nThe proposed research consists of a study of the interrelation of political competition and\r\neconomic knowledge in the design and implementation of deregulated electricity markets\r\nin the U.S. INTELLECTUAL MERIT    It will therefore bridge the literature on the performativity \r\nof economics and the older and broader economic sociology of the construction of market institutions.\r\nUsing a combination of methods, the research will reconstruct the process by which\r\nexisting electricity markets were designed by analyzing the work of economists within\r\ntheir field, the field of politics over electricity deregulation, and then considering the\r\npolitical coalitions that are formed across these two domains. The eventual configuration\r\nof the new electricity markets will be related to this simultaneously scientific and\r\npolitical process. Economists involved in the area of the design of electricity markets\r\nwill be identified, and data will be collected on their scientific standing, institutional\r\nlocation, ties to government and private-sector clients, in order to locate them in an\r\noverall structure of this field. Of these, roughly 30-40 will be subjects of open-ended\r\ninterviews dealing with their professional careers and their stances on the key\r\ncontroversies of the design of electricity markets. Data will also be collected on the\r\npolitics of market design in this area, by identifying organized representatives of the\r\nmajor interests involved, collecting primary and secondary materials on them, and\r\ninterviewing key players from industry, government, and consumer groups. BROADER \r\nIMPACTS  The research will contribute to general knowledge in science and technology studies, as\r\nwell as economic sociology, by integrating an awareness of the role of economic experts,\r\npervasive in the market-style deregulation of recent decades, into the sociological\r\nunderstanding of the construction of market institutions.",
