To date many research programs have taken up the product cycles and health impacts of nanomaterials, and many are exploring the potential of nanoproducts for environmental applications (membranes, sensors, etc.), but none have begun to examine directly nanomanufacturing technologies. At this stage of understanding and development of nanomanufacturing technologies, it is difficult to form testable hypotheses. It is very likely that some nano approaches will be measurably better in terms of their comparative environmental performance, while others will be worse. Thus this research is need-driven, as are many new research problems.\r\n",
