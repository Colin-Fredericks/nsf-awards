The core idea is to unify the multithreaded and event-driven models of concurrency, providing the benefits of both styles of programming.  This unified concurrency model internally structures code in continuation-passing style and uses the type theoretic approach of monads to mediate between the thread and event views of the system.\r\n\r\nThe approach will be tested first by building a high-performance web server using the Haskell programming language.  Driven by the experience gained in that phase of the work, the remainder of the research will concentrate on scaling up the methodology in two ways.  First, a layered approach to designing large network service stacks will be investigated.  Second, ways of adapting the abstractions to work for multiprocessor architectures will be explored.  Both of these phases of the research will draw on expressive static type\r\nsystems to eliminate overheads introduced by abstraction boundaries and allow programmers to exploit parallelism.\r\n  \r\nThe expected outcome of this research is improved programming language support and design methodologies for building robust, highly concurrent software.\r\n",
