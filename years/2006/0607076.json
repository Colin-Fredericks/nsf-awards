 "awd_abstract_narration": "B Project Summary\r\nSupport is sought from NSF to help with the organization of the 8th International Workshop on Discrete\r\nEvent Systems - WODES06, to be held in Ann Arbor on the campus of the University of Michigan, July 10-\r\n12, 2006. WODES is a bi-annual series of conferences entirely devoted to the field of discrete event systems.\r\nIt is attended by 100-150 researchers (primarily from academia), with considerable international diversity.\r\nAll past seven editions of WODES have been held in Europe, every other year since 1992. WODES conferences\r\nare not financially sponsored by any technical organization. In the past, host institutions have been\r\nsponsoring the conference.\r\nWODES06 is the first edition ofWODES to be held in the US. It will provide researchers from different\r\nfields (control theoreticians and control engineers, software engineers and computer scientists, operations\r\nresearch specialists) with an opportunity to exchange information and new ideas, and to discuss new developments\r\non the theory and applications of discrete event systems. The conference will be particularly\r\nattractive to US students in these fields who have not been able to attend WODES in the past. It offers\r\na unique opportunity for them to get exposed to the latest research trends in the multidisciplinary area of\r\ndiscrete event systems. The organizers of the conference intend to offer reduced registration rates to student\r\nattendees in order to encourage their participation. Moreover, the organizers are making a special effort\r\nto solicit participation of industrial researchers at the conference through industrial sponsorship, invited\r\nsessions, and software demonstrations.\r\nBroader Impacts: WODES06 will have broad educational impact on the US graduate student community\r\nin control engineering, embedded systems, software systems, and operations research as well as broad\r\nimpact in bringing together theoreticians and practitioners with interest in modeling, analysis, verification,\r\ndiagnosis, control, optimization, and simulation of discrete event systems.",
