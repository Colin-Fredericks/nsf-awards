 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will demonstrate a new nano-scale, conformal, atomic layer deposition (ALD)-enabled hermetic capping. Such an innovative capping technology will transform MEMS and electronics integration from dual-in-line packages (DIP) into chip-scale packages (CSP), wafer level packages (WLP) and three-dimensional (3-D) packages, which are required for low-cost\r\nand super-compact systems. MEMS devices are mechanically protected by polymer layers with cavities. Polymer processing is fully compatible with existing WLP manufacturing for microelectronic components. To meet hermetic and/or vacuum requirements, a nano-scale (25 to 60 nm) ALD-alumina layer with a hydrophobic surface monolayer will be coated to provide comprehensive, conformal, pinhole-free protective coverage. This project will demonstrate the feasibility of this innovative concept by using a MEMS package sealed by a polymer structure coated with ALD-alumina and hydrophobic monolayer. The project will also demonstrate a product insertion process by transforming microelectronic non-hermetic CSPs into hermetic ones. The project will be applied to various CSPs produced by different manufactures.\r\n\r\nCommercially, packaging is recognized as one of the major barriers to the large scale commercialization of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). Wafer-level hermetic capping has enabled the integration of MEMS and electronics in dual-in-line (DIP) packages. This project creates a new paradigm to apply ALD for packaging of MEMS, microelectronic, optoelectronic and radio frequency (RF) components and systems. The potential impact of successful ALD applications to packaging extends far beyond the proposed hermetic sealing. \r\n",
