 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Akron is requesting funding for the Research in Disabilities Education Focused Research Initiative (RDE-FRI) aimed at increasing the quantity and quality of students with disabilities in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education. The three major objectives of the project are: 1) encourage specific learning disabilities (SLD) and typical students to explore STEM as a future career choice by building their confidence and efficacy in STEM, 2) develop empathy and better appreciation of diversity amongst students who would traditionally enter engineering programs and 3) develop understanding, better appreciation of diversity, and an elaborated sense of teaching and learning amongst the participants. To achieve these objectives, we propose a three-year intensive Saturday and summer workshops. These workshops will be used to provide learning experiences, access to engineering laboratory and field experiences for the participants, which include pre-college 6 to 8 grade students from Summit and Stark counties. Exciting hands-on activities based on the Society of Automotive Engineers? ?A World in Motion?, smart balloon, civil materials, and information technology are designed to capture and spark the interests of these students in the STEM fields. The materials presented at the workshop will illustrate aspects of inclusive technology and engineering classrooms education that will help the students succeed. The proposal is truly an integrated project among the Electrical and Computer, Mechanical, and Civil Engineering departments at The University of Akron.\r\n\r\nThe project consists of: (1) A summer workshop involving hands-on experiments; (2) Saturday workshops throughout the academic year; and (3) e-mentoring program throughout the academic year by college students, professional mentors and the professors. The summer workshop is designed for 10 SLD students, 10 typical students, 5 college students and 5 science/special education teachers. In both Saturday and summer workshops, participants will work in small groups consisting of 2 SLD students, 2 typical students, 1 college student and 1 science/special education teacher. These workshops offer participants the opportunity to think independently, to work collaboratively, and to design innovatively.\r\n\r\nThis project will add to our understanding of the effectiveness of mentoring and intervention aimed at increasing the interests of SLD pre-college students in STEM. The merit is evident by the unique demonstration of the integrated engineering and science concepts presented at the workshop. We will cultivate interest and understanding between SLD students, their peers and typical students. The PI will actively evaluate the different group?s (SLD, typical student, college students, science/special education teacher) attitudes towards STEM education. In addition, this program will provide on-going e-mentoring for participants in order to foster their positive attitudes towards STEM.\r\n\r\nThis program will be the first such program in Northeast Ohio aimed at increasing the interest of SLD students in STEM education. Specifically, the broader impact include: (a) direct STEM learning experience to 15 teachers, 15 college students, 30 SLD students and 30 typical students; (b) improvement in self confidence of SLD students in STEM; (c) the opportunities for SLD middle school students to demonstrate innovations, mathematics and science skills; and (d) a framework to facilitate the education of science and engineering by the special education teachers. Since some of the experimental developed during the workshops will be distributed to the participants? middle schools for inclusion in their science curricula, hundreds more middle school students will benefit. Perhaps one of the major benefits of this program is the peer-to-peer relationship. These participants will provide exposure to the others that may not ordinarily occur. The same can be said for the student-teacher-professor relationship. In this project, SLD students are placed in the least restrictive environment and are challenged along with their typical student classmates to strive for excellence, and to learn new skills that will build their confidence towards a career in STEM.\r\n",
