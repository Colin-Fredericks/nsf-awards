 "awd_abstract_narration": "A symposium-workshop is proposed on\r\nLandslide Ecology - A perspective from Tropical Mountainscapes that has three main goals:\r\nFirst, to expose ecologists to a conceptual model that emphasizes deep connections between\r\necosystem and geomorphic processes, and the resulting large-scale dynamics of tropical\r\nmountains mediated by landslides.  Bringing together experts with diverse backgrounds to think\r\nabout their own landslide work in a broader context is a first step towards breaking down barriers\r\nwithin and among disciplines. Second, to share the limited, yet diverse work on landslide ecology\r\nwith an audience coming from nations in which landsliding is a relevant process. The ecologists\r\nparticipating in this symposium-workshop use diverse techniques (field and lab work, tree ring\r\nanalysis, remote sensing, GIS, and modeling) to examine a diverse array of questions in\r\nmountain systems world-wide. Lastly, to outline a strategic program that will contribute to a\r\nsustained growth of the field of landslide ecology, and more broadly speaking of emerging fields\r\nlinking biology with geosciences.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts - The proposed symposium-workshop will bring together for the first time\r\nstudents and faculty investigating the influence of landslides on tropical and subtropical montane\r\necosystems, catalyzing at the same time the establishment of a network of collaborators. In\r\naddition, the symposium-workshop is meant to challenge ecologists to think of ways in which\r\necosystems influence this geomorphic process by exposing them to the physical aspects\r\nunderlying the formation of landslides. This symposium-workshop has been programmed as part\r\nof the annual meeting of the Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation, Kunming,\r\nChina, and therefore it is expected to have a multiplicative effect. In fact, this meeting attracts an\r\naudience for which mountains and landslides are important. The results of this symposiumworkshop\r\nwill be published, and in addition, the summaries will be posted on a web page\r\n(http://ursula.cnnet.upr.edu/landslides/) that will focus on landslide ecology. Overall, this\r\nsymposium-workshop will highlight the contribution that ecologists can make to understand a\r\nlarge-scale geomorphic process with evolutionary, ecological, environmental, and societal\r\nimplications.",
