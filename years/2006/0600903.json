 "awd_abstract_narration": "Let G be a complex semi-simple group, and let g be its Lie algebra.\r\nOur main object of study is the Kac-Moody extension g' of the loop\r\nalgebra g((t)); more specifically, the category of representations of\r\ng' at the critical level, denoted g'_(crit)-mod. Our goal is to develop a\r\nlocalization theory for this category, i.e., to relate it to other categories\r\nthat are constructed locally out of spaces, endowed with an action\r\nof the loop group G((t)), such as the affine Grassmannian. Ultimately,\r\nwe believe that the structure of g'_(crit)-mod is governed by a pattern\r\nof local Langlands correspondence, i.e., its extrinsic structure can be\r\ndescribed solely in terms of the space of local systems on the formal\r\npunctured disc with respect to the Langlands dual group.\r\nThe second (and, so far, unrelated) part of the project is the development\r\nof representation theory for groups associated to G and 2-dimensional local\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nThe object of study of the current project is representation theory.\r\nStarting from the 1930's it was realized that there is fairly small list\r\nof types of possible fundamental symmetries that occur in Nature.\r\nThese types are called \"root data\", and the corresponding concrete\r\nmathematical objects are called semi-simple groups. In order to have\r\na representation theory one has to pick one of those semi-simple\r\ngroups and couple it with a data of algebraic or analytic nature, such\r\nas what is known in mathematics as a \"field\" or \"ring\", e.g., real or\r\ncomplex numbers. Having a representation theory, the objects that\r\none deals with look fairly complicated, and most of the questions that\r\none can ask are not amenable to complete answers. However, we\r\nhope to find a point of view on representations, which, on the one\r\nhand, would answer some deep questions about their structure, and,\r\non the other hand, will ultimately reduce to questions about  the\r\ninitial data, i.e., the root system.\r\n\r\n",
