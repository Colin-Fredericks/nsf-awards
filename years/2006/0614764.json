 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parasitic insects, and particularly parasitic wasps, are extremely important natural controls on the populations of other insects and spiders, including many important pests in agriculture, forestry, and human and animal health. This project will survey, on a global scale, one major group of parasitic wasps, the Platygastroidea. The main goals are to (1) describe and name the more than 2000 species of the Scelionini; (2) intensively explore poorly known areas of the world with rich platygastroid faunas, particularly the Atlantic forest of Brazil, tropical forests of southeast Asia, the Western Ghats of India, and the arid lands of South Africa; and (3) conduct a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary history of Platygastroidea, using data from both their anatomy and DNA sequences. A multinational group from nine countries has been brought together to accomplish these goals, led by Dr. Norman F. Johnson (The Ohio State University) and Dr. Andrew D. Austin (University of Adelaide, Australia).\r\n\r\nCentral to the strategy to accomplish these goals is the use of databasing and Internet tools - a cyberinfrastructure - that will allow researchers around the world to store and analyze data, images, and literature; automatically disseminate results to the widest range of users; and work together in real time. This electronic \"co-laboratory\" is designed to maximize the efficiency and productivity of the limited number of specialists on this group. Support for postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and undergraduate students will provide young scientists with training and experience in biodiversity science and informatics at the international level. \r\n",
