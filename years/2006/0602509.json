 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Loewner differential equation was introduced in 1923 to study \r\nextremal problems for conformal maps in the unit disc. Schramm's \r\nrecent discovery of the stochastic Loewner evolution SLE, the \r\nLoewner equation driven by one-dimensional Brownian motion, has \r\nopened up a new area of investigations involving conformal mappings, \r\nprobability theory and mathematical physics. It has led to the \r\ndiscovery of new results in percolation and random walks, for \r\nexample, as well as the discovery mathematical proofs of results \r\nknown to the theoretical physics community. The Loewner equation is \r\nalso related to an algorithm for numerical conformal mapping \r\ndiscovered by Marshall and K\\\"uhnau. The Loewner equation has as \r\ninput an arbitrary continuous function and produces a continuous \r\nfamily of conformal mappings. Marshall plans to investigate \r\nproperties of the solutions of Loewner's equation under various \r\nassumptions on the smoothness of the driving function, and \r\nconversely to investigate how smoothness of the boundaries of the \r\nassociated regions implies smoothness of the driving function. This \r\nis a classical problem where progress has been made only recently. \r\nMarshall will analyze convergence and error-estimates for the \r\nnumerical mapping method called ``zipper'', closely related to \r\nLoewner's equation, and improve the speed of convergence using \r\n``generational'' techniques.\r\n\r\nThe main theme of Marshall's research program is to study conformal \r\nmappings generated by the Loewner differential equation, and related \r\ntopics. Conformal mappings have been used as a tool in science and \r\nengineering for many years. They are often used to change \r\ncoordinates from a complicated region to a simpler region like a \r\ndisc. Physical processes are modeled by partial differential \r\nequations. A partial differential equation on the complicated two \r\ndimensional region can be changed by a conformal map to a similar \r\nequation on the disc, a setting where it is easier to solve. \r\nClassically, this method was used for problems related to Laplace's \r\nequation, such as electrostatics and two dimensional fluid flow. \r\nNumerous non-classical applications have been developed in the last \r\nthree decades such as electro-magnetics, vibrating membranes and \r\nacoustics, transverse vibrations and buckling of plates, elasticity, \r\nand heat transfer. Fundamental research in conformal mapping and \r\nconformal field theory are important directions in mathematics and \r\nphysics respectively. The fusion of Loewner's differential equation \r\nand probability forms a bridge between these two areas. This project \r\nis likely to increase the understanding of solutions to Loewner's \r\nequation, as foundational work, which should increase its usefulness \r\nin understanding stochastic processes. Broader impacts include the \r\ncontinued improvement and dissemination of the conformal mapping \r\ncomputer codes, which have been used by a number of investigators \r\nnot in mathematics, as well as mathematicians. Greater speed and new \r\nknowledge of convergence should lead to wider applicability and use \r\nof this algorithm. Broader impacts also include helping to cement a \r\nstronger relationship between modern complex analysis and \r\nmathematical physics, which should benefit both.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
