 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI), jointly supported by the NSF and Department of Energy (DOE), will take place in Porto Alegre, Brazil in June 2007, on the topic of predictive process dynamics for manufacturing (PPDM).  Organized by Dr. John R. Howell of the University of Texas at Austin, the institute will involve approximately 35 participants from the United States and Latin America including graduate students and junior and established investigators, and about 10 instructors (internationally recognized scientists, active in the field).   The activities will consist of a combination of tutorial lectures, advanced-topic presentations, round table discussions, and student workshops, with the goal of providing the participants with an up-to-date review the state of the art in manufacturing process control theory.  The subject matter is of emerging importance to engineering and industry, and has the potential to revolutionize how products are designed, manufactured, and accepted for their intended end use.   \r\n\r\nThe wide range of applications and materials will impart a significant interdisciplinary nature to the PASI, and should foster the cross-fertilization of new ideas to advance the field and, ultimately, increase relations between Latin American junior and senior investigators and their counterparts in the U.S.  \r\n\r\n",
