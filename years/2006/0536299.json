 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Mechanical (56)\r\n\r\nThis CCLI Phase 1, Exploratory Project is developing a web-based thermodynamic engineering scenario that can be used in thermodynamics courses.  Project staff are basing the scenario on an actual engineering facility and are expanding the case study concept through skills-based problems and actual solutions written in the context of the real-world environment. The scenario is not being linked to a particular topic or textbook chapter but is including problems spanning multiple concepts, thereby creating greater cohesion across the curriculum. Supplementary and background information is promoting increased inquiry-based learning and overall student engagement. The scenario is being used in two courses as part of an assessment plan using quantitative (pre- and post-test evaluation, ABET outcome surveys) and qualitative (focus groups, survey groups, classroom observation) techniques under the direction of an assessment supervisor and with input from an outside consultant, engineering faculty, and industry representatives. The scenario is being formatted in a web-based textbook supplement that is easily adapted at other schools. Further dissemination includes a website, publications, national conferences, and local conferences. This project is increasing student engagement and inquiry-based learning, exposure to actual design methods, and greater integration of course topics. \r\n\r\n",
