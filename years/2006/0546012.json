Characterization of the molecular probe and the microfluidic systems are proposed followed by a demonstration of the integrated system using a gene expression model. The education goals include BioMEMS course development, introducing a seminar series on Bio/Nano topics, undergraduate mentoring and an outreach component focused on involving high school students.\r\n",
