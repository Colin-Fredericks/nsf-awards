 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nFrom August 31 to September 6, 2006 there will be a one-week Summer\r\nSchool and Research Conference on ``K-theory and Noncommutative\r\nGeometry'' in Valladolid, Spain.  The field of algebraic K-theory is\r\nrapidly changing, thanks to the recent developments relating it to\r\nmotivic cohomology, etale cohomology, C*-algebras, derived categories\r\nand cyclic homology.  The field of noncommutative geometry is also\r\nrapidly changing with cyclic homology, C^*-algebras and derived\r\ncategory techniques playing a leading role.  The two subjects have\r\nconsiderable overlap, as this list shows.  Bringing together\r\ninternational experts in these related fields should result in the\r\ndiscovery of new connections between these branches of mathematics.\r\n\r\nThis conference is part of an on-going attempt to link up several different\r\nareas of mathematics undergoing rapid development: algebra, especially its\r\nconnections to algebraic geometry via K-theory; functional analysis,\r\nespecially operators on objects of geometric interest; and geometry,\r\nespecially those non-commuting aspects measured by cyclic homology.\r\nThe research conference portion will expose them to the forefront\r\ndevelopments in the subject, and the opportunity for researchers to\r\ninteract will advance discovery and enhance partnerships.",
