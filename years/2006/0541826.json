 "awd_abstract_narration": "EAR-0541826\r\nRICHTER\r\n\r\nLong-term measurements of weather, floods, water quality, human health, wildlife populations, earthquakes, and air pollution are highly valued. Regrettably, there are no analogous networks of observations of the earth's soil. The Earth's soil is today changing rapidly, driven largely by human impact, and remarkably little is understood about its rate and processes of change. A network of soil observation sites could inform scientists and the public alike, not only about soil, but also about how soil affects the quality of the atmosphere, water resources, and ecosystems themselves. The intent of this project is to establish an RCN among scientists, students, and teachers, who have experience with the two main scientific approaches to estimating soil change: long-term soil experiments (LTSEs) and chronosequence studies.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual goal is to synthesize and critically evaluate the science of soil change, and to promote new research across sites currently used for LTSEs and chronosequence studies.\r\n\r\nThe goal for broader impact is to stimulate scientific community development (both in terms of scientific discipline and in diversity of individuals), as well as much greater interest in the study and appreciation for the changing soil of planet Earth.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish these goals, two active projects will be combined which for several years have been operating in parallel: the Long-Term Soil Experiment Networking Project and the Weathering Systems Sciences Consortium (WSSC). This proposed RCN will be called the Global Soil Change Community, and it will build upon much of the work of LTSE Project and WSSC by promoting greater use of long-term soil experiments and chronosequence studies throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThese goals will be accomplished with annual workshops and papers, but especially through a competitive program for undergraduate and graduate students and post-docs, as well as for teachers. Drupal.org, a website content management system (CMS), will help us unite all these groups and others (including the general public and under-represented groups as well) with a community website that is remarkably open to all. By the end of the project, a CMS should include not only website-driven inventories of LTSEs and chronosequence studies but data bases of soil property and process data that can be used to run models.\r\n\r\nThese collaborations will significantly advance the interaction among soil-change research sites and significantly enhance understanding of the rate and processes of soil biogeochemical change.\r\n\r\n",
