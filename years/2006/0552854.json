St. Omer\r\n\r\nThis REU award for a 3 year Site will provide research experiences for 12 undergraduate students in electrical and computer engineering, including (but not limited to) varied projects in SiC nanostructures, digital halftoning, surface plasmon resonance sensors, parallel supercomputing, and computational electromagnetics.  The program objectives are as follows: (1) provide underrepresented students and students from institutions with limited research opportunities a research experience that will increase their confidence and ability to contribute to the body of engineering knowledge; (2) improve student understanding of the nature of research practice and scientific reasoning; (3) provide students with a collegial partnership experience with faculty, peers, and research staff; (4) increase student appreciation of the importance of coursework to the understanding of engineering research; (5) improve oral and written comprehension and communication of technical knowledge; (6) expose students to research instrumentation, measurement techniques, documentation, and laboratory management; and (7) encourage greater interest in graduate school and research careers. \r\n\r\nThis REU Site program provides not only stimulating research opportunities, but it also offers a variety of professional development workshops, weekly seminars, field trips to local industry, and social events. The 8-week summer experience will culminate in a Departmental Research Symposium where students will present their work in written and oral form. Also, two students from each summer cohort will be awarded travel grants to allow presentation of their work in conjunction with their research mentor at an appropriate conference.\r\n\r\nRecruitment efforts will target women, underrepresented minorities, and students from academic institutions with limited opportunities for research. The involvement of these students in exciting research enhances the likelihood that they will consider post-graduate study.\r\n",
