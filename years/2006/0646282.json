 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a travel grant to support US researchers' participation of a majot world conference in smart materials, structures and systems.\r\n\r\nThe World Forum on Smart Materials and Smart Structures Technology (SMSST'07) will be held in Chongqing and Nanjing, China from May 22-27, 2007. Chongqing University (CQU), Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA), and Hong Kong Polytechnic University will jointly host the forum. SMSSTT'07 provides a premier opportunity for scientific, professional, and industrial colleagues worldwide to share ideas on the most recent and advanced developments, identify common research problems, and promote international cooperative research in the emerging technologies of smart materials and structures. The objectives of SMSST'07 are to: (a) update the state-of-the-art with new knowledge gains, (b) review technological innovations and achievements, (c) assess the potential impact for transforming Engineering Practices, (d) promote international engagement through cooperative platforms (US-Europe, US-China, US-Japan), (e) form partnerships with industry, and (f) broaden the outlook for revolutionizing student and education programs. It is also intended to involve young U.S. scientists to expose them to different social, technical, and cultural perspectives in China through active participation in this world forum. SMSST'07 is a major worldwide event that will highlight the major advancements in sensors and smart structures, mechatronics technology, and protecting critical infrastructure against natural and man-made threats. It will also allow the world's top experts to map out future challenges in research and innovation, as well as review, critique, and finalize the reports submitted by the US-Europe, US-China, and US-Japan joint task groups. The details of the workshop activities and program schedule are provided in body of the proposal.\r\n \r\nSMSST'07 is designed to have a broad impact in the areas of integrated sensor systems, mechatronics, and smart materials and smart structure technologies for aerospace, civil and mechanical systems through international collaborations both in terms of research and education. The workshop will invite, and make every effort to include, the participation of young and underrepresented groups of researchers to enhance the diversity of representation and their involvement in scientific activities. SMSST'07 will also promote the international collaboration to leverage resources, and share technical data and research ideas for the mutual benefit of the United States and European and Asian countries. \r\n",
