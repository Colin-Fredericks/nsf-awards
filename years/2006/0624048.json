 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will support a workshop to develop a roadmap for creating regional and national language archives and the tools to achieve these aims. The Digital Tools Summit for Linguistics, http://www.ku.edu/pri/DTSL/ is a workshop on digital tools and cyberinfrastructure development in linguistics, to bring together trusted repositories such as national libraries as well as major corpus research institutions, language software engineers, computational linguists, and linguists. The workshop, to be held June 22-23, 2006, at Michigan State University, aims to facilitate new interdisciplinary collaboration to design and create digital tools specifically for linguistic analysis. During the workshop, participants will prioritize and design tools and data structures within working groups (e.g. in data annotation, migration, visualization, and resource interoperation) and will prepare design sketches of and implementation plans for at least one tool. A special goal of the workshop is to address the needs of non-technologically-oriented language researchers, simulating the development of truly useful, stable, cross-platform open-source tools. The participation of Indigenous/First Nations language workers and graduate students is particularly encouraged and will be subsidized through this funding from the NSF programs in Linguistics and in Human Language & Communication.",
