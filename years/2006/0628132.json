 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year, $2,749,731 project will build on the past work of the Algebra Project to develop materials for teaching, according to constructivist principles of learning, algebra and geometry at the high school level.  The modules in algebra will focus on the following topics:  Road Coloring - functions (discrete); Trip Line - integers and their properties; Relay Races - linear equations; Winding Games - modular arithmetic; Mechanisms -  functions (continuous); Flagway Game - polynomials; and Random Walk - probability and statistics. To augment underserved students' pursuit of life pathways that require mathematics (algebra) knowledge, the project focuses on creating learning experiences that begin with realistic situations relevant to students' life.  Reflection on those experiences is then promoted via pictorial representation/modeling of the events, conversing about them using intuitive language (\"People Talk\"), discussing them using structured language (\"Feature Talk\"), and learning/using symbolic representations of the underlying mathematical structures (including calculators/computers).  The materials to be developed will be aligned with state and national standards, will require double periods of daily mathematics instruction for four years, and include research-based teacher support programs (20 workshop days focusing also on the social-emotional domains) and community development activities.  Besides externally conducted formative and summative evaluation of the project, a research component is set out to examine how students develop the concept of function within such environments.  Accordingly, the project material development teams, consisting of mathematicians, mathematics educators, curriculum writers, school and community leaders, will collaborate with a publisher to assure timely, wide dissemination.",
