Initially distributing the scholarship funds across all academic levels, the project is maintaining a cohort of undergraduate students from the freshman through senior academic standing.  In addition to scholarship support, the project is providing a network of advising, mentoring and other academic support from an extensive student support network that been developed over the past 10 years.  The project is engaging a significant number of economically disadvantaged and underserved minority undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThe long term goal for this project is increasing the degree production in STEM majors, assisting the Long Island Region meet a critical need for high technology and engineering employees.  The program is also incorporating an internship program as well as industrial mentoring through a network of university alumni employed in high tech companies.",
