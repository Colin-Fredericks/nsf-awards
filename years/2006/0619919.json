 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nThe University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (UCCS) will develop a time-resolved magneto-optical and second harmonic generation (SHG) magnetometer using a 15-fs pulse laser system. The main advantages of the instrument are: availability to identify the excited spin waves due to the different surface sensitivity of both techniques (surface versus bulk spin waves); flexibility to access a wide frequency range using the same setup (from \"quasistatic\" to terahertz); time precision limited by the width of the femtosecond pulses; and ability to obtain vector resolved magnetization response. The system will be used to investigate spin dynamics with applications in nanotechnology, particularly spin wave propagation and damping. The specific research projects will be: spin waves focusing, propagation of thermally excited spin waves, influence of the local behavior on the overall magnetization damping, and SHG response from liquid crystals. Educational outreach will include the participation of undergraduate students in the development of the instrument, where they will receive training in experimental techniques with cutting edge technology (high-frequency applications, ultrafast laser techniques, etc.). The instrument will also be used as a part of the Optical and Solid State Labs. UCCS will offer a modified class using this instrument to science and engineering majors, providing them with the training necessary for their future careers in the local nanotechnology and biomedical industries. The instrument will also support interdisciplinary undergraduate research (physics, materials research, biology, and chemistry). \r\n\r\nLay Abstract\r\n\r\nThe development of new and improved electronic devices for such applications as communication and computers requires an understanding of fundamental material processes that often occur in ultra-short (femtosecond) time frames (in order to visualize one femtosecond, light travels from the Earth to the Moon in about 1.3 seconds; in one femtosecond, light travels a distance less than the thickness of a human hair). The magnetic behavior of materials is especially important in all of these applications. The University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (UCCS) will develop an instrument to measure magnetic properties that will provide a unique set of techniques to greatly enhance our research in the field of ultrafast phenomena with applications in nanotechnology. This development project will also include educational outreach. Undergraduate students will participate in the development of the instrument and receive training in experimental techniques with cutting edge technology (high-frequency applications, ultrafast laser techniques, etc.). The instrument will be used as a part of the advanced laboratory classes offered to physics majors. UCCS will also offer a modified class using this instrument for science and engineering majors, providing them with the training necessary for their future careers in the local nanotechnology and biomedical industries. The research activities using this instrument will include programs leading to, for example: development of faster and smaller nano-electronic devices used in communications, development of better materials for computer memories, and investigation of liquid crystals for displays (LCD's). \r\n",
