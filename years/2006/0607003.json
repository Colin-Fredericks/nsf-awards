This year it will be held in San Francisco, CA on June 11-16.\r\n\r\n Intellectual Merit:\r\nThe IMS is the major international forum in the microwave research and wireless communications. Each year, students present their work not only to a technical audience but also to a group of technical judges while developing their communications and presentation skills and interacting with experts in the field. \r\n\r\n Broader Impact:\r\nBy promoting this activity, IMS promotes not only education in microwave theory and techniques by building an integrated program inside a major conference but fosters the next generation of microwave engineers.\r\n\r\nSupport of this activity is recommended at the level of $5,000.\r\n",
