 "awd_abstract_narration": "The World Wide Web Instructional Committee at North Dakota State University is expanding its existing set of animation-based modules, the Virtual Cell (V Cell) animations available at (http://vcell.ndsu.edu/animations), to include 27 animation-based modules that depict major molecular and cellular biology processes.  In addition they are implementing a dissemination system that ensures rapid load time for the large-sized animations files and using the animations as research tools to determine the aspects of animations that best support learning.  Seven institutions are helping test these modules by using them in their science courses: North Dakota State University, East Carolina University, Marquette University, Onondaga Community College, University of Colorado, Denver, University of Washington, and Utah Valley State College. These institutions are serving as tests sites to measure the impact of these animation modules on student learning. The studies are specifically focusing on the effectiveness of animation in learning biological processes. The major product developing from this project is an on-line dissemination site that is rich with high quality graphical materials that supports student learning of molecular and cellular biology processes. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project resides in its efforts to improve student learning of complex processes, a major theme in science education. The project is addressing questions relating to the role of animation in supporting learning.  Also being researched are the best technologies to deliver complete suites of modern educational modules in a seamless manner to both instructors and students. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project resides in the development of world-class animation-based modules that support the learning of molecular and cellular processes. The modules have the potential to change the manner in which these processes are taught. The project is also testing the utility of WWW-based and peer-to-peer delivery of educational materials.\r\n",
