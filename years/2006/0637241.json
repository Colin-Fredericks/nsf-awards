 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 6th International \"Hiroshima\" Symposium on the Development and Application of Semiconductor Tracking Detectors and will be hosted by the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP).   As indicated by the name, this is the sixth symposium in this series, with all prior venues in countries on the Pacific Rim.  The intellectual merit of this proposal is in bringing together experts in the design, processing and applications of semiconductor tracking detectors for discussions of past experiences, lessons learned and new ideas which are still in the early stage of development. Sessions will include Simulations and Manufacturing, Pixel Technology, Strip Technology, New Materials and Electronics, and Applications to Particle Physics, Space Physics, and Biological and Medical Sciences and allied fields.  The broader impact of this proposal will be in the design and development of future semiconductors and their application to tracking detectors many of which are used in medical imaging as well as particle physics experiments.",
