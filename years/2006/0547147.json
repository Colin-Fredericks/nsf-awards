Progress in this area could accelerate the pace of improvements necessary for implementing large-scale quantum computers and advance fundamental understanding of quantum mechanics at large scales. The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development project at Syracuse University is to probe the quantum coherent properties of vortices that are guided through nanofabricated superconducting structures with feature sizes down to 100 nm. The research project will make extensive use of the nearby, NSF-funded Cornell Nanoscale Facility. Experiments will be developed to measure the quantum interference of a vortex that is permitted to follow two different paths and detect the tunneling of a single vortex by coupling the vortex to another quantum coherent superconducting device. Quantum coherent circuits are currently outside the realm of the standard undergraduate curriculum and are unfamiliar topics to the general public. Therefore, a new course on applied topics in quantum mechanics will be developed for the undergraduate physics program which will treat important modern topics, including the emerging field of quantum information. New experimental projects involving investigations of quantum coherence will be built for the upper-level undergraduate lab courses.
