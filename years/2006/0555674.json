 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research at the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology includes both experimental research and theoretical research addressing key issues in nuclear physics and related areas of particle physics and high-energy astrophysics. Research topics include neutrino oscillation studies, ultra-cold neutron research, and ultra-high energy cosmic ray studies. Participation by postdoctoral scholars, graduate students and undergraduate students is integrated throughout the program, affording young researchers exceptional opportunities to advance their training and education in these frontier areas of nuclear physics and astrophysics .\r\nNeutrino oscillations will be addressed by a new experimental project to study the remaining unknown mixing angle q13 by measuring the disappearance of antineutrinos from a nuclear power plant. During this grant period this new project should begin construction.\r\nWe will also embark on a new experimental program utilizing novel techniques to produce and study ultra-cold neutrons. These neutrons are converted to very cold temperatures where they can be trapped for long periods of time, enabling very precise measurements of their properties. The first experiment will study the violation of mirror symmetry in the decay of ultra-cold neutrons. We will also perform research and development towards a new experiment to determine the electric dipole moment of the neutron, which should begin construction during this grant period.\r\nTheoretical studies related to these experimental efforts are also part of this program.\r\nWe will continue to maintain operation of the California HIgh school Cosmic ray ObServatory (CHICOS) as a facility to obtain a sample of ultra-high energy cosmic rays and as an outreach program for K-12 teachers and students in the Los Angeles area.\r\n",
