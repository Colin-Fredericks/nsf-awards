 "awd_abstract_narration": "The gene network: This project focuses on a gene network that regulates plant responses to\r\ncytokinin, a key hormonal regulator of plant growth and development. The initial steps in\r\ncytokinin signaling are mediated by a 'two-component' system that transmits information from\r\nmembrane to nucleus. The two-component system makes use of histidine kinases that act as\r\ncytokinin receptors, histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins that transduce the initial\r\nsignal, and response regulators that regulate the signal output. The transcriptional targets of this\r\npathway as well as other outputs have yet to be determined. This project will delineate the\r\nnetwork of genes and proteins regulated by two-component signaling elements of Arabidopsis.\r\nThis two-component signaling network includes the transcription factors that control gene\r\nexpression as well as interacting proteins that regulate other aspects of signal output.\r\nProject URL: http://www.bio.unc.edu/research/two-component/default.htm\r\nFunctional characterization: Transcription factors will be characterized in terms of the genes that\r\nthey regulate. Proteins will be characterized in terms of their protein-protein interactions within\r\nthe signaling network. The physiological function of the network elements will be defined in\r\nterms of their role in regulating cytokinin responses as well as seed size, meristem function,\r\nvascular development, leaf and cotyledon morphology, metal ion homeostasis, and circadian\r\nrhythms.\r\nSharing of results: Genomic information and tools generated will be made available to the\r\nresearch community through the web and through standard methods of publication in a timely\r\nfashion. Datasets of general interest, that are not made available through publication, will be\r\ndeposited on the project web site within two years of their generation.\r\nSignificance of work: These studies will define the circuitry by which the two-component gene\r\nnetwork acts to alter plant growth and development. In addition, these studies will reveal\r\nconnections between this pathway and other cellular networks. Determining how this integration\r\nis achieved will contribute to an understanding of signaling networks in plants and will serve as a\r\nmodel for examining other interactions within the plant cell. The techniques and tools developed\r\nduring the course of these studies will assist gene studies in Arabidopsis and in other plant\r\nspecies.\r\nBroader impact: Results from the project will benefit society through the understanding of a\r\ncritical gene network that regulates multiple traits of agronomic importance. Elucidation of these\r\nroles will provide avenues to modify such agriculturally relevant traits such as senescence, plant\r\ntransformation, grain yield and filling, and patterns of growth and development. The plant\r\nresearch community will benefit by the optimization of novel research techniques and the\r\ndevelopment of new community resources. The proposed research will enhance the\r\ninfrastructure of research and education by providing hands-on training for undergraduate\r\nstudents, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers within the PIs' labs. In addition, the\r\nPIs will partner will local groups to assist in the creation and maintenance of programs aimed at\r\nfostering science education in grades K-12.",
