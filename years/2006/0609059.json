 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Nanoscale Exploratory Research (NER) project is to explore three directions for nanoparticle-coated CNTs based on recent success in controlled assembly of nanoparticles onto CNTs: (1) to manufacture ultra-thin nanoparticle line features; (2) to grow hierarchical 3-D hybrid architectures of nanotubes, nanowires, and nanoparticles; (3) to fabricate an ultrasensitive hydrogen sensor.  The ultra-thin nanoparticle lines, if achieved, will significantly advance the fabrication of nanoparticle-based devices and the technique to manufacture nanoparticle lines may serve as a useful tool for nanomanufacturing.  Nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as individual components have been demonstrated to have interesting applications because of their unique properties.  There has been less effort on combining the unique properties of nanoparticles with those of nanotubes for new applications.  \r\n\r\nThe 3-D hybrid architecture of nanostructures could play a role in the next-generation nanodevices and nanosystems expected to have increased complexity.  If achieved, the hydrogen sensor will be able to rapidly detect trace amounts of hydrogen and the new sensor fabrication concept and sensing mechanism may lead to gas sensors and biosensors capable even of single molecule detection.  This NER project will train graduate students in different disciplines, and if possible will involve undergraduate and high school students by leveraging such existing programs at both UWM and NU as REU, SROP, and UHRP.  Outreach to K-12 students, teachers, and the general public will be through Science Saturday, and separately through a science fair in collaboration with the Wisconsin Career Academy.  In addition, there will be K-12 outreach through modular education materials being created by the NCLT at NU.",
