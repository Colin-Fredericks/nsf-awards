 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emotions pervade human experience. Most work on affect concerns negative feelings such as depression and anxiety. Less is known about positive feelings. The studies proposed here examine some effects of positive affect, as suggested by the theory and research of Carver and Scheier (1998). This theory holds that positive emotion is an internal signal that the person is moving toward a desired goal at a rate higher than necessary. This view leads to 3 sets of predictions. \r\n\r\nFirst, this theory holds that positive affect that comes from doing well at some activity should cause a tendency to \"coast\" with respect to that activity, because it implies that progress is better than needed. This should be reflected in reducing effort toward that activity.  Secondly, this theory suggests that positive affect may also facilitate goal shifts. If positive affect is a signal that the person is devoting more effort to the now-focal goal than needed, it would set the stage for another goal to become focal.  Recent research suggests that positive feelings broaden attention (in contrast to the narrowing of attention by negative feelings). This would permit a more informed choice of what goal (if any) to shift to.   Finally this broadening of attention should make people more aware of unexpected opportunities that have arisen. \r\n\r\nThe results from this project will inform future conceptions of the relation between normal experiences of positive emotions and the extreme experiences that occur in mania. Coming to a better understanding of mania would have substantial societal impact.  Furthermore, this work will contribute to the training of graduate and undergraduate students in the experimental techniques relevant to this line of investigation and in the extended body of ideas that underlie the research.\r\n",
