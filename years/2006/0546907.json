As these applications become increasingly sophisticated and more frequently portable, their performance and power dissipation requirements often exceed the capabilities of modern DSP processors. The\r\ngoal of this research is to develop novel architectures, circuits, and software for high performance and low power DSP processors that meet the demands of emerging and future DSP applications, and that are also well-suited to future semiconductor fabrication processes. Research results are introduced into both undergraduate and graduate level courses and other investigators are involved in collaborative efforts. Results of this research are expected to enable new embedded, medical, environmental, and consumer applications.\r\nTo achieve project goals, the investigators develop DSP systems with features that are new on several levels. First, easily-scalable programmable building block processors with high performance and high energy efficiency are developed using innovative architectures, granularity, clocking, interconnection, and circuits. Second, efficient architectures are developed for shared blocks such as large memory arrays and specialpurpose DSP processors, as well as methods for effectively integrating these blocks into the programmable DSP array. Third, software tools including a compiler and automatic mapping tools are developed to more easily program the system. Fourth, to demonstrate gains in performance and energy efficiency, the system is implemented in silicon, tested, and characterized.",

This second thrust developed such memories and also developed a number of special-purpose accelerators.\n\nA 167-processor computational platform was designed and fabricated as the third thrust of this project.  It consists of an array of simple programmable processors capable of per-processor dynamic supply voltage and clock frequency scaling, three algorithm-specific processors, and three 16 KB shared memories; and is implemented in 65 nm CMOS.  All processors and shared memories are clocked by local fully independent, dynamically haltable, digitally-programmable oscillators and are interconnected by a configurable circuit-switched network which supports long-distance communication.
