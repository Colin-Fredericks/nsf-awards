The workshop is designed to exchange ideas on current research in the field and compare the merits of educational policies that encourage young students to enter science and engineering careers in each country.  The U.S. PI is Professor Chester Van Tyne of the Colorado School of Mines and the lead organizer in Korea is Professor Kwang Sun Kim, Dean of the Graduate School, Korea University of Technology and Education.  The workshop has secured co-funding from the Korean Science and Engineering Foundation.  \r\n\r\nThe United States and South Korea face very similar challenges, as do many countries, in attracting bright students into science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers.  The workshop will compare best practices research in each cultural context and bring together experts from each country to identify new and diverse approaches to attracting gifted and talented young people to STEM careers.  The workshop will catalyze research on this topic among a new generation of scholars and inform policy for securing an adequate future supply of scientists and engineers. \r\n",
