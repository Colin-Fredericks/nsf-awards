 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social networks can be represented as time-evolving graphs where the nodes are the members/entities of the social network and the edges represent connections/relationships between the nodes. This project tries to answer questions such as: How does a \"normal\" social network look like? How will it evolve over time? How can we spot \"abnormal\" interactions (e.g., spam), in a time-evolving e-mail graph? The approach developed in this project is to look for time-evolution \"laws\", and to design fast, scalable data mining tools  for real graphs with millions and billions of nodes.  The approach consist of two efforts: (1) discovery of patterns that hold when graphs evolve over time and (2) tools to analyze, visualize and mine such graphs to discover anomalies.  The resulting tools will have a broad applicability. They will be vital for mining and outlier detection in numerous settings, such as money-laundering rings, mis-configured routers on the Internet, suspicious user accesses to database records, surprising protein-protein interactions in a gene regulatory network, and many applications involving large-scale evolving social networks. The project Web site (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~christos/PROJECTS/GRAPH-MINING/) provides additional information and will be used for results dissemination.\r\n",
