 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal, the principal investigator (PI) plans to study the\r\nsecond part of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for modular\r\nabelian varieties (including elliptic curves). This conjecture gives a\r\nformula that relates certain invariants attached to the abelian variety,\r\nincluding the orders of the Shafarevich-Tate group, the torsion subgroup,\r\nand the component groups. To start with, the PI will study the possible\r\ncancellations between the orders of the torsion and component groups in\r\nthe formula, by extending work of Mazur and Emerton. The PI also plans to\r\nuse the notion of visibility to show that the conjectural order of the\r\nShafarevich-Tate group divides the actual order (in certain cases),\r\nassuming the first part of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.  In\r\nthe course of the work, the PI hopes to prove results that should be of\r\ninterest independent of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture,\r\nincluding generalizations of several parts of Mazur's seminal paper\r\n\"Modular curves and the Eisenstein ideal\" to non-prime level.\r\n\r\nThis proposal falls in the area of arithmetic geometry, which concerns the\r\napplication of algebraic geometry to number theory.  Number theory is one\r\nof the most ancient branches of mathematics, and deals with questions\r\nregarding integers or rational numbers and their properties.\r\nAlgebraic geometry is the study of solutions of polynomial equations using\r\ngeometric techniques. Thus arithmetic geometry can be thought of as\r\nstudying integer or rational number solutions to systems of\r\npolynomials. Elliptic curves are certain polynomial equations whose\r\nsolutions can be added in a certain way, similar to usual addition. The\r\nwork of the PI will enrich our understanding of elliptic curves; for\r\nexample, in finding the number of solutions to the equation defining an\r\nelliptic curve, provided this number is finite.  Elliptic curves are\r\nimportant objects of study in number theory, and have applications both\r\nwithin and outside mathematics. For example, they played an important role\r\nin Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theoerem, and are being applied to\r\ncryptography. In particular, the work of the PI has potential long-term\r\napplications to real-life problems.\r\n",
