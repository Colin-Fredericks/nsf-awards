 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to observationally study the role of magnetic reconnection in large-scale solar eruptions and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). To this end, extensive data analysis will be conducted on observations of CMEs and activity on the Sun's surface, such as solar flares and filaments, obtained by both ground-based facilities, such as the Global Ha Network at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), and satellite missions, such as LASCO, TRACE, RHESSI, and the EIT and MDI instruments on-board SoHO. Using observations at Ha, UV, and EUV wavelengths, the proposers will measure the apparent motion of flare patches in the lower solar atmosphere and the magnetic fields that the patches sweep through, to evaluate the rate of magnetic reconnection in the corona. The dynamic evolution of mass ejections will be measured using CME observations, as well as optical and EUV observations, of eruptive filaments and coronal structures. The time profiles of mass acceleration at the early stage of mass ejection will be compared with the inferred magnetic reconnection rate to observationally examine the temporal correlation and magnitude scaling relationship between reconnection and acceleration. Solar eruptive events of different magnetic configurations, specifically the inverse and normal configurations of the erupting magnetic structure, will be analyzed to test whether the reconnection-acceleration relationship holds for different magnetic configurations. Physical parameters relevant to magnetic reconnection and magnetic environment, such as the magnitude, duration, and height of magnetic reconnection, mass and magnetic flux transferred by magnetic reconnection, and magnetic energy released through magnetic reconnection, will be measured from observations to study the impact of magnetic reconnection on the dynamical evolution and energetics of large-scale eruptions.",
