 "awd_abstract_narration": "SUMMARY. Funds are requested from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for\r\nattendee / speaker support for the title symposium. The ACS Division of Polymer\r\nChemistry has established a unique and diverse team of organizers from industry,\r\nacademia, and government focused on the important topic of entrepreneurship in polymer\r\nscience and technology. Polymer science and technology is an important component of\r\nmaterials research which overlaps with many current NSF initiatives. The global\r\ncompetitive demands on polymer chemists today require that they be well trained in\r\nscience and that they behave more like entrepreneurs to feed an insatiable technologically\r\ninnovative economy. An entrepreneur transforms creative ideas into successes and many\r\nof the entrepreneurial success are directly related to NSF programs. This symposium will\r\nfocus on breakthrough inventions enabled by experimentation on novel, emerging, and\r\npioneering technologies oriented toward materials research. Closer collaboration\r\nbetween industry, academia and government should increase the number, speed and\r\nimpact of success stories and place prominent emphasis on the necessity of\r\nentrepreneurship.\r\nThe symposium will cover basic research leading to new technology development and\r\ncommercialization. Entrepreneurial activities ranging from identifying a need, to basic\r\nresearch, to developing novel and useful technology, to protecting the invention, to\r\nobtaining funding, to becoming a self-sustaining business will be reviewed. Our objective\r\nis to provide current, practical information that is based on scientific breakthroughs\r\nleading to real world experiences. The symposium will begin with a tutorial on\r\nentrepreneurship. Discussions will focus on fundamental polymer and related science,\r\nchallenges and opportunities for scientists and engineers in the market to facilitate an\r\nunderstanding of entrepreneurship. Scientists, engineers and technologists interested in\r\nthe latest developments and advances in this diverse and growing area are invited to\r\ncontribute oral and poster presentations.",
