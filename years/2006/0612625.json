 "awd_abstract_narration": "Regularization methods are numerical techniques based on exact \r\nsolutions of partial differential equations that are derived in the same \r\nway as fundamental solutions when the Dirac delta is replaced by a \r\nsmooth approximation, such as a Gaussian.  The vortex blob method is \r\nan example.  The resulting solutions of the PDEs are bounded approximations \r\nto the fundamental solutions.  This project advances the theory, the \r\ncomputational implementation and the application of these methods \r\nto problems of Stokes flows. Regularized high-order elements, such as \r\ndoublets and quadrupoles, are systematically derived, the required \r\nproperties of blobs are proposed and families of blobs with such properties \r\nare developed. The regularized fluid velocity expression forms the basis \r\nof new numerical methods, whose convergence and efficiency properties are \r\nanalyzed. Performance-based guidelines for choosing the numerical parameters \r\nare provided.  Finally, several applications of the methods include the \r\ndynamics of microorganism populations and the large-scale flow patterns they \r\ngenerate, the motion of cilia as they beat to generate an organized net flow, \r\nflows across permeable walls, and more. \r\n\r\nThe investigator develops mathematical tools necessary to design new reliable \r\nways to generate computer simulations of biological phenomena involving \r\nmicroorganisms in a liquid environment.  These include the motion of bacteria \r\nin the human body, the synchronized motion of cilia in the lungs, the transport \r\nand filtration of chemicals transported by blood, and other biologically \r\nimportant situations.  The computer simulation of these phenomena complement \r\nexperimental studies done in medical laboratories and are extremely useful, \r\nparticularly for understanding the behavior of the human body under circumstances \r\nthat cannot be tested in vivo. Often, computer simulations can detect responses \r\nthat occur when parameters are outside the range typically used in the laboratory, \r\nand thus point to new experiments that should be pursued.  The methods developed \r\nin this work increase our understanding of how E. coli may move around the body \r\nor how defects in the lung cilia can translate into decreased functionality and \r\npossibly disease. \r\n  \r\n\r\n",
