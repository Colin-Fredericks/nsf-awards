The center is serving as a focal point for new research projects, faculty development, student recruitment, and curriculum development in geographic information systems (GIS) and other geospatial technologies such as remote sensing and global positioning system (GPS). Inquiry-based, hands-on instruction and opportunities for students to participate in data collection and original geospatial research is being offered through this center as part of an effort to attract and retain talented undergraduate students in mathematics, science, technology, and engineering at NCCU.  Other activities of the GRITS Center include faculty development workshops, seed grants to faculty wanting to integrate GIS modules into their courses and research, support for student research using geospatial strategies, and efforts to encourage university-wide interdisciplinary integration of GIS into the undergraduate curriculum. The GRITS center is also offering outstanding undergraduate and graduate students competitive scholarships and internships.  A GIS certification program at NCCU will be established as a result of this award and co-funding from the HBCU-UP Targeted Infusion Program.\r\n",
