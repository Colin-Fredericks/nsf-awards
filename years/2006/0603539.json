 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports a small workshop to plan collaborative research to develop moist physics parameterizations for the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM).  The workshop (WS) is intended to advance the representation of cloud distribution and microphysics in the CAM by integrating efforts of members of the community with those of NCAR scientists.  The goal is to improve capability to represent important microphysical processes and connections between clouds, chemistry and aerosols in the modeled atmosphere.  The current formulation of cloud distributions and microphysics in the CAM is overly simplistic in representing these processes and interactions.\r\n\r\nThe WS will \"jump start\" the process.  A group of 10 members of the community with expertise in microphysical schemes will be invited to join NCAR scientists.  All Community Climate System Model (CCSM) Atmospheric Model WG members (a self-appointed group) will be invited to attend, but funding will be limited to to the ~10 invited key participants.  \r\n\r\nThe PIs will develop a specific strategy for implementing a plan for the next version of CAM and CCSM, including roles, decisions, which processes and which representations they might use in order to insure that community development proceeds towards a common version of cloud fraction, microphysics and aerosol schemes for the CAM.  The ultimate result of this process will be a new microphysics scheme or several candidate schemes for the next generation of CAM.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts include the benefits to be derived by over one hundred scientists who use the CCSM/CAM, and the potential for improved climate projections, so important to societal issues.",
