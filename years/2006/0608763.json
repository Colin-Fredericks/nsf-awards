 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will use optical pumping (OP) and spin-injection (SI) methods to\r\ngenerate massively athermal nuclear spin polarizations for exploitation in nanostructured\r\nsemiconductor devices. The proposed research aims to develop a fundamental\r\nunderstanding of the electron-nuclear cross relaxation in a host of materials engineered to\r\nexhibit structural features ranging from bulk to mesoscale to quantum dots. In the course\r\nof these studies, new phenomenology in the form of nuclear spin hyperpolarization in\r\nnovel inorganic and polymeric semiconductor structures is anticipated as well as the\r\ndevelopment of new analytical tools for the measurement of nuclear polarization. This\r\nwork will use the newly developed understanding of OP and SI to design new application\r\nexperiments and devices.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed work lies in the assertion that measurement\r\nand observation are of intrinsic and fundamental value in developing an understanding of\r\nthe natural world. A more complete understanding of nuclear hyperpolarization could\r\npotentially overcome limitations in current analytical spectroscopic methods (i.e., NMR,\r\nMRI) by providing the mechanism for greatly enhanced signals as well as assist in the\r\ncreation of spintronics and quantum computing devices.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is expected to have a broad educational outcome because it\r\nwill offer students a unique inter-disciplinary scientific education and exposure to teams\r\nof diverse and complimentary backgrounds. Undergraduate students from both CCNY\r\nand UC Berkeley will be involved in the research and will spend summers visiting the\r\nalternate campus to broaden their scientific horizons. This research will also be used to\r\ninspire freshmen during a pivotal point of their undergraduate education through a series\r\nof seminar discussion courses. Long-distance seminars and group meetings between the\r\nCCNY and UC Berkeley groups will be used to ensure the synergistic nature of the\r\nconsortium.",
