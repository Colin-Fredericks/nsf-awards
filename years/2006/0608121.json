 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gordon Research Conference on High Temperature Materials, Processes, and Diagnostics has been held semi-annually since 1998.  This event successfully brings together scientists and engineers working on both applied and fundamental materials research.  The meeting participants are typically interested in materials with a wide range of applications, including materials for solid oxide fuel cells, nuclear systems, space applications, energy systems, and protective coatings.  Key basic research areas that are important for high temperature materials and processing are thermochemistry, diffusion, interface reactions, materials degradation, computational methods, and nanostructured materials.  The support provided by NSF is used exclusively to support graduate students and other young researchers who wish to attend the meeting, with preference given to women and under-represented minorities.  All recipients of this support are required to present a poster on their research.",
