 "awd_abstract_narration": "SGER: Human-MAV Team Processes for Effective Hurricane Response\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will enable scientists to immediately respond to four hurricanes in 2006 with rotary-wing micro air vehicles (rMAVs), or miniature helicopters carrying cameras. It is expected that the rMAV team will be able to directly contribute to the response effort, as well as conduct research. Miniature backpackable helicopters are transformational to search and rescue, but little is known about how responders can be trained to use them effectively under stressful conditions. Ephemeral data on rMAV and team processes and performance during the actual disaster response will be collected and archived for use by the scientific, especially human-robot interaction, and emergency response communities. The data will be used to validate a model of team processes for effective and safe flying of rMAVs under emergency response conditions generated during our previous work at Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma. This project will also create a quick-time cognitive work analysis field method which will allow team roles and strategies to be identified and modified after each shift. While this quick-time method is unlikely to be optimal, it is expected to foster immediate improvements- which could mean life and death for disaster victims. In addition, the project will have significant broader impacts spanning the emergency response, civil and mechanical, insurance, and robotics communities.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
