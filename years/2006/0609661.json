 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations arise in many\r\napplications where wave propagation or transport phenomena are important.\r\nOften these equations and/or their solutions involve discontinuous\r\nfunctions, giving difficulties for standard finite-difference approaches\r\nto discretizing the differential equations.  In particular, nonlinear wave\r\npropagation problems often give rise to shock waves, discontinuities in\r\nthe solution which can arise spontaneously even from smooth initial data.\r\nThe goal is then to approximate a weak solution to the underlying integral\r\nconservation law.  Often the problem must be solved in a heterogeneous\r\nmedium where the material properties vary with space, often discontinously\r\nat sharp material interfaces.  This results in discontinuous coefficients\r\nor flux functions in the equations to be solved.  This proposal concerns\r\nthe further development of multidimensional high-resolution\r\nfinite volume methods for solving such problems, the development of\r\nsoftware implementing these methods, and the application of these\r\nmethods to particular problems.  The P.I. has previously developed\r\na multidimensional \"wave-propagation algorithm\" that yields a very\r\ngeneral framework for solving such problems, and has implemented this\r\nmethod in the CLAWPACK software.  These algorithms and the software\r\nwill be further developed and brought to bear on a variety of problems.\r\nSome particular applications to be studied include: tsunami propagation\r\nand runup, pyroclastic flows arising from volcanic eruptions, the\r\nsimulation of seismic waves, and elastic wave propagation in heterogeneous\r\nmedia, including shock wave propagation in tissue and bone.\r\n\r\nA wide range of practical problems arising in science and engineering are\r\nmodeled using \"hyperbolic differential equations\" and have a very similar\r\nmathematical structure, allowing researchers in applied and computational\r\nmathematics to make contributions that are widely applicable.  The goal\r\nof this work is to further develop methods and software for approximating\r\nthe solutions to these equations.  These methods are implemented in the\r\nCLAWPACK software package written by the P.I. and co-workers, which\r\nis freely available on the web and allows students and researchers\r\nstudying a wide range of phenomena to use state of the art methods for\r\nthese mathematical problems.  This software has been downloaded by more\r\nthan 5000 registered users over the past several years and applied to\r\nnumerous scientific and engineering problems by the PI, his students, and\r\nother users.  Specific practical problems will also be studied, building on\r\nwork already performed by the P.I. and students.  One project involves\r\nmodeling the effects of tsunamis on coastal regions, both to aid in\r\nscientific studies of past tsunamis and as an aid to hazard mitigation\r\nand preparedness.  Other geophysical projects involve the study of flows\r\narising from volcanic eruptions and the propagation of seismic waves in\r\nthe earth following an earthquake or in oil exploration.  A project with\r\nbiomedical applications is the study of shock waves propagating in tissue\r\nand bone, with potential application to the study of \"shock wave therapy\",\r\nin which ultrasonic shock waves are used to treat a variety of medical\r\nconditions including nonunions (broken bones that fail to heal), plantar\r\nfasciitis, and tendinitis.\r\n",
