 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable researchers to pursue a coordinated and multidisciplinary approach to improving the understanding of the interactions between climate variability and climatic mean state over the past 50,000 years. Specifically, the researchers will compile a global array of existing data, acquire high-resolution records that focus on climate variability across the western Americas and eastern Pacific Ocean, place these data on a common timescale to quantify age uncertainties, use traditional and newly developed time series analysis tools to quantify the nature of climate change and variability in the region, and integrate numerical models and data. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the research team will pursue the following science questions: 1) How does the mean state of the climate system influence climate variability? 2) What is the feedback of climate variability on the long-term mean climate state? 3) Does variability change as a threshold in the climate system is approached? and 4) What is the sensitivity and response of terrestrial and marine systems to changes in mean climate and climate variability?\r\n\r\nThe research strategy allows for assessing the ability of climate models to simulate changes in climatic variability and providing guidance for future experimental designs in terms of direct implications on predictions of future climate variability. Process modeling will help address a myriad of questions relevant to climate science, terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and water resources management. \r\n\r\nThe project will directly support the next generation of paleoclimate scientists by supporting several graduate students and post-doctoral scholars, emphasizing cross-training in data acquisition, data analysis, and modeling, and ensuring that science results are disseminated to the broader public through an interactive website and active public outreach.\r\n\r\nThis study includes a strong element of interagency cooperation between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) thorough the active involvement of USGS researchers with academic colleagues. The USGS commitment of personnel and computing resources will be leveraged with the NSF commitment to the academic researchers and their institutions in a cost-effective partnership to help the project achieve its science goals.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe PALEOVAR project involved collaboration among multiple scientists at several institutions (University of Oregon, Oregon State University and the University of Minnesota).  The overall aim of the project was to understand the climate changes over the past few tens of thousands of years, an interval that includes the cold Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, around 21,000 years ago), the warming \"deglacial\" period that began around 17,000 years ago, and the warm \"interglacial\" period of the past 11,700 years.  The interval from the LGM to present experienced a wide range of climate variations, including some very abrupt changes (similar to those that occurred before the ice sheets reached their greatest extent), and some that were quite gradual (like the overall trend  over the past several thousand years).  The interval studied thus provides a natural laboratory that can be used to test and elaborate our understanding of how climate changes larger than those experienced during the last century \"work\"&mdash;what the controls of the variations were, and how the specific mechanisms that cause climate changes operated.\n\nThe strategy used in the project to gain this understanding had several elements, including 1) the development of sets of paleoclimatic data (from ocean, land and ice cores, and other sources, both new and existing) that document what climate changes took place, 2) the development and application of climate models that can be used to simulate past climates, and 3) synthesis studies, in which the paleoclimate data are compared with the simulations.  Such \"data-model\" comparisons allow us to evaluate the particular mechanisms involved in past climate changes, and also contribute to \"model benchmarking\" studies, aimed at testing the same climate models that are being used to make projections of the future.\n\nWork at the University of Oregon, along with that at other institutions, showed that:\n1) Climate models are able to simulate the broadscale patterns of past climatic variations successfully.  Syntheses of paleoclimatic data and comparisons with climate-model simulations show that there are still some details of past climates that are not well simulated (likely related to processes not currently included in climate models), but overall, climate models are up to the task of simulating climates different from the present day. \n2) The large-scale patterns and trends of climate change and the response of the biosphere (e.g. vegetation and ecosystems) since the Last Glacial Maximum can be explained by relatively simple changes in controls.  The ultimate control is the systematic variation of incoming solar radiation due to changes in Earth\u00c6s orbit (i.e., the \"pacemaker of the Ice Ages\"), changes in the composition of the atmosphere and reductions in the size of the ice sheets that amplify the solar radiation impacts, and changes in ocean circulation that occur in response to freshwater inputs from the melting ice sheets.  An example of a biosphere response is the global variations in biomass burning, the primary controls of which are temperature (which determines overall biomass production) and effective moisture (which determines fuel load and \"fire climate\")  Over time, the rate of biomass burning closely tracks the changing climate. \n3) Large-scale patterns of simulated climate change, such as greater warming (or cooling) at high latitudes as opposed to the tropics, greater warming (or cooling) of the continents relative to the oceans, the pattern of changes in the temperature difference between summer and winter, and long-term changes in the spatial patterns of precipitation are robust, meaning that they are regular features of climate change that occur over and over in simulations of past, historical and future climates.  Similar patterns are also apparent in the paleo and historical data, which implies that these patterns are not simply \"hard-wired\" into the climate models but are features of the real climate.\nOverall, t..."
