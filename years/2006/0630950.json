 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the PIs set up a virtual center for promoting and supporting exchanges and collaborations in statistical science between US-based and China-based researchers and educators. The center will be guided by a scientific committee. The goal is to enable research collaborations in the areas where the two countries have complementary strengths. The center will sponsor or co-sponsor Ambassador Lectures in China given by prominent researchers from the US on cutting-edge topics in statistics, invite prominent Chinese scholars to give theme lectures in the US and to collaborate with US researchers, co-sponsor workshops in China on frontiers of statistics and assist US participants to attend those workshops, and support collaborations between researchers from the two countries, especially junior researchers. \r\n \r\nThe virtual center recognizes the importance of enabling US researchers and educators to advance their work through international collaboration. The activities supported by this proposal also help ensure that future generations of US researchers in statistical science have substantial interaction with their counterparts in China, a country that is accelerating its research and education at a rapid speed.\r\n",
