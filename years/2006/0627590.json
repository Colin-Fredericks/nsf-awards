 "awd_abstract_narration": "Routing protocols enable a distributed set of nodes to determine the\r\nflow of data over important networks such as the Internet. As a\r\nresult, ensuring that nodes throughout the network properly implement\r\nthe routing-protocol is of paramount importance. The routing-protocols\r\nin these networks are distributed, and nodes operate independently,\r\nbut must cooperate and \"play by the rules\" of the routing protocol\r\nif the network is to function correctly and efficiently. Routing\r\nprotocols form the basis of what is called the \"control plane\" of a\r\nnetworking architecture.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the control plane, and is seeking to further\r\ndevelopment of a methodology for measuring the inherent security of\r\nthe control plane component of existing and future routing protocols.\r\nThe overall approach has a significant theoretical component: general\r\nclasses of routing protocols are identified and they are being\r\nanalyzed for their ability to monitor themselves. The technique of\r\nStrong Detection is being used to reveal bounds on the kinds of errors\r\nthat these classes of routing protocols can detect, thus identifying\r\ncomplexity classes of routing protocols in terms of their\r\nself-monitoring abilities.\r\n\r\nThe work in this project contributes to an entirely new way of\r\nevaluating the security level of a routing protocol.  Strong Detection\r\nis novel, not only in its ability to identify the existence of a\r\ncontrol plane attack, but also in its ability to classify the\r\nrobustness to attack of classes of routing protocols. The project will\r\ncontribute to the general area of routing security, which is necessary\r\nto protect our networking infrastructure from deliberate or accidental\r\ndamage.",
