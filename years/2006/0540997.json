 "awd_abstract_narration": "Background\r\n\r\nRapid increases in computer performance, according to Moores law, have enabled software architects to\r\ndesign software of ever increasing functionality and complexity. Consequently, consumers expect software\r\nthat grows in functionality and can process larger data sets with every new release (e.g., huge spreadsheets\r\nor streaming high-quality video). Unfortunately, since Moores law will likely not hold in the near future,\r\nowing to physical limitations such as wire delays and heat dissipation, hardware speedups will not keep\r\npace with the demands of software. Thus, to meet the performance requirements of new software, one must\r\nlook to software techniques. \r\n\r\nThe proposed work will explore a new approach, algorithmic optimizations in\r\nvirtual machines, to provide the performance for next generations of software.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\n-A system for marking implementations of algorithms, data structures, and their uses. A VM that\r\nknows about this system can exploit the information for connecting uses with suitable implementations.\r\nA VM that does not know about this system still executes the code correctly but without its\r\nperformance benefits.\r\n-An implementation within a Java virtual machine that exploits the information for improving performance.\r\nThis implementation support includes modifications to the garbage collector (for migrating\r\ndata from one representation to another), compiler (for inlining away the calls), and scheduler (for\r\nscheduling profile collection threads with lower priority).\r\n-A collection of libraries and applications marked to exploit algorithmic optimizations. This will form\r\npart of the evaluation for the proposed work.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThe infrastructure developed as part of this research will be used in undergraduate\r\nalgorithms classes to give students deep knowledge about the strengths and limitations of \r\ncommonly used algorithms and data structures. This research will provides the performance \r\nnecessary for meeting the needs of future software systems.\r\n",
