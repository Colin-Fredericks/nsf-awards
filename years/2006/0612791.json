 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent years have witnessed significant improvements in automatic\r\nmachine translation systems.  An enabling factor for this short\r\nturnaround time is the adoption of automatic evaluation metrics, which\r\nserve to guide developers to improve translation systems.  However,\r\ncurrent metrics are a coarse approximation of human judgments for\r\nsystem outputs.  This SGER project is exploring ways of improving\r\ncurrent metrics.  It does so on three fronts.  First, judgments of\r\nsyntactic similarities between system outputs and human references are\r\nbeing incorporated into the metric in addition to phrasal\r\nsimilarities.  Second, machine learning techniques are being applied\r\nto find characteristics that are correlated to human judgments of\r\nquality.  Third, the project is determining more fine-grained analyses\r\nof what is wrong as well as what is right with system outputs based on\r\nsyntactic as well as lexical characteristics of the system outputs.\r\nIn developing a learnable, syntax-aware metric, discriminative methods\r\nwill be generalized for complex, structured problems.  A more\r\ninformative automatic evaluation metric will lead to more rapid\r\nimprovements in machine translation technology, enabling access to\r\narchives from centuries past and documents from around the world.  All\r\nrelevant software and non-proprietary data will be distributed widely.\r\nWritten reports of experimental results and findings will be\r\ndisseminated through academic publications.\r\n\r\n",
