 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project proposes to advance the state of the art in automatic\r\nspeech recognition by detecting emotional and highly accented speech\r\nand differences based on age and gender, and then optimizing the\r\nacoustic model for those conditions. It will apply long-term\r\nadaptation techniques to improve robustness, and will implement\r\nan innovative second-pass decoding technique to improve accuracy\r\nby using side information such as thesaurus terms and\r\nhuman-prepared summaries.\r\n\r\nThe techniques to be developed will dramatically improve the efficiency\r\nof professional catalogers, leveraging automatic segmentation to\r\nsuggest topic boundaries in interviews, using domain-tuned\r\nclassification algorithms to recommend thesaurus terms, and\r\nproviding automated tools to support generation of event timelines.\r\nVolunteers will help assign metadata and provide transcripts.\r\nEfforts will be made to automate transferring capabilities developed\r\noriginally for English to other languages.  Access to multilingual\r\nmaterials will be done by combining knowledge-based and corpus-based\r\ntechniques to extend existing thesauri to new languages and by supporting\r\ncross-language searching of manually prepared segment-level\r\nsummaries and automatic speech recognition transcripts.\r\n\r\nEach component will be evaluated and user studies done to measure\r\nthe overall impact on support for cataloging, search and exploration.\r\nThis will produce significant impact, both through improved access\r\nto our cultural heritage and through the application of the techniques\r\nto other important problems.\r\n\r\nThe collection of spoken material used in this project will be the 116,000\r\nhours held by the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, a\r\nset of already digitized video recordings of great historical importance.",
