 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is partly  about large deviations in different contexts. In studying the scaling limits of interacting particle limits, one usually proves  laws of large  numbers. They  arise in different contexts  and have  corresponding large deviation results that are related.  Random walks and diffusions in a random environment are also expected, under suitable conditions,  to satisfy law of large numbers, central limit theorem and large deviations. The large deviation theory has close connection to the theory of homogenization of random Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations  with vanishing viscosity. We expect to continue with our investigation in these areas. \r\n\r\nIn  complex interactive systems, noise often acts as a stabilizing force and guides the system along a predictable deterministic path.  Deviations from this behavior are  rare. One goal of this project is to quantify and measure  how rare a  given deviation is and if  such a deviation should occur what is most likely to have caused it?\r\n",
