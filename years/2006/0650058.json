 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nSelf-assembly is the process by which small \"components\" follow simple\r\ncombination rules to form intricate structures. DNA Self-assembly is widely\r\nbelieved to be a key tool for nano-technology, nano-robotics, and molecular\r\ncomputation. DNA self-assembly in particular, and nano-technology in general,\r\noffer significant algorithmic challenges. This project will explore two\r\nexciting directions in this field:\r\n1. Error correction at the nano scale.\r\n2. Models and algorithms for molecular machines.\r\nIntellectual merit: Error correction at the nano scale appears to require\r\ntools and techniques that are significantly different from those required for\r\nerror correcting codes. For instance, errors and error correction mechanisms\r\nare bound by thermodynamic laws at the nano scale, as well as by the constraint\r\nthat any \"computation\" required to correct an error must be carried\r\nout using the same underlying error prone physical mechanism. While specific\r\nerror correction mechanisms are now known in certain cases, a general\r\nunderstanding has been elusive.\r\nMany experimental groups have developed rudimentary (but very promising)\r\nDNA based molecular machines. Modeling of these machines is in a preliminary\r\nstage. Exploratory research in modeling these machines is likely to\r\nlead to interesting and challenging algorithmic questions.\r\nBroad impact: Error correction at the nano scale will facilitate sophisticated\r\ntasks such as counting, growing crystals of pre-specified sizes (no\r\nlarger, no smaller), shape recognition etc. with great precision using inherently\r\nerror-prone DNA self-assembly (or other technologies). This would be\r\na new engineering primitive, somewhat like the engine and the semiconductor,\r\nwith important immediate as well as unforeseen uses. Also, molecular\r\nmachines may act as sensors, signal carriers, actuators, or drug delivery\r\nmechanisms. Undoubtedly, much of the hard work in achieving these goals\r\nwill be done (and is being done) by experimentalists. But the PI believes\r\nthat algorithmic techniques will also play an important supporting role.\r\nThe PI will organize an informal reading seminar where students will\r\nexplore this area in depth. The PI hopes that this seminar will provide a\r\nvaluable educational experience. The PI also plans to write an article in a\r\nbook intended for scientifically literate readers who are not experts in this\r\nfield; the article will highlight algorithmic issues at the nano scale.\r\n1",
