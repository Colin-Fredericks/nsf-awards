 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new computational method for image registration is formulated.  \r\nRegistration refers to the task of aligning a pair of images obtained  \r\nby CT (computed tomography), MR (magnetic resonance), ultra-sound,  \r\nand other techniques, so that they can be compared both qualitatively  \r\nand quantitatively. This is an important problem with applications  \r\nranging from remote sensing to medicine. In medicine, imaging  \r\ntechniques and analysis have become an important, non-invasive tool  \r\nfor diagnosis and for surgical and radiation treatment planning.  \r\nDespite advances in this area of research, the challenges posed by  \r\nregistration for three-dimensional images remains an open problem. A  \r\nnew mathematical approach is developed that optimizes any chosen  \r\nsimilarity measure of the images, subject to the constraint of a set  \r\nof differential equations that can generate any differentiable and  \r\ninvertible transformation.\r\n\r\nThe main intellectual merit of the project is that it significantly  \r\nenhances our understanding of imagery and shapes and also the  \r\naccuracy and efficiency of image registration techniques. The main  \r\nfeatures of the new method are as follows.\r\n1. Similarity measures used to compare images are directly optimized.\r\n2. The method has a landmark matching capacity for large deformations  \r\nbetween images.\r\n3. The method is founded on solid mathematical theory; in particular,  \r\nthe admissible space of transformations is the set of all  \r\ndifferentiable and invertible transformations.\r\n4. The project is carried out with the use of the software Insight  \r\nTool Kit developed by the National Institutes of Health; that  \r\nsoftware provides an excellent resource for the research activity.\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed activity are as follows.\r\n1. Undergraduate and graduate students are educated and trained to  \r\napply powerful mathematical techniques to medical and other image  \r\nprocessing problems.\r\n2. The new method will impact other areas of the computational  \r\nsciences. Results are to be presented at conferences and published in  \r\nscientific journals and through the mass media directed at scientists  \r\nand the general population as well.\r\n3. New partnerships between medical doctors, biomedical engineers,  \r\nand mathematicians are established, helping create a favorable  \r\nenvironment for further research aimed at improving the health of our  \r\ncitizens.\r\n",
