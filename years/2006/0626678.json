 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded the University of Connecticut under the direction of Dr. Senjie Lin to study the genome of the eukaryotic phytoplankton organisms known as dinoflagellates.  The researchers will obtain sequences of cDNA, or expressed message RNA sequences for genes in the nucleus, from two species of dinoflagellates known to produce toxins that cause fish kills.  The species to be sequenced are Karlodinium micrum and Amphidinium carterae. The genes will be sequenced and categorized by function for further genetic study.  Dinoflagellates are microscopic eukaryotic unicellular organisms  that are the most prominent lineage among marine microbes in terms of current and potential future significance associated with carbon cycling, coastal fisheries production, and environmental health. Dinoflagellates are the source of \"red tides,\" that cause fish kills and shellfish poisoning.  Depending on the species, their toxins can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP), neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP), and diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP), and some other health effects. In evolutionary history, dinoflagellate genomes not only have undergone vertical evolution but impacted by rampant horizontal gene transfer from their plastids, endosymbionts, and other organisms. Through large scale sequencing of expressed message RNA sequences this team will attempt to answer fundamental questions about dinoflagellates and their genomic structure.  For example, how many genes does a typical dinoflagellate genome hold? Is it more gene-rich than other eukaryotes? Are multiple copy genes dominant in dinoflagellate genome? Is there a common molecular machinery shared by the two dinoflagellate species that produce similar toxins? What genes and pathways are responsible for toxin production?  A graduate student and undergraduate student will work on the project and be trained in genomic biology.  An exhibit on red tides and their genomes will be constructed for an aquarium, which will explain dinoflagellate biology in the context of modern genomic research.",
