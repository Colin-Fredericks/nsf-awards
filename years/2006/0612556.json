 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a result of the increasing need within the federal government, NSF included, for effective formal assessment and accountability of investments in funded projects, the West Virginia EPSCoR (WV EPSCoR) proposes to conduct a series of three regional workshops to specifically address the issue of evaluation in each of the 27 EPSCoR jurisdictions.  The purpose of the regional workshops is to obtain the necessary input and feedback from participants that will facilitate the development of a program evaluation system consistent with both EPSCoR's vision, goals and objectives, as well as with the needs and unique characteristics of the individual EPSCoR sites.  Workshops participants will have the opportunity to share their locally implemented evaluation strategies, discuss their strength and areas to improve, and receive technical assistance from evaluation experts.  Thus, a major outcome of the proposed workshops will be the identification of a set of effective evaluation models that can be used by the jurisdictions.  Similarly, participants will be expected to provide suggestions for the development of the overall EPSCoR evaluation scheme.  \r\n\r\n",
