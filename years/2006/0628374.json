 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel grant seeks fund to assist US-based graduate students to attend the 3rd Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI), which promises to follow on the successful footsteps of its two predecessors. NSDI focuses on the design principles of large-scale networks and distributed systems, and the challenges that are shared between systems. The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers from across the networking and systems community to foster cross-disciplinary approaches and to address shared research challenges. This grant offers travel support to graduate students who might otherwise be unable to attend due to funding deficiencies. Beneficiaries include both student paper authors and others whose research areas significantly overlap with the conference topics. As technical conference participation is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience, this NSF travel support has high potential to shed a light on the future career development of the students, and therefore to nurture the next generation of researchers.",
