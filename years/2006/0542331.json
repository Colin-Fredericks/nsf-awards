 "awd_abstract_narration": "Light is an important parameter that controls numerous processes in photosynthetic organisms such as the cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria are ecologically important and serve as important model photosynthetic cells. Excess light energy is potentially very damaging to photosynthetic organisms and they have evolved a variety of mechanisms to help them cope with high light stress, many of which necessitate altering the expression of numerous genes. An important part of the light intensity control of gene expression is likely to be through the perception of changes in light quality. However, the contribution of wavelength-specific photoperception to the overall molecular and cellular response to high light stress remains poorly understood. Using whole-genome microarray analysis of cyanobacteria, this study will examine the role that light color perception plays in controlling global gene expression in the response to high light stress. The studies will be performed in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus strain PCC 7942, which has a small genome that has recently been completely sequenced, and for which a wholegenome DNA microarray is now available. This organism has a well-developed set of genetic tools available that will facilitate future analyses of the stimulons identified in this study. The knowledge gained will aid in our understanding of how photosynthetic organisms respond at the molecular level to light stress, which is of critical importance in the agricultural field and could ultimately lead to advances in crop productivity. Broader impact: The research plan will directly support the training of a female, African American graduate student and two minority undergraduate students. Moreover, the introduction of microarray technology to the research and teaching laboratories of the PI will facilitate the training of future graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Texas at Arlington, many of whom are ethnic minorities (primarily African American and Hispanic).",
