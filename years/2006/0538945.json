 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores the application of optical technology to  the communication problems of future high-performance computing (HPC) systems. The goal is to develop  flexible and dynamically reconfigurable optical interconnection architectures that will scale to a large number of processors while  delivering scalable bandwidth, low communication latency, low power  consumption, and low cost. The proposed approach is an organized effort  combining architecture, technology, simulation and physical  demonstration.  The proposed research consists of three inter-related tasks: (1)  Development and design of reconfigurable and scalable optical interconnection architectures for HPCs, (2) Identification and  characterization of possible optical components necessary for the  implementation of the proposed architectures, and (3) Development of analytic modeling and simulation tools for the precise physical modeling  of the optical implementation techniques, as well as end-to-end system  modeling of the proposed architectures. \r\n\r\nAs feature sizes in CMOS chips decrease to the sub-micron regime, and clock  rates increase to the multi-GHz range, electrical interconnects are predicted to reach their fundamental limits and become the ultimate  bottleneck for performance. This limitation will result in major bandwidth imbalances in future high-performance computers, and significantly affect their performance and scalability. One of the  technologies that has been recognized to have the potential to solve  communication problems of HPC systems is optical interconnects.\r\n\r\n",
