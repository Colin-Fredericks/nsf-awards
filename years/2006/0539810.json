 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a thin, highly accurate, reliable, cost-effective, portable, durable and survivable pressurized sensing strip (or mat) for remotely sensing the weights of moving objects in harsh environments. Applications are numerous, ranging from measuring the weight of moving aircraft to measuring the weight of heavy containers arriving in ports. The system will be based on innovations in fiber optics technology. For an initial and innovative commercial application, the company has chosen weigh-in motion (WIM) for road vehicle safety, particularly because of its relationships with key customers, together with the great need to reduce vehicle accidents. This research would enable new and innovative sensor design, sensor networking systems in a distributed environment, the integration of sensors into engineered systems and the interpretation and use of sensor data in decision-making processes. \r\n\r\nVehicular accidents are endemic on the nation's highway system and throughout the world. While the technology to be developed has applications in many areas, the specific commercialization plan within this proposal (WIM) will have broad, sweeping impacts on making the nation's highways safer for driving. Existing WIM systems for roads are expensive to install and maintain and are inaccurate. Despite these facts, WIM systems dramatically improve road safety where used. \r\n",
