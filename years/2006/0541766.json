Research projects that will be enhanced by this instrument includes studies on (a) the mechanism of amine oxidation catalyzed by the copper/quinine-dependent amine oxidases and the design of mechanism-based inactivators; b) modification of proteins by lipid and sugar oxidation products during oxidative stress; c) novel oligomeric and polymeric materials; d) characterization of nanosized aggregates that form at the outset of biomineralization; d) highly controlled asymmetric reactions; e) synthesis of new and unusual three-dimensional architectures; and f) properties of metal macrocycles.  \r\n\r\nThe X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, especially synthetic chemistry, materials science and biochemistry.  In addition, the diffractometer will be cyber-enabled to allow access to users at remote locations.  \r\n\r\n",
