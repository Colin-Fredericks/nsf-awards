 "awd_abstract_narration": "0606986 \r\nStone \r\nThis project will evaluate the fate (degradation) and effects of two antimicrobials, tylosin and chlorotetracycline (CTC), in swine manure treatment (aerobic and anaerobic lagoons) and anaerobic sequencing batch reactors. These compounds are two of the most commonly administered antimicrobial agents to improve swine growth rates and prevent, control, and treat swine-related health problems in confined feedlots. The pervasive use of these antimicrobials in swine production makes the development of such information timely and important. The project has four research goals: (1) determine removal efficiencies of the antibiotics through laboratory based simulations of aerobic and anaerobic lagoon waste treatment processes; (2) assess the impacts of the antibiotics on psychrophilic (ca. 5-20oC) and mesophilic (ca. 30-38oC) aerobic and anaerobic lagoon treatment performance; (3) quantify changes in microbial community diversity and activity due to the antibiotics during aerobic and anaerobic waste treatment; and (4) determine changes in operational efficiency of anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (SBR) due to the antibiotics during treatment of swine waste. The broader impacts section of the project involves collaboration between two universities in South Dakota and participation by undergraduates and graduate students in the research.\r\n",
