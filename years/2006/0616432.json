 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important body of research shows that language learning is constrained by pre-determined properties of the brain, called Universal Grammar. While the role of Universal Grammar is accepted in the acquisition of first language, it is still controversial whether and how Universal Grammar is implicated in the learning of additional languages. This study examines the extent to which Universal Grammar is implicated in the acquisition and maintenance of the weaker language of two groups of bilinguals. The first group is composed of post-puberty learners of Korean who are native speakers of English and Chinese. The second is composed of heritage speakers of Korean who grew up in English and Chinese-speaking countries. For both groups, Korean is the weaker language, either because it is the language acquired late or because it is not the dominant language of the community. This project will focus on the distribution and interpretation of reflexive pronouns. The three languages share an important core of properties, but also differ in interesting ways. By investigating how the similarities and differences in the system of reflexive pronouns are negotiated by speakers, researchers can investigate the role of Universal Grammar in different types of bilinguals.",
