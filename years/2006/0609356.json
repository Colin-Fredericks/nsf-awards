 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oregon State University and the  H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest will host a 10 week NIBIB-NSF Bioengineering and Bioinformatics Summer Institutes (BBSI) Program in EcoInformatics under the direction of Dr. Desiree D. Tullos.  This Institute will support a total of 60 undergraduate and graduate students, 15 per year, for a total of four years.\r\n\r\nEcoInformatics is the integrated application of mathematical sciences, computer science and engineering to the study ahd management of ecoystems. The objective of this Summer Institute in EcoInformatics is to provide early undergraduate and early-stage graduate students majoring in the biological sciences, computer sciences, engineering, mathematical sciences, and physcial sciences with carefully planned interdisciplinary ecosystem informatics research and education experiences in order to increase the number of individual pursuing ecoysystem informatics at the graduate level and beyond.  Building on the interdisciplinary Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program at the H.J. Andrews Forest and its information management program this Summer Institute will  1) train and promote discovery in young scientists who will make basic contributions to ecosystem science, computer science, and mathematics through team -based research and education: 2) promote the pursuit and success of a diverse group of students seeking higher education and research experience in EcoInformatics; and 3) provide graduates to work in interdisciplinary settings on natural resources management and policy.\r\n\r\nThe Summer Institute will target the recruitment of underserved student populations of Native Americans, Hispanics, and women, and will provide career development activities illustrating career options in academia, agencies, and the private sector.  Through this integrated research and education, effective mentoring, and hands-on experience, participants will gain the foundation and opportunities to develop and seek support for their own graduate program, including a peer reviewed research proposal, as well as the training to become outstanding interdisciplinary scientists and effective contributors to EcoInformatics science.\r\n\r\nThis project is being co-funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)/ Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI)/Biological Databases and Informatics (BDI) Program ; the National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), and the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE)/Division of Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS).\r\n\r\n",
