 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed reserch develops and analyzes efficient numerical methods\r\nfor time-harmonic acoustic wave propagation problems in fluids and solids.\r\nParticularly, exterior two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems for\r\nacoustic scattering in inhomogenous media and fluid-structure scattering\r\nare considered. The discretization of the governing PDE models is performed\r\nusing finite elements on orthogonal rectangular meshes with local adaptation\r\nto boundaries and interfaces. Special phase error reducing low-order finite\r\nelements are studied and employed. The aim is to solve three-dimensional\r\ntime-harmonic wave propagation problems in which the diameter of the\r\ncomputational domain is from tens to hundreds wavelengths. These problems\r\nlead to very large systems of linear equations which can have from millions\r\nto several billions unknowns. Numerical methods for this frequency range\r\nare under active research, and no efficient method still seem to exist.\r\nThe large scale linear systems are solved iteratively with a Schwarz-type\r\ndomain decomposition preconditioner. Very efficient subdomain preconditioners\r\nare constructed using fast direct solvers by means of domain embedding.\r\nThis novelty makes the proposed approach very fast. The conditioning of\r\npreconditioned systems are analyzed for suitable model problems. The\r\nresulting methods are constructed in such a way that the iterations can\r\nbe carried out on a small sparse subspace related to the interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe studied scattering problems arise routinely in many disciplines.\r\nDue to limitations of contemporary methods and computational resources\r\nmany of these problems cannot be solved in practice. The aim of this\r\nresearch is to develop numerical methods which enable the solution of\r\nmany of these large problems. The first class of studied model problems\r\nare acoustical geological surveys employed in oil exploration. Currently\r\nit is necessary to use crude methods for surveys which are in many\r\ncases inaccurate. The developed methods can eventually lead to improved\r\nyield in the extraction of oil and reduced environmental impact.\r\nThe second class of model problems describe scattering by elastic objects\r\nlike mines in seabed. Mines have been the single largest cause of fatalities\r\nin naval warfare. This part of the research is conducted in cooperation\r\nwith researchers at a Navy research center and it is closely related to\r\na project funded by the Office of Naval Research. A broader goal of this\r\nactivity is develop computational methods which help to enhance the\r\ndetection and identification capabilities of mines in seabed.",
