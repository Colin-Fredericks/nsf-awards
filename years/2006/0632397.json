This course is an interdisciplinary exploration of nuclear chemistry which explores use of radioactivity in the cultural and geopolitical context of the circumpolar north.  The impact of nuclear weapons development on the Aleuts and the future development of nuclear power in the Arctic are being investigated by the students.  Students are learning state-of-the-art nuclear chemistry and health concepts and they are discovering where nuclear development intersects with people and the land.  This context-based approach shows the intellectual merit in using civic engagement to stimulate creative thinking by students.  A broader impact of this project is use of the model to adapt other courses which will focus on use of northern natural resources and energy, topics known to engage the interest of arctic indigenous people and students.  This course is expanding the science courses available to UARCTIC students.\r\n",
