 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tradeoffs and Idealization in Biological and Chemical Modeling\r\nScientific models almost always contain idealizations. This raises a number of fundamental\r\nphilosophical questions: Is idealization inevitable regardless of the amount\r\nof data and computational power at our disposal? Does idealization have any nonpragmatic\r\nvalue or justification? Will idealization persist as science progresses?\r\nMuch of the recent philosophical literature correctly suggest that idealization has\r\nepistemic value and is likely to persist as science progress. This has been defended\r\nin different ways, including by demonstrating how idealized models can identify core\r\ncausal phenomena. However, one important defense of idealization has not yet played\r\na central role in philosophical discussions: the existence of tradeoffs. Modelers have\r\nmultiple theoretical desiderata including precision, generality, and accuracy. Some\r\ndesiderata cannot be simultaneously maximized because they constrain and trade off\r\nagainst one another. This necessitates the construction of multiple idealized models\r\nfor a given phenomenon.  Intellectual Merit:  \r\nTradeoffs and Idealization in Biological and Chemical Modeling will defend the existence\r\nof tradeoffs among the desiderata of models and modeling and argue that these\r\ntradeoffs are part of the explanation and justification of idealization's ubiquity. The\r\nanalysis will focus on classic models of predation, competition, and molecular structure,\r\nas these exemplify theoretical practice in evolutionary ecology and quantum chemistry.\r\nThis project can be divided into three components. The first part consists of identifying\r\nand characterizing the most important desiderata for theoretical modeling. Examining\r\nuniversal desiderata of models as well as specific properties of ecological and\r\nchemical models, this stage of research will generate a set of definitions that are both\r\nanalytically rigorous and consistent with scientific practice. In the second part, tradeoffs\r\nand other constraints among these desiderata will be identified. This will consist of\r\nshowing, by both mathematical and empirical means, that increasing the magnitude of\r\nsome desiderata will necessarily affect the magnitude of others. This analysis will yield\r\na list of the most important tradeoffs. Finally, these analyses will be used to argue that\r\nthe existence of tradeoffs is part of the explanation and justification for idealization.\r\nThis project is primarily a contribution to the scientific and philosophical literature\r\nabout modeling and idealization. Broader Impacts:  It will also have a very direct impact on the debate\r\nbetween biologist Richard Levins and his critics over the existence of tradeoffs. While\r\nLevins has long maintained that simultaneously maximizing all theoretical desiderata\r\nwas impossible, his lack of formal arguments for this thesis have left his insights vulnerable\r\nto critical attack. This project will yield arguments to defend Levins' position.\r\nAnother wider impact concerns scientific pedagogy. Ideas from this project will\r\nbe reformulated for use in secondary and higher education with the primary goal of\r\nmaking citizens more informed consumers of science, especially in fields such as climate\r\nscience where critics prey on public misunderstanding of modeling and idealization.\r\nA secondary goal is to improve advanced textbook discussions of the justification for\r\nmodeling and theorizing.\r\nFinally, the arguments of this project may be useful in adjudicating disputes between\r\ndifferent groups of theorists. Some theorists believe that idealization should\r\nultimately be eliminated from their models; others believe that idealized models will\r\nalways be important in scientific inquiry, despite their inaccuracies. Rational resolution\r\nof these disputes might be aided by fully accounting of the rationals for idealization,\r\nincluding the existence of tradeoffs.",
