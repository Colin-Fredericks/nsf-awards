The grant will provide partial travel stipends to 10 full delegates and 15 student delegates to facilitate their participation in the conference.  With respect to intellectual merit, the conference is an important international forum for researchers from a broad cross-section of engineering, science, and medical disciplines who are working on fundamentals and applications of flow and transport in small-scale internal flows.  Some of the current topics to be featured in the conference are effects of nanoparticles on transport processes, surface tension effects at small scales, multiphase flows in small channels, novel medical diagnostic and drug delivery devices, and microchannel flows in energy devices.  All of these topics are related to core priority areas within the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program of the NSF, the funding program.  The conference will have many broader impacts by providing a forum for interaction and dissemination of recent research, as well as by providing special opportunities for the participation of a diverse group of students and academic researchers.\r\n",
