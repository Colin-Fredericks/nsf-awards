From a device application point of view, one of the most fundamental challenges to create on-chip large-scale integrated optics has been to provide signal isolation and to suppress parasitic reflections between devices. In this context, there is a very strong interest in the miniaturization of non-reciprocal optical devices and their on-chip integration. In this context, the present project will greatly benefit the efforts of creating ultra-compact devices at a single-wavelength scale with enhanced functionalities.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: This project provides excellent training opportunities for graduate students. In addition, as part of the efforts on outreach and education, minority graduate students will be actively recruited to work on this project with additional fund secured from Stanford University's Engineering Diversity Program. Special focus is also placed on incorporating undergraduate students into the research program, as well as on outreach to the professional and local communities.\r\n",
