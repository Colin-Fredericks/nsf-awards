 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this grant is to provide support for US-based graduate student travel to Pisa, Italy to attend ACM SIGCOMM 2006 conference.  The SIGCOMM conference on Communications, Protocols, and Applications is the premier technical meeting that examines the state-of-the-art in computer networks and communications. It features a large percentage of high-quality papers that have tremendous impact on the field of computer networking. This grant offers support to graduate students since they constitute one of the important segments of the research community and they often have limited resources of funds to travel to conferences, especially when they are not paper authors. With the support of this grant, the travel award program of SIGCOMM 2006 conference will be able to extend its support to a much larger number of students, providing an opportunity for a broader student body to interact with world-class scientists in their fields. Considering the potential of motivating students to do high-quality research through the SIGCOMM 2006 conference participation, this travel support has strong impact on educating the next generation researchers in computer networks and communications.",
