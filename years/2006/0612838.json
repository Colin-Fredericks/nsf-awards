 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graduate student Satsuki Takahashi, supervised by Dr. Bonnie J. McCay, will undertake research on how community-based conservation is developed and maintained over time and in changing circumstances. Building on anthropological theories of practice and studies of natural resource management, the researcher will study four fisheries cooperatives in Ibaraki, Japan. It is often emphasized that the legally privileged property rights to access particular coastal resources have helped Japanese fisheries cooperatives develop and maintain community-based management institutions over their long history since the 1800s. Yet, in contrast to the popular belief of a static state of cooperation maintained over this time history, this researcher hypothesizes that such institutions have been constructed through dynamic negotiations among people and between people and their coastal environments. Through archival research, semi-structured interviews, and participant observation, the researcher will investigate how each cooperative has managed coastal resources over the last fifty years, a period when the cooperatives and their members experienced major socio-cultural and ecological changes associated with urbanization. This in-depth historical and ethnographical research will provide opportunities to gain an understanding of the interplay between practices, situations, and contexts in contemporary Japanese culture and to gain further understanding of community-based natural resource management. \r\n\r\n",
