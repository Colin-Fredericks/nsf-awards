During evaporation the lighter isotope of oxygen, 16-O, preferentially escapes to the atmosphere leaving the heavier isotope, 18-O, enriched in the remaining pool of water.  Leaves represent such a situation and thus are highly enriched in 18-O compared to the source water.  This project will use this difference in evaporative concentration to determine the amount of water deficit by comparing materials that preserve both the evaporated versus the non-evaporated water bodies.  \r\n\tPreliminary studies have shown that for Africa, the hippopotamus and the giraffe represent two such end-members:  the hippopotamus represents a non-evaporated source and the giraffe represents a highly evaporated water signal because of its dependence on leaves as a major source of water in its daily activities.  Tooth enamel preserves well in the fossil record and thus should be able to be used to evaluate the water-deficit in the geological past.  Other mammals will be identified that serve as indicators of the non-evaporated and the evaporated signals.\r\n\tThis study is easiest to carry out in equatorial regions because of the low seasonal amplitude in the stable isotopic composition of water.  If this method proves successful in tropical regions its application will be able to be extended to higher latitudes where the isotope cycle in water is more complex.  Furthermore, it may lead to other methods of determining water deficit by demonstrating a method that uses the relative isotope enrichment resulting from evaporation from a water source.\r\n   \t\r\n",
