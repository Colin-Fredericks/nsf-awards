 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase II project will provide development of a new homeland security technology for improving security for crowded venues by integrating a new networked security screening technology and new electronics communications with materials handling automation and computerized process control. New approaches and technologies are needed to provide effective security screening for places having high passenger and high pedestrian traffic. A primary need is to be able to screen persons and their carried items at significantly higher processing rates from those achieved using conventional security checkpoints while maintaining a smooth flow of people through the system. The Phase I project demonstrated technical feasibility.  Phase II will complete development of the new high flow security screening system and design, construct, and test a near commercial scale prototype system. It is planned that the prototype system will be tested and evaluated by a TSA-approved, independent third party. Upon successful testing the system will be ready for deployment.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. transportation industry needs fast effective improvements in its security systems. Improved security technologies for use in transit systems can be applied to many other segments of society as well. In today's world it is vital that our nation's citizenry, transportation systems, institutions, and economy have the best protection possible from those who seek to weaken and destroy our society. The proposed technology will provide smooth flow of people and items through a fast and effective security inspection station with greater than an order of magnitude increase in processing rates compared to current technologies. The new technology will provide a significantly higher level of protection to persons in busy and crowded areas against attacks by terrorists using weapons or explosives than is currently available. Similarly, security at federal buildings, government installations, maritime ports, shippers, mailrooms, and other sensitive locations can be improved by the proposed technology that will allow for a faster and less impeded flow of persons and packages through the security inspection process. \r\n",
