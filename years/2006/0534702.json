 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current database management systems require all data to be modeled in terms of precise values. However, there is a large number of application domains where data values are imprecise or uncertain. Examples of such data include measurements for sensors, locations of moving objects, and experimental data. For these applications there is a need to develop a database management system that supports uncertain data types. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to develop a comprehensive database management system for storing and querying uncertain, or imprecise data. The project encompasses the creation of a comprehensive model for uncertain data based upon the relational model, the extension of SQL to support probabilistic queries over uncertain data, techniques for efficient and accurate evaluation of probabilistic queries, and the development of a prototype system. The specific optimization issues addressed include indexing, join algorithms, and query optimization for uncertain data. \r\n\r\n The prototype will be developed as an extension of the open-source PostgreSQL database management system. A realistic moving objects' application is targeted for testing of the prototype. In addition, collaboration with experts in biology and chemistry will serve as validations of the applicability of the developments in these domains. \r\n\r\n The project is expected to have a significant impact on application domains that are in need of an uncertain data management system, and also on the database community. The proposal is expected to provide a single model for multiple types of uncertainty, and to develop indexing, join, and query optimization techniques for uncertain data. \r\n\r\nThis project will integrate research and education through student participation in research projects, course development, and research seminar. The results from this research will be included in course projects and will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications in journals and conferences, conference presentations, and the Web pages (http://wwww.cs.purdue.edu/homes/sunil/UncertainDB) that will also provide the prototype dissemination. \r\n",
