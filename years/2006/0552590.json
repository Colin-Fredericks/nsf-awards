 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a  continuation of a summer REU site within the Statistics Department at Rice University for the study of Statistics and its applications. These efforts are led by the Principal Investigator Javier Rojo, Professor of Statistics. The objectives of the RUSIS will continue to be achieved through:\r\n\r\nTraining and mentoring of 17 (12 NSF- and 5 NSA-supported) selected junior and senior underrepresented minority students and students with no easy access to a career experience at their institution through intensive core courses in probability, stochastic processes, and statistical inference, with special emphasis on areas of current interest. (e.g.  multiple comparisons, extreme value theory, multivariate survival analysis, geophysics, statistical genetics, and general biostatistics). \r\n\r\nEngaging the students in research projects under close collaboration with the faculty mentors, and with the objective of producing joint publications. Students will present their results at national meetings and they will be mentored in the preparation and presentation of their talks. In addition, students meet with an advisory committee composed of top scientists and present their work to them. \r\n\r\nShort courses on the use of Unix platforms, latex, and software to be utilized for research purposes such as Mathematica and Splus;\r\n\r\nVisits to scientific facilities (e.g., Biomathematics and Biostatistics Depts at MD Anderson Cancer Center, NASA) have been organized and will be continued, and a series of lectures, by a variety of scientists, which are part of an AGEP funded program, will be attended. These lectures cover a variety of topics ranging from applying to Graduate School to career experiences by outstanding scientists.\r\n\r\nEvaluation and monitoring of the progress of students for seven years (expected time for them to finish graduate school) after their participation; annual evaluation of the program by the participating students and an external advisory committee.\r\n\r\nThe length of RUSIS is 10 weeks for each of the three years. Undergraduate students with a mathematical background that includes three semesters of calculus, and one semester of linear algebra or matrix analysis, and who fall within the description of the first bullet item above, will be heavily recruited by the PI Javier Rojo (email: jrojo@rice.edu 713-348-2797) with the assistance of the Advisory Committee members, all of whom have extensive experience in engaging nontraditional students in careers in science and engineering.\r\n \r\nThe application materials and information about the program may be downloaded from\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stat.rice.edu/~jrojo\r\n",
