 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Indian Science and Engineering Society project (AISES BPC) proposes a three year demonstration project to broaden the participation of American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) students in the computing. This project will provide undergraduate summer research experiences at Johns Hopkins University, the University of Michigan,  and the University of St. Thomas. Younger students will begin with a research experience at St. Thomas and then will progress, for the second summer to a research position at the University of Michigan or Johns Hopkins. The project will examine and test factors that are critical to achieving this objective: How can AISES effectively use its extensive set of programs to reach and increase the participation of AI/AN postsecondary students in computing disciplines? What is the impact of undergraduate research opportunities on recruitment and retention of these AI/AN students in computing majors? What impact does participation in undergraduate research opportunities have in encouraging and preparing AI/AN students to attend graduate school? The program will expose the students to computing theory, applications, and role models. It will expand their academic and professional horizons, and provide them with a mentoring support network. The ultimate goal of the effort is to increase the number of AI/AN students majoring in computing disciplines, working in a computing career, pursuing graduate education in the computing fields, and ultimately attaining a Ph.D. in a computing discipline.",
