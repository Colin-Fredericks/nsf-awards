 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to develop advanced lithography methods, which transfer self-assembled nanostructures from biomacromolecules (more specifically, DNA) into conventional inorganic materials with interesting physical properties of electronics, optics, and magnetism. The developed methodologies will allow parallel and cost-effective fabrication of nanostructures, which have potential applications in the next generation of computers that process information by integration of electronics, optics, magnetism, and molecular self-assembly. The central elements of our proposed advanced lithography methods rely on self-assembled DNA nanostructures, which direct the final patterns. Many soft-lithography techniques will be adapted to transfer DNA patterns. The proposed research integrates both top-down lithography approaches and bottom-up self-assembly approaches for nanofabrication.\r\nBroad Impact\r\n\tThis proposal suggests a radically novel approach for fabrication of nanostructures with functional, inorganic materials. This research, if successful, could significantly influence the future development of nanofabrication, the ultimate technique that drives the rapid development of computers.\r\n\tThe interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research will provide participating students excellent opportunities to learn not only basic core sciences (chemistry, biology, electronics and engineering), but also how to integrate them into their daily research and address specific problems using different approaches. Two women graduate students and one undergraduate student are already on this research team. We will continue to build a diverse research team for this project.\r\n",
