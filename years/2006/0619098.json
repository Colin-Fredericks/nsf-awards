 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nNorth Dakota State University will acquire a new low vacuum scanning electron microscope.  This instrument will be equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), a tensile stage, and a WebSEM system for remote imaging and control.  This state-of-the-art microscope will support secondary and backscatter imaging, microanalysis, research training, classroom education and the outreach programs of the University Microscopy Center.  Acquisition of this microscope will strengthen ongoing research projects and stimulate new research efforts in  nanoscience, biomaterials, polymeric materials/coatings, receptor-mediated monocyte differentiation, plant pathology, and entomology.  Fully hydrated specimens can be examined without traditional fixation and dehydration. The capabilities of this microscope will increase the number of students and researchers using the facility and will provide additional educational experiences in exiting courses and stimulate an expanded curriculum in the areas nanoscience, engineering, and the biology sciences.  This new instrumentation will strengthen existing collaborative research programs, provide the stimulus to facilitate new cooperative programs, strengthen our collaboration with a consortium of regional colleges initiating a nanotechnology technician training program, provide the opportunity for remote microscopy access to North Dakota tribal colleges and high schools through the NATURE program (Nurturing American Tribal Undergraduate Research and Education) and support our outreach to K-12  students and teachers throughout the region.\r\n\r\nLay Abstract\r\n\r\nThe scanning electron microscope will strengthen on-going research programs in the North Dakota State University Microscopy Center.  This new instrumentation will expand the role of microscopy into new and exciting research areas including nanotechnology, new polymers and coatings, engineering, and biological sciences.  This microscope will allow the investigation of a wide range of samples that can not be easily examined using our current instruments, thus stimulating additional cooperative research efforts both on and off campus.  The advantages offered by this microscope will be included in existing courses and will be added as a component to new classes currently being developed.  The capability of remote operation from on or off campus classrooms or offices will provide students and faculty with easy access to a state -of-the-art microscope.  Remote operation makes this instrument available to other universities, North Dakota tribal colleges, junior colleges, and middle and high school students throughout the region.  \r\n",
