 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will facilitate the participation of young scientists, ranging from exceptional undergraduates to beginning faculty investigators, in a meeting on \"Ribosome Synthesis\" to be held August 16-20, 2006 at the Airlie Conference Center in Virginia (http://www.ribosomesynthesis2006.org/).  The ribosome is central to the growth and maintenance of all cells, from those of unicellular bacteria to complex multicellular eukaryotes. Ribosomes are complex macromolecular machines that use the instructions in the genetic code to align and polymerize amino acids into protein.  The formation of ribosomes requires that the 60 to 80 RNA and protein components are produced in the correct amounts and assembled into the correct special configuration.  All organisms have evolved elaborate machineries that assist and control the orderly formation of ribosomes; the organization and function of this machinery is incompletely understood.  Nevertheless, it is already apparent that a number of the components of this machinery also have important functional roles in development and regulation of growth. The purpose of this meeting is to afford senior scientists, as well as students and beginning investigators, the opportunity to achieve an overview of ribosome biogenesis and its relation to cell growth.  Equally important, the meeting will provide an impetus to investigators to focus and structure their research efforts and maximize their contributions in areas needing attention.  The project will have major impact on the recruitment and success of young investigators and aid their integration into the field.",
