 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anton Nekrutenko\r\nIstvan Albert\r\n\r\nPennsylvania State University is awarded a grant to develop a resource that integrates various types of genomic data (sequences, alignments, microarray data) with an extensive array of analysis tools. The system, G2, will enable researchers to follow the \"data->analyses->experiments\" path that is critically needed to realize the goals of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects. It will have a very simple, intuitive interface that would allow instructors to demonstrate principles of genomic biology in school and college classrooms. Building on longstanding work from the bioinformatics group at Penn State University and its collaborators in developing genome analysis tools and databases, the G2 metaserver represents a new generation of comparative genomics resources. The project will develop a simple, compact, and powerful system for the integration of any genome-based information; create a framework that makes it exceptionally easy for any developer to add analysis tools to our system, and explore the utility of new \"Google-like\" user interfaces that interpret simple input and guide the user during the search process. An educational version of the system will enable teachers to show genomic biology in action and to demonstrate the strong connection between genomics and classical disciplines such as evolutionary biology. Undergraduate and graduate students working on the project will acquire interdisciplinary training in large-scale genome analysis, data mining and programming. A minority undergraduate student will be recruited to work on this project in the summer. The project data will be utilized in a lecture and in a computer class presented at the Biotechnology and Bioinformatics Workshops for K-12 science educators conducted annually at Penn State.  \r\n",
