This collaborative project between UC-Berkeley and UC-Davis will investigate the mass transport of liquids in carbon nanotube nanotunnels that are only a nanometers wide and microns long. The fabrication method for nanofluidic devices that consist of carbon nanotube membranes will be further developed, aiming at tight control of the nanotube dimensions (diameter/length) and structure. Molecular and ionic transport through sub-2 nm diameter carbon nanotubes will be then experimentally tested.  The focused research will enable a deeper understanding of nanofluidics -- the science of molecules in environments commensurate with their own size. The fundamental research on the transport through the nanotubes has far-reaching impact, as it will lay a solid foundation for the design and development of a host of nanofluidic devices. The fabricated devices will be useful in applications including separation, desalination, as nanopores for DNA sequencing as well as for biomolecule filtration and detection.\r\nWith respect to Broader Impacts, the program launched though this exploratory research will provide important opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to have exciting research experiences in nanoscience and engineering. This will be accomplished both with structured instruction in the form of seminars, workshops and coursework as well as with participation in the research laboratory environment.\r\n",
