 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective is to explore the feasibility of a novel spin based quantum dot logic paradigm for a magnetic exchange switch.  This device will utilize manipulation and control of magnetism in magnetically doped Si(Ge) quantum dots prepared by direct self assembly onto Si substrates. This project will demonstrate that doping these dots with Mn ions will produce high Curie temperature (>100K) carrier mediated ferromagnetism, a primary requirement for such a switch. The approach is to use Mn ion implantation into germanium on insulator (GOI) to determine the range of doping that produces high Curie temperature ferromagnetism, followed by aligned ion and electron beam lithography to controllably Mn dope the quantum dots.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project is very important in providing a pathway to a revolutionary switching device based upon advancing our knowledge of dilute magnetism in dimensionally constrained nanostructures.. Magnetism in quantum dots is an area where there have been some recent theoretical advances but no concomitant experimental confirmations.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Semiconducting electronics is at least a $100B market, and if successful, this work will provide a new avenue for the extension of the semiconducting roadmap and have significant economic as well as technological implications.  This program will be a central component of SpINQuEST (Spins in Quantum Systems and Technology), an umbrella center at UVA which offers significant research, educational and outreach programs, including the Spins in Solids Summer Institute. SpINQuEST programs will greatly enhance the students' research, educational and cultural experiences, based upon the diversity of participating institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
