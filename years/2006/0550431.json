 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of individual-level public opinion and behavior has flourished in recent\r\ndecades. But understanding of the dynamics of mass opinion prior to the 1950s has\r\nbeen undermined by the absence of high-quality, individual-level data. Over 450 national\r\nopinion polls were conducted from 1935-1945. However, these surveys have not been\r\nexploited by the social science community because they are not easily usable. The data\r\noften contains numerous miscodings and other errors. In addition, the surveys employed\r\nnow-discredited quota sampling procedures. The principal investigators  recode the\r\ndatasets and implement and disseminate methods appropriate for analyzing this historical\r\npublic opinion data. By applying methods that make quota sample data usable, this\r\nproject opens up a new realm for public opinion research in the U.S. and other\r\ncountries, such as England, that have used quota-sampling methods.\r\nRecovering this early opinion data promises to illuminate critical questions\r\nconcerning the role of the mass public in the political system. The public opinion polls\r\nfrom this time contain a plethora of valuable items measuring attitudes concerning\r\neconomic policy, World War II, and racial relations. The principal investigators  use\r\nthe polling data on attitudes toward international intervention to determine how the mass\r\npublic guided and reacted to foreign policy decisions during the Second World War,\r\nthereby expanding the systematic study of public opinion and war to include the most\r\nsignificant international conflict in American history. The principal investigators also\r\nuse the opinion data on domestic policy as a resource for examining the relationship\r\nbetween the mass public and both the programmatic accomplishments and limitations of\r\nthe New Deal.\r\nBroader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity\r\nThis project makes available to the social science research community a trove\r\nof public opinion data that has largely been ignored in the past. The principal\r\ninvestigators  compile and produce readily usable computer files for roughly 450\r\nopinion polls undertaken in the United States from 1935 to 1945. These files are\r\navailable through the Roper Center in Storrs, CT. However these data are almost\r\nimpossible to use in their existing condition. The principal investigators  recode the\r\nindividual files, prepare documentation, and make available a series of weights to\r\nmitigate the biases resulting from quota-control sampling. The investigators  also\r\ncompile the individual polls into a series of cumulative datasets. These efforts make\r\nthe data more easily accessible to the larger social science research community.\r\nThe project also promises to expand the field of political behavior by promoting\r\nthe study of historical public opinion. It  provides to the community of scholars a\r\nwealth of individual-level opinion data in the pre-1950 era, allowing researchers to gain\r\nnew insights into an array of substantively important topics, such as changes in\r\nAmericans' racial attitudes and public support for the early American welfare state.\r\n\r\n",
