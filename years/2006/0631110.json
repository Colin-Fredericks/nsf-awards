 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is supporting a new cohort of Meyerhoff scholars who have demonstrated financial need and are majoring in programs offered by the College of Natural and Mathematical Sciences (CNMS) - comprised of the departments of Biology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics/Statistics, and Physics. The project is seeking to retain 90% of these students in CNMS majors into the junior year. Furthermore, the project expects each scholar to complete at least one summer of significant research activity by the beginning of the junior year, with at least 70% of these students entering graduate or professional school at the time of their graduation. The merit of the project rests on its grounding in the almost two decades old Meyerhoff Program at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC). Outcomes and process evaluation and research are being conducted by the original evaluation team for the Meyerhoff Program. The project's broader impacts are being felt through the significant increase in the number of underrepresented minority science and math Ph.D. candidates that is expected. The strong track record of the Meyerhoff Program supports this ambitious goal.",
