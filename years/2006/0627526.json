 "awd_abstract_narration": "CT-ISG: Cryptographic Foundations for Next-Generation Security\r\nApplications\r\n\r\nBoaz Barak\r\n\r\nThis project tackles some of the foundational challenges to the\r\nadvent of the networked society and pervasive databases pose to\r\ncryptography. Specifically, it studies the existence of\r\ncryptographic protocols that allow mutually distrusting parties to\r\nachieve a common goal with a minimal sacrifice in privacy. This\r\nincludes as a special case protocols for electronic elections, electronic\r\nauctions, privacy-preserving data mining and many more applications.\r\n\r\nA central issue in such protocols is the effect on security of executing\r\nmultiples instances of one or several protocols over a network.\r\nIt is known that in some cases such interaction can lead to subtle\r\nbut fatal security flaws, and so constructing protocols whose security\r\nis robust with respect to such interactions\r\nis a central question in this cryptography. This project uses\r\nrecent and new ideas and techniques to attack this problem.\r\n\r\nMore concretely, the research involves\r\nstudying the tradeoff between trust and interaction.\r\nThere are known protocols with robust security assuming the existence\r\nof completely trusted third parties. This project focuses on reducing the\r\nassumption of a trusted party, and aims to discover to what extent\r\nthis can be done without compromising security. The goal is to get both\r\npositive results- protocols obtaining robust security under weaker trust\r\nassumptions than was previously known, and negative results- showing\r\nthat certain security goals are impossible to achieve without some\r\ntrust assumptions. This will allow the users of secure applications\r\nto know what is and is not achievable in terms of trust and security.\r\n\r\nThis project also tackles the main sources of inefficiency in current\r\nconstructions of robustly secure protocol, in order to find out to what extent\r\nthe current efficiency bottlenecks in such constructions are inherent.\r\n",
