 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation requires services for on site operation, maintenance and calibration of a spectroradiometer located in Barrow, Alaska.  The instrument is part of the NSF's UV Monitoring Network, which provides data to researchers studying the effects of ozone depletion on terrestrial and marine biological systems.  The UV network is operated by Biospherical Instruments, Inc. (BSI), which designs and manufactures the spectroradiometers.  This Interagency Services Agreement is for the acquisition of services to ensure that continuous, uninterrupted, and quality measurements of UV parameters are obtained in the Alaskan Arctic region.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has historically provided assistance with the instrument at no charge but, is no longer able to continue the service on the recommended schedule required by BSI for optimum measurement performance.   In order to ensure uninterrupted and good quality measurements of UV in the Arctic, personnel at the Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric and Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program site in Barrow, Alaska have agreed to provide the necessary services.\r\n\r\n",
