Bourque\r\nUniversity of Southern California\r\n\r\n\t\r\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has funded a number of Centers of Excellence located throughout the United States. As part of the DHS-funded National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), UCLA is conducting a National Household Survey on Disaster Experiences and Preparedness. The original DHS award supports the development and administration of a telephone survey with a national sample of 1,500 selected by random digit dialing.  This sample is too small to make estimates about subgroups, whether these groups are defined by residential location or race/ethnicity.  This project provides support to enlarge the sample (increase by 1100 respondents) to obtain better estimates of subgroups and thus enhance the ability to make subgroup comparisons. The increased support will enable the PI to sample sufficiently to obtain more stable estimates of underrepresented groups within and across both strata, and for enhanced inter-group comparisons.  Specifically, this and additional support for other sources will allow the PIs to increase the sample to 3,300, with an over-sample of 1000 in the three high visibility cities and a sample of 2300 throughout the rest of the continental US.  The high visibility cities is comprised of New York City (Bronx, Kings, New York, Queens, Staten Island), the Washington, DC area (DC, Arlington County, Fairfax County, Prince William County, Loudoun County, Montgomery County, Prince George's County) and Los Angeles County.\r\n \r\nThe survey will be completed using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) over a 6-month period in English or Spanish at the request of the respondent.  Households are selected using random digit dialing, and phone numbers are pre-stratified into two strata.   The survey will collect baseline data on prevention, response, recovery and risk communication and will enable the comparison of the public's knowledge and preparation for terrorism with that for natural disasters.  More broadly, study findings will allow future researchers and policy makers to better design terrorism and other disaster preparedness messages and associated intervention.\r\n \r\n",
