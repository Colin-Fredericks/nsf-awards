 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among emerging functional nanomaterials, magnetic nanostructures have carved an important niche in multitude of novel phenomena and diverse applications. The proposed joint project for the Materials World Network, between Northwestern University and the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IITB), focuses on hitherto underrepresented considerations of shape anisotropy and compositional domain of magnetic nanostructures, and their influence on critical phenomena such as proton relaxation in MRI, affinity for cellular transfection and RF heating characteristics. The focus of the research is on synthesis and characterization of anisotropic and complex multicomponent magnetic nanostructures. Here, anisotropy implies magnetic nanostructures with morphological and shape diversity with sharp physical features  such as nano-rods, nano-triangles and nano-dendrites, compared to the equiaxed spherical counterparts. The role of anisotropy in nanostructures has recently assumed significant importance, leading to exciting prospects in photonic, phasmonic and related electromagnetic wave propagation. In addition, the portfolio of magnetic nanostructures has been rather limited, with magnetic iron oxides and bare metal/alloys systems being the majority focus in the past. The proposed work will extend the nanomagnetic portfolio to anisotropic morphologies, multicomponent oxides, and protected core (metal/alloy)-shell (oxide) duplex structures. The combination of novel synthesis, extensive characterization with electron and light microscopies, magnetic resonance, in-situ synchrotron radiation, and cellular transfection will help unravel fundamental aspects of colloidal suspension, surface functionalization and role of shape/size anisotropy in magnetic nanostructures applications. This has considerable implications for MRI imaging, biotechnology, magnetic sensors and related fields. \r\n\tThe proposed work straddles at the interface of physical sciences, engineering and biology, all enabled by innovative materials research. It will make extensive use of and help define proper role of advanced internet and web-based interactive portals for international collaborative research. The high bandwidth Internet-2 backbone at Northwestern and equally impressive communication facilities at IITB, will be utilized to provide real-time access to imaging and data acquisition. Over and above the obvious exchange of students and senior PIs, each partner will engage in development of demonstrative module based on magnetic colloids for UG classes, high-school groups and local science museums. The project will incorporate research advances in short-course on magnetic nanostructures, being offered at the ASME-NU nano bootcamp. The project will showcase advanced materials research in all our recruiting efforts, including active participation in REU and MIN programs. \r\n\tThis award is being co-funded by the Sout Asia program of the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE), and by the Ceramics (CER) program in DMR\r\n\r\n",
