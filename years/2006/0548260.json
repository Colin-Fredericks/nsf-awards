 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator (PI) proposes to develop a science program that integrated the ground based instrumentation and observing facilities of San Fernando Observatory (SFO) with those of National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) and the Solar-B spacecraft (to be deployed in 2006). This program would be integrated into the curriculum of the California State University-Northridge (CSUN) Department of Physics and Astronomy to spur interest in experimental astronomy among undergraduate and graduate students. The proposer also plans to make multi-height magnetic field measurements of emerging sunspots, as well as near-simultaneous deep photospheric and chromospheric magnetic field observations of solar active regions, with Solar-B, the refurbished SFO spectroheliograph, and similar instruments at NAOJ. The ground based, high sensitivity near-infrared (NIR) measurements at SFO and NAOJ would complement the higher spatial resolution observations of Solar-B. As a part of longer-term program, the PI intends to collaborate with the NSF's Advanced Technology Solar Telescope project upon its completion. \r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses the problem of diminishing manpower in the fields of experimental solar physics and astronomy by exposing undergraduate students to state-of-the-art observational solar physics near the beginning of their careers, motivating their further academic pursuits. The international collaboration would also contribute to the development of a long-term curriculum for experimental astronomy. This effort will play a vital role in enhancing astronomical education in the United States while furthering our understanding of fundamental problems in solar physics, from coronal heating to space-weather prediction. This project will lay a robust foundation for research and education in the field of experimental astronomy while engaging undergraduate and graduate students in active research.",
