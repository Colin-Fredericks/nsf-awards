 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for the effort to understand the formation mechanism of highly aligned textures on the inner surface of semi-permeable axonal guidance hollow fiber membranes (HFMs) using a wet phase inversion process. Such an understanding is critical in developing reproducible and highly effective scaffolds for tissue regeneration. The objectives of this research are to model the HFM groove formation mechanism during the wet phase inversion process and establish a sensitivity relationship between the fabricated groove geometry and axonal outgrowth rate. Key research activities will include designing and building an experimental phase inversion apparatus with full sensing and controlling capability, understanding the groove formation mechanism, modeling the fabricated HFM macrogeometry and microgeometry, verifying the modeling approaches for groove formation, and testing the sensitivity of groove geometry on axonal outgrowth via a dorsal root ganglion explant regeneration assay.\r\nThis study is expected to generate knowledge on physical reasoning in modeling HFM inner surface groove formation, sensitivity of HFM macroscopic and microscopic geometries on axonal outgrowth effectiveness, and a better design for a sensor integrated apparatus for phase inversion based HFM fabrication. This research will be a pioneering attempt to understand, model, and fabricate highly aligned grooves on the inner surface of HFMs. This study will improve the axonal outgrowth for clinical applications, stimulate scientific understanding of biomanufacturing research, promote teaching and training in biomanufacturing, broaden participation of underrepresented groups, and enhance the infrastructure for biomanufacturing research and education at Clemson University with a detailed outreach to the whole nation.\r\n",
