 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a planning effort for the Upper Green River Biological Preserve at Western Kentucky University (WKU).  The effort will develop a Master Plan for the management of lands at the preserve and the establishment and management of a biological station on the site.  As part of the effort, visits will be exchanged between directors of the Preserve and successful field stations to gain advice and information\r\nTwo workshops will be conducted; the first will focus on development of a common vision for the preserve and of a set of priorities for research, conservation, and education.  Expected participants will include a broad spectrum of the science and education community.  The second workshop will focus on facilities design and planning for management and resources to support the priorities developed during the first workshop.  Participants will include a number of those who participated in the first workshop,  a landscape designer, an architect, a bioengineer, and University master planners and facilities planning personnel.  A professional facilitator will be used for both workshops to insure that the meetings are as productive, open, and useful as possible.  Following the workshops, a Master Plan will be finalized and action begun for its implementation. \r\n\r\nThe Green River watershed includes one of the best-developed karst systems on earth, and provides a home to numerous endangered species.  The station is located about 2 miles upriver from Mammoth Cave National Park.  Western Kentucky University is the lead partner in monitoring the ecological impacts of the Green River Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, an ambitious restoration program that will provide numerous opportunities for experimental and observational research.   Thus, the station will enable research on habitat restoration at the watershed scale, as well as other field-based research and educational activities for which current facilities are inadequate.",
