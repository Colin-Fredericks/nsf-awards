 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators in this group propose to work on outstanding questions in physics. What is the Nature of the Universe and what is it made of? What are matter, energy, space and time? How did we get here and where are we going? from the theoretical standpoint. Theoretically, string theory has undergone major developments in the last several years in techniques as well as emerging cosmological applications. Many new possibilities of physics beyond the standard model that were not considered in the past have recently emerged. Connection between particle physics and physics underground or in space is becoming stronger than ever.. This proposal attempts to address these major questions from many possible directions Specifically, the PIs propose to take the following approach. Ganor proposes to do research in M-theory, string theory, supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories, field theories in higher dimensions,and to search for possible tests of string theory and M-theory in cosmology. Gaillard studies effective supergravity theories at the quantum level, with an emphasis one those derived from the weakly coupled heterotic string. She will explore the implications for collider physics and cosmology of these theories. Hall plans to study issues of electroweak symmetry breaking, and connections between particle physics and cosmology, such as how inflation and dark energy can be incorporated into fundamental theories that connect to scales of unification and to neutrino masses. Murayama proposes to study physics behind the electroweak symmetry breaking, underground physics such as neutrino physics and proton decay, dark matter and cosmology, and dynamics of field theory. Zumino studies various aspects of noncommutative quantum field theories and (super)string theories and tries to go beyond the known mathematical techniques to develop a deformation quantization of differential forms (for gauge theories) and a functional super-star product for (super)string field theory. The broader impact is that the PIs provide training to students and postdocs who become the next generation of scientists of the nation as well as the world. Diversity is promoted through interactions with two female PIs The group works with QuarkNet teachers to bring the excitement of forefront research to high-school students through lectures as well as making themselves available as resources. \r\n\r\n",
