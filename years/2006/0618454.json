 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past decade, robotic systems have moved from stand-alone units to more complicated\r\nsystems that exhibit certain capabilities of interactions with human beings and/or\r\nenvironments. This development coupling with the recent re-organization of the Information\r\nand Intelligent Systems Division (IIS) of the National Science Foundation (NSF) into a\r\ncluster-research environment has prompted the necessity of organizing this workshop to\r\ndiscuss and explore the future research trends of robotics in a cluster-research environment.\r\nSpecifically, the proposed workshop aims to address this problem with top-down and bottomup\r\napproaches:\r\nA) Top-down approach: Given that the IIS/Robotics program will be clustered with other\r\nIIS programs into cluster-research on Robust Intelligence, what are the potential\r\ninnovative research areas that robotics researchers should look into so that future\r\nrobotic systems will exhibit better mobility, intelligence, adaptation, and autonomy?\r\nB) Bottom-up approach: Given that many robotics researchers have their individual\r\nresearch areas that do not fit into this cluster-research Robust Intelligence theme, what\r\nshould these researchers explore in order to propose more pertinent projects for future\r\nIIS competitions?\r\nIntellectual Merits. This workshop will bring together researchers in the robotics\r\ncommunity, including the principal investigators (PIs) currently supported by the NSF/IIS, to\r\nexplore innovative robotics research areas in this cluster-research Robust Intelligence theme.\r\nResearchers will explore the benefits of synergistic integration of robotics, computer vision,\r\nartificial intelligence, and other appropriate technical areas into future robotic systems to\r\nachieve intelligence and flexibility in reaction to dynamic and changing environments.\r\nBroader Impacts. The workshop will have significant and broader impacts on the robotics\r\ncommunity. Through the workshop, researchers will broaden their views of future research\r\nfor advancing Robust Intelligence in general, and robotic science and technologies in\r\nparticular. Traditional single-PI-focused research areas such as dynamics, kinematics,\r\ncontrol, motion planning, actuators, etc. will give way to a cluster of technologies in\r\nperception and cognition, and learning and intelligence. Equipped with this new vision,\r\nresearchers will have better ideas in proposing innovative robotics research to investigate\r\nmethodologies and technologies that will provide answers to design and develop future\r\nrobotic systems that exhibit better autonomy, mobility, and intelligence.",
