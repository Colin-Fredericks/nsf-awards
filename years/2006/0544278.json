 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Neutrinos are the least understood of the fundamental particles. While similar to electrons, they interact very weakly with other particles. Thus, little is known about how neutrinos interact with matter. Contrary to earlier expectations, recent experiments have shown that neutrinos have a small but finite mass. The research enabled by this CAREER award will explore how the origin and consequences of neutrino mass may be probed using (1) man-made beams of neutrinos incident at a detector after passing thousands of kilometers through the earth, (2) neutrinos from galactic supernovae, and (3) collisions of high-energy protons in collider experiments. Another aspect of the research program is to study the interactions of ultra high-energy cosmic neutrinos in the hope that new phenomena at energies inaccessible at particle colliders may be discovered. The latter will utilize the extensive data expected from cosmic ray experiments and neutrino telescopes. The overall research program includes the phenomenological analyses of data, the design of future experiments and the assessment of their potential, and the formulation of theoretical neutrino mass models and their tests. \r\n\r\nThe impact of this work arises from the synergy between particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology related to neutrinos. The goal of the research is to improve the current understanding of the neutrino sector of the Standard Model of particle physics with a point of view that may shed light on the unification of forces, the physics applicable when the Big Bang occurred and the role of neutrinos in the evolution of the Universe. The interdisciplinary nature of the projects is bound to engender new avenues of research and will foster collaborations between researchers in diverse fields. The students participating in this research will gain valuable expertise beyond their primary area of research. The local QuarkNet Center will be used to introduce teachers to the frontiers of physics and engage them in discussions about the elements of a scientifically sound theory. The visitor program will serve as a vehicle to integrate diversity into the research enterprise.\" \r\n\r\n",
