  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) works with member organizations to address complex research problems in logistics and distribution. The mission of CELDi is to enable member organizations to achieve logistics and distribution excellence by developing meaningful, innovative, and implementable solutions that provide a significant return on investment.  Research in logistics and distribution is typically sponsored by an \"operations\" unit of a member organization so our laboratory is most often their facility and \"success\" of a research project is only achieved if the results are implemented and provide measurable value.  The NSF also supports more fundamental research associated with I/UCRC\u00c6s on a competitive basis.  As such, the Clemson Research Site of CELDi operates using three types of research projects.\n\nDirected projects\nDirected projects utilize a team of at least one faculty member with one or more graduates students to address a logistics problem of high importance to the industry member of CELDi.  Each project provides financial support for the student or students as well as engages them in an environment where deliverables are required, deadlines must be met, and informative briefings to upper management are demanded.\n\nCenter Designated Projects (CPD)\nSome funding from each membership fee is pooled to fund CDP\u00c6s which take either the research findings from a directed project or a research theme running through several directed projects and explores it in a more general and comprehensive way.  The results are typically both a report and software that can be readily used by all CELDi members with little modification.  Clemson researchers participated in three CDP\u00c6s.\n\nFundamental Research Projects (FRP)\nNSF provides competitive funding for basic research on ideas that are spawned from the research conducted within I/UCRC\u00c6s.  Researchers at Clemson have participated on two of these projects.\n\nThe intellectual merit of CELDi projects lies in conducting research that is implemented to satisfy members\u00c6 needs with return on investment and that is generalized for dissemination into the academic sphere.  All of the Directed Projects at Clemson have been rated very highly by sponsors on short surveys conducted after completion.  Clemson has also won three \"CELDi Success Story Awards\" which the Center awards to projects that \"have significant, verifiable impact on the partnering organization(s).\"  Clemson researchers have published over 30 manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings that are based on or motivated by the three types of CELDi projects.\n\nThe broader impacts of CELDi are also measured in several ways.  The model for conducting applied research that focuses on operational issues in a way that satisfies the sponsor and that is academically relevant scholarship is important.  The number of peer-reviewed articles has been reported.  Transfer of research results occurs at the biannual CELDi meetings in which all members can view posters and talk to researchers about the work being undertaken in the Center as well as through the final research reports.  By facilitating this interaction every six months, CELDi delivers applied research results to a significant audience of practitioners who actively use it in a very timely fashion.\n\nCELDi has a significant impact on the student researchers to better prepare them for careers in industry and academia.  Obviously, working closely with faculty mentors all of whom have been employed full time in industry at some point in their careers teaches important skills related to time management, meeting deadlines, developing and presenting briefings for upper management, and handling a variety of situations with clients.  In addition, the Center supplements these by facilitating interactions with the industrial advisory board (IAB) during the biannual meetings.  Specifically, there are one-on-o..."
