 "awd_abstract_narration": "Julie Yu, Exploratorium Teacher Institute, is a Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellow for the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 academic years.  Yu's work will use informal science education research to develop chemistry materials for the Exploratorium Teacher Institute.  These curricular materials and teacher enrichment workshops will integrate current areas of academic research and will be offered to 6-12th grade teachers that serve a diverse urban student pool.  \r\n\r\nThis Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.",
