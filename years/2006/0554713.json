Ricardo Baeza-Yates, University of Chile, Oscar Pino, Catholic University of Bolivia, and Routo Terada, University of Sao Paulo, are organizing a workshop on computer security to be held in Arica, Chile on August 14-18, 2006.  Their goal is to gather researchers from Latin America and the United States to address the problem of computer and information security.  In this electronic age, there are increased threats that impact all aspects of society.  Topics will include cryptographic methods, web security, and complexity in security.  Participants to the workshops will include researchers from neighboring institutions in the U.S. and Latin America, with a special focus on including participants from U.S. Minority Serving Institutions.\r\n\r\nThis conference will work to advance discovery in this area by bringing together researchers new to the field, as well as security veterans who will look at problems not directly related to their own research as well, given the diversity of topics proposed for discussion.\r\n",
