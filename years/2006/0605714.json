 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical models based on partial differential equations, the calculus\r\nof variations, and associated numerical techniques have had great success\r\nin image processing, especially in segmentation and denoising problems.\r\nThis project will extend some of the most successful of these models, such\r\nas total variation based image denoising, to curve and surface denoising\r\ntasks that are of fundamental importance in computer vision and computer\r\ngraphics applications. Accordingly, a central theme of this project is to\r\nfind novel and natural ways to generalize models originally designed for\r\nprocessing images to processing curves and surfaces. This leads to\r\ncurvature dependent functionals that need to be minimized over geometric\r\nobjects. The project will draw on a variety of numerical techniques, such\r\nas the level set method, to develop algorithms for the solution of these\r\nchallenging computational problems. It will also develop new variational\r\nimage denoising and segmentation models that are more effective than\r\ncurrent ones in multiscale decomposition of images.\r\n\r\nThe problems addressed by this project form a crucial step in diverse\r\napplications of image processing, computer vision, and computer graphics.\r\nIn particular, surface denoising is a preliminary first step in many\r\nautomatic detection and recognition tasks that involve three dimensional\r\nshapes, such as face recognition and target identification. It is also an\r\nessential component of algorithms that fit surfaces to volumetric data,\r\nwhich is needed in many medical imaging applications. \r\n",
