 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds upon a current CSEMS project, the Galileo Scholars Initiative, which started in 2002 and concentrates on computer science and technical subjects.  This project's more inclusive criteria for eligible disciplines is helping to expand the scope of current efforts to include more students and a more diverse learning community of students, thus responding more completely to the current and projected workforce needs of the burgeoning Life Sciences industry in central New Jersey. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this initiative is reflected in the increased enrollment, retention and success in STEM degree programs of financially needy, academically talented students. Students are benefiting from mentoring provided by college faculty and individuals from industry, cohort-building activities enhanced by an online support system, and opportunities for internships. This effort is supplemented by funds provided by industry partners and individuals through the RVCC Foundation. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed collaborative project are the partnerships that are being forged between the college's administration and staff with area high school students and staff, industry partners and the community itself. Through project dissemination activities, the results of these efforts are being widely shared among the higher education community of New Jersey and beyond.\r\n",
