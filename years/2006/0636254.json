This information coupled with a growing understanding of selective ion movement and its dynamic impact on wall charge is of intellectual interest to academic and industrial microdevice researchers. Preliminary results by the PI show pH changes significantly in 2 mL sample wells containing electrodes. The next step is to directly measure any pH gradient contours within the channels of the microdevice. A straight, fused silica capillary microdevice is an ideal system with which to further understand how ions selectively move axially down the length of the capillary as well as radially either toward or away from the capillary walls. This work will compare direct measurement data to theoretical predictions and develop modifications to models if necessary. This project will promote the intellectual development of a graduate and an undergraduate student.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n \r\nThe proposed research would enable determination of pH and other ion gradients within microdevices with the broad impact of developing a tool for the screening of microdevices for various applications. This technology could also bring isoelectric focusing techniques to the scale of nanoliters of fluid. The educational and professional development of graduate and undergraduate students will continue during the duration of this one-year project. Successful research and educational techniques will be broadly disseminated to the academic, and microtechnological communities.",
