 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an integrated educational and scientific program to develop advanced analysis tools for the auroral zone and polar cap deployments of the Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR), and to apply these tools to the study of auroral electrodynamics. The project has three science objectives: 1) to use ground-based radar and optical measurements to estimate the time-dependent energy spectrum of auroral electrons; 2) to quantify the relative drift between auroral forms and background plasma; 3) to resolve and interpret small scale variability in ionospheric state parameters near auroral boundaries. These objectives were chosen to exploit natural synergies between areas of emphasis in the Boston University (BU) electrical engineering curriculum, and physical problems of interest to the broader science community. Item 1 will expand on inversion strategies using optical estimates of energy flux to constrain the inversion procedure. Item 2 will combine the electronic steering capabilities of AMISR with the application of robust optical flow estimation to auroral imagery. The goal is to produce maps of the relative motion between auroral arcs and the background plasma. This involved analytical process will lead to new insight about the electrical decoupling between the magnetosphere and ionosphere. Item 3 involves increasing the resolution of arc boundary measurements by exploiting the element phasing capabilities and software radar approach of AMISR. The project also has three concrete educational objectives: 1) to institutionalize graduate-level incoherent scatter radar (ISR) education at Boston University; 2) to integrate basic ionospheric physics and remote sensing into the undergraduate electrical engineering curriculum; 3) to produce at least one ISR-related Ph.D dissertation. Item 1 will be achieved through the development of an ISR module as part of the PI's graduate course in radar remotes sensing. Basic ionospheric concepts and ionospheric remote sensing techniques will, similarly, be incorporated into the PI's undergraduate electromagnetics course (Item 2). The budget includes full-time funding for a graduate student, whose dissertation will grow directly from this project (Item 3). The educational objectives of this proposal will be pursued in collaboration with staff of the Millstone Hill Observatory. By incorporating ISR education into the standard undergraduate and graduate EE curriculum at BU, educational and public outreach results are intrinsically included in this effort. The graduate student funding will promote an underrepresented minority group.",
