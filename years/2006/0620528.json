 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses on the development of an innovative diffusion barrier for the preparation of Pd thin film on tubular porous stainless steel substrate. A thin Pd film supported on tubular porous SS substrate provides a commercially viable avenue for the use of palladium membranes for hydrogen production/recovery, particularly for large-scale applications.  During Phase II the diffusion barrier will be developed to a commercial scale membrane unit for performing field tests. Pd membranes due to their excellent hydrogen permeability and selectivity can streamline existing hydrogen separation and purification processes dramatically for fuel cell and hydrogen separation applications. \r\n\r\nThe projected worldwide market size when fully matured is in the range of $1 billion/yr. Refineries' demand for hydrogen is expected to post annual growth in excess of 10% as refiners use more hydrogen to meet clean fuel regulations. A Pd-base hydrogen selective membrane suitable for large scale operations will play a major role in meeting this demand, particularly for the retrofit market, such as hydrogen recovery from waste refinery streams, as an add-on stage for existing steam reformer for incremental capacity, etc. In summary the proposed diffusion barrier could offer a practically viable Pd-based hydrogen separation device, which can benefit fuel cell and industrial hydrogen applications, and greenhouse gas reduction.  \r\n",
