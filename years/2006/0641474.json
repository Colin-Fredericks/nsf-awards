 "awd_abstract_narration": "OISE 0641474\r\nEvans\r\n\r\nThis international workshop has several integrated components that involve focused discussion sessions and site visits to academic institutions and industrial laboratories in Finland and Sweden where senior and junior U.S. researchers will meet first with counterparts in Helsinki, then in Uppsala, to examine the likely impacts of mobile wireless technology on the Internet's future architecture.   The intent is to collaboratively identify trends and technological innovations that offer potential solutions to rapidly evolving requirements for scale, mobility, and physical communication.  The goal of U.S. organizer, Joseph Evans from the University of Kansas, and his counterparts, Kari Markus of the Finnish National Technology Agency and Per Gunningberg at Uppsala University, is to foster long-term collaboration between members of the international research communities who are currently identified with mobile and wireless technology and with network architecture.  Workshop results should help define an agenda for study of fundamental concepts and techniques for future Internet architectures.  If successful, this could lead to international consensus on wireless networking architectural options while strengthening cooperation between academic and industrial researchers.  \r\n\r\nThese international cooperation activities fulfill the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Scandinavia to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.   Broader impacts include new educational insights arising from the interactions as well as the introduction of participating U.S. junior faculty and researchers to leaders in cellular networking from the Nordic wireless technology community.",
