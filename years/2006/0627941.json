 "awd_abstract_narration": "Monitoring Seasons Through Global Learning Communities (MSTGLC)\r\n\r\nThis University of Alaska Fairbanks award for the Monitoring Seasons Through Global Learning Communities (MSTGLC) project is a collaboration between the International Arctic Research Center (IARC) and the NASA Landsat Data Continuity (LDCM) and Terra Satellite Missions.  Through interactions with scientists working on these research projects and inquiry- and project-based investigations of their own, elementary and secondary students are using existing and new GLOBE protocols to monitor seasonal environmental changes that occur and increase their understanding of the Earth system.  Participating schools are being organized by biomes into eight regionally based Global Learning Communities (GLCs): Tundra, Taiga, Deciduous Forest, Grasslands, Rainforest, Desert, Shrub Land, and Savannah.  Students monitor their own biomes' seasons through regional based field campaigns, gaining new insights into the connections between climate variations and vegetation phenology.  Comparison of regional observations through an international phenology network established with this award reinforces student understanding of the causal relationships between abiotic and biotic components of the Earth system.  Existing GLOBE environmental monitoring protocols, including soil temperature, soil moisture, precipitation and phenology, are being adapted to be more biome specific. New freshwater ice and mosquito protocols for the Arctic and Tropical regions, respectively, will also be created during this award.  The project is initially focused on the Tundra and Taiga biomes because phonological changes are more pronounced in these regions.  In each subsequent year, two additional GLCs will be targeted, with organized field campaigns in these regions.  During field campaigns, students make daily measurements of cloud cover, air and soil temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture, using standardized GLOBE procedures.  In addition, seasonal, biome-specific vegetation phenology measurements will be taken using adapted GLOBE protocols and in situ ice (Tundra and Taiga) or mosquito (Rainforest) observations will be collected.  Throughout the year, students and teachers interact with project staff and partner scientists through web chats, audio conferences, and face-to-face training.  One international professional development workshop for teachers will be offered during each year of the project, at a location that corresponds to that year's targeted GLC.  During the workshops, standard-based content key concepts and skills in Earth system science and technology will be taught.  An annual Earth systems symposium will allow students to share the results of their investigations with other students and scientists.  As part of this project, students in Polar Regions will participate in the International Polar Year (IPY) through student-led field campaigns and web chats with IPY scientists.  In situ ice, mosquito, and vegetation measurements by students will provide more extensive ground validation for remotely sensed data collected by the satellite missions.  \r\n",
