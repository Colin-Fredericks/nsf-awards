 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support to enable the collaboration between scientists and students at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) in Pune, India and scientists and students at Washington State University (WSU) and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) on data analysis for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). The particular focus will be to develop tools and methods to search for a background of gravitational waves that might arise from the superposition of many astronomical gravitational wave sources that are too weak to detect individually. During their visits to the US, the IUCAA scientists (two faculty members and a graduate student) will provide tutorials to their US counterparts on relevant detection methods used for the cosmic microwave background and radio astronomy. In turn, the US students and faculty will train the IUCAA group in signal simulation techniques. This exchange of information will enable each group to maximize its effectiveness in the project at their respective home institutions while continuing the collaboration via internet telephony. While in the US, the IUCAA group will increase their visibility within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration by attending collaboration meetings. This award is supported by the Division of Physics and the Office of International Science and Engineering.",
