 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:  In this project, the investigators will examine existing \r\nindices for representing the results of regression analyses for meta-analysis, \r\nand will develop new methods for synthesizing results from regression analyses.  \r\nCurrently, meta-analytic studies often omit regression results due to the \r\ndifficulty in comparing results across different models.  The investigators will \r\nconsider the appropriate standard errors for these study indices, which are \r\nfundamental to most combinations of study results. In addition, they will \r\ndetermine whether existing indices can be used to represent results of related \r\nanalyses such as structural equation models and hierarchical linear models \r\n(HLMs), and will propose new indices if needed. \r\n \r\nSeveral special cases will be considered in the research. In particular, results \r\nmeant to represent group differences (i.e., slopes for dummy variables) will be \r\nconsidered, including cases where regression models contain several dummy \r\nvariables to represent factors with multiple levels (e.g., two treatment groups \r\nand a common control group). Because meta-analysts also often wish to summarize \r\nacross studies with different designs (e.g., HLM studies with regression \r\nstudies), the proposed research will outline the conditions under which such \r\ncross-design combinations are reasonable.\r\n \r\nBroader Impact:  This study will have broad impacts on syntheses of research in \r\nmathematics and science education, and in many other areas (e.g., economics, \r\npolitical science) where regression models and other forms of the linear model \r\nare common. The methods provided by this research will enable reviewers to \r\ninclude regression results in meta-analyses together with simpler indices (e.g., \r\ncorrelations, standardized mean differences).  Special attention will be paid to \r\nsynthesis work where subpopulation comparisons (such as within and across \r\nunderserved group differences) are particularly important.\r\n",
