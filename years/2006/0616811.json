 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Cynthia K. Larive of the University of California, Riverside is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to work on the development of capillary isotachophoresis- Nuclear magnetic resonance (cITP-NMR) methodology, and to apply this concentration, separation, and dual detection analytical tool for the analysis and structural determination of mass limited samples and heparin oligosaccarides.   Analyte bands will be detected by conductivity, and the bands will be focused in the NMR microcoil probe to permit signal averaging and 2D NMR experiments. \r\n\r\nDetection and structure determination of low-level impurities is a critical component of drug development and discovery, and the use of cITP-NMR will appreciably reduce the mass of isolated oligosaccharides and other chemicals and biochemicals required for NMR analysis. This research will advance the instrumentation for on-line cITP-NMR and will impact analytical chemistry, biochemistry and the pharmaceutical industry.  In addition, this project will educate students, including undergraduates and members of underrepresented groups in state of the art analytical instrumentation and methodology.  \r\n",
