 "awd_abstract_narration": "The underlying assumption behind currently available sparse direct\r\nsolvers, namely that an individual solve in isolation should take\r\nminimal time, does not represent an optimal solution in the setting of\r\nan adaptive finite element method.  There, intermediate results, in\r\nthe form of a factorization, from the solution of a current refinement\r\ncan be updated when a local refinement occurs.  Two innovations\r\nunderlie the project: an interface that allows applications to pass\r\ninformation about refinement to the direct solver library and a data\r\nstructure, the Unassembled HyperMatrix, that allows sparse matrices\r\nand their factorization to be stored in an unassembled format that\r\nfacilitates the updating of the matrix and its factorization.  In\r\nother words, this research is based on the ideas of inheriting the\r\nelimination tree from the refinement history of the domain and storing\r\nelement matrices unassembled on all levels, assembling them only when\r\nnecessary for the factorization. Since the resulting solver functions\r\nfully in terms of element matrices, dense submatrices are naturally\r\nexposed as part of the factorization which will allow high-performance\r\nkernels like the level-3 BLAS to be fully exploited.\r\nThe focus of the research includes the design of an API that optimally integrates the\r\nsolver into applications, the development of the Unassembled\r\nHyperMatrix infrastructure, and an investigation of stability and\r\ncomplexity, in particular the design of pivoting strategies for the\r\nindefinite case.\r\n\r\n\r\nComputational simulation has joined the two traditional methods in\r\nscience, theory and experiment, as an equal partner.  For many\r\napplications, ranging from the similation of vibration in an\r\nautomobile to the computation of the radar signature an airplane on\r\nradar, finite element methods are the computational method of choice.\r\nThe best of these methods use adaptive approximations to balance\r\naccuracy against the time required for the solution.  Invariably, most\r\ntime is spent in the solution of a system of linear equations.  It is\r\nthe reduction of this solution time, in the specific setting of an\r\nadaptive application, that is the focus of this\r\nresearch.  The innovation that is the basis of this project consists\r\nin storing the linear system in a new format, the Unassembled\r\nHyperMatrix, that allows much of a past computation to be reused when\r\nan adaptation occurs.  Hand in hand with this theoretical innovation\r\ngoes the development of an interface that allows an application to\r\nexpress adaptation to the solver library.  The new approach has the\r\npotential for reducing the cost of a solution related to an adaptation\r\nsubstantially.\r\n",
