 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, \"NUE: Nanodevices and NanoEngineering Laboratory at University of Pittsburgh,\" at the University of Pittsburgh, under the direction of Dr. Minhee Yun will  develop a three-credit elective course on integrated nanoscale science and engineering into the second year of the undergraduate curriculum of the School of Engineering that will provide creative opportunities for undergraduate education.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed new integrated course will provide a combination of class lectures, laboratory work, a team project, and web-supported instruction.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The program will serve to train undergraduate students in the design and execution of experiments in nanotechnology of science and engineering.  The proposed course wil provide significant hands-on opportunities for education and reach a broad public audience.  In addition, the NUE project and the existing NSF funded Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program will be designed to build bridges among engineering education and nanoscale research and K-12 education.\r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) Program Solicitation (NSF 06-538), and is being funded by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Electrical and Communications Systems (ECS) and the Division of Engineering Education and Centers.   \r\n\r\n",
