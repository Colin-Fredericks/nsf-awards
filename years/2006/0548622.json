 "awd_abstract_narration": "Enrique Peacock-Lopez of Williams College is supported by a Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to carry out research on a variety of nonlinear dynamics investigations of systems of biological interest. The PI and his group are studying chemical self-replication, including cross catalytic mechanisms and prion self replication. A second goal of the work is to elucidate the mechanism of transport of incompletely spliced mRNAs across the nuclear membrane, which is regulated by HIV-Rev protein.  Peacock-Lopez  is, in addition, supported for work with a collaborator, Professor Manuel Morales of the Williams Biology Department, to develop mathematical models of species competition and coexistence. The award is partially supprted by the Genes and Genome Systems program within the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division.  The work is having a broader impact through the inclusion of undergraduate students in cutting edge research and via an outreach program which brings high school students to the Williams campus for college-level science experiences.",
