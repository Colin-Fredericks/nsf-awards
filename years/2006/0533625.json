The server software, called an SOA, or\r\nService-Oriented Application, is realized as a process and provides\r\nits service through an interface consisting of application methods.  A\r\nclient, either an end client application or another SOA, uses the SOA\r\nservice via remote procedure call to application methods.  Many\r\nmission-critical electronic business application servers fit this\r\nmodel.\r\n\r\nThe recovery model is tiered. The innermost tier consists of shared\r\nmemory (application variables shared by the different threads of the\r\nserver process). The middle tier, called a service domain, consists of\r\ntightly-coupled SOAS.  Optimistic logging is used within the service\r\ndomain.  Optimistic logging does not write log records to disk before\r\nsending messages and is thus low-overhead.  Communication outside the\r\nservice domain uses pessimistic logging, where log records are written\r\nto disk before messages are sent. Special result logging is used to\r\ncommunicate with transactional systems such as DBMSs.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will help provide availability for\r\napplications which use web services. Since many mission-critical\r\nelectronic business application servers fit this model, the greatest\r\nimpact of this research will be in increasing availability for those\r\nservers and hence for the applications which depend on them.  In\r\naddition, the project will be used in training of Computer Science\r\nPh.D. students, currently a national priority.  The code and\r\nmanuscripts for this project will be disseminated via the project web\r\nsite http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/salzberg/soa/\r\n",
