 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of this CAREER Award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Indraneel Ghosh, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona, will carry out fundamental studies related to the synthesis and characterization of new classes of symmetrically branched molecules composed of helical peptide motifs as an organizing element.  The chemical architecture of the self-assembling dendrimer-like molecules will be designed to be modular and flexible allowing for the physiochemical investigation of both multivalent and polyvalent assemblies from the nanometer to micrometer length scales.  These symmetric molecules, while answering fundamental questions in hierarchical self-assembly, will lead to the rational design of multivalent protein complexes and advanced biomaterials. Thus, this work will impact emerging technologies such as multivalent targeting, controlled release, tissue engineering and catalyst supports.\r\n\r\nThe broad research platform will result in the development of necessary research skills and scientific knowledge for graduate students and undergraduate students at the continuously evolving chemistry/biology interface.  Research and education will be further integrated in a summer research program for training and mentoring under-represented high-school students.  Thus, the research and educational goals described in this CAREER proposal will provide for the training of skilled scientists at all educational levels, while providing them with the necessary mentorship to be successful in their future professional careers.\r\n",
