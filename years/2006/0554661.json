 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jaron   0554661   A special symposium, \"Science and Engineering Principles Applied to Control Hyper-communicable Diseases,\" is being convened as a component of the 2006 World Congress of the International Union of Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine, Seoul, Korea, August 27 to September 1, 2006. The symposium will address the growing threat posed by the rapid propagation of highly infectious agents within heavily populated communities and across national boundaries. The meeting will focus on how science and engineering researchers can communicate and collaborate effectively with the biomedical research and health delivery communities to develop effective disease surveillance techniques, rapid and reliable methods to detect and identify pathogens, and early warning systems. The need for a global infrastructure to isolate, treat, and remediate these hyper-communicable diseases will be examined. This symposium is to become an important component of, and is to be integrated with, the major program launched in 2005 by the International Council of Science (ICSU) on \"Science for Health and Well-Being.\" The proceedings of the special symposium is planned for publication and wide dissemination late in 2007, and summary reports are planned for newsletters of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (IFMBE) and the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE).\r\n\r\n",
