Dhagat, Oregon State University\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research aims to develop passive (battery-less) magnetic sensors amenable to wireless interrogation in complex sensor networks. The devices are based on the propagation velocity of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) in a piezoelectric substrate changing due to the resistance of an overlying magnetic film responding to external magnetic fields.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit To accomplish the goals of this proposal the PI plans to design and fabricate sensors based on acousto-electric effect waves (SAW) on a piezoelectric substrate. It is the first example of an integration of a magnetoresistive (MR) film on SAW substrates and the sensor signal manifest as a pulse delay instead of an amplitude change providing better discrimination. The activity will explore selectively programmable identification (ID) type device feature by further integration with antenna and reflectors. This project would help to establish the possibilities of passive and field programmable SAW devices since RF signal energy for thermal writing has not been reported yet. \r\n\r\nBroad Impact: This project opens a new venue for potential applications of passive, wireless devices including current sensing, position sensing, structural health monitoring and, if bio-chemically functionalized, environment monitoring. Further, as they require no battery and their data can be retrieved by a wireless query the sensors may be used in remote and inaccessible locations. The proposed research will be conducted with the assistance of 1 graduate and 1 undergraduate student. The PI is intensely involved in undergraduate students senior projects and by bringing diversity and teaching new courses.\r\n\r\n",
