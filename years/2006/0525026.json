 "awd_abstract_narration": "This exploratory research study will evaluate the feasibility of innovative methodology designed to distinguish between three theories on the dynamics of husband-to-wife violence.  The objectives for this exploratory study are to (1) conduct preliminary testing of cyclic patterns of behavior in abusive relationships and whether the level of daily abuse is associated with predictors reported in the day(s) prior to the abuse, and (2) explore the feasibility of conducting a large-scale longitudinal study of daily husband-to-wife violence and predictors. Women who report having been abused within the past month but do not intend to leave the relationship will be given a cellular phone and asked to confidentially report daily into a telephone recorder on the level of violence, arguments, hassles, distress, marital harmony, life events, and husband's alcohol intake during the previous day for a 2-month period.  Weekly telephone discussions with subjects and an end-of-study interview will assess the women's sense of safety during the study.  \r\n\r\nThis proposal will have considerable broader impact. First, it will advance discovery and understanding through the integration of research and teaching.  The results from this project will be integrated into a domestic violence workshop series for medical students, and psychology graduate students will be involved as research assistants. Second, this study will broaden participation of underrepresented groups.  The research team and consultants include faculty from underrepresented groups, and the study will be performed in a setting that serves underrepresented minorities.  Third, this study will enhance research infrastructure through the development of novel methods and analysis for research, and involve partnership across two academic institutions. Fourth, this study will be broadly disseminated through presentation at national professional meetings and multidisciplinary conferences in ways that will be useful to policymakers and investigators.  Fifth, this line of inquiry could benefit society by permitting partnership development between members of the research team and federal agencies, as well as the sharing of results with organizations developing policy recommendations on domestic violence\r\n",
