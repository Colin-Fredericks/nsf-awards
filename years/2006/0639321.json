 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project teams of undergraduates are undertaking substantive research projects that contain both mathematical and computational aspects. To prepare the students for their research experiences, the PI team at Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) is offering a sequence of educational components. These include both a new course, \"Research in Applied and Computational Mathematics,\" and a special topics course that serves as a \"capstone-like\" experience. Additional activities are also being implemented to develop and then sustain each group of students as a cohort. For example, to enable students to gain a broad perspective of i) contemporary research in computational science and mathematics, and ii) some of the associated methods and tools, the project team is instituting an interdisciplinary seminar in computational mathematics, consisting of expository talks accessible to advanced undergraduate students given by prominent computational scientists from universities, national laboratories, and industry. Through the combination of their research and coursework students gain a deep and broad understanding of a research area in applied and computational mathematics. The project also features a significant partnership between RPI and Howard University that supports two students from Howard to be in residence at RPI annually for a spring term (tuition waived) and summer as part of the undergraduate cohort. Faculty mentors at Howard join with RPI colleagues to oversee the continuation of the research projects in the fall term.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project lies in the mentored participation of undergraduates in a research project. The organization and components of the program provide an environment in which creativity, invention, and scientific communication skills are promoted and developed. The educational and professional experiences of the participants are also enhanced through regular interaction with scientists and engineers, both theoretical and experimental, from other academic, industrial and government laboratory facilities. The broader impacts of the project are found in the partnership with Howard University and the increased diversity of the student cohort. But more importantly the partnership offers the opportunity to nurture longer term collaborations among faculty with similar research interests at both institutions that form the basis for continued undergraduate student research experiences. Additionally, the new courses and seminar series also serve as models that other institutions may adopt or adapt. Such curricular changes provide mentored transitions that increase the number of students interested in, and prepared for, graduate school in mathematics. The project is supported by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the EHR Division of Undergraduate Education.\r\n",
