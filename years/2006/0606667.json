An intricate interaction between the shape, the\r\ncomposition distribution, and pressure enable these membranes to\r\nundergo a variety of composition- and ordering-related phase\r\ntransformations resulting in complex microstructure.  These in\r\nturn affect the function of the membrane.  The experimental study\r\nof the mechanics, phase segregation, and adhesion of bilayer\r\nmembranes is an extremely active and fascinating field.  A number\r\nof theoretical models and studies that consider different aspects\r\nand different approximations are beginning to emerge. This has\r\nset the stage for a systematic mathematical analysis that\r\nexamines the relationship between the different models,\r\nunderstands the status of the various approximations, and yields\r\na mapping of the different parameter and behavioral regimes. \r\nThis mathematical analysis is the aim of this project.  The\r\ninvestigator seeks not only to catalog and reconcile available\r\nexperimental observations but hopes to motivate new experiments\r\nand the discovery of new phenomena by pointing out potentially\r\ninteresting regions.  The project builds on and extends the class\r\nof mathematical problems involving diffusion, phase\r\ntransformation, and pattern formation that has been studied in\r\nflat spaces, motivated by issues in materials science, to a new\r\nclass of problems that involve these phenomena on deformable\r\nmanifolds.  The investigator starts with an energetic formulation\r\nof the single phase membrane and derives limiting theories using\r\nboth formal (matched asymptotic) and rigorous (Gamma convergence)\r\nmethods.  He then considers multi-species membranes and\r\nidentifies circumstances when there is strong phase separation,\r\nstudies nucleation from stability considerations, and derives\r\nsharp interface models.  Evolutionary problems are treated as\r\ngradient flows of appropriate energy.  Finally, he studies the\r\nimplications of this analysis for cell adhesion.\r\n\r\n     Lipid bilayer membranes are ubiquitous in living organisms\r\nas cell walls, mitochondria, golgi apparatus, and numerous other\r\nimportant organelles.  They play a critical role in biology as\r\nthey protect, regulate flow, and host many metabolic functions by\r\nforming a variety of complicated shapes and structures.  This\r\nproject seeks to advance our understanding of the factors that\r\ngovern the shape and composition distribution of these membranes. \r\nIt does so by building mathematical models based on existing\r\nobservations and using mathematical analysis to explore the full\r\nimplications of these models.  The project provides for the\r\ntraining of a doctoral student in this critical and emerging\r\ninterdisciplinary area.  The student is trained in and uses\r\ncontemporary methods of mathematical analysis, but also is\r\nexposed to experiments in biology and theories in mechanics and\r\nmaterials science.  The project also trains three summer\r\nundergraduate research students.\r\n",
