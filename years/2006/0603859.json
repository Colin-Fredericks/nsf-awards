His objectives are to gain\r\nboth better understanding and simplifications of complexity\r\n(which includes complexity reduction for multi-dimensional shock\r\nreflection problems), of the effect of solutes on the enhancement\r\nof strength of alloys, and of the mechanism of singularity\r\nformation in air, water, and liquid crystals.  The methods\r\ninclude hard, soft, and asymptotic analysis, numerical\r\ncomputation, and techniques of mathematical modeling.  The\r\nmathematical issues are fundamental for the understanding of the\r\nrespective subject areas.  For instance, a model is sought in\r\nmulti-dimensional shock reflection problems to reduce possible\r\nturbulence and thus bring the complexity to a comprehensible\r\nlevel and settle the von Neumann paradoxes (e.g., the paradoxical\r\nboundary between regular shock reflection and Mach reflection). \r\nThe issue in the phase-field model of alloys is to provide a\r\nquantitative as well as qualitative foundation for manipulating\r\nsolutes to strengthen the alloys.  Study of these mathematical\r\nissues (1) yields new understanding regarding alloys, liquids,\r\ngases, and liquid crystals, which are critical for the\r\nadvancement of many engineering sciences such as solid solution\r\nhardening, aerospace engineering, robot designing, and energy\r\nefficient devices; (2) provides advanced training for graduate\r\nstudents or postdoctoral researchers; (3) enhances collaboration\r\nand cross-training between mathematics, material research, and\r\nphysics, thereby establishing a foundation for training students\r\nin this broad area. \r\n\r\n     The investigator studies some applied mathematical problems\r\nin fluid dynamics (which includes the motion of air and water),\r\nmodeling of alloys, and liquid crystal physics in material\r\nscience.  Scientists and engineers have used mathematical\r\nequations, called partial differential equations, to model\r\nmotions or evolution.  The turbulent nature of fluid flows,\r\ndefects in materials, and the complexity of life show up in the\r\nform of singularities and instabilities in the solutions of the\r\nequations or in the complexity of the equations themselves.  In\r\ncases where the equations are quite simple, it is these\r\nsingularities and instabilities that often spoil accurate\r\nnumerical computations of the solutions.  The investigator uses\r\nanalytical mathematical tools to study the structures of the\r\nsingular solutions.  In the case of a compressible gas such as\r\nair, for example, he isolates typical singularities (hurricanes,\r\ntornadoes, shocks, etc.) and investigates their individual\r\nstructures.  The result of the investigation is a clearer\r\nunderstanding of the worst possible -- most singular --\r\nsolutions, or a drastic reduction of complexity, which quantifies\r\nour knowledge of the physics and offers guidance in\r\nhigh-performance numerical computations of general solutions. \r\nSuch results influence scientific areas such as weather\r\nforecasting, alloys, liquid, gases, and liquid crystals, and\r\nprovide critical knowledge for the advancement of many\r\nengineering sciences such as solid solution hardening, aerospace\r\nengineering, robot design, and energy-efficient devices.  In\r\naddition, the project provides opportunities for advanced\r\ntraining for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers and\r\nenhances collaboration and cross-training between mathematics,\r\nmaterial research, and physics, creating a foundation for\r\ntraining students in this broad area. \r\n",
