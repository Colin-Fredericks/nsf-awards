 "awd_abstract_narration": "ACLI-ware: Dynamic Data Driven Control for Wirelessly Implemented Application Systems\r\n\r\nThis project creates an end-to-end management solution for mobile computing that incorporates aspects from the physical wireless communication medium through application requirements. Our middleware\r\n(ACLI-ware) moves abstracted information towards higher layers, making them channel aware, and conveys constraints and requirements towards lower layers, making them application aware.  In providing applications channel awareness, information about the wireless channel, battery power, neighbors and their distances, lengths of routes, etc. are abstracted from the lower layers towards higher layers. For example, the appearance of a metallic wall may require selecting alternate routes and defining new communication clusters.  On the other hand, a dense network requires clever interference-mitigation algorithms and fair-scheduling and routing algorithms.  This information is also used by the application to throttle sending rates or adapt data fidelity.  To achieve application awareness, applications' constraints such as latency, fairness, quality of service, etc. influence the algorithms used at lower layers. For example, tight latency constraints can lead to smaller communication clusters, shorter allowable routes and quick feedback algorithms from the physical medium. On the flip side, a high bandwidth/throughput requirement entails optimal clustering and high fidelity channel-feedback.\r\n\r\nThis project couples two components seldom brought together: and use of physical channel information for adaptation and the elicitation of application constraints to impact communication characteristics. Thus, there are two key innovations in ACLI-ware: (a) interaction amongst layers, with each layer depending on the other layers' inputs and (b) dynamic solutions, with algorithms that adapt in real-time to varying channel conditions and system requirements.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
