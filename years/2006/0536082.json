 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\n\r\nThis project is developing an innovative program called Entrepreneurship through Multidisciplinary Projects and Collaborative Teams (EMPaCT). Based on the earlier Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) program, EMPaCT is providing multidisciplinary design experiences for students, and is promoting a culture of entrepreneurship throughout the university and region.  EMPaCT project work is done in teams that typically consist of engineering students, a business student, and one student from another discipline.  Design projects enable the student teams to experience the entire research, development and marketing process.  And EMPaCT courses give undergraduates at all levels -- from freshman through senior -- experiences in the product design process.  Project evaluation is looking not only at the quality of the EMPaCT final projects, but also at the effectiveness of the courses, and the development of an entrepreneurial culture.  The broader impacts of the project are two-fold.  The instructional materials developed by EMPaCT courses will benefit other universities that wish to promote multidisciplinary education.  And the project will stimulate economic growth by increasing entrepreneurial efforts, leading to new commercial products and businesses.\r\n\r\n",
