 "awd_abstract_narration": "MacNeil Lehrer Productions will expand and enhance the work of the The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer Science Unit to further the public's awareness and understanding of critical science-rooted issues.  The NewsHour Science Unit will have multiple points of impact -- TV, radio, online, podcast, DVD distribution and community-based collaborative outreach.  Deliverables include a minimum of 15 documentary-style field reports annually as well as a minimum of 12 in-studio reports, live discussions, and multi-segment series highlighting specific areas of science (e.g. nanotechnology and the International Polar Year).  Profiles of individuals working in various scientific fields, as well as online chats with scientists and science policy makers will communicate the excitement and possibilities of scientific careers.  Partners in the proposal include the Association of Science and Technology Centers, the PBS Program Club and local PBS stations.  During the first year The NewsHour will work with at least five key ASTC members to develop a content sharing partnership that is optimal for all partners.  Two initial partners are the Museum of Science, Boston, and the North Carolina Museum of Life and Science.  In each subsequent year, an additional five science museum organizations will be added to the local/national network that will use new technologies such as RSS (real time syndication service) and podcasting as well as traditional Web links to deliver materials from The NewsHour to partners as well as from participating organizations to each other and back to the Online NewsHour Web site.  Rockman et al will provide evaluation services.",
