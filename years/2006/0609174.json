The objective of this research is design molecularly thin films that allow active manipulation of their surface energy and tribological (friction, lubrication and wear) behavior through the application of electric fields.  The approach is to investigate two candidate alkanethiol based molecule systems using combined experimental and computational studies that include 1) synthesis, chemical and structural characterization of candidate films; 2) computational studies to qualitatively predict and understand the effect of electric fields on film behavior and 3) experimental tribological characterization of films in response to electrical fields.\r\n\r\nSuccessful demonstration of the proposed research strategy can lead to applications in a whole range of industrial and consumer mechanical systems in which energy and economical losses associated with friction/wear can be significantly reduced.  The films can also be used in systems where friction behavior needs to be controlled on demand such as biomaterial research (cells, tissues, fluid studies) and consumer applications (footwear for all-year traction).  The project will also enhance undergraduate and graduate education by incorporating research results into engineering courses and leveraging freshman honors/student workstudy programs at Iowa State University to include undergraduates in research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
