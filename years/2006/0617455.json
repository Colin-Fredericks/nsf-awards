 "awd_abstract_narration": "What determines the success of foreign language learning? With support from the National Science Foundation, Ms. Margarita Kaushanskaya will study this topic in her doctoral dissertation research under the direction of Dr. Viorica Marian. Three questions will be examined. One, is it easier to learn a foreign language when its sounds and letters correspond to the native language? Two, is it easier to learn a foreign language when a learner only hears the foreign language, or when a learner can both hear and read it at the same time? Three, is it easier to learn a foreign language if a learner already has experience acquiring a foreign language? Findings promise to inform the practices of ESL instructors, foreign language educators, speech-language pathologists, and learning disabilities specialists by providing specific guidelines for efficient and successful language learning. This project will also promote participation of under-represented Latino and Asian groups in scientific research.",
