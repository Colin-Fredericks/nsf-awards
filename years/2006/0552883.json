 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Northwest Indian College (NWIC) REU Site will provide research experiences in the biological sciences to 8 tribal students each year, in partnership with Western Washington University, the University of Washington, the University of British Columbia Fisheries Centre and Pacific Northwest Tribal Natural Resources Departments.  Student will conduct their research at NWIC or at a partnering institution, under the guidance of faculty mentors.  The objectives of the program are 1) to engage students in biological research projects relevant to tribal needs, 2) to develop the skills of undergraduates in order to enhance their scientific knowledge and competency, and 3) to enhance students' self-esteem and self-identities, while conducting biological research integrated with their culture and history.  The goal is to expose students to interesting and relevant scientific projects to facilitate their completion of, and further advancement in, their academic career, through attainment of BS, MS or PhD degree.  Students will receive training on their chosen project and in the preparation of oral presentations and written reports. Students will present their findings at an annual REU workshop and at other venues including regional and national scientific meetings.    The REU program is expected to increase the number of Native American STEM graduates, especially those with background knowledge and skills in the management of natural resources at the reservation. More information is available at http://www.nwic.edu/NewEventsTemp/REUpressabstract.htm, or contacting Roberto Gonzalez-Plaza at 866-676-2772 ext 4307 or rgonzalez@nwic.edu.",
