 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical communication by pheromones is the predominant mode of information \r\ntransfer in most vertebrates. The female garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) sex \r\npheromone, a nonpolar, hydrophobic blend of saturated and monounsaturated methyl \r\nketones, is insoluble in aqueous solutions. This pheromone is detected by the \r\nvomeronasal organ (VNO), which is specialized for the reception of nonvolatile \r\nchemical cues, but the mechanism by which the pheromone gains access to the \r\naqueous environment of the organ is unknown. Preliminary data indicate that the \r\nHarderian glands' (HG) secretions, which duct exclusively into the VNO in snakes, \r\ncontain solubilizing and/or pheromone-binding properties. For over 300 years, the \r\nfunction of the cephalic HG has been the subject of speculation from numerous \r\nsources.  Certainly their relatively large size, their phylogenetic age, and persistent \r\nconservation in almost all tetrapod groups as they emerged from an aqueous to an \r\nair/land environment suggest that they probably play an important role in the \r\nphysiological adaptation to terrestrial life.  This project will examine the role of the \r\nHG as a mediator in providing access for the female sex pheromone to the VNO of male \r\ngarter snakes.  Using radiolabeled garter snake sex pheromone, studies will be \r\nconducted to determine the solubilizing effect of HG secretion on the female sex \r\npheromone and the potential of the HG secretion to possess pheromone-binding \r\nproteins.  \r\nThe effects of HG removal on courtship behavior and prey attack, both known to require \r\na functional VN system, will also be investigated, as will the effects of seasonal and \r\nhormonal variation on the composition of the HG. The integrative research described \r\nhere will provide demonstrations of a novel mechanism by which nonpolar, hydrophobic \r\npheromone molecules reach the VNO, using a very well characterized system: the VN \r\nsystem of garter snakes.  If a pheromone-binding protein is involved, it will be the \r\nfirst identified in a non-mammalian species.  This research will provide a compelling \r\nmodel for the examination of HG involvement in perireceptor events mediating VNO \r\nfunction of other mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates.  In addition, this study \r\ntakes advantage of two unambiguous, quantifiable behaviors exhibited by a species in \r\nits natural habitat that not only offers a robust model for insights into seasonal shifts \r\nin reproductive behavior and feeding, but also proposes a physiological mechanism \r\nmediating these seasonally regulated changes.  This proposal involves an integrative, \r\nmultidisciplinary approach including field and lab studies that will yield significant \r\ninsights into the unifying principles of pheromonal communication common to many, \r\nif not most, vertebrates. The broader impacts of this proposal include multidisciplinary \r\ntraining in research and education through the mentoring of graduate students, \r\nundergraduates and outreach to high school and grade school students.  \r\nUndergraduates are an integral part of the PI's laboratories, assisting in animal \r\nhusbandry, field work and behavior experiments.  These undergraduates have been \r\nco-authors on 23 published papers from the two laboratories.  The PI's have a \r\nlong-term commitment to mentoring, with more than a dozen high school students \r\ninvolved in minority training programs and Intel/Westinghouse competitions, and an \r\nadditional nine high school students having worked in an NSF-initiated Apprenticeships \r\nin Science and Engineering program.  These experiences, coupled with appropriate \r\ncourse work, will provide a firm foundation for these scientists-in-training to \r\nexperience the joys and frustration of field and laboratory work. \r\n",
