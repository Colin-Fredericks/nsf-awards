Regalbuto\r\nInstitution:  \tUniversity of Illinois at Chicago\r\n\r\nSolid headway is being made to \"transform the art of catalyst preparation into a science\" by studying the fundamental phenomena that occur during noble metal impregnation.  With past support from NSF, it has been shown that the uptake of noble metal coordination complexes over many oxides and carbons during impregnation can be described in terms of a simple electrostatic mechanism.  In many cases, the high dispersion of the monolayer-adsorbed complexes is retained during reduction and yields highly dispersed metals.  \r\n\r\nThe working hypothesis in the current proposal is that electrostatic control of metal adsorption can be achieved at the nanoscale over surfaces containing two oxide fractions:  the \"strong electrostatic adsorption\" method can be extended to provide a simple, scientific method to prepare a wide range of bimetallic and promoted catalysts using cheap, common precursors.  Over promoter/support surface, pH will be controlled to achieve selective adsorption of the metal complex onto the promoter and not the support.  Bimetallics will be synthesized by adsorbing a second metal complex selectively onto a precursor oxide phase of the first metal and then reducing the intimately contacted metals. \r\n\r\nThese efforts are directed toward getting the most out of common precursors and methods by understanding them better.  It is hoped that successful demonstrations of the proposed work will lead to great leaps forward in the understanding and practice of bimetallic and promoted catalyst preparation.  The potential scientific impact is extremely broad, affecting all facets of the chemical industry which employ bimetallic and oxide promoted catalysts.\r\n\r\nOn education and diversity impact, the REU program is firmly integrated into the operation of the research laboratory.  The third research thrust of the proposed work has been formulated specifically for REU students; this work will be relatively easy to undertake, exciting to do, and will get noticed in peer evaluated publications and conference presentations.  Diversity has been and will continue to be a hallmark of the REU program.\r\n\r\n",
