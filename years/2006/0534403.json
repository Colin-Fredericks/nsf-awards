 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the Information Age, career and life-long learning are increasingly dependent on information-retrieval (IR) skills in order to utilize digital and on-line information effectively. However, integration of IR into undergraduate curricula has not kept up with this demand. IR deserves more attention as an integral element of many disciplines. To address primary problems in the current college-level IR education and possible causes of the problems, this project is carrying out three kinds of activities: \r\n(1)\tCreation of a module-based curricular model, which facilitates the development of an array of IR modules that enable flexible adoption and integration. These modules, including general IR modules mainly designed for IT/CS programs, and discipline-oriented IR modules based on specific disciplines such as Biology and Psychology, can be adopted based on the specific needs of different universities and programs.\r\n(2)\tCreation of a Multi-Disciplinary Information Retrieval Laboratory across departments at Armstrong Atlantic State University, which provides not only a desirable environment for faculty and student training, but also a platform to systematically integrate IR into multidisciplinary curricula. \r\n(3)\tDissemination achievements of the project to facilitate the adoption by other universities of the module-based approach through different channels including conferences, workshops and forums.\r\nThis project provides students and faculty with an appreciation of the connection between theoretical and practical aspects of IR, from different angles of different disciplines. It also emphasizes the ubiquitous nature of IR in multiple disciplines and promotes the status of IR in undergraduate education.\r\n\r\n",
