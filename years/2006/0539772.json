 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop an electric field (E) based measurement system to acquire electromagnetic signals that may be earthquake precursors. Each year earthquakes cause considerable damage to property and enormous numbers of casualties. However, no one has yet been able to demonstrate a reliable method of earthquake prediction that has practically useful,\r\nrepeatable results. The company plans to work with earthquake researchers and another firm that investigates these possible earthquake precursor signals, to test QFS's state-of-the-art E sensing technology's ability to refine these types of measurements. There are many theoretical arguments that the Earth produces electromagnetic (EM) signals that are earthquake precursors. Several groups are investigating this possibility working primarily with magnetic field (B) sensors. However, the B sensors have limitations that mean E sensors may actually be better suited to this work. Available E-sensing technology is not sensitive enough, and does not have adequate robustness to environmental factors. \r\n\r\nStatistics show that in the decade of 1991-2000, earthquakes caused US $270 billion of damage. In the 20th century, a million people died in earthquakes. Even a few minutes' warning would allow potential victims to take effective measures to prevent injury and death, and allow the shutdown of valuable systems that could be damaged by an earthquake. The global nature of earthquakes leaves no corner of the Earth untouched\r\nand the potential market for an effective system would be significant.\r\n",
