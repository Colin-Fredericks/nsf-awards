 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2006 Rustbelt RNA Meeting (RRM) will be held October 20-21, 2006 in the Lodge at Deer Creek State Park & Resort in Mt. Sterling, OH. The intellectual objective of the RRM is to provide an inexpensive, high caliber, interdisciplinary meeting for RNA researchers in the Midwest. The field of RNA structure/function and processing is growing at a rapid pace and RNA processing has proved to be a critical step in many important biological phenomena such as carcinogenesis and cellular development. Consequently, research groups need a forum where they can hear and discuss new results and techniques in all areas of RNA research that can result in furthering an individual lab's aims. The format of the meeting includes both oral and poster presentations, and the session themes are based upon the submitted abstracts.  The size and organization of the meeting fosters discussion between scientists at all career levels.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The RRM emphasizes trainee participation. The RRM features graduate and undergraduate student participation, from institutions ranging from large research-intensive universities to small, primarily undergraduate colleges. Trainees account for the majority (~90%) of both poster and oral presentations.  The smaller size of the RRM allows for more interaction between the trainees and the established scientists, and provides a forum for junior PIs to describe their emerging research programs. \r\n\r\n",
