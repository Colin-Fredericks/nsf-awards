These so-called spinor condensates offer a new form of coherent matter (quantum gas) with complex internal quantum structures that depend sensitively on the fine details of the inter-atomic interactions. This research will build upon the PIs recent investigations of spinor condensates created directly in all-optical traps in which the group studied the nature of the spinor ground state of the system and dynamical evolution of excited spin states. The broader impact of the program involves education as well as applications to sensors and clocks.",
