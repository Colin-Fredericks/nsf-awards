 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU program at Iowa State University focuses on providing an intensive research experience for students interested in research on molecular biology, biotechnology and genomics of animals, microbes and plants. The REU site seeks to attract undergraduate students from academic institutions that serve minority populations and from small liberal arts colleges where scientific research opportunities are not readily available. Students who have finished their sophomore or junior years and who have interest in research careers will spend ten weeks on the Iowa State University campus.  Students will receive a stipend, room and board, and travel to and from the Site. In addition to research, students meet together weekly for lunch and discussions on ethics, diversity, applying to graduate schools, written and oral scientific presentations, and the frontiers of biological research.  Regular social events and visits to regional biotechnology companies are also scheduled. The students write up their research work for general and scientific audiences, publish their research on the program web page, and present their work at a mini-symposium for the other students, mentors, and colleagues.  Undergraduate students in biological or agricultural sciences are eligible. They must be US citizens or permanent residents. Students who have completed lecture and laboratory courses in biochemistry or biology will be given preference. Women and minorities are especially encouraged to apply. For more information, students should visit http://www.reu.iastate.edu/, or contact the Program Directors: Dr. Max F. Rothschild and Dr. David J. Oliver at (515) 294-6202 or by email reu@iastate.edu.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goals of this REU in molecular biotechnology and genomics have been to educate young college students in these two emerging areas of science and to have them develop an appreciation for the process and outcomes of research.  During this five year project a total of 53 students from around the US came to Iowa State University.  Students came from primarily small colleges with small or no research programs and students were also ethnically and racially diverse.  They spent ten weeks in the program and worked in individual research labs dealing with agricultural plans and animals primarily.  They learned to think like a scientist, plan research projects and develop testable hypotheses about their research.  Also during the ten weeks they learned to collect data, analyze the date and test their original hypothesis.  These activities are crucial to research and to the discovery process.  Students also learned to present their research.  This was done in discussions in weekly meetings and by writing research papers and making poster presentations of their research. In addition to these activities, they visited research places like the Mayo Clinic and Pioneer Seed company to understand the role research plays in saving lives and creating new and improved crops and animals.\n\nStudents in the program were also interviewed to see what they learned in the process.  Nearly all had a much better appreciation for how and why research is conducted and in particular why biotechnology and genomics (study of DNA) are emerging fields that offer great promise to improve our lives.  Furthermore, they were able to decide if they were interested in graduate school in a similar research field.  A survey of students who had reached being seniors in college or had graduated showed that over 50 % or them had interest in graduate school and another group was interested in professional schools in fields that overlapped with the disciplines involved in this REU.  These efforts to inform and train students in research, especially in the fields of biotechnology and genomics, have a positive impact on the ability of the US to produce a next generation of scientists and to help provide for economic development for the US.  By all measure this REU was a success as it provided quality training and produced a number of students now in graduate school or considering graduate school.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/15/2010\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Max Rothschild"
