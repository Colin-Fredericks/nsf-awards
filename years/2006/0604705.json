It is our understanding\r\nthat Gromov--Witten theory has entered a very productive period\r\nof its development. It is about to become a part of a more\r\ngeneral framework based on ideas of conformal field theory.  Many\r\nkey outstanding problems of the theory such as, e.g. Virasoro\r\nconjecture, or Witten's W_n-gravity conjecture are likely to\r\nget either resolved on the basis of this framework or at least\r\nadvanced to a substantial degree.  Respectively, we are planning\r\nto continue our study of GW-invariants, their axiomatic\r\nstructure, their generalizations, their relationships with\r\nintegrable systems and symplectic field theory, methods of their\r\ncomputation including those associated with the mirror\r\nconjecture, and try to utilize the advantages that may come from\r\nconformal field theory.  A particular problem that gave the\r\nproposal its name is a long-standing conjecture about the\r\nbehavior of Gromov-Witten invariants under symplectic reduction\r\nof target spaces by circle actions.\r\n\r\nFrom a more general prospective, problems we deal with in our\r\nresearch lie on the crossroad of two major pathways in\r\nmathematics of the last two centuries. One of them is the\r\nin-depth pursuit of the intricate properties of algebraic curves\r\n--- in the form inherited from works of Gauss, Abel, Jacobi,\r\nRiemann, Klein and Poincare. The other is the broad conceptual\r\nlandscaping of mathematical physics dictated by the progress of\r\nclassical and quantum mechanics and often associated with the\r\nnames of Hamilton, Maxwell, Gibbs, Poincare, Hilbert, Einstein\r\nand Weyl.  It is string theory that in the search for the\r\nultimate laws of nature places algebraic curves in the center of\r\nthe modern landscape of fundamental physics, and generates new\r\nmathematical questions and points out plausible answers with an\r\namazing pace and persistence.  Some of the problems we work on\r\nare motivated by such questions, some others hopefully provide\r\nthe answers that string theory did not really anticipate.\r\n          \r\n\r\n",
