 "awd_abstract_narration": "Princeton University is awarded a grant from the Faculty Early Career Development program (CAREER) to develop an integrated computational and experimental approach for modeling biological pathways and networks. This technology will consist of three integrated components: a computational component for generalizable, efficient, and accurate integration of diverse genomic data, an analytical component for network/pathway modeling based on the integrated data, and an experimental component for validation and feedback. The integrated analysis of diverse genomic data and experimental verification will allow iterative refinement of computational methods and lead to highly accurate network-level pathway models that can serve as a scaffold for mechanistic models of complex biological processes. The key contribution of this work is in the tight integration of computational modeling and experimental testing to create a combined approach that uses iterative refinement of predictions to improve both the models and the algorithms. The success of this integrated approach will lead to more accurate and complete models of biological processes and pathways than those created by purely computational methods, and yet it will be substantially faster than study of the same processes by experimentation alone. \r\nThe interdisciplinary nature of this proposal will further the impact of advanced computer science on biology and will precipitate further interactions between the two fields, both through research and through interdisciplinary education. In concert with this research program, two graduate courses in bioinformatics will be developed. The PI will also continue to participate in development and teaching of a cross-disciplinary genomics curriculum for undergraduates in collaboration with biology, physics, and chemistry faculty at the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics. Both undergraduate and graduate curricular materials developed at Princeton will be made available via the Internet. In addition, a systems biology symposium at Princeton University will be organized to catalyze collaboration among computational and experimental researchers and to introduce more students to systems biology.  \r\n",
