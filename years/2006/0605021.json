Through a\r\nrigorous mathematical study, she finds effective parameters and\r\napproximations that are not otherwise obvious.  She combines\r\ncomputational and analytic tools to produce novel techniques that\r\ncan simulate and image composite materials.  In particular, the\r\nstudy involves structures arising from photonic bandgap\r\nmaterials, geophysical inversion, and heterogeneous\r\nelectrochemical surfaces.  The investigator answers open\r\nquestions about the interaction of small scale parameters,\r\nsolution expansions at singularity surfaces, and the links\r\nbetween continuous and discrete inversion.\r\n\r\n     Often the behaviors of many material substances, whether\r\ngeological deposits or designed electromagnetic materials, depend\r\non interactions between components of the materials at different\r\nscales of length. The investigator studies problems of this sort,\r\nin which advances have an impact in the applications area as well\r\nas in mathematics.  The new photonic simulation techniques aid in\r\nthe development of the next generation of nano-scale materials\r\nand optical devices.  The tailored computational approaches allow\r\nfor more accurate geophysical prospecting.  The investigator and\r\ncollaborators also analyze models that further the fundamental\r\nunderstanding of certain electrochemical processes.  Both\r\ngraduate and undergraduate students benefit by participating in\r\nthe project at appropriate levels.\r\n",
