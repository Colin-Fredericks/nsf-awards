Roblin, Ohio State University\r\n\r\nThe rapid evolution of wireless towards higher data-rates is fueling the need for high-efficiency wide-band RF power amplifiers. In this GOALI project an alternative experimental-based technique for the design of power amplifiers will be investigated.\r\nFor this purpose an advanced testbed combining a large-signal network analyzer, an active loadpull and an infrared microscope will be developed for the full-wave acquisition, visualization, and engineering of the transistor waveforms. This visualization of the transistor loadline and instantaneous power dissipation under modulated, switched and pulsed operation will offer new opportunities for the design of high-efficiency power amplifiers.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merits of the proposed research activity consist in developing new understanding and novel techniques for 1) the experimental characterization of power RF transistors under modulated and pulsed operation, 2) the interactive design of class E, F and Doherty amplifiers using load-lines and 3) the linearization of such amplifiers. The proposed GOALI program will rely on a formal collaboration with Andrew Corporation\r\n(basestation power amplifiers) and also various informal collaborations with the Air\r\nForce Research Lab at Wright Patterson AFB (power GaN HEMTs) and Avago (Cell phone amplifiers).\r\n\r\nThe broader societal impact of the proposed research is to provide critical support to the wireless industry by developing new advanced techniques for designing power transistors which are power and spectral efficient. The results will be disseminated in engineering literature, shared within the NSF ConnectionOne IUCRC members and directly introduced in the classroom to benefit engineering students.\r\n\r\n",
