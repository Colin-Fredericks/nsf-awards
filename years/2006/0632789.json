 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to synthesize plate crystals of zinc oxide (ZnO) by using chelating ligands and zinc counterions shown previously to produce this crystal habit. It also aims to connect the aqueous chemistry to directional growth rates leading to different crystal habits. With speciation software, supersaturation will be determined for the various species of zinc hydroxide ions believed to participate in crystal growth. The correlation between observed crystal habit and supersaturation will identify a particular species as a likely primary growth unit. Solid-state structure of ZnO crystallographic planes and the structure of compounds containing solution species will be used to ascertain aqueous species affinities for specific planes, which would affect directional growth rates. The final aim is to measure emission properties of spin-coated crystals with a photoluminescence spectrometer, using polymers as binding media on substrates. This will enhance student instruction with comprehensive projects that directly gauge the utility of synthesized crystals and complement curricular materials initiatives with spectrometer utilization in nanotechnology research and upper-level teaching laboratories.\r\n%%%\r\nZinc oxide is a member of a class of conducting transparent oxides important in applications extending from energy conserving window glass to transparent contacts for photovoltaic and display device technologies. In addition, up to 14 undergraduate chemistry majors over three years will be exposed to the intricacies of hydrothermal crystal growth. Moreover, the entire chemistry curriculum this undergraduate institution will be enhanced by the acquisition of the photoluminescence spectrometer which will also be used for undergraduate laboratory exercises and nanotechnology research. It is notable that 75% of chemistry majors in this institution are women and 12% are underrepresented minorities. \r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
