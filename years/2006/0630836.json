 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together faculty and colleagues in academic and financial support services units from the School of Engineering and the College of Arts and Sciences to recruit academically talented and financially needy students into courses of study in engineering, computer science, physical science, and mathematics. Key components that contribute to the intellectual merit of the project include: connecting scholarship recipients with faculty mentors; use of upper division undergraduates as study group tutors; and enabling the scholars to gain research experience either at the University of New Mexico or other private and governmental research establishments. In addition to considering a student's grade point average, the quality of recommendation letters, and the student's resume, the application process also requires submission of a goal-related essay. The broader impacts of this project are seen in the opportunity the scholarships give to keep more New Mexican students in the state with career opportunities in government laboratories, and other private industries within the state. In addition recruitment of academically qualified yet financially needy students is helping many of New Mexico's rural communities where students have had limited opportunities in the past for access to higher education.",
