 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing Numbers, Connections, and Retention in Science and Engineering (INCRSE) is a program which focuses on increasing the quantity, quality, and diversity of all STEM majors by employing both recruitment and retention strategies.  Retention of STEM majors is being accomplished by the redesign of science labs and mathematics courses based on current research in student learning.  Mathematics, science and engineering courses are linked using applied projects that integrate course objectives, promoting student learning and engagement.  INCRSE sponsors seminars and biweekly brown bag lunches for faculty at the lead institution as well as regional community college faculty to support efforts in student engagement and retention.  STEM career awareness among majors and non-majors aids with both retention and recruitment of current students by integrating STEM career awareness into core curriculum mathematics and science courses and the project team works with Career Services to bring STEM employers to the Career Exposition.  INCRSE has partnered with the office of Admissions to create a Transfer Student Information Day for recruitment to STEM of transferring community college students.  Potential transfer students observe courses, meet with STEM faculty and advisors, and tour campus with STEM majors serving as tour guides.   \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIncreasing Numbers, Connections, and Retention in Science and Engineering (INCRSE) at West Texas A&amp;M University (WTAMU) was funded in 2006 as type I Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Talent Expansion Program.  This program focused on increasing the quantity, quality, and diversity of all STEM majors at WTAMU employing both recruitment and retention strategies.  Retention of STEM majors was accomplished by the redesign of science labs and mathematics courses based on current research in student learning.  Recruitment of STEM majors focused on outreach and relationship building with faculty and students at four surrounding community colleges. \n\n \n\nCurricular learning communities were implemented and expanded across the STEM disciplines, co-enrolling cohorts of students into two or more STEM courses.  Engineering Learning Communities co-enroll cohorts of first year engineering majors into a mathematics and engineering course.  Mathematics and physical science majors are co-enrolled into a Calculus and Physics learning community in their first semester. First year life-sciences majors are co-enrolled in a Chemistry and Biology learning community. Problem Based Learning is implemented in these communities where students engage in teams to solve a real-life discipline specific problem using concepts from these courses.  Additional learning communities have been created to support students in gateway mathematics and science courses using the university\u00c6s Freshman Seminar College Success Course.  The study skills, time organization, and career preparation topics of the Freshman Seminar are targeted specifically to the majors enrolled and success in the gateway course.   Over 200 first year STEM majors are now enrolled each year in a learning community targeting their success and retention in the STEM field. \n\n \n\nNSF funding provided the opportunity for redesign of Biology laboratories from the ground up with new learning objectives and modernized laboratories designed to increase the connection the between lecture and lab while increasing student engagement.  These new laboratory experiences impact over 1000 students each year.\n\n \n\nRecruitment of community college transfers was accomplished through an initiative improve the transfer process through the building of relationships between STEM faculty at the institutions.  WT STEM faculty visit community college classrooms.  STEM faculty at university and community college institutions participate in joint faculty development sessions.  Articulation agreements and joint degree plans were devised and agreed upon by both institutions for all STEM degree programs. \n\n \n\nThese INCRSE programs have been institutionalized within the STEM disciplines and the learning community model has spread across the university and now includes living learning community components. \n\n \n\nWest Texas A&amp;M has observed the following outcomes since program initiation: \n\nIncrease of 73% (697 to      1208) in the number of STEM majors\nIncrease of 191% (103 to      300) in the number of Hispanic STEM majors\nIncrease of 44% (294 to      424) in the number of female STEM majors\nIncrease of 48% (214 to      316) in the number of CC transfer STEM majors\nIncrease of 42%, (97 to      138), in the number of annual STEM graduates\nThe undergraduate      enrollment at West Texas A&amp;M has increased by only 22% (5668 to 6908)      during this same time period.  \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/14/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Pamela Lockwood"
