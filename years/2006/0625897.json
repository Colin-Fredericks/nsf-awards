 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this NSF/Sandia collaborative research project (submitted to NSF 05-616) is to develop infrared (IR) photodetector arrays with wide spectral range and high spectral resolution to enable gas sensing spectroscopy in a micro-/nano-system. The approach is to pursue the hybrid integration of epitaxial and colloidal quantum dots (QDs) with lithographically-defined photonic crystal (PC) cavities to extend the spectral range and control the spectral resolution. Water-soluble colloidal QD-micelle bilayer building blocks will be investigated for ordered self-assembly and heterogeneous integration of epitaxial and colloidal QDs.  Nano-scale QD and micron-scale PC cavity integration processes and spatial/spectral coupling schemes will be explored for enhanced IR sensor performance.\r\n\r\nThrough the combination of self-assembly (bottom-up) and micro-fabrication (top-down) techniques, this research project addresses the long-standing issue of how to use ordered, colloidal QD self-assembly to enable functional devices and to serve as building blocks for integrated systems. This research will advance our knowledge and understanding of the interfacial chemistry and physics of hybrid materials, which could lead to other novel nanophotonic devices, including light sources, modulators, and solar cells. The central theme of this integrated approach to research and education is the use of complete micro-/nano-systems to provide a multidisciplinary learning environment spanning diverse areas including applied physics, applied mathematics, chemistry, optics, photonics, and semiconductor device physics. A test-bed featuring a multi-spectral photonic crystal infrared photodetector array (4x4), will be developed in order to demonstrate proof-of-concept for IR sensing, and to help develop multi-disciplinary courses on nanophotonics and nanomaterials. In addition, undergraduate students from under-represented groups will be recruited to participate in the proposed work via links with regional institutions serving women and/or under-represented minorities, such as Prairie View A&M University (TX), North Carolina Central University (Durham, NC), Bennett College (Greensboro, NC), and University of New Mexico.",
