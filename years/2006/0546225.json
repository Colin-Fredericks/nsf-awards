 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER:  An Integrated Research and Education on Functionally Graded Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Modeling and Experiments\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nThis research is concerned with electrochemical and mechanical performances of solid oxide fuel cells. One promising approach for improving SOFC performance is the use of functionally graded electrodes rather than purely monolithic or composite electrodes. This program will address three-dimensional transient thermal fracture analysis of functionally graded SOFCs using cohesive zone models and interaction integrals along with stochastic fracture modeling and sensitivity analysis. Fracture modeling will be validated with SOFC experiments. The program will be carried out in such a manner that the excitement of fuel cell research will be shared with students from high school through graduate school, and fuel cell researchers at the University of Connecticut and throughout the world. Research findings will be utilized in two outreach programs, e.g. the da Vinci Workshop and Engineering 2000, which are existing on-campus summer enrichment programs for New England middle and high school math-science teachers and high school students, respectively. \r\n\r\n",
