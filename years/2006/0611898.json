 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this travel grant is to seek funds to help increase representation and participation of US-based graduate students in the IEEE SECON 2006 meeting. Since its first endeavor in the year 2002, this IEEE Communications Society sponsored annual conference on sensor and ad hoc communications and networks has established itself as one of the premier conferences serving the rapidly growing research community. This grant offers travel support to graduate students who might otherwise be unable to attend SECON 2006. It provides a chance for the students to be exposed to the state-of-the-art in their research, and to interact with leading researchers and fellow students from other institutions. The participation of deserving students in technical conferences such as SECON has the potential to shape the future of the research in ad hoc and sensor networks.",
