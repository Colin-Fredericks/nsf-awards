The organizers are Dr. Ahmet Aktan, Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia and Dr. Suheyl Batum, Rector, Bahcesehir University, Istanbul, Turkey. The objective of the proposed workshop is to develop a plan for the construction of a model curriculum to educate future civil and environmental engineers who will be capable of effectively addressing the societal challenges related to infrastructures. In spite of the intertwined human, natural and engineered systems nature of engineering education, there is a great merit in the construction of a model curriculum with sufficient flexibility. If a model curriculum, in conjunction with its delivery tool and pedagogical standards, is carefully designed by experienced researchers, educators and practicing engineers, its potential impacts should be significant by inspiring ABET and ASCE, as well as the civil and environmental engineering education programs throughout the world.\r\n \r\nINTELLECTUAL MERITS: The practice and education of civil and environmental engineering is facing a dilemma. Throughout the last several decades there have been expression of concern with the state of our critical infrastructures, in conjunction with concerns for the state of civil and environmental education and practice.  Since constructed systems serve as the backbone of many critical infrastructures, civil and environmental engineering education and practice, and the performance of many critical infrastructures are intricately linked. Thus reforming civil and environmental education and practice (through continuing education) is of great significance.  This project will support 15 US scientists and engineering educators to participate in the workshop.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  Reliable recent studies made in the U.S. concluded that (The engineer of 2020 will need to be conversant with and embrace a whole realm of new technologies, but some old problems are not going to go away. They will demand new attention and, perhaps, new technologies. In some cases their continuing neglect will move them from problems to crises).  Civil engineering in particular has a major impact on the country.s infrastructure.  If the workshop helps develop a model curriculum for civil engineering education with alternates, with sufficient specificity and by following a systemic approach, it may fill a critical void in training of future engineers.  The workshop participants are expected to include women and junior scientists. This project is funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems.",
