Networks of sensors equipped with a transducer suite are valuable in sensing applications requiring integration of heterogeneous types of measurements.  This project focuses on the design, control, and performance of sensor fields consisting of nodes equipped with a suite of dynamically controllable transducers.  The project is motivated by open questions regarding implications of transducer heterogeneity in sensor networks, specifically on placement and topology control algorithms, data gathering and dissemination strategies, data fusion methods, and related network protocols. The investigators employ a combination of mathematical analysis and computer simulation to study the design implications of such networks.  The objective of the project is to obtain practically motivated and theoretically sound design and performance insights for heterogeneous networks.  Design objectives include energy conservation and spatial uniformity of each sensing capability over the region of interest.  More generally, it is of interest to understand how local state information is best incorporated into transmission decisions (for distributed medium access control), and how local state information can be efficiently obtained through clustering protocols.  Expected results from this research will improve sensor network performance and efficiency, permitting longer network lifetime, more reliable data collection and dissemination, and greater system reliability.  Research results will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed conferences and archival journals, as well as educational outreach modules designed to interest high school and undergraduate students in engineering. \r\n",
