 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)  We are refining four undergraduate courses established in Phase I and developing three additional courses offered by the School of Meteorology and the School of Electrical & Computer Engineering. These courses provide hands-on laboratory experiences in the special knowledge and skills necessary for organizing real-time weather data, improving and preparing that data for display, and interpreting its scientific significance. In order to widely disseminate these materials, laboratory modules are being developed for students via an iterative design-implement-test process with results from each step in the process informing successive iterations and leading to increasingly effective implementations. A community of scholars has been developed through this program.  Faculty training, student learning, and assessment complete the loop. An assessment plan closely monitors project activities. Moreover, the developed assessment tools identify at-risk students who receive enhanced training. Faculty members teaching project courses participate in special programs to help them utilize currently available topics such as active learning and course design. The project will continue outreach to various meteorological centers and has formed partnerships with at least three other universities, including a minority serving institution. In addition the PI's partner with the Oklahoma Climatological Survey (OCS) to develop project materials for K-12 students and teachers via the OCS EarthStorm outreach program and the NSF digital library.",
