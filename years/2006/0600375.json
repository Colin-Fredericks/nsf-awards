 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the development of design theory and computational modeling tools for systems where geometry changes over time according to wear in the contacting surfaces.  These geometric changes in turn alter the contact stress distribution at the interface, and also can cause subtle changes in the kinematics of the mechanism, which lead to changes in the forces at the contact.  The goal of this research is the development of principal-based engineering analysis tools that can accurately predict the geometric evolution of components and resulting kinematic evolution mechanisms, allowing accurate life prediction of mechanical components in relative motion.  A fundamental wear life prediction capability suitable for integration within existing commercial engineering software will be developed by accomplishing the following specific aims: (1) Create fundamental theories for prediction of evolution of contact geometry, (2) Develop computational tools to predict the kinematic evolution of generic systems, and (3) Verify the accuracy of the predictions in a wide variety of applications.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will lead to new developments of the theoretical bases for life prediction of evolving kinematics and create practical computational engineering design tools able to predict and track the geometric evolution of wearing components and the kinematic evolution of the mechanisms containing those components.  Successful development of a method for life-prediction of wearing surfaces will elevate the designer's approach to this widespread failure mode from its current state of heuristic and qualitative methods, to the same level of rigor routinely applied to stress analysis, fatigue, and fracture; resulting in improved product reliability and shorter development cycles.  Technology transfer will be ensured through workshops for practicing engineers, conference presentations, and archival publications.  This project will provide extensive opportunities for interaction between engineering students and a broad spectrum of industries.\r\n",
