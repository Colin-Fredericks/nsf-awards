The goal is to establish future research needs and directions in proxy development that will bear on research related to EAR, ATM, and OCE programs in the Geosciences Division of NSF. Approximately 50 researchers will participate in the workshop, including members of the modern oceanographic community and paleoclimatologists and paleoceanographers working on timescales spanning from ice cores to drill cores. The workshop will be held in San Francisco immediately following the Fall 2005 AGU Meeting.\r\n\r\nAlthough not limited to specific approaches, there will be a strong emphasis on geochemical methods and their relationships to numerical models. Overarching questions will explore the present state of proxy approaches and, most importantly, where we need to go next. We remain convinced that a sharper vision of the modern/near modern ocean is paramount in future explorations of deep time. And, similarly, the geologic record provides our only window to the full range of earth system states possible for future climate. The goal is to bring together new perspectives, new ideas, new questions, and new colleagues. Funds are requested to cover hotel and meal expenses for the days of the workshop, as well as costs associated with the organization of the workshop.\r\n",
