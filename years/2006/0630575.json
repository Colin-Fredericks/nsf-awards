 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical\r\nInterest in solid-state chemistry and materials science has undergone explosive growth in recent years due to the broadly based recognition of the technological importance and scientific challenges involved in the discovery and study of new materials, and due to the influx of scientists from other disciplines who see the opportunities for performing exciting research in this area. The proposed symposium will be part of the 2006 Northwest Regional Meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), which will be held June 25-28, 2006, in Sparks, Nevada. This symposium and its associated poster session will be a venue and a vehicle for exchange of knowledge, new findings, and techniques in research and education in these fields. Scientists in the Western and Northwestern regions of the U.S. will be exposed to new areas of research, possibly leading to new directions for their own research. The symposium will provide an opportunity to form new collaborations involving academia, industry, or national laboratories. \r\n\r\nTechnical\r\nThis symposium will bring together leading researchers and students at various academic levels in the Western and Northwestern regions of the United States. Invited speakers will present their latest research results in the following areas: nanotubes for sensing; optical and electronic nanomaterials and nanoparticle clusters as directional photoemitters;  nanostructured materials; micropatterning of anisotropic organic materials; molecular actuators; photophysics and electronic properties of novel organic and metal-organic hybrid materials; nanoporous materials; and benzenoid building blocks for nanotubes and helicenes. The symposium program includes a poster session covering topics included in the two major themes areas of the symposium (micro/nanostructured materials and organic materials), as well as in topical areas such as scanning probe microscopy, semiconductor fabrication chemistry, and molecular devices. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
