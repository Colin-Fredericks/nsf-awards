 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical:\r\nNovel tools have long played a pivotal role in scientific discoveries.  Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), derived from Einstein's idea of photoelectric effect, is such a tool that yields direct and unique information about the microscopic behavior of electrons inside solids.  It provides what we need the most to understand the physical properties of a solid: the direction, speed, and collision processes of electrons.  Over the last two decades, the improved resolution has allowed this technique to influence some of the most important physics questions today, for example the high-temperature superconductivity.  The objective of the proposed program is to bring the ARPES experiment to an even higher level, towards becoming a quantitative tool to gain information that cannot be obtained by other means.  This higher precision measurement capability will help expand the \"universe for discoveries\".  This program will yield the following broad benefits:  i) development of new measurement capability and methodology will benefit a broader scientific community; ii) training graduate and undergraduate students through collaborative and interdisciplinary research; iii) communication of key results to world-wide community to advance our understanding of novel solids; iv) some of the techniques developed may find industrial applications in the future.\r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\nAngle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has emerged as a leading experimental tool to investigate condensed matter systems, in particular the complex materials exemplified by the high-temperature superconductors.  The progress during the last two decades was made possible by a confluence of important scientific ideas, advancement in instrumentation, discovery of new materials and sophisticated data analysis technique. Looking towards the future, ARPES is expected to have even bigger impact in condensed matter physics by exploring new materials and testing new ideas.  The objective of the proposed program is to bring the ARPES experiment to an even higher level, towards becoming a quantitative tool to probe the electronic structure of complex materials and to gain information that cannot be obtained by other means.  The method is a combined effort on instrumentation development and experimental measurement.  Specifically, it is proposed: i) to further advance the experimental capabilities, including efforts toward sub-meV resolution; ii) to perform in depth study of model systems; iii) to investigate strongly correlated materials, exemplified by the cuprates and manganties.\r\n",
