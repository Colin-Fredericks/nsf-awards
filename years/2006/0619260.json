 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nThe George Washington University (GW) will acquire a new SQUID magnetometer to be shared with researchers at Georgetown University (GT).  The magnetometer will be capable of making measurements at applied fields as high as 7 T in the temperature range of 1.9 - 800 K, it will have the ability to reset its magnet to reduce remanent fields and allow low field operation, and a re-condensing helium dewar to virtually eliminate helium loss and cryogen filling.   The acquisition of this instrument will enable; the investigation of magnetic nanomaterials produced by alkalide reduction, the investigation of the magnetic properties of di- and trinuclear first-row molecular complexes, the study of quantum confinement on magnetically ordered systems for which the magnetic and electronic properties are intimately connected, the study of f-block metal magnetic coupling to d-block metals in hybrid metal-organic framework materials, the study of regular model arrays of small magnetic particles and magnetic nanowires, development of high frequency nanocomposites,  and the study of magnetization decay in nanomagnetic materials.  The instrument will bring GW and GT researchers together and catalyze meaningful collaboration.  The instrument will provide educational opportunities for undergraduates, graduates and postdoctoral fellows through research and classroom instruction.  Washington, DC high school students from underrepresented groups will be given the opportunity for hands-on participation in the research through the ACS program Project SEED.  Finally, in addition to the fundamental importance of the scientific knowledge these projects will generate, the studies will have impact on the development of advanced technology requiring superior soft or hard magnetic materials.\r\n\r\nLay Abstract\r\n\r\nMagnetic materials are of critical importance to a vast number of present and future applications: data storage, medical diagnostics, motors, bearings, generators, actuators, relays, meters, and transformers to name a few.  Improving today's technology and creating tomorrow's will in no small part depend on the discovery of improved magnetic materials and the development of a deeper understanding of their properties.  The SQUID magnetometer is an essential tool used to study and evaluate the magnetic properties of materials.  It will be used to guide scientists at The George Washington University and Georgetown University in their efforts to discover the magnetic materials that will enable the technological advances that will drive our future economy.  The SQUID magnetometer will provide the foundation to collaborative efforts between the two universities and magnetics researchers from the greater Washington DC area, synergistically driving scientific progress forward.  It will also be used to train new generations of scientists through undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral research.  In addition, the investigators will utilize the American Chemical Society's Project Seed to enable Washington, DC high school students from underrepresented groups to directly participate in the research.  The research enabled by the acquisition of the SQUID magnetometer will include programs that will: develop nanomagnets for medical diagnostics, quantum computing, radar absorbing \"stealth\" technology, high efficiency energy conversion and numerous other applications; nanorods for high strength permanent magnets and nanoelectronics; and advance the fundamental understanding of magnetic materials.\r\n",
