 "awd_abstract_narration": "Goal 1 Increase enrollment in STEM classes by establishing a summer math/science institute for\r\nhigh school juniors and seniors with research interns assisting in the planning, promotion, and\r\nimplementation of the institute. These participants will serve as feeders to the internship program\r\nand to the STEM courses. Further, the interns will work with high school students in the lab setting\r\nmonthly and become mentors to these students. A Career Day and recruiting of non-traditional\r\nstudents who are working in STEM fields will also assist.\r\nGoal 2 Increase retention of Native American graduates from STEM fields through implementation\r\nof a series of STEM lectures with lecturers from four-year colleges as well as visits to BCC of\r\nformer BCC STEM graduates to expose their successes. Key to the success of this goal will be\r\nfollow-up visits to Montana colleges to trace BCC STEM graduates.\r\nGoal 3 Strengthen STEM research infrastructures will involve developing partnerships with\r\ninstitutions/organizations which can do scientific testing for our research when the college lacks the\r\nequipment and moving beyond wind energy to alternative energies. The grant will encourage the\r\nbroadening of research at BCC by BCC STEM faculty becoming more involved in the research\r\nactivities. This will be accomplished by assisting them in developing a research component to their\r\ncourses and/or a research capstone course.\r\nGoal 4 Improve technology by offering a GPS-GIS summer workshop for BCC students, build a\r\nmini math lab for the math department and involved in data collection for both TSET and RSI.\r\n",
