Moreover, VoIP uses\r\nmultiple protocols for call control and data delivery, making it\r\nvulnerable to various attacks at different protocol layers.  The\r\nalready-known security solutions for data networks fall short of\r\ndefending VoIP applications because of the differences of cross protocol\r\ninteractions and the way in which the different handshakes effect the\r\ndistributed service elements and consequently the end user quality of\r\nservice (QoS) of VoIP.  This project seeks to develop a series of\r\nintrusion detection techniques suitable for VoIP and experimentally\r\nverify their commercial viability. Overall objective is to detect known\r\nand unknown attacks in an accurate and timely manner, without incurring\r\na noticeable delay in call setup times.\r\n\r\nThe research plan consists of two major components:\r\nProtocol-state-machine (PSM) based mechanism for detecting known\r\nattacks, and Hellinger-distance based (HD) mechanism for detecting\r\nunknown attacks.  The incorporation of the communication between\r\nprotocol state machines is particularly suited for intrusion detection\r\nin VoIP, because call control and media delivery protocols are\r\nsynchronized by exchanging synchronization messages for critical events\r\nthroughout the established sessions.  The core of HD detection scheme is\r\nbased on using the Hellinger distance to measure the deviation from\r\nnormal network protocol behaviors. To have the detection mechanism\r\ninsensitive to site and traffic pattern, a dynamic self-regulating\r\nthreshold is used, thus making the detection mechanism robust, widely\r\napplicable, and easier to deploy. Research results of the project will\r\nbe broadly disseminated through publication, web pages, and technology\r\ntransfer to industry.\r\n",
