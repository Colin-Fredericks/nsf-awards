 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2007 special semester \"Recent Advances in Combinatorics\" will take\r\nplace at the Centre de Recherche en Mathematiques in Montreal, Canada\r\nfrom January to July 2007.  Combinatorics, a subject often motivated\r\nby the simplest and most basic of questions, is nevertheless\r\nbreathtaking in its scope of techniques and breadth of applications.\r\nMany combinatorial topics are very exciting at the moment, following\r\nextraordinary recent breakthroughs in the understanding of some\r\nfundamental and difficult questions.  Of particular emphasis at\r\npresent is the development of a new \"Combinatorics of Macdonald\r\nPolynomials,\" which ties together far-flung topics in a surprising\r\nway.  The semester is organized as a series of four research\r\nworkshops, each with an associated preparatory school for graduate and\r\npost-doctoral level participants.  Each workshop/school combination\r\nconcentrates on an area in which current research advances are\r\noccurring.  This grant will support attendance at the workshops and\r\nschools by graduate students and junior researchers from the United\r\nStates, giving them an unusual opportunity to interact with a large\r\nnumber of the world's leading researchers in these areas, particularly\r\nthose from Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nThree main themes guide the topics of the workshops.  (1) Relations\r\nbetween Enumerative Combinatorics and Statistical Physics; more\r\nspecifically, the uses of enumerative techniques for the study of gas\r\nmodels, Ising and Potts models, etc., for the purpose of computing\r\nphase transitions or thermodynamic limits.  (2) Algebraic Aspects of\r\nCombinatorics on Words, underlining natural links with the study of\r\nfree groups, free fields, free Lie algebras, and of special properties\r\nof continued fractions in relation with the study of Artin's billiards\r\nand real quadratic fields.  (3) Interactions between Algebraic\r\nCombinatorics, Algebraic Geometry and Representation Theory, a theme\r\nof two of the workshops.  The emphasis here is on the study of\r\nsubjects such as Schubert varieties, Hilbert schemes, Gromov-Witten\r\ninvariants, and their ties with symmetric functions such as Macdonald\r\npolynomials, and with classical combinatorial enumeration.",
