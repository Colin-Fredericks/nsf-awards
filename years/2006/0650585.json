 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is to develop an integrated micro-electromechanical systems\r\n(MEMS)-based miniature microphone system for directional sensing of sound based on a\r\nbiological model. The design follows that used by the Ormia ochracea fly. This fly employs a\r\nunique coupled mechanical bar system operating at the critical damping to extract the direction\r\nof sound. The Ormia ochracea fly has ears separated by only about 500um yet has remarkable\r\nsensitivity to direction of sound. The separation of the fly's ears is too small for it to sense the\r\ndirection of a sound source if it uses traditional human techniques such as the difference in\r\narrival times or the amplitudes of sound at each ear. The fly's unique ear structure helps to\r\nmagnify the difference in amplitude as well as phase of the sound wave.\r\nThe proposed MEMS device uses two flapping wings which are textured to achieve critical\r\ndamping to mimic the fly's ear system. An initial finite element simulation shows the proposed\r\ndesign replicates the directional sound response of the fly's biological system. The\r\ndisplacement of the membrane due to typical sound pressure is on the scale of nanometers and\r\nrequires a highly sensitive position measurement approach to determine the amplitude. Such a\r\nposition sensitivity can be achieved by optical means using two diffraction gratings at the edges\r\nof the wings. A diffractive interferometer using fixed and moving gratings can provide subnanometer\r\ndisplacement sensitivity. By placing the gratings at the outer edges of the\r\nmembrane, a maximum displacement can be achieved. This translates into angular resolution\r\nof the direction of sound to about 1-2 degrees. The proposed tasks include the design,\r\nfabrication and characterization of the sensor performance.\r\nIntellectual merit: The proposed research provides an opportunity to combine the advances in\r\nMEMS technology with unique functionalities of biological systems to develop a novel sound\r\nsensor. The findings of the research will enable us to understand how the fly's hearing system\r\nachieves such a remarkable directional sensitivity and to fabricate an electromechanical\r\nequivalents. A set of such sensors can be used for pinpointing explosions by monitoring the\r\ndirection of sound which can be deployed using micro air vehicles. In addition, a network of\r\nthese sensors can be used for unattended movement monitoring. Other applications of such\r\nsensors include use in low noise hearing aids. The principal investigators and research staff\r\nhave extensive experience in MEMS design, fabrication and testing. The Naval Postgraduate\r\nSchool has state-of-the-art MEMS design facilities as well as an anechoic chamber with\r\nexperienced staff for acoustic testing.\r\nBroader impact: This research will accomplish two goals. First, it will significantly expand\r\ncurrent knowledge on the inner workings of the Ormia ochracea fly's unique hearing system and\r\non the design and fabrication of electromechanical equivalent for applications involving\r\npinpointing sources of sound. Second, the graduate students participating in this investigation\r\nwill gain valuable knowledge and experience in this multidisciplinary area of research. The\r\nNaval Postgraduate School also provides research opportunities for promising local high school\r\nstudents. Current plans are to include high school students in the research, where possible, in\r\norder to enhance their skills in mathematics and science and to encourage them to pursue\r\nmathematics, science, and engineering in higher education. The findings of the research will be\r\npublished in scholarly journals and conferences.",
