 "awd_abstract_narration": "The San Fernando Observatory (SFO) of California State University Northridge (CSUN) has the longest existing data set of photometric full disk solar images, now covering more than 17 years. These images allow precise measurement of the relative brightness of solar features such as sunspots and faculae. \r\n\r\nIn the proposed research, the PI will use SFO's archived and future photometric images to address the following open questions about solar variability: Are observed solar magnetic features sufficient to explain both the short and long term variations in total and spectral solar irradiance? What are the relative contributions of various solar features to changes in these irradiances? What are the statistical properties of solar active regions, and do they change either during the solar cycle or from one cycle to the next? Does the solar irradiance at solar minimum change in a systematic way? Can measurements of solar features be used to reconstruct current and historic values of total and spectral solar irradiance? \r\n\r\nSFO photometric images, precision information on solar active regions, and secondary data such as total and spectral solar irradiance models will be made available to the scientific community. This SFO research program will also have broader impacts extending beyond solar physics. This research will bolster the CSUN educational mission by teaching students the value of research and by training them in the use of computers and analytical techniques. The proposed research will also broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science. Public talks on the results of this research will be presented in the CSUN planetarium, informing and educating a wider audience.",
