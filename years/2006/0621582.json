The PI of this award is Dorothy Zolandz. The CSR provides an apolitical forum for leaders in the chemical sciences and engineering, with the objective of enhancing understanding of issues that affect government, academic, national laboratory and nonprofit sectors.  These discussions provide a vehicle for interaction among the participants, and for education, exchange of information and discussion of issues and trends that affect the chemical sciences. CSR members are appointed by the National Research Council's Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology; membership consists of 30-35 volunteer chemical scientists and engineers from academia, industry, government, the national laboratories, and the non-profit sector. The results of CSR discussions and workshops will be disseminated through workshop reports made available through professional societies, scientific and trade publications, and on the web.",
