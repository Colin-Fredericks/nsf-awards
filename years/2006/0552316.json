Inaccessible to direct observation below a few kilometers (the limit of drilling and exposure by erosion) the Earth's crust, mantle, and core are primarily studied through their interaction with seismic waves. Recent developments in seismic sensor design, and the acquisition, transmission and storage of data have resulted in dramatic improvements in the resolving power of seismic imaging of the interior. Earthquake research, including rapid and accurate location and characterization of the earthquake source, its magnitude and a better understanding of the physical process involved, has also benefited greatly from recent technical advances. The unprecedented on-scale recording of the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake of December 2004, and the resulting new insights into the source processes of mega-earthquakes, is clear evidence of the significance of the value of long-term investments in new technology and global observational systems.   \r\n\r\nThe Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) operates a national facility for the development, deployment, and operational support of modern digital seismic instrumentation and data management facilities to serve national goals in basic research in the Earth sciences, in earthquake research, and in nuclear test ban monitoring. IRIS programs are overseen and governed by a Consortium of 102 Member Institutions, comprising virtually every US university with a seismology research program. IRIS also includes a growing number of long-term partners, totaling 2 US Affiliates, 43 Foreign Affiliates and 8 Educational Affiliates.  IRIS's core activities fall into five broad areas: (1) The Global Seismographic Network (GSN) is a network of high dynamic range, broadband sensors distributed around the world at 2000 km spacing that is operated jointly with the U.S. Geological Survey; (2) The Program for Array Seismic Studies of the Continental Lithosphere (PASSCAL) supports Earth science experiments through loans of seismic sensors, data acquisition, telemetry and power systems and through services that include planning, shipping, field support, data capture, and instrument refurbishment; (3) The IRIS Data Management System (DMS) collects, assesses, archives and distributes all data from the GSN, PASSCAL experiments, the U.S. National Seismic Network, and other national and international sources; (4) The IRIS Education and Outreach (E&O) Program enables audiences beyond seismologists to access and use seismological data and research for educational purposes, including teacher workshops, student internships, museum exhibits, educational materials, and programs for under-resourced schools; and (5) Community Activities that improve collaboration among member institutions to carry out Earth science research more efficiently and to seek partners among groups outside of seismology, including other Earth science consortia, government agencies, and international organizations.  \r\n\r\nThe IRIS E&O Program plays a central role in the IRIS contribution to broader impacts.  Additional broader impacts of this effort include the GSN's role in the early-warning for earthquake events, including those that create tsunami, and as a key element of the CTBT systems.  This award will provide support for the operation of the IRIS facility during the period 2006-2010.   \r\n\r\n***\r\n",
