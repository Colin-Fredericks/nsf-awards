 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed synthesis project will examine, by means of meta-analysis, the research evidence on gender differences in mathematics performance. The stereotype that girls and women lack mathematical ability is held by children and parents, as well as by mathematics and science teachers. The goals of the research are as follows: First, the PI will conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis of research on gender differences in mathematics performance to indicate whether a gap exists and whether there are specific areas in which males and females differ. Second, the PI will conduct moderator analyses to ascertain variations in the magnitude of gender differences in mathematics performance along dimensions such as age and cognitive level of the test as well as ethnicity. Third, the PI will ascertain whether males show larger variability in their scores, compared with females. Fourth, the PI will examine large national data sets such as the NLSY and NAEP to analyze the available data for gender differences in mathematics performance. Fifth, the PI will use large cross-national data sets, including TIMSS, PISA, and IAEP, to examine international patterns of gender differences and also determine whether correlations exist between countries' gender equality index and the magnitude of the gender difference. \r\n",
