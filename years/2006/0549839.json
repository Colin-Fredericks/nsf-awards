 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal supports travel awards for graduate students, post-docs, and young faculty\r\nto attend the \"Organic Conjugated Materials\" Symposium to be held at the 2006 Spring\r\nMaterials Research Society Meeting. Given the current status of the field of organic\r\nelectronics, this symposium is timely, and will be of great interest to the general\r\nmaterials community. Specifically, we envision a high-impact, cross-discipline, and\r\ncomprehensive symposium on organic conjugated materials -- the electrically-active\r\ncomponent of organic electronics -- with emphasis on the chemistry, physics, the\r\nprocessing-structure-property relationships, as well as device fabrication and\r\ncharacterization of organic molecular materials and polymers. Nine half-day oral sessions\r\nand two evening poster sessions are being planned; 25 speakers have already accepted our\r\ninvitation to speak at the symposium. We expect to receive >250 abstracts in response to\r\nthe call-for-papers, and intend to select approximately 60 oral and 130 poster\r\npresentations from these abstracts.                                                                                                                     \r\nFunding from the NSF will allow us to provide ten travel awards at $500 each to support\r\ngraduate student and young faculty travel to the symposium. Priority will be given to\r\ngraduate students who are attending their first national meeting. Four travel awards will\r\nbe reserved specifically for young faculty who will be giving oral presentations at the\r\nsymposium.",
