 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's propose to develop a system that can control its position relative to a moving surface (such as an isopycnal) and withdraw significant volumes of water from a planktonic layer within a defined density interval. This sampling is based system on a well-tested, remotely operated vehicle (ROV) known as the Phantom. They will install a CTD and particulate sensors on the vehicle and use the feedback from the CTD to control the position of the ROV relative to an identified density interval. The control software will allow an extension arm on the ROV to stay within the selected density interval while multiple liters of water is extracted from the layer. The system will have two distinct water sampling systems on the ROV: one will pump up to 50 1-liter samples into individual sampling containers, while the other system will pump continuously to the surface through a hose coupled to the umbilical of the ROV. Imaging optics and acoustic transducers will characterize the larger plankton aggregated near the thin layers. The proposed sampling system will permit experimental work and ecological analyses of the organisms found within and around planktonic thin layers, and will have significant impact on our understanding of the importance of these ubiquitous features. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThis proposal offers a next step in the composition of thin layer phenomenon and follows a logical path in the pursuit of advancing the field. The basic data and knowledge is correlated with environmental parameters while the PI's are well placed within the appropriate community. The work should provide guidance for current and future research into the thin layers. In this way, other researchers can benefit from the methods advanced by the proposed research. Outreach includes dissemination of the results to an adult education program.\r\n",
