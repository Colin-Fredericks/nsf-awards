It\r\nrelates a very active branch of geometric group theory (automata\r\ngroups and groups acting on rooted trees) with symbolic and\r\nholomorphic dynamics.  Before introduction of iterated monodromy\r\ngroups, groups generated by finite automata were mainly isolated\r\nexotic (counter) examples. It is clear now that such groups appear\r\nnaturally in connection with iterations of self-coverings of\r\ntopological spaces (in particular iterations of post-critically\r\nfinite rational functions). This opens new perspectives of\r\napplication of holomorphic dynamics to group theory. On the other\r\nhand, computational effectiveness of automata groups helps to\r\nstudy deeper the combinatorics and symbolic dynamics of\r\nself-coverings. For example, if the self-covering is expanding,\r\nthen its Julia set is uniquely determined by the iterated\r\nmonodromy group. The project suggests further investigation of the\r\nconnections between dynamical systems and automata groups. We\r\nhope, in particular, to get new results in the theory of groups\r\nacting on rooted trees, groups generated by automata, theory of\r\ngrowth of groups, find new applications of geometric group theory\r\nto combinatorics of iterations of rational functions and\r\npolynomials.\r\n\r\n{Second abstract.} The project brings together two branches\r\nof Mathematics, which where not so close before: geometric group\r\ntheory and holomorphic dynamics. Geometric groups theory is a part\r\nof algebra which studies large-scale properties of groups of\r\nsymmetries. Holomorphic dynamics studies iterations of rational\r\nand polynomial functions and is a source of complex and beautiful\r\nfractal structures such as Mandelbrot and Julia sets. Iterated\r\nmonodromy groups, introduced by the investigator, are naturally\r\nassociated with rational iterations and are groups encoding in a\r\ncompact symbolic form all the complex topological behavior of the\r\niterations and geometry of their Julia sets. The construction of\r\nthe iterated monodromy group is very natural, but groups obtained\r\nin this way are very exotic from the point of view of classical\r\ngroup theory. Difference between classical groups and iterated\r\nmonodromy groups resembles in some way the difference between the\r\n``smooth'' geometric shapes of the classical geometry and fractal\r\n``wild'' shapes of holomorphic dynamics. Algebraic properties of\r\niterated monodromy groups remain to be rather mysterious and a\r\npart of the project is to understand them better. We are also\r\nhoping that this new connection between group theory and dynamical\r\nsystems will be fruitful for both parts of mathematics, that we\r\nwill be able to use group theory to obtain new results in\r\nholomorphic dynamics and to apply holomorphic dynamics to study\r\nnew classes of groups.\r\n\r\n",
