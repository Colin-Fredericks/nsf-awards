 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\n\r\nThis project develops energy management techniques for large-scale,\r\nmulti-tier data-centers, using formal optimization methods that do not\r\ncompromise performance requirements.  High-performance Internet\r\nservices are often functionally decomposed into a pipeline of\r\nmultiple, semi-independent tiers spanning multiple machines.  These in\r\nturn might consist of a heterogeneous mix of system generations, due\r\nto phased upgrades.  Power delivery and cooling costs constitute a\r\nsignificant part of total cost of ownership.\r\n\r\nThe expected workload of such a system is aperiodic, with highly\r\nvarying execution demand and possibly significant I/O activity.  This\r\nrepresents an opportunity for major energy savings, but only if\r\nperformance guarantees can be maintained.  Scalability also requires\r\nthat local power management decisions must yield globally optimal\r\nenergy consumption.  Although effective power management policies have\r\nbeen devised for simpler architectures, no straightforward extensions\r\nexist to make them applicable to multi-tier clusters while preserving\r\nresponse-time guarantees.\r\n\r\nResults will be disseminated at leading conferences and the software\r\nwill also be publicly available on the Internet for use by the\r\nresearch community in further research, or by the industry as a basis\r\nfor possible product development.  Moreover, from a global societal\r\nperspective, successful energy management helps save natural\r\nresources, while reduced service-provider costs foster economic growth\r\nand IT innovation.  Finally, this research will help train graduate\r\nand undergraduate students.\r\n\r\n",
