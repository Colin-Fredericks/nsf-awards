This is the fourth such exchange\r\nbetween the two countries and will primarily focus on new instrumentation for nanoscale\r\nstructures. It is scheduled for 2007, with 14 young researchers from Japan visiting the\r\nU.S. in March with a reciprocal visit by 14 young U.S. researchers to occur in the summer\r\nor fall of the same year. During the 7 to 10 day visits, the participants will travel to\r\nleading research centers to investigate current research in each others countries. The\r\nobjectives of this exchange program are to develop and strengthen connections between\r\nyoung U.S. and Japanese researchers (primarily at the assistant professor level), in the\r\ndiscipline of nanotechnology and, specifically, nanomanufacturing.\r\nThe intellectual merit lies in the exchange of scientific and technical information, in\r\nthe emerging, fast growing and ever-important field of nanotechnology. The broader impact\r\nlies in continuing and future intellectual exchanges and the promise of continuing a\r\nmutually beneficial collaborative relationship between these two technology leading\r\ncountries\r\n",
