 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research focuses on algorithms to solve illumination problems,\r\nwhich are a class of geometric optimization problems that focus on where to\r\nplace, or how to move, groups of guards in such a way as to illuminate\r\nenvironments or targets of interest. The objective is to solve this class\r\nof geometric optimization problems, through visually-guided agents, i.e.,\r\nrobotic agents with line-of-sight sensors and line-of-sight communication.\r\nThe technical approach is based on a novel set of \"incremental partition\r\nand deployment\" algorithms that effectively solve the classic art gallery\r\nproblem for robotic guards with visibility sensors.  Our solutions rely on\r\nnovel geometric structures that reflect the environment topology, on\r\nnavigation algorithms to explore these structures, and on distributed\r\nalgorithms to manage the information gathered via local sensing and\r\ncommunication.  The broad research objective is to design distributed\r\nalgorithms for various illumination and motion coordination\r\nproblems. Useful scenarios arise by considering a hierarchy of\r\nenvironments, a variety of illumination models, and different tasks.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will impact the emerging technologies of robotic and\r\nsensor networks.  The focus is on situations where groups of robots with\r\ncameras and other controllable sensors will provide pervasive coverage and\r\nsensing in urban environments.  Example applications could include civil\r\nrescue operations and adaptive aerial surveillance.  This technology holds\r\nthe promise to affect society at large by facilitating a number of critical\r\ntasks in national security, industrial automation, and novel commercial\r\napplications.  This research will achieve broad dissemination through\r\nregular publications as well as through the development of lecture notes\r\nand a course on cooperative mobile robotics.  The PI will develop software\r\nfor distributed illumination problems, geometric optimization and algorithm\r\nvisualization. The PI will supervise teams of undergraduate students\r\nperforming senior design projects on robotics and controls related\r\nto the broad themes of this proposal, including sensor networks, mobile\r\nrobot control, and visual sensing.  The PI plans to advertise opportunities\r\nto work on proposal-related projects as widely as possible to attract\r\nunder-represented and minority students.\r\n",
