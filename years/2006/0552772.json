The program builds upon the current education and research theme of the previous REU program on Smart Sensors and Integrated Devices (SSID), and also extends it to a systems approach of nano-integration with micro-systems research.  The program will provide 10 students each year with research experience in cellular biophysics, biosensing science and technology, nanoscale devices, and translational applications in medicine and environmental sciences.  REU participants will work closely with an interdisciplinary team of students with at least two faculty advisors to understand, develop and apply new sensor technologies starting from one or more sensing mechanisms (optical, mechanical, electrical/electromechanical, and magnetic) and extending to nano integration and biofunctionality of the sensor/biological interface.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the program are to provide undergraduate students with a comprehensive research experience in Nanoscale Structures and Integrated Biosensors (NSIB) and make them aware of the opportunities in graduate programs in science and engineering, or in industrial research settings. The program will place emphasis on the participation of female and underrepresented minority students, and encourage the students to pursue graduate programs in physics and engineering.   \r\n",
