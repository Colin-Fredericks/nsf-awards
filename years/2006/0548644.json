The focus of the conference will be on recent developments\r\nin the study of analysis and geometry in metric measure spaces\r\nwith a particular emphasis on geometric analysis, geometric\r\nmeasure theory and subelliptic PDE in Carnot groups and general\r\nsub-Riemannian manifolds. Applications of these subjects to\r\nproblems in robotics, control theory, the geometry of the visual\r\ncortex, and digital image reconstruction will also receive\r\nsignificant attention.  An important aim of the conference is to\r\nprovide a forum for the exchange of ideas among researchers in a\r\nvariety of pure and applied fields and to foster new avenues for\r\ncollaboration and exchange.\r\n\r\nThe basic theme of sub-Riemannian geometry is the \"geometry of\r\nconstrained motion\"; it provides mathematical models for any\r\nphysical situation in which allowable motion is subject to\r\nspecific a priori geometric constraints. Historically, the roots\r\nof the subject lie in Carnot's work on thermodynamics and\r\nadiabatic processes, but it has progressed significantly beyond\r\nthese motivating questions to a central position in modern\r\nnonsmooth geometric analysis, and has seen remarkable\r\napplications in numerous areas: robotic path planning, remote\r\ncontrol of satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles, digital image\r\nreconstruction and computer vision, neurobiology, and the\r\nmathematics of finance, to name a few. The goal of the conference\r\nis to bring together a wide spectrum of pure and applied\r\nmathematicians with common interests in the subject of\r\nsub-Riemannian geometry to develop new methods and techniques for\r\nits study. Special emphasis will be placed on supporting graduate\r\nstudents and junior participants, to train the next generation of\r\nresearchers in this exciting and rapidly expanding field and to\r\nlay the foundation for a \"North American\" school in this area on\r\na par with the established centers of research in sub-Riemannian\r\nand Carnot-Caratheodory geometry in Europe.
