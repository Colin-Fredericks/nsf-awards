PROJECT SUMMARY\r\nIn this research program, the PI proposes a novel combined geometric active contour/particle\r\nfiltering approach for tracking the boundaries of objects (i.e., planar shapes), when the observation\r\nis an image which may be a complicated nonlinear function of the closed curve. The advantage\r\nof using geometric active contours is that they allow topological changes (automatic merging and\r\nbreaking), and hence can be used to track multiple objects.\r\nMore specifically, the particle filtering framework will be applied to the space of continuous\r\nclosed curves which is an infinite dimensional space. This is a particularly difficult problem since\r\ngenerating Monte Carlo samples from a very large dimensional (theoretically infinite) system noise\r\ndistribution is computationally complex. Moreover, the number of samples required for accurate\r\nfiltering increases with the dimension of the system noise. The PI will show that as long as the\r\nnumber of dimensions of the system noise is small, even if the total state space dimension is\r\nvery large (or infinite), a particle filtering algorithm can be implemented which will allow him\r\nto develop practical robust tracking algorithms. In particular, the PI proposes to approximate\r\ncurve deformation using a time- varying finite dimensional representation. He will formulate the\r\nproblem as particle filtering with unknown static parameters and use a modification of a particle\r\nfilter that has been shown to be asymptotically stable for tracking static parameters.\r\nThe main assumption is that even though the curve may be regarded as a point of an infinite\r\ndimensional space, \"most of its deformation\" for a given period of time can be approximated using\r\na small finite number of dimensions. But over time, this approximation may no longer suffice\r\nand hence one must allow the number of dimensions and the finite dimensional basis to change\r\nwhenever the current approximation is unable to track with suffcient accuracy. For a number\r\nof key scenarios, this assumption seems reasonable, and allows the use of infinite dimensional\r\nobserver techniques for visual tracking.\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe key objective of this project is the development of new methodologies for employing visual\r\ninformation in a feedback loop, the underlying problem of controlled active vision. This is a\r\nchallenging problem both from the intellectual and practical points of view. Indeed, controlled\r\nactive vision, and in particular visual tracking requires the integration of techniques from control\r\ntheory, signal processing, and computer vision. This research program points the way to finding a\r\nnew class of robust and hopefully real-time visual tracking schemes making use of all of the above\r\nbuilding blocks.\r\nBroader Impact of Research Activity:\r\nThe PI believes that the proposed synergy of vision, filtering, and control described in this\r\nproposal may have a strong impact on tracking and active vision. Indeed, visual tracking provides\r\na fundamental example of the need for controlled active vision. While tracking in the presence of a\r\ndisturbance is a classical control problem, visual tracking raises new issues. Firstly, since cameras\r\nare part of the system, one must consider the nature of the disturbance from imaging sensors.\r\nSecondly, the feedback signal may require some interpretation of the image, e.g., segmentation\r\nof a target from its background, or an inference about an occluder. Finally, as visual processing\r\nbecomes more complex, the issue of processing time arises. Each of these problems must be\r\nanswered before target detection, and visually-mediated control can be provided for medical,\r\ncommercial, or advanced weapon systems.",
