 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the development, implementation and population of a database for metamorphic geochemistry (MetPetDB) with the purpose of archiving published data for ready access to researchers and students in the petrologic community. This database will facilitate the gathering of information for researchers beginning new projects, permit browsing and searching for data relating to anywhere on the globe, will provide a platform for collaborative studies among researchers anywhere on the planet, serve as a portal for students beginning their studies of metamorphic geology, and be the repository of vast quantities of data being collected by researchers globally. There will be a large increase in efficiency and reduction in duplication of effort, all of which will contribute towards more effective use of federal research monies. Most importantly, it will provide a springboard for launching new scientific studies that would have previously been prohibitively expensive or difficult.  \r\n\r\nThe data model will be based on metamorphic samples and subsamples and will incorporate seamless integration between images and chemical analyses as a fundamental design element. This aspect of MetPetDB is unique in the geosciences, and results will serve as a template for development in other, image intensive, disciplines. The database will house a wide range of information available for samples from all over the globe to be grouped into two categories: (a) observations and measurements (e.g. mineral data, images, chemical analyses), for which robust data models already exist, and (b) interpretative results (e.g. P-T conditions, crystallization ages, cooling rates, etc), which are conclusions based on the observational data. Development of a robust data model for interpretative data is part of the proposed project. The database system will incorporate a number of tools for data analysis and calculation that will add considerable power to the researcher. The database will be searchable via a number of different criteria, and will have user-friendly, web based interfaces for sample browsing, uploading and exporting, and project collaboration. \r\n",
