 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will help support he annual Summer Institute in Statistical Genetics. Tuition and travel scholarships are provided for 30 students. The Institute offers a series of 18 three-day workshops on a wide variety of topics in statistical genetics. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the Summer Institute in Statistical Genetics lies in the dissemination of current methods of statistical analysis to population biologists and to population and quantitative geneticists, and to the explanation of issues in current population biology, and population and quantitative genetics to statisticians. The workshops are taught by leaders in the field, many of whom have developed the theories being taught and have written the standard textbooks in those areas.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the Summer Institute in Statistical Genetics lies in the increased awareness among biologists for the power of modern statistical methodology. This proposal is aimed at exposing students in population biology, and population and quantitative genetics to the need for sound statistical analyses of their data, and providing them with the tools for those analyses. The Institute also raises awareness among statisticians about the opportunities for research in population biology, and population and quantitative genetics.\r\n",
