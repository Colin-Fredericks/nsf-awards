 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large scale topology of metric spaces\r\n\r\n   The project is dedicated to the  large scale geometry and topology, \r\na relatively new interdisciplinary subject which studies very large \r\nscale properties of a space. It is opposite to the classical topology \r\nwhich is a science of small scales, since it is based on the notion \r\nof a continuous transformation which is local by the definition. The project\r\nis devoted to the large scale counterparts of the following\r\nclassic topics of topology: Dimension Theory, Cohomology Theory, Theory \r\nof Embeddings. Among the research problems selected for the project are:\r\nThe quest for a large scale analog of Morita theorem that states that\r\nasymptotic dimension increases by one after crossing the space with the reals;\r\nthe quest for the asymptotic analog of Alexandroff theorem connecting\r\ncohomological approach to dimension to geometric one; and a problem \r\nof quasi-isometric embedding of discrete groups into the product of trees.\r\nOne of the main goals of the project is potential \r\napplications to the Novikov Higher Signature Conjecture and some \r\nother related conjectures.\r\n   The classical topology has the century long history and now it \r\nis substantially developed in all directions. Its long and painful \r\nbirth  at the end of 19th and beginning of 20th centuries was inspired and \r\npushed by the progress in natural sciences and mathematics, in particular \r\nin analysis. By the end of the 20th century in many areas\r\nof mathematics the necessity appeared for a discipline which would be\r\nsimilar to topology and which describe  behavior of the large scale world.\r\nSuch a discipline started to hatch in a last decade or so.\r\nThis proposal is a further push for rising of such a science.\r\nThere are already many connections between the asymptotic topology \r\nand applied disciplines. Thus, a part of this project is\r\nthe study of the connection between large scale embeddings into the product of \r\ntrees and aperiodic tilings and hence the quasi-crystals.\r\nAnother connection is to the computer science. It turns out that\r\nthe asymptotic infinite dimensionality\r\nof certain sequence of graphs would give the foundation for PRA\r\n(\"product replacement algorithm\") which is a noncomutative version of Gauss\r\nelimination algorithm. It is known that PRA works well in all instances but\r\nstill it lacks a rigorous mathematical justification.\r\nDeveloping  of the asymptotic dimension theory up to the task \r\nis the heart of the proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
