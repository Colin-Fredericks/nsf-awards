 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large-scale sensor networks that can monitor an environment at close range with high spatial and temporal resolutions are expected to play an important role in various applications, e.g. assessing ``health'' of machines, aerospace vehicles, and civil-engineering structures; environmental, medical, food-safety, and habitat monitoring; energy management, inventory control, home and building automation, etc.  Each node in the network will have limited sensing, signal processing, and communication capabilities, but by cooperating with each other they will accomplish tasks that are difficult to perform with conventional centralized sensing systems.\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on novel solutions for prominent signal processing problems in sensor network design: efficiently extracting information through distributed  (neighborhood-based) processing, mitigating practical difficulties such as node localization errors and spatially correlated measurements, and conserving energy through active node selection.  Distributed Bayesian algorithms are being developed for estimating physical phenomena in the presence of node location uncertainties; ignoring these uncertainties may lead to poor estimation and detection performance.  The investigators also study nonparametric distributed signal processing approaches under the practically important scenario where parametric models for the response function and noise distribution are unknown. Here, the goal is to provide reliable inference about the observed phenomenon that is comparable to that achieved using exact parametric models. Educational goals of the program include incorporating modern teaching techniques and statistical signal processing applications into the undergraduate engineering curriculum and integrating state-of-the-art signal processing into the graduate engineering curriculum at the Iowa State University. The research results and teaching tools developed in this project are made available to a broad scientific community through the Internet and publication in scientific journals.\r\n",

The measurements follow an underdetermined linear model where the  regression-coefficient vector is the sum of an unknown deterministic  sparse signal component and a zero-mean white Gaussian component  with an unknown variance. Our reconstruction schemes are based on an  expectation-conditional maximization either (ECME) iteration that aims at maximizing the likelihood function with respect to the  unknown parameters for a given signal sparsity level.

If the signal sparsity level is unknown,  we introduce an unconstrained sparsity selection (USS)  criterion and a tuning-free automatic double overrelaxation  (ADORE) thresholding method that employs USS to estimate the  sparsity level.  We compare the proposed and existing sparse signal  reconstruction methods via one-dimensional simulation and  two-dimensional image reconstruction experiments using simulated and  real X-ray CT data.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to apply compressive sampling to real NDE data in general and to NDE X-ray CT data in particular. \n(b) We develop a generalized expectation-max..."
