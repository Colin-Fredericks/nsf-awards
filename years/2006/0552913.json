The program director is Ben Jang who is assisted by co-PI William Whaley. Eight students each year will be recruited from 2-year community colleges in the Northeast Texas area to provide research opportunities to individuals who would not otherwise have an opportunity to do undergraduate research. Students will be selected based not only on GPA, but also on the recommendations of instructors, laboratory skills and problem solving ability. Research projects will be in the main areas of organic, inorganic, analytical and physical chemistry. Two field trips are planned to world-class industrial facilities and workshops to improve the students presentation skills and scientific writing are planned. Every student will participate in a poster session at the end of the summer that is open to the university community and the students home institutions.",
