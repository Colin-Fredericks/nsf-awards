Francfort and J-J. Marigo. \r\nThis formulation departs from the classical Griffith theory while\r\npreserving its essence, the competition between surface and bulk\r\nterms.  Doing so, it allows to address the issues of crack path\r\ndetermination, creation of new cracks, and interactions between\r\ncracks.  Its numerical implementation is based on a\r\nGamma-convergence approximation, which gives a natural way to\r\nconsider global minimizations over all possible crack sets.  The\r\ninvestigator extends the existing model to account for the\r\npropagation of cracks under thermal loads and in heterogeneous\r\nmedia and conduct numerical experiments in these areas.  He\r\nbuilds a robust numerical algorithm avoiding most local\r\nminimizers, and studies the link between Gamma-convergence and\r\nlocal minimizers for this model.  He implements an overlapping\r\ndomain decomposition method on supercomputers and studies the\r\nrelation between discretization and regularization parameters. \r\n\r\n     Fracture mechanics is a very active area of research, with\r\nvital applications.  In recent years, the unexpected collapse of\r\nterminal 2F at Charles de Gaulle airport in France, the\r\ndisintegration the Columbia space shuttle upon re-entry, and the\r\ncrash of American Airlines Flight 582 over Queens, NY were all\r\nlinked to unpredicted and unexplained fracture.  In the area of\r\nbrittle fracture (which encompasses materials as diverse as\r\nceramics, glass, and concrete), most commonly accepted theories\r\nare based on Griffith's criterion and are limited to the\r\npropagation of an isolated, pre-existing crack along a given\r\npath.  The investigator extends the analysis and the numerical\r\nimplementation of a generalization of Griffith's theory, proposed\r\nby G. Francfort and J.J. Marigo, that eliminates these\r\nrestrictions.  He extends the current model to account for more\r\ngeneral problems (thermal loads, heterogeneous materials), and\r\nimproves the current numerical implementation on supercomputers. \r\n",
