 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Academy of Engineering (NAE) will convene a committee of leading thinkers\r\nfrom such areas as technology, science, business, politics, and entertainment. They will create a\r\nranked list of the grand challenges and opportunities for engineering facing those born at the\r\ndawn of this new century. This \"blue-ribbon\" committee will then look at engineering research\r\nand innovation either already being explored or which should be considered that might help\r\naddress aspects of each challenge.\r\n\r\nInput from many sources will be considered, including the NAE membership and foreign\r\nassociates, engineering societies worldwide, international Frontiers of Engineering attendees,\r\nengineering students, MacArthur grantees, Intel Science Search winners, NSF Young\r\nInvestigator awardees, and the broader public. The committee will be a diverse, balanced, highprofile,\r\ninternational group with both technical expertise and vision. Key, and unique, to this\r\nproject will be a focus on public outreach. Not only will public input be sought during the\r\ndeliberative process, but results will be shared through a major event in Washington, D.C.,\r\ncollaboration with one or more major media outlets, and a web site designed with students in\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThe main goals of this project are: (1) to improve public understanding of how engineering can\r\naddress current and emerging societal challenges; (2) to excite young people about their potential\r\nto contribute to the world's grand challenges through an engineering career; and (3) to uncover\r\nexamples of engineering research opportunities related to the challenges.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nPublic outreach is a primary goal of this project. The public will be invited to provide input\r\nabout grand challenges to society that engineering and technology might address in the future.\r\nBy actively thinking about large-scale enduring challenges and how engineering and technology\r\nmight meet them, the public will better understand the process of engineering and what issues\r\nengineers can address. Outcomes will show, in an engaging way, how engineering is helping\r\npeople throughout the world. It will illustrate how even some of the most esoteric concepts may\r\nprove to have huge impacts on practical issues ranging from global politics to our own bodies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nNot only will this project contribute to technological literacy by illustrating the impact future\r\ntechnologies may have on our lives, but it will provide a better understand of the engineering\r\nprofession. It will show the process of developing new technologies and the trade-offs involved.\r\nThis project will engage people of all ages in a discussion of technological choices, benefits,\r\nrisks, and values. It will also give the public a clear picture of engineers' roles in society.\r\nBy using high-profile people to generate specific challenges and opportunities, this project will\r\nexcite young people about contributing to society something recent surveys have said they\r\nwant to do. Girls, in particular, are interested in choosing careers that help people. This project\r\nwill vividly illustrate how engineering can accomplish those goals.",
