 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Presidential Scholars Project is increasing the number of high achieving, but financially needy, students earning science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees. Each year the program is recruiting high school and current STEM students as full-time STEM majors. These students are pursuing associate degrees in biology, chemistry, computer science, environmental science, mathematics, or engineering. The goal is to increase the numbers of students who enter the workforce or transfer to a university following completion of an associate degree. \r\n\r\nProject objectives include: (1) recruiting eligible scholars, (2) retaining scholars utilizing Title III-funded retention activities, and (3) ensuring scholar goal attainment of earning an associate degree and either (a) securing a career placement with support from the College Career Placement Office, or (b) pursuing a baccalaureate degree with support of the College Transfer Center.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project lies in the exposure scholars have to faculty and employers rich in STEM experience and the contact scholars have with faculty who conduct research in the areas of mathematical modeling, numerical analysis and scientific computer programming, spread of disease, ecology, and food science. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project is realized in the (1) advancement of students who are primarily ethnic minorities in STEM fields; (2) utilization of HBCU Title III-funded retention activities; (3) project dissemination; and (4) benefit to the community due to the increase of STEM-degreed professionals.\r\n\r\n",
