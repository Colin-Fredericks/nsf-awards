 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe revised proposal seeks funding to develop an inquiry science instruction observation protocol (ISIOP) to identify the nature and extent of inquiry science instruction for for middle school science environments based on previous work of the research team (Inquiry Synthesis Project) that built a comprehensive framework from review of science instruction research on the notion of inquiry science instruction.  The protocol for the current project is expected to derive from the conceptual framework of the previous project work. The ISIOP is claimed to be closely aligned with the National Science Education Standards and the way scientists do science. The research objectives are to: 1) develop a middle grades science classroom observational protocol based on a conceptual framework of inquiry science instruction from previous research and theoretical writings, 2) rigorously test the reliability and validity of the protocol, 3) assess the usability of the protocol by evaluators of science education programs, and 4) disseminate the protocol, reliability and validity trial results, and directions for use through professional evaluator networks. The project is designed to proceed in four phases: ISIOP test framework specification and development (Jan to Oct 2006), classroom pilot test with 10 teachers and 30 observations to establish inter-observer agreement (Oct. 2006 to Jan 2007), classroom pilot test to establish discriminant validity and test tailoring to discipline-specific science contexts (April 2007 to Jan 2008), and evaluator expert analysis  and dissemination to determine usability by target audience (Jan 2008 to Oct. 2008).   \r\n\r\n\r\n",
