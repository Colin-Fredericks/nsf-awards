Such applications  benefit\r\nfrom scalable, robust and secure group services such as\r\none-to-many or many-to-many multicast and distributed data access.\r\nGroup services, in turn, require support from infrastructure protocols\r\nsuch as routing, or security mechanisms such as authentication, access\r\ncontrol and key management.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to advance state-of-the-art  group-oriented\r\nservices in the context of wireless mesh networks.  The project presents\r\nnew formulations of distributed problems capturing the particularities of\r\nwireless mesh networks and the interactions between security, availability\r\nand scalability. It also studies the viability and limitations of cross-layer\r\ndesign as a new paradigm of building secure network services. Innovative\r\nresults consist of scalable one-to-many and many-to-many wireless\r\nmulticast protocols that provide support for efficient group communication, scalable\r\ndata sharing algorithms that are robust to malicious behavior,\r\nhigh-throughput, robust and secure routing that assist applications to achieve\r\nhigh-performance, scalable key management protocols and authentication\r\nmechanisms enabling decentralized infrastructure access services.\r\nThis project contributes to the education of the next generation of secure\r\nsystems designers, generating interactions between the distributed\r\nsystems, security and wireless networks research areas.\r\n",
