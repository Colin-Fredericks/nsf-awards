 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Georgia Topology Conference is an annual conference that has been  organized by several generations of topologists at the University of  Georgia for well over forty years. The conference has focused on many  areas of topology including hyperbolic geometry, laminations,  foliations, 4-manifolds, 3-manifold invariants, symplectic topology  and contact topology. The conference features emerging areas of  research in topology. Typically our conferences feature a several  senior researchers and a large group of young researchers, mostly  recent Ph.D.'s and some graduate students. This format, with its  attention to emerging areas of research, helps this conference play a significant role in both disseminating the newest research and  preparing graduate students and postdocs for a successful research  career in mathematics. We encourage and fund participation by members  of underrepresented groups. Our participants and organizers have  included many women.\r\n\r\nTopology can be viewed as the study of the structure and shape of the  space we live in. As such there are deep relationships between  topology, geometry, and physics. It is this diversity of approaches to central problems that has always energized research in topology.\r\nMore information can be found on the conference web-site\r\nhttp://www.math.uga.edu/~topology/\r\n",
