 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at developing an instrument for online real-time measurement of the sizes of submicron fibers down to 100 nm. Output of this device would be used to control industrial processes for making fine fibers. There is a growing trend of using finer fibers, both in glass and polymer fiber industries, in order to obtain extraordinary properties. Processes used for making fine fibers are operated under extreme conditions, so it is desirable to closely monitor and control them in order to ensure a reliable operation. Currently, there is no technique available to measure submicron fiber size online. The objective of the proposed research is to upgrade the electronics, optics and mechanics of the existing instrument, in order to enable measurement of fibers down to 100 nm. \r\n\r\nBesides providing the fiber industry with an advanced tool to optimize the manufacturing process, this project would have broader economic and environmental impacts by enhancing the efficiency and productivity of a significant manufacturing sector. The total market of products with fibers as the primary component (filters, fabrics, etc.) is worth several hundred billion dollars. Any improvement in the productivity of the pertinent fiberizing processes would result in higher energy efficiency as well as lower pollutant\r\nemissions. \r\n",
