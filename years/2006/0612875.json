 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on more efficient protocols for converting simple starting materials into more complex and valuable products.  The strategy is to use a single sub-stoichiometric additive that can be manipulated in situ to catalyze two or more distinct transformations in a single reaction vessel without the need to purify intermediates between each step.  Ruthenium complexes, which are known to catalyze a wide range of reactions, will be studied to effect several one-pot, multi-step processes including olefin metathesis/olefin isomerization, olefin metathesis/radical atom transfer, metathesis/ketohydroxylation, metathesis/cyclo-addition, and metathesis/cyclopropanation.  \r\n         \r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Marc L. Snapper of the Department of Chemistry at Boston College.  Professor Snapper and his students will be investigating tandem, one pot, and multi-step reactions for the preparation of organic molecules.  Such tandem processes improve overall synthetic efficiency and offer advantages in minimizing time, labor, and material costs.  They also minimize waste production, leading to environmentally friendly preparation processes.",
