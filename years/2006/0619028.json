Of the different imaging modalities, intermittent-contact (TappingModeTM) atomic-force microscopy greatly reduces the effects of adhesion and friction on the probe tip. Here, however, the destabilizing influence of the intermittency of contact may result in probe-tip oscillations with high contact velocity and destructive, nonrepeatable, and unreliable characterization of the nanostructure.\r\n\r\nThis research effort aims to develop and experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of innovative design and control strategies for minimum-contact, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy to successfully and nonintrusively characterize soft physical structures at the nanoscale. Successful application of the proposed control strategies is expected to dramatically improve the repeatability of structure scans and to provide a more faithful representation of surface properties while significantly reducing damage to the measured structure.\r\n\r\nA direct link to industry-relevant problem formulations and a channel for long-term commercialization is provided through a formalized collaboration with Veeco Instruments Inc., a leading provider of nanoscale metrology equipment. This research effort is also integrated with educational and outreach activities of the investigators, through the inclusion of modules on principles of nanoscale characterization in the senior-level undergraduate and first-year graduate-level course \"Modeling MEMS and NEMS\" and through the creation of a promotional brochure on nanoscale science aimed at local and regional high schools.\r\n",
