CSTB provides objective, nonpartisan, scholarly analysis blending in expertise in computer science, electrical engineering, telecommunications, and various applications of information technology (IT).  It engages experts from the entire information technology community in mixed collaborative groups, developing ideas, explanations, assessments, and recommendations reflecting diverse points of view to address the health of the computer science, telecommunications, and their applications in the United States.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The intellectual merit of this project lies in the results of the studies and other activities enabled by this core support. CSTA reports and activities provide a source of strategic thinking that advances understanding of key technologies and play a vital role in helping to develop federal policies in these areas.   \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The work of the CSTB is used by a significant number of agencies, officials, and individuals in the field and is seen as an authoritative source on IT trends. Much of its work also blends IT knowledge with insights from other fields such as biology, the social sciences, economics, and law to provide interdisciplinary perspectives on applications of IT and social and economic impacts.\r\n\r\n",
