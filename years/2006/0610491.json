URI will provide one shipboard technician on each cruise of R/V Endeavor to support seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.  As specialized services, they will maintain and operate an undulating, towed vehicle system that is portable, and is available for use on appropriate R/V Endeavor or other UNOLS vessels as scheduling allows.  The technical support and instrument maintenance provided via this award enables shared-use operation of this oceanographic facility by qualified researchers from throughout the US, and it enables efficient use of the vessel for federally-funded oceanographic research.  Budgets for technical support are evaluated annually, and the cost is based on the proportion of vessel use by each sponsoring agency.\r\n***\r\n",
