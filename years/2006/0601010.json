 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposers will collaborate on a suite of main projects in the \r\ncombinatorics, geometry, and topology of Grassmannians, flag manifolds, \r\nand their Schubert varieties. These varieties are central to questions \r\nspanning many areas of classical mathematics, such as algebraic topology, \r\nenumerative geometry, and representation theory. They hope to resolve some \r\nthorny questions about classification of singularities and topology of \r\nSchubert varieties, e.g. the 30-year old problem of the \r\nfixed-point-property for Grassmannians. They also propose several \r\nadditional projects, continuing some of the PI and co-PI's past work in \r\nalgebraic combinatorics.  These projects relate to the recently discovered \r\n\"cyclic sieving phenomenon\", to alternating subgroups of Coxeter groups, \r\nand to critical groups of graphs.  Some of these projects are outgrowths \r\nof the PI's past (NSF-funded) REU's.\r\n\r\nThe appeal of this work is that counting problems, one of the staples of \r\nthe field of combinatorics, which seem unrelated to algebra or geometry \r\nsometimes find the key to their solution and/or application in these other \r\nareas. This has been particularly true for the algebraic/geometric objects \r\nin this proposal:  the Schubert varieties in flag manifolds and \r\nGrassmannians.  These objects are the key to understanding how lines and \r\nplanes can tilt and intersect at different angles in the two-dimensional \r\nplane, in three-dimensional space, and in higher dimensions.\r\n\r\n",
