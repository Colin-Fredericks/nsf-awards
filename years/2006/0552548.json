The objectives of the REU program are to: (1) provide a significant number of research opportunities for women and underrepresented minority students; (2) build a diverse pipeline of future graduate students; (3) educate students to recognize the value, significance and broad range of interdisciplinary research being conducted in the College of Engineering; (4) develop a College-wide infrastructure that supports students and faculty engaged in undergraduate research while establishing funding to continue a permanent REU program; and (5) create stronger relationships for research and educational exchanges between faculty and students at its partner institutions. This REU program will support 12 students per year for 3 years.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: REU students will work on a research project and be mentored by faculty who are leading experts in their field. The program is designed to guide the students toward graduate school.  One of the key outcomes of the REU program will be to further enhance the infrastructure for research and education in the College of Engineering by establishing a permanent program that will continue after this award period ends.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts:  The REU site program will focus on preparing students, especially women and underrepresented minorities, for graduate education. The College is committed to, and places a priority on, including students from underrepresented groups in its REU program. Its goal is to have 50% female and 33% minority participation. The nations academic institutions will benefit from an increased number of students, particularly women and minorities entering the professorial ranks. \r\n",
