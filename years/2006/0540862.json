 "awd_abstract_narration": "Background\r\n\r\nWidely recognized problems of programming with threads and locks include race conditions,\r\npriority inversion, and deadlock, problems notoriously difficult both to avoid and to diagnose.\r\nWe need better abstractions for ordinary programmers to use to exploit concurrency. A promising\r\ndirection that solves the problems with locks is the various forms of atomic action (AA).\r\nAn AA is a collection of computational actions that are guaranteed to appear to occur: either\r\nentirely or not at all, and in a definite order with respect to other AAs. Atom-like notions\r\nhave enjoyed great success in database applications.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\n-A precise programming model for AAs, with a focus on closed and open nesting.\r\n- Overheads of alternative AA implementations on existing hardware.\r\n- Performance benefits of AAs resulting from increased parallelism, despite their overheads.\r\n- Hardware-assist for AAs: hardware interfaces (APIs) and virtualization to mask hardware limits.\r\n- AAs vis-a-vis non-transactional activities such as I/O, networking, etc.\r\n- AAs vis-a-vis run-time services such as garbage collection (GC), exceptions, and traps.\r\n- Tools for profiling and tuning performance of AAs, and their refinement re: bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nDelivering on AAs will lead to significant economic and security benefits\r\nthrough improved robustness and performance of applications for new commodity hardware. AAs\r\nwill make it possible to increase concurrency, and thus performance, of software while also increasing\r\nreliability and simplifying tuning and maintenance. Ordinary programmers will more readily exploit\r\nthread-level parallelism on the desktop, writing programs they could not write, and get to work, before.\r\nThe project will benefit the hardware industry by exploiting their new offerings, and the software\r\nindustry by increasing the robustness of concurrent software, while also contributing to economic and\r\nnational security. All project results and tools will be available to the public, and the project will train\r\ngraduates in important high-demand skills, and thus contribute to the technical work-force.",
