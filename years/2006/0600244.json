The aim of this project is to\r\nunderstand how good these expanders are by estimating the related\r\nKazdan constants. As well as objectives which would be both deep\r\nand of practical use, the project has elementary aspects\r\nwhich can be presented at an undergraduate level\r\nand thus serve educational purposes.\r\n",
