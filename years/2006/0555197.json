In\r\nparticular, the following topics will be studied: (1) The\r\nFrenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman's uniqueness conjecture of the moonshine\r\nvertex operator algebra. The goal is to prove the conjecture completely\r\nand to obtain a characterization of the Griess algebra (independent of\r\nthe monster simple group). This is a part of program of classification\r\nof holomorphic vertex operator algebras of central charge 24. (2) The\r\nchiral ring (which was defined by physicists in the study of super\r\nconformal field theory and super string theory) of a N=2 unitary vertex\r\noperator superalgebra and elliptic genus of a Calabi-Yau manifold. The\r\npurpose is to understand the role that the chiral ring plays in the\r\nstructure and representation theory  of vertex operator superalgebra,\r\nand to investigate to what extend the chiral ring of the vertex\r\noperator superalgebra associated to a Calabi-Yau manifold determines\r\nthe elliptic genus of the manifold. (3) The connection between vertex\r\noperator algebra (an algebraic approach to conformal field theory) and\r\nconformal nets (an analytic approach to conformal field theory). This\r\nis a long term program. The goal is to construct vertex operator\r\nalgebras and conformal nets from each other. This will lead to a\r\nunification of  the algebraic and analytic approaches to 2 dimensional\r\nconformal field theory.\r\n\r\nThe theory of vertex operator algebra provides an algebraic foundation\r\nfor the 2 dimensional quantum conformal field theory in physics and is\r\nalso deeply related to many important areas of mathematics such as\r\nrepresentation theory, group theory, modular forms, topology\r\ninvariants, and C*-algebras. The planned research links vertex algebra\r\noperator algebras with topology, C*-algebras and quantum field theory,\r\nand has important applications in both mathematics and physics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
