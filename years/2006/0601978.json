 "awd_abstract_narration": "In broad collaboration with the IODP, ICDP, ice-core, limnogeology and paleolimnology research communities, the CoreWall Consortium (the LacCore at the U. of Minnesota, Borehole Research Group at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, Electronic Visualization Laboratory at U. of Illinois at Chicago, and INSTAAR at the U. of Colorado) will jointly develop CoreWall Suite, a real-time stratigraphic correlation, core description (CD) and data visualization system to be used by the marine, terrestrial and Antarctic science communities. The work model forged by the CoreWall Suite will significantly alter and enhance the current approaches used for core description and analysis of sediment and rock cores by providing an integrated environment for these activities, for both field and repository environments. In particular, the CoreWall Suite will incorporate the new NCLIP software, the updated version of CLIP (e.g.,Sagan and Splicer) that was developed by the Lamont group more than 10 years ago. The CoreWall Suite will be portable, able to work on a variety of display platforms such as laptops and tiled displays, hence allowing it to be used in the field, laboratory and individual office settings. This project entails a variety of significant broader impacts including involvement of undergraduate and graduate students. The CoreWall Suite will be useful for a variety of outreach activities as well as classroom use.",
