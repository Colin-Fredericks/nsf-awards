 "awd_abstract_narration": "The third Nano and Giga Challenges, titled \"Symposium and School on Nano and Giga Challenges on Nanoelectronics and Photonics: From Atoms to Materials to Devices to System Architecture,\" will be held at Arizona State University from March 12-16, 2007.  The first two days will consist of a series of tutorial lectures (Spring School) by internationally renowned scientists and university faculty. These lectures are targeted for graduate students and engineers and scientists not directly working in the field. The lectures will be complimented by hands-on training in ASU research laboratories and will be published in the Springer Nanoscience and Technology Series as was done after the first two meetings held in Moscow (NGCM2002) and Krakow (NGCM2004) respectively. Two journal issues and the book have been published after each meeting.\r\n\r\nFunding is requested to support student participation at this conference. Several avenues have been created to promote student interest and involvement: A student paper contest has been set up to increase ASU and national-level student participation and awareness of Nanoscale technology issues. A poster session will offer students an opportunity to interface with scientists in their field of research. Students can serve as conference volunteers and part-time assistants (paid by conference grants provided to ASU by sponsors). In addition, students are also welcome to attend presentations during the symposium period of the conference. The conference will also provide employment networking opportunities both at the conference website and at the job fair in the exhibition area of the meeting.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis conference aims to bring together academic and corporate scientists and engineers to enhance an exchange of ideas and to advance an understanding of the problems and potential areas of new solutions in nanotechnology for electronics and photonics, ranging from contemporary to advanced microelectronics to future molecular, bio and optoelectronics. The goal is to contribute to a fundamental understanding of specific nanoscale technology problems and approaches to help solve these technical challenges that provide the basis for today's information technology.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe conference will make possible a gathering of leading scientists, engineers and managers from academia, national labs and industry to discuss new solutions in nanotechnology for electronics and photonics, ranging from contemporary to advanced microelectronics to future molecular, bio and optoelectronics. Additionally, students who participate in the conference will have an opportunity to network and collaborate with established researchers in the field of nanoelectronics and photonics. The NGC2007 meeting in Arizona will continue in the tradition of the two previous conferences of publishing tutorial lectures in the form of a book and the research papers in two or three journal issues. The meeting will also provide grounds to enhance business opportunities and international visibility of the local start-up companies. It will provide an effective opportunity for large companies to contribute in the development of the nanotech business infrastructure and education in Arizona as well.\r\n\r\n",
