 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intellectual objectives of this proposal are to develop strategies for spontaneous patterning of self-assembled monolayers prepared from organic molecules on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite, to use self-patterning, self-assembled monolayers to control assembly of single component and multi-component nanoparticles systems on HOPG and to explore the optical and magnetic properties of patterned nanoparticle systems as a function of composition and geometry. If successful, this will result in methods for spontaneous assembly of small nanoparticles on the small nanometer length scale. Professor Zimmt will use synthetic organic chemistry to design molecules that will permit deposition of patterned organic monolayers on graphite (HOPG). Linking metal and semiconductor nanoparticles to the organic layers can further functionalize the patterned monolayers. This work includes creation of 1,5-substituted anthracenes and triptycenes molecules that can be functionalized with linking groups, which in turn will bind metal or semiconductor nanoparticles. In this way, highly ordered arrays with perfectly spaced metal or semiconductor nanoparticle monolayers can be formed with full control over the interparticle spacing in the 1-4 nm range. Though many studies have been done on patterning of organic chains on clean surfaces, the synthetic chemistry introduced is highly creative, and will enable both specific control of surface patterns, as well as a detailed understanding of the properties that determine surface morphology.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Matthew Zimmt of Brown University who will develop new methods that will allow fabrication of closely spaced structures for use in molecular electronics and nanotechnology and whose research will provide discipline-integrated training for graduate students and undergraduates.\r\n",
