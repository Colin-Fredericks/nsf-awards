 "awd_abstract_narration": "Disterigma, a genus of Neotropical blueberries, grows in the threatened northern Andean cloud forests. Morphological and molecular studies will be conducted to understand the characteristics, diversity, habitat, and endemism of the various species. Specimens from major European herbaria will be examined and new observations and analyses will be made from samples collected from the field. The project will conclude with a published revision of Disterigma for the Neotropics.\r\n\r\nThis is the first systematic revision of a genus in the Blueberry Family (Ericaceae) from the Neotropics that combines traditional morphology and modern molecular analysis. Data from this study will provide a framework for testing hypotheses of speciation and biogeography in Andean plants. The revision will contain descriptions, keys, illustrations, distribution maps, and illustrations needed to identify species. It will also provide information about the habitat, conservation status, and uses of Disterigma. This aspect of the work is essential for the assessment and conservation of the thirteen species that are threatened and the twenty that have restricted distributions. This study will help to justify the protection of areas that are undergoing change from increased human occupation. Results will raise public awareness about Andean biodiversity and the urgent need to preserve it.\r\n",
