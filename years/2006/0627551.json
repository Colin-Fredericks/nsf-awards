 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nExisting distributed authorization systems focus on the formulation of\r\npolicy, but enforcement remains a per-host issue.  Failure of any\r\ncomponent to faithfully enforce policy can lead to vulnerabilities,\r\nand in the extreme, renders authorization impotent.  Without greater\r\nassurance in the integrity of authorization enforcement, that scales\r\nto Internet-wide applications, reliable, distributed authorization\r\ncannot be built.\r\n\r\nThe Shared Reference Monitor (Shamon) project leverages advances in\r\nintegrity measurement and virtual machines to compose a coherent\r\nauthorization system for distributed applications.  A Shamon consists\r\nof a set of reference monitors on multiple, physical machines that are\r\nintegrity-verified to enforce a consistent security policy across\r\nvirtual machines that define an application.  The use of virtual\r\nmachines provides coarse-grained isolation that simplifies security\r\npolicy for large-scale distributed systems, and the integrity\r\nmeasurement ensures that each member of the Shamon can verify that the\r\nothers are enforcing this policy.\r\n\r\nThe Shamon project focuses on building the services to\r\ncompose and maintain such shared reference monitors.  First, a\r\nlogic-based approach is defined that enables composition of trust in\r\nthe enforcement of a consistent policy by the Shamon reference\r\nmonitors.  Such trust composition will be robust in the presence of\r\nsystem dynamics including the joining, leaving and migration of\r\nvirtual machines.  Second, the Xen hypervisor system is augmented with\r\nthese trust composition services.  In this way, monitored applications\r\nwill only communicate with systems whose regulation is consistent with\r\nits Shamon policy.  \r\n\r\n",
