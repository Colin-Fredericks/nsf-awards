 "awd_abstract_narration": "Roy\r\n0547252\r\n\r\nThe objective of this CAREER award is to develop efficient bioengineering tools to direct mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and ultimately to therapeutic, antigen-specific T cells suitable for immunotherapy and transplantation. In particular, the effects of 3D scaffold structures and various bioreactor cultures on hematopoietic differentiation of ES cells will be studied. Artificial thymus-like environments will be created using microbead-based signaling (synthetic thymic stromal cell) and tetramer-directed antigen presentation (artificial antigen presenting cell) to direct ES cell-derived HPCs into functional T cells. The research objectives, if successful, would lead to the development of scalable methods for generation of hematopoietic stem cells and T cells from ES cells. This could ultimately provide a readily available source for on demandadministration of therapeutic cells in a variety of complex clinical disorders, especially cancers. The educational objectives include community outreach programs for 9th and 10th graders, involving graduate and undergraduate biomedical engineering students and learning scientists from the University of Texas as well as science teachers from area high schools. The PI will also develop challenge-centered teaching modules based on how people learn (HPL) concepts through regular workshops involving high school science teachers and their students.",
