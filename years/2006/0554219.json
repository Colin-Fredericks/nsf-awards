 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore the role of teacher-student discourse in mathematics classes in grades 9 and 10.  Their work will take place at one high school with a very diverse student body in New York.  They will implement this study to evaluate strategies for improving the frequency and conceptual richness of teacher-student discourse.  Since none currently exists in the mathematics education community, the researchers will develop a discourse assessment instrument (DI) for the mathematics classroom.  The first year of the project will be used to design and refine this instrument.  The researchers will form a study group of teachers at the high school and have them discuss research literature, reflect on practice as observed through the use of the discourse instrument, modify and refine the discourse instrument and explore new strategies.  All of this is to be done with a view towards increasing teacher-student rich mathematical discourse and making the teachers action researchers in the project.  Two of the lead researchers have been involved in facilitating study groups with teachers in their previous work.  The researchers will use teachers as action researchers in this project.  Teachers will explore literature on methodology and on classroom discourse.  They will engage in research in their own and each other's classrooms, keep journals, participate in designing and refining the instruments and strategies and will disseminate findings along with the research team.",
