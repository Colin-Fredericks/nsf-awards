The approach is to build a mathematical model based on cells physiological and electrical properties and validated by experiments, starting with endothelial and epithelial cells. Identification and modeling of a complex cell system is unlike any engineering modeling problem and imposes a very challenge task to identification researchers. New identification methods have to be developed and analyzed. Especially, identification methods for systems described by a nonlinear partial differential equation have to be developed. It is expected that the results of the research will lay a foundation for identification and modeling of other non-engineering systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe research will impact on understanding of cells at the nanometer level and on new drug developments. For example, endothelial and epithelial cells provide protective barriers to maintain homeostatic separation of tissue compartments. Inflammatory disorders, e.g., a number of lung diseases, depend on alterations in endothelial and epithelial cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. It is critical to understand such behavior in order to treat these disorders. With the developed model, cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion properties could be studied under different drug stimuli so new drugs could be tested and developed. The research will have an impact on education. It will lead to Ph.D./MS theses and provide promising undergraduate students an opportunity to be involved in the state of the art research. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
