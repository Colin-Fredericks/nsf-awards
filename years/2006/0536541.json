The project team is developing a set of ten laboratory experiment modules for a target audience of second-year science and engineering undergraduate students.  The experiments include the use of scanning probe microscopy (SPM), the study of electron diffraction, absorption of light by quantum dots and photoluminescence from quantum dots.  The hands-on laboratory course is complementing a recently developed lecture-based course funded by Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education.  Anticipated outcomes for science and engineering undergraduate students include: an understanding of fundamental concepts involved in nanotechnology; hands-on experience using advanced tools to characterize, analyze, and synthesize experimental results; and increased awareness of career opportunities in the area of nanotechnology.  Both formative and summative evaluation methods are used in project assessment.  Evaluation efforts are coordinated by a faculty member in the area of Science Education.  The project also includes faculty from two Community colleges assisting in the development, implementation, and dissemination of the course as well as active participation by the team in the development of an interactive exhibit on nanotechnology and K-12 science teachers to perform experiments related to the exhibit.\r\n",
