 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Robert L. Last (Michigan State University)\r\n\r\nCoPIs:  David R. Gang (University of Arizona), Gregg A. Howe (Michigan State University), A. Daniel Jones (Michigan State University), Eran Pichersky (University of Michigan), and Curtis Wilkerson (Michigan State University)\r\n\r\nCollaborators: HyeRan Kim (University of Arizona), Kenneth Nadler (Michigan State University), and Carol A. Soderlund (University of Arizona)\r\n\r\nThe long term goal of this project is to lay a foundation for a complete 'systems biology' understanding of the entire network of genes and proteins involved in the development of each of the different types of glandular trichomes found in tomato and related species in the Solanum and the full set of genes and enzymes responsible for their biosynthetic capacity. The glandular trichomes are chosen as the focus of this project because these fascinating cell-surface structures make a wide variety of structurally and biosynthetically diverse small molecules. These specialized (secondary) products come from many different biosynthetic pathways and are known or postulated to serve a variety of roles in stress adaptation, including providing defense against important plant pests. Comparison of genes found from the EST sequences and metabolites found in the different gland types will be used to discover new biosynthetic enzymes, and these will be tested for function by in vitro biochemical methods and by in vivo methods using transgenic plants. Mutants and introgression lines will be evaluated for changes in glandular trichome morphology and chemistry and genetic analysis initiated for future identification of genes that are responsible for these novel phenotypes. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThese studies should inform breeding and transgenic approaches to improving stress tolerance in agriculturally important plants. The data from this project will be provided to GenBank, The SOL Genomics Network (http://sgn.cornell.edu/) and made available through a project website. This project will integrate research and education in three ways: 1. Summer research experiences for undergraduate students and secondary school teachers; 2. Training of students in successful approaches to doing research in an interdisciplinary and geographically dispersed environment, which is becoming more and more important for success in the biological sciences; 3. Training of participants in cutting-edge, computer-based curriculum development tools with the Lon-CAPA web-based course management system developed at Michigan State University. A strong emphasis will be placed on recruitment and training of underrepresented minorities and women.",
