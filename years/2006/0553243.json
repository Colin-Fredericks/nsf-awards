Mullins\r\n\r\nInstitution:  \tUniversity of Texas at Austin\r\n\r\nAnalysis (rationale for decision):\r\n\r\n\r\nFilms consisting of highly porous, planar arrays of titania (TiO2) nanocolumns will be grown by reactive vapor deposition at a glancing angle. It is anticipated that such films will have useful chemical properties since (i) the films have high intrinsic surface area, (ii) the individual nanocolumns which compose the film have reduced dimensionality, and (iii) the films have a large concentration of surface defects.  These qualities, along with the intrinsic properties of TiO2, suggest that titania nanocolumnar arrays have potential for promoting useful catalytic chemical processes. Further investigations in the project involve chemically-modifying the TiO2 nanocolumns (initially by adding nitrogen) in order to modify/enhance the selectivity and/or activity of the surface chemistry.  Electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and ultrahigh vacuum surface science techniques will be used to physically and chemically characterize both the pure and chemically modified films.  Initial studies will focus on the dissociation of water, the reduction of NOx, and the partial oxidation of methanol employing these films.  \r\n\r\nIn this project students will collaborate with two senior scientists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in addition to conducting research with two senior faculty members at their home institution.  Students from under-represented groups will be recruited for involvement in the research project.  Mentoring from a broad perspective will be a key component of the project.  The students involved in the project will communicate their findings at local and national meetings as well as through archival journals, book chapters, and review papers. Some of the discovered results will be included in course-work materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
