 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to develop and understand homological invariants \r\nof three- and four-dimensional topological objects. Such invariants \r\ninclude Donaldson-Floer and Seiberg-Witten theories, and several \r\nbigraded homology theories of links. These theories have the Alexander \r\nand Jones polynomials as their Euler characteristics, as well as the \r\nquantum sl(3) link invariant. We would like to construct a bigraded \r\nhomology theory of links for each complex simple Lie algebra g, with \r\ncomponents of links colored by irreducible representation of g. The \r\nEuler characteristic of the theory should be the quantum invariant \r\nof colored links associated with the quantum deformation of g, and \r\nthe theory should be functorial (extend to cobordisms of links). \r\nOur other goals include better understanding of the relations between \r\nexisting theories, and an investigation of the categories that \r\nappear when link homology theories are extended to tangles. \r\n\r\nTopological objects in dimensions three and four have special properties \r\nand a number of connections to algebra and analysis that do not generalize \r\nto other dimensions. Three-dimensional objects, including knots, links, \r\nand three-manifolds (the latter are global objects glued out of three-dimensional \r\nspaces), admit combinatorial invariants, also known as quantum invariants, \r\nthat come from algebraic structures and can also be recovered from \r\ntwo-dimensional conformal field theories. Quantum invariants of \r\nfour-dimensional objects, for the most part, are not known to have combinatorial \r\ndescriptions, and their definition and computation requires analytical \r\ntools. We would like to bridge this gap by constructing new four-dimensional \r\ninvariants that are combinatorial, and, second, by finding combinatorial \r\ndescription of known analytical invariants of four-manifolds, including \r\nDonaldson-Floer and Seiberg-Witten invariants.",
