 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of two parts. The first part is concerned with estimation of moment\r\ncondition models. A new estimation method that achieves an asymptotic minimax efficiency\r\nproperty is proposed. The second part explores nonparametric identifiability for finite mixture\r\nmodels, and develops a semiparametric estimator.\r\nIntellectual merit of the proposed activities\r\nThe first part aims at providing a method for estimating moment condition models, which\r\nare usually estimated by the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) in the current applied\r\nliterature. This research is motivated by the recent concerns that the performance of GMM\r\nmay be problematic under empirically relevant data generating processes. The conventional\r\nlocal first-order efficiency theory is of limited use for analyzing this problem. This part of the\r\nproposal develops a global first-order efficiency theory for moment condition models using the\r\nlarge deviation principle (LDP), which is a major subject in probability theory. It then proposes\r\na new estimator that achieves the asymptotic minimax efficiency bound in a large deviation\r\nsense. The new estimator uses Owens empirical likelihood as a crucial ingredient; indeed, it\r\ncan be interpreted as a robustified version of the conventional empirical likelihood estimator.\r\nPreliminary simulation results imply that the new method outperforms competing estimators,\r\nthough more experimental studies will be undertaken in the project. Empirical applications of\r\nthe method to panel data models and further theoretical extensions of the method are planned.\r\nThe second part considers finite mixture models. Finite mixture models allow applied\r\nresearchers to deal with parameter variations, such as unobserved heterogeneity or unobserved\r\nregimes, in a convenient and interpretable way. The existing literature on finite mixture models,\r\nhowever, focuses on parametric models. The proposed research develops nonparametric\r\nidentification theory for finite mixtures, where components of a mixture model are treated\r\nnonparametrically. While a few studies have succeeded in treating such models, they demand\r\nspecifications such as symmetric distributions or multiple independent observations from each\r\nobservation unit. This research takes an approach that is very different from these studies and\r\nshows that nonparametric identification is possible by using variations in covariates. It also proposes\r\na new estimation algorithm for a semiparametric finite mixture model. Generalizations of\r\nthese results, including their extensions to dynamic models, will be explored.\r\nBroader impacts of the proposed activities\r\nThe broader impacts of the results from the proposed activities include the following. First,\r\nthe project will produce computer programs that will be made accessible to public. For example,\r\nthe research on minimax estimation will yield computer software for the new procedure. This\r\neffort, as a byproduct, will include developing a reliable program for implementing empirical\r\nlikelihood methods, which have been attracting a great deal of attention among practitioners.\r\nThis will benefit a broad range of communities. Second, graduate students will be supported\r\ndirectly and indirectly by the proposed project. Past NSF support enabled graduate students to\r\nparticipate in projects of the PI as research assistants. This provided them with financial support\r\nas well as opportunities to learn state-of-the-art econometrics and programming skills. The\r\nproposed project will continue to support graduate students and provide them with the skills and\r\nknowledge necessary for their thesis research and early career development. Third, econometric\r\nmethodologies from this project will be used to analyze empirical economic problems. This\r\nincludes applications of the new minimax estimation method to models of income dynamics,\r\nwhich have important policy implications. The proposed methods are expected to shed new\r\nlight on economic problems that are highly relevant to a broad audience.",
