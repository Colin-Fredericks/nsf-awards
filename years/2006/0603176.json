 "awd_abstract_narration": "A-1\r\nLouis Stokes Colorado Alliance for Minority Participation\r\nCO-AMP Phase III Project Summary\r\nColorado State University (CSU) in collaboration with the University of Colorado at Boulder, Fort Lewis\r\nCollege, Colorado State University at Pueblo, Metropolitan State College of Denver, the University of Colorado at\r\nColorado Springs, the University of Colorado at Denver, Colorado School of Mines, Adams State College, Trinidad\r\nState Junior College, Pueblo Community College, Din College, AIMS Community College, four tribal nations, and\r\nindustry constitute part of the CO-AMP consortium that was formed in 1995/96. The consortium is proposing COAMP\r\nPhase III that will undertake a comprehensive effort to address the following activities in connection with\r\nunder-represented students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines:\r\nRecruitment, retention & leadership programs \r\nLongitudinal tracking\r\nSummer outreach programs  Graduate school placement\r\nThe primary goal of the LS CO-AMP Phase III Proposal is to continue increasing the number of\r\nunderrepresented minority students successfully completing baccalaureates degrees in STEM disciplines in\r\nColorado.\r\nPhase III of CO-AMP will build upon the momentum and the success of LS CO-AMP, which began in\r\n1995. The underrepresented students (Hispanic, African American, Native American, and Pacific Islanders) who are\r\nenrolled in the undergraduate STEM degree programs at the participating institutions will benefit greatly from the\r\nproposed activities. The efforts of the Consortium will extend from the pre-freshmen level to enrollment in graduate\r\nschool programs. The CO-AMP consortium has been the major driving force at the institutions involved since 1995\r\nto encourage and motivate students to excel and graduate with a B.S. degree in the STEM fields. The enrollment and\r\nvisibility of diverse students has increased at the participating institutions which is demonstrated by the 68%\r\nincrease in the LS CO-AMP enrollment since its inception. Student performance in their respective disciplines has\r\nimproved tremendously. A significant level of support, in addition to that from the NSF, has been provided by the\r\ncentral administrations, the Departments and Colleges of the Consortium institutions, Industry, and the Colorado\r\nInstitute of Technology. Very importantly, the faculty and staff members of the Consortium institutions have\r\nprovided essential support without which the activities of LS CO-AMP could not have been so successful. CO-AMP\r\nparticipating institutions, industry, tribal councils and the Colorado Commission on Higher Education are expected\r\nto continue their support of the project from 2006 to 2011. The success of this consortium will continue to be shared\r\nwith the other LS AMPs in the nation. In addition, CO-AMP will work with the Alliance for Graduate Education\r\nand the Professoriate (AGEP) to place more underrepresented students in STEM graduate studies.\r\nBy linking the resources of the Consortium institutions and partners and by continuing ongoing efforts to\r\nsolicit funding from all available sources, LS CO-AMP will continue to promote institutionalizing the successful\r\nprograms it has developed within the Consortium institutions. This is essential to assure that the benefits to\r\nstudents, which occur from these programs, continue after funding from the NSF is no longer available.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nColorado LS CO AMP is looking to continue increasing the number of underrepresented undergraduate\r\nstudents graduating with a Bachelors Degree in STEM disciplines. In addition, LS CO-AMP Phase III is planning\r\nto matriculate underrepresented (UREP) students into graduate school to ensure a future balance of the\r\nrepresentation of minority students in STEM graduate disciplines. During Phase III, the Consortium will work\r\ntoward institutionalizing and sustaining its program activities after the NSF Funding expires. LS CO-AMP has had\r\nconsiderable success during Phase I and II, and the Consortiums success will be amplified during the proposed LS\r\nCO-AMP Phase III project. The anticipated successful collaboration with the Colorado Commission on Higher\r\nEducation, the legislature, and congressional representatives, will strengthen the sustainability of LS CO-AMP in the\r\nState of Colorado.\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThrough the assessment of the activities and the collaboration of LS CO-AMP with other alliances such as\r\nAGEP, McNair Scholarships Program, and Rocky Mountain Middle School Math Science Partnership, LS CO AMP\r\nplans to increase awareness of cultural differences and necessary institutional changes to positively sustain support\r\nof UREP STEM undergraduate and graduate students after NSF funding expires. Moreover, the results of the Phase\r\nIII programs and activities will add substantially to the understanding of the issues and the challenges of UREP\r\nstudents in graduate and undergraduate STEM disciplines. The focus of LS CO-AMP Phase III is to continue the\r\nrecruitment and the retention activities of Phase I and Phase II, as well as to matriculate the UREP undergraduate\r\nstudents into graduate school. This commitment to graduate education will produce more UREP STEM faculty\r\nmembers who, in turn, will help in bringing more diverse students to the classroom. It will also enable effective and\r\nsustainable institutional transformation to enhance diversity in STEM disciplines. In addition, this diversity\r\ncommitment will improve the overall climate for UREP students in the State of Colorado and nationwide.",
