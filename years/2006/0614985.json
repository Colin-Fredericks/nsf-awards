 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to implement and leverage a system that can\r\nbrowse the past execution of a computer.  \"Browsing\" refers to the ability\r\nfor a user to search, analyze, summarize, restore, or replay arbitrary data\r\nor events that existed or occurred sometime in the past on that user's\r\ncomputer.  These capabilities depend on two foundational techniques.\r\nVirtual-machine introspection allows the system to understand the execution\r\nof a virtual machine as it executes or replays, without perturbing that\r\nexecution or replay.  Virtual-machine replay allows the system to re-execute\r\na past time interval of the virtual machine instruction-by-instruction, yet\r\nat only a few percentage overhead in time and space.\r\n\r\nThe ability to browse the past execution of one's computer can benefit\r\nsociety by providing new capabilities to administrators, users, and\r\nprogrammers.  Administrators can use this ability to secure computers more\r\neffectively by detecting past intrusions, which may help shrink the ranks\r\nof \"bot armies\" controlled by criminals and spammers.  Elderly people with\r\nmemory loss can use this ability to recall the events that occurred on\r\ntheir computers, such as e-mail exchanges and GUI interactions.  Programmers\r\ncan use this ability to fix difficult non-deterministic bugs and thereby\r\nimprove the overall robustness of the software on which society has come to\r\ndepend.\r\n",
