 "awd_abstract_narration": "The human brain comprises ~100 billion neurons precisely organized into networks by specific cell-cell contacts called synapses that give rise to cognitive phenomena such as emotion, learning and memory, and perception. During development, the intricate and precise patterns of neuronal synapses are formed. Synapse formation is initiated by special proteins at the presynaptic and postsynaptic cell surfaces upon cell-cell contact. Dr. Elva Diaz (Principal Investigator) and members of her laboratory have identified a new group of related proteins that are found at the postsynaptic neuronal cell surface. Interestingly, different family members of this new gene family are expressed in specific brain regions, suggesting a role for these molecules in determining synaptic specificity. Their hypothesis is that these proteins are involved in postsynaptic differentiation and transmit signals to the presynaptic neuron to cause recruitment of synaptic vesicles, the first step in the formation of new synapses. In this application, Dr. Diaz proposes experiments using genetic manipulations in mice and methods to identify other molecules with which these proteins interact in order to understand how this interesting class of proteins functions during synapse formation.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed activities include integration of the research and education activities specifically in the context of broadening the participation of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups (primarily Hispanic/Latino). As an active participant in campus programs aimed to increase the number of underrepresented students pursuing postgraduate degrees in science, Dr. Diaz is in a strong position to recruit such students to her laboratory as members of the research team for this proposal. Undergraduate participation will be directed by Dr. Diaz in conjunction with doctoral students in the laboratory, thereby integrating research, teaching, and community outreach activities for students pursuing graduate studies in the Diaz laboratory.\r\n",
