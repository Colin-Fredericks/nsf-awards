It includes the development of functionality as well as visualization tools for editing bathymetry, analyzing sonar bias parameters, and real-time survey display.  The work permits on-going user support, improvement of software documentation, and support for new sonar data formats.  The heart of the system is an input/output library that allows programs to work transparently with any of the 61 supported swath sonar data formats.   Through this approach, generic utilities can be developed that can be applied in a uniform manner to sonar data from a variety of sources.  Data to which this software is applied includes bathymetry, beam intensity, and sides can data.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts:  Broader impacts of the work are increasing the infrastructure for science, serving the needs of researchers using multi-beam sonar data for marine geology and geophysics research, and facilitating data analysis and visualization.  This work supports researchers at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory in New York and at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California.\r\n\r\n",
