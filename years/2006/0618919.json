 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives. What religious goals did Charlemagne (ruled 768-814) hope to achieve by supporting\r\na revival of scientific knowledge at the beginning of the ninth century? How were royal political\r\nlegitimacy and science related in Charlemagne's striving for greater order in his kingdom and\r\nempire? In what ways did royal court culture and the education of clerics intersect and promote\r\nthe sciences? Intellectual Merit    In answering these questions the project will present Charlemagne's case for ordering a reform of Christian knowledge as part of a broad renewal of the religious culture in his\r\nrealm. This religious renewal included the vision of Charlemagne and his dynasty as divinely\r\nchosen to direct the ordering of Christian Europe and improve Christian education within it. The\r\nking assembled from Italy, England, Ireland, and elsewhere scholars with extensive knowledge to\r\nhis court. The court itself emerged as a source and a point of dissemination for revived or\r\nrediscovered literary texts and scientific knowledge along with fuller exploration of writings by\r\nthe church Fathers and more recent Christian authors. Using the advice of various scholars, both\r\nsecular and clerical, the king oversaw doctrinal reform, ordered attention to specific areas of\r\nstudy in the education of clerics, and stimulated the interest of ecclesiastical leaders in a renewal\r\nand expansion of the liberal arts as an essential foundation for biblical and doctrinal\r\nunderstanding. The project will show how certain of these leaders pursued a distinctive\r\ninterpretation of Saint Augustine's view of secular scientific knowledge in order to justify an\r\nextensive revival and teaching of classical Roman texts (and some translated Greek texts) on\r\nastronomy, cosmology, medicine, agriculture, mathematics, and military science among others.\r\nThe nature of these texts, illustrations from their pages, the ways they were studied in the\r\nCarolingian renaissance of the ninth century  all these will be exposed. The search for and\r\ndiscovery of order in the heavens, the weather, human physiology, the structure of the cosmos,\r\nand the behaviors of animals contributed to a greater sense of confidence in the direction and\r\norder of the church and kingdom. At the same time, such confidence always required renewal\r\nthrough analyses of new phenomena and newly revealed knowledge. The project will show how a\r\nsuccession of clerics from Charlemagne forward interacted with the royal court and royal\r\npatronage to support increasingly more sophisticated scientific study and the teaching of natural\r\nscience. These were seen to strengthen the church and Christian culture and thereby to benefit the\r\nking, acting in accord with the will of God.\r\nMethods. Historical methods, reading and translating medieval Latin manuscripts, engaging and\r\napplying current scholarship on the era of Charlemagne, will allow the PI to offer new\r\nunderstandings of the place of science in the vastly different world of ninth-century northern\r\nEurope. Description and analysis of the political and religious situations will use official\r\ndocuments, letter collections, religious treatises, and scientific texts to expose the particulars of\r\nscientific revival. These sources also reveal goals and strategies of ecclesiastical advisors and\r\npower figures, interacting with the royal court and with each other in regard to the sciences.\r\nIntellectual merit. The history of scientific knowledge in ninth-century Europe has moved from\r\nthe study of computus (calendar-making and computation) to astronomy and to medicine and\r\nbeyond. The present project will for the first time bring together a broad range of sciences and\r\nexplore more deeply the religious background behind the Carolingian profusion of scientific\r\nstudies, including the sense of connection between good kingship and the reform of religious and\r\nsecular studies in schools. This picture of a Christian revival of science will show the reasons\r\nspecific to ninth-century politics and religion for such a renewal and advancement.\r\nBroader impacts. The project will show the importance of historical conditions for different\r\nrelationships among science, religion, and politics. The publication of an accessible historical\r\nnarrative in book form will engage public interest. Both the limits and opportunities, historically\r\nconditioned, of political and religious involvement in science will be set out and discussed.",
