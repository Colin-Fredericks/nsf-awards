 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modifying cellular proteins by the addition of specific functional groups is important in regulating the biological functions of cells.  This process, called posttranslational modification, can involve the addition of a variety of chemical groups and can govern a protein's location within various cellular organelles or can enhance a protein's interaction with its cellular partner.  Dr. Sumter's research will study posttranslational modification of High Mobility Group A1a (HMGA1a), a protein directly involved in regulating gene expression. This protein typically is chemically modified in its highly conserved regions although the significance has not been evaluated.  Site-directed mutagenesis of sites of modification of HMGA1a combined with biochemical assays will be used to ascertain their importance in transcriptional activation of genes. These preliminary data will lay the foundation for future identification of the arginine methyltransferase involved in HMGA1a modification and provide insights into the importance of posttranslational modifications in regulating transcription. The research outlined in this proposal will advance current knowledge of regulation of gene expression and will allow important conclusions to me made about mechanisms employed by cells to regulate biological processes. \r\n\r\nDr. Sumter's interdisciplinary research interests combine techniques in molecular biology and biochemistry and will provide excellent training opportunities for undergraduates students. She aims to foster the interest of underrepresented groups in biological sciences by increasing retention of chemistry and biology science majors by using biological systems to teach topics in general chemistry and providing research experiences in molecular biology and biochemistry in a collaborative learning environment that will enhance student preparation for postgraduate training and careers in biology. Modifications in courses will foster the interests of undergraduates in pursuing independent research opportunities. Research participants will design, carry out, analyze, and draw conclusions from experiments. The experience will culminate with opportunities to present scientific projects locally and nationally to scientific audiences. The research environment is exceptionally attractive for students from underserved backgrounds because it uses a collaborative model in which students work in research teams to diminish competition and isolation.  It is anticipated that this project will support the PI's professional development while also fostering the interests of minorities and women in science.",
