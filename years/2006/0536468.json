 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) In this exploratory project faculty from the Mathematics, Chemistry, and Biology Departments are developing an interdisciplinary curriculum and learning resources organized around the science and mathematical concepts associated with understanding, analyzing, and representing the growth of sprouts. The goals of this curriculum are to integrate guided-inquiry and inquiry-based learning in courses for majors and non-majors and to increase student appreciation for interdisciplinary, active learning approaches. The evaluation plan seeks to understand factors leading to successful implementation of this approach, increased student learning, and the ability of interdisciplinary projects to improve student attitudes towards interdisciplinary, inquiry-based learning. Faculty are also examining changes in their understanding of student-centered pedagogies with an eye towards encouraging those not familiar with student-centered techniques to implement them. The project promises to build knowledge about the effectiveness of theme-based interdisciplinary approaches to learning science. Though the cost of growing sprouts is low, the process of growing sprouts is rich, inspiring many questions that touch on interrelated fields. These two features make the project accessible to many schools that otherwise might not be able to conduct interdisciplinary, inquiry-based learning in mathematics and the sciences. The project is increasing its broader impact by involving in-service teachers in summer workshops where they participate in the same learning environment as the undergraduate students. In addition to presentations and publications about the project the PI and team are making their materials available via the web-based Sci-Pi project of the Botanical Society of America.",
