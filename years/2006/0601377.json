 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The prompt detection of chemical species is the key to a new generation of gas sensors for wide-ranging applications. Spectroscopic gas sensors offer conclusive detection of species since each gas has unique absorption lines in the infrared spectrum. The critical element in the spectroscopic gas sensor is the emitter. A tuned infrared emitter based on a unique metallo-dielectric photonic crystal has been successfully developed at Ion-Optics, consisting of a sub-wavelength array of holes in a thin metal layer residing on a photonic crystal. This GOALI project will be a University-Industry collaboration between Iowa State and Ion-Optics, Waltham, MA. At Iowa State, a rigorous electromagnetic scattering-matrix method will reliably model, predict and design the optical and emissive properties of these novel metallo-dielectric photonic crystals. Novel superlattice defects and distortions of hole apertures in the metallo-dielectric photonic crystal will be designed to provide narrow tunable emissive modes. These structures will be fabricated at Ion-Optics for enhanced infrared emitters for gas sensors. Distortions of the hole arrays will enhance selective defect modes and suppress others. Emitters at telecommunications wavelengths (1.55 )  and optical frequencies will be designed.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: High-performing emitter designs will be utilized by Ion Optics for fabrication of commercial sensors. Enhanced high-sensitivity sensor advances emerging from this GOALI project will be employed in medical applications, homeland security, and industrial environments, providing widespread societal benefits. A graduate course will discuss key advances from this project. Special efforts will be made to recruit students from underrepresented groups for this project. There will be joint visits between Iowa State and Ion-Optics personnel. Graduate students will have valuable industrial experience and training from time spent at Ion-Optics. Graduate students proficient in sensor development will be trained to join the workforce in this growing technological area. \r\n",
