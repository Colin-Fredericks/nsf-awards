 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will lay the foundations for an international conference on women\r\nin leadership to be held in Fall 2007. This exploratory research project will examine\r\nwhat is known about women in leadership throughout various sectors and identify what\r\nfurther research is needed to improve our understanding and knowledge.\r\nThis project will encompass\r\nA. Research Review: a thorough review of the research on women's leadership in\r\ndifferent sectors.\r\nB. Development of Comprehensive Bibliography: from the research review, a\r\nbibliography will be developed and made widely available.\r\nC. Identification of Researchers: researchers working in the different sectors will be\r\nidentified; a selected number will be invited to participate in the conference.\r\nD. Development of Conference Framework: the issues and questions to be addressed at\r\nthe conference will be developed.\r\nE. Preparation of Grant Proposal: grant to support the conference will be developed and\r\nsubmitted.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project and conference will provide insight into our\r\nunderstanding of STEM women in leadership and of women's leadership in STEM,\r\nacross different sectors and disciplines, in an interdisciplinary way that has not been\r\nbroached.\r\nBroader Impact: The interdisciplinary approach of this project will lead to a clearer\r\nunderstanding of women in leadership, and will yield strategies and approaches to crossfertilize\r\nsuccesses across different sectors. The potential impact of knowledge transfer\r\nfrom one sector to another could lead to strategies for significantly increasing the\r\nadvancement of women to leadership positions.",
