 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some of the most prominent efforts to improve math and science learning today focus\r\nsimply on students' exposure to curriculum--getting more students to take college preparatory\r\ncoursework, while also increasing the rigor of such coursework. Yet, it is not known if just\r\nchanging and expanding the courses in which students are enrolled will have a substantial effect\r\non learning in science and math, particularly as participation expands to students who have\r\ntraditionally not been enrolled in such courses, and whether there are potential costs to this\r\napproach. The efficacy of such reforms will likely depend upon the ways in which they are\r\nimplemented, the capacity of schools to enact more rigorous coursework without sacrificing\r\nquality, the degree to which students actually receive more challenging and engaging instruction,\r\nand the capacity of students to respond to increased rigor. Extant research does not tell us the\r\ndegree to which such curricular reforms improve student outcomes, nor what kinds of students or\r\nschools are best served by such changes in course requirements and offerings.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research rigorously evaluates the efficacy of large-scale curricular reform\r\nin a large, urban mostly-minority school district, Chicago. Since 1997, Chicago has enacted a\r\nnumber of curricular reforms aimed at increasing students' exposure to rigorous coursework,\r\nincluding raising graduation requirements for all students, expanding AP courses in\r\nneighborhood high schools, and requiring double algebra courses for students with low skills.\r\nThe researchers already have access to administrative records, elementary and high school\r\nstandardized test scores, high school course transcripts, and college records on the population of\r\nstudents attending Chicago Public Schools since 1991. This allows for a rigorous, longitudinal\r\nanalysis of the effects of large-scale curricular reforms on student outcomes, including ACT \r\nscores, course grades, high school graduation, and college outcomes. The data allow for\r\nexamination of growth over time of individual students, and comparisons of this growth across\r\npre- and post-reform cohorts of students. The four investigators on the research team all have\r\nsubstantial expertise conducting research on high schools and working with schools to make use\r\nof their research. All have very strong statistical skills and substantial experience using the\r\nlongitudinal data required for this work.\r\n\r\nThis study will help guide urban schools as they make decisions about investing\r\nresources into particular courses to enhance student achievement and educational attainment.\r\nincreased opportunities for advanced coursework may improve outcomes across the board, but it\r\nis likely that the findings will be more nuanced and complex. This study will also show the\r\nobstacles and costs to implementing rigorous curriculum in schools that have not traditionally\r\noffered such courses. The results will be published in multiple outlets to reach different types\r\naudiences. Reports will be aimed at practitioners, showing the effects of the different types of\r\ncurricular reform on student outcomes for different types of students in schools with different\r\nlevels of structural capacity, as well as the barriers to implementation. Scholarly articles will be\r\nwritten to explain the methodology for studying large-scale curricular reforms, and to discuss the\r\nimplications for theories on learning and on the effects of school organizational structure.\r\nMembers of the research team have a long history of working with the Chicago Public Schools to\r\nincorporate research results into policy and practice. They actively try to present their work in\r\nways that are accessible to practitioners as well as scholars. The members of this research team\r\nwill also share this work with the many organizations and individuals who are working on issues\r\nof high school reform around the country.\r\n",
