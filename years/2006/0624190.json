 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the evolutionary basis of human irrational decision-making.  In the past few decades, behavioral economics has observed that people demonstrate a number of systematic decision-making biases in both the laboratory and the field. To date, however, very little research has explored the origins of such biases.  Do economic biases reflect learned behaviors that result from particular market experiences, or are these biases the result of more ingrained tendencies, ones that result from evolved and possibly innate mechanisms?  This proejct investigates the evolutionary origins of human economic behaviors, including persistent biases such as gain-loss asymmetry and reference dependence.  To do so, this project conducts a series of economic studies with a novel set of subjects, non-human primates.  Although non-human primates lack market conditioning, they too face a variety of distinctly economic problems, such as coping with the scarcity of goods, assigning the limited resources necessary to acquire them, and managing risks inherent in their native ecology.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, then, that certain aspects of economic decision-making will follow from  evolutionarily-specialized mechanisms designed to deal with primitive resource conditions that foreshadowed modern economies.  This project introduces a fiat currency and trade to a captive group of primates and then verifies the results of these market experiments.  The project then uses this method in a series of studies to explore primate preferences over a range of economic problems typically used to extract data describing human decision-making.   These studies will be the first of their kind to determine whether human-like standards of rationality are present in our close primate relatives and, if so, whether homologous psychological architectures can explain rational choice in both species. Demonstrating that primates either do or do not share economic biases with humans will have implications for which policy interventions are likely to overcome such biases in human markets and can be used to develop new behavioral measures for future neuroscientific and clinical investigations of human economic biases.\r\n",
