 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hacking's research focuses on moduli spaces of algebraic surfaces.\r\nThese spaces are known to have complicated singularities in\r\ngeneral. However, Hacking proposes to describe fundamental\r\nexamples which are well-behaved and understand the many new\r\nphenomena which do not occur for moduli of curves. Jointly with\r\nKeel and Tevelev, Hacking will describe natural compactifications\r\nof the moduli spaces of del Pezzo surfaces. These spaces can be\r\nthought of as analogues of the moduli spaces of pointed stable\r\ncurves of genus zero associated to the exceptional root systems.\r\nHacking has shown that the moduli space of curves is rigid, i.e.,\r\ncannot be deformed. However, a heuristic due to Kapranov suggests\r\nthat moduli spaces of surfaces should have deformations in\r\ngeneral, and Hacking aims to construct an explicit example. The\r\ntotal space of the deformation should be a moduli space of\r\ngeneralised surfaces in some sense, e.g., noncommutative surfaces.\r\nHacking also proposes to relate degenerations of del Pezzo\r\nsurfaces and derived categories and to study noncommutative\r\nanalogues of Kleinian singularities.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometry is the study of algebraic varieties, i.e.,\r\nspaces defined by polynomial equations. Many of the spaces arising\r\nin nature are algebraic varieties, so algebraic geometry is\r\nimportant in theoretical physics. A moduli space is a space\r\nparametrising all varieties of a given topological type. Moduli\r\nspaces are again algebraic varieties and often have many\r\nremarkable properties one cannot hope to observe on an arbitrary\r\nvariety. The moduli spaces of curves have been intensively studied\r\nand are of fundamental importance in many contexts. The proposed\r\nresearch concerns moduli spaces of surfaces, which are only poorly\r\nunderstood at present.\r\n",
