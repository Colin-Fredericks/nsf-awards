 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education CAREER project proposes to examine the governance of Colleges of Engineering to determine if they behave as learning organizations.  Based on the framework developed by Senge the PI will work with engineering colleges and departments to develop a rubric that will allow them to self-reflect, make governance decisions that benefit the organization, the faculty, and the students and continuously improve.  Upon the development of this rubric the PI will then conduct studies at varying types of institutions to determine if a correlation exists between governance structures and the intellectual development of engineering students. The work will assist engineering educators in understanding the intellectual development of their students, with a goal of aiding engineering educators and curriculum developers in deploying practices to increase this development. This work opens new avenues of research combining the fields of engineering management and engineering education.",
