 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nSince its inception in 1962 the Aspen Center for Physics (ACP) has provided a unique physical andscientific environment ideally suited for stimulating interactions, collaborations and innovation in physics research. For four months every summer more than 500 leading international researchers, freed from the usual constraints and distractions of their home institutions, come to Aspen to engage in research at the forefront of their fields. Research is conducted (a) in the context of workshops in areas at the forefront of physics research; (b) in small groups focused on specific projects; or (c) by individual investigators carrying out their own research. The scientific programs emphasize open problems at the cutting edge and are designed to maximize informal interactions within each area and cross-fertilization between different areas. While continuing to provide leadership in the central areas of physics (particle physics, astrophysics and condensed\r\nmatter physics) the ACP has been open to new directions in physics as well as to science at the interface between physics and other disciplines (biology, chemistry, engineering, material science, and mathematics). The ACP alsoorganizes between four to six one-week Winter Conferences that bring together 35 to 80 researchers in areas of current interest in physics and inter-disciplinary physics research. The ACP makes an effort to ensure age, gender, race, socio-economic, institutional and geographic diversity and has an increasingly rich and visible public outreach program. This consists of (a) public lectures that introduce the public to the most exciting directions of current scientific research as well as to issues concerning science policy; (b) Dialogues on Physics, informal get-togethers where leading esearchers discuss their current research interests in a relaxed setting during which questions and discussions between the speaker and the public are strongly encouraged; and (c) tutorials on various areas of physics. In recent years the ACP has enhanced its presence in the Aspen Community by establishing closer ties and collaborations with the Aspen Institute and the newly created Aspen Science Center. Support for the Aspen Center for Physics will be provided through the Divisions of stronomical Sciences, Materials Research, and Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and through the Biological Sciences Directorate.\r\n",
