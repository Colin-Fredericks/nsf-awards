 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract \r\n0619096\r\nKlingner\r\n\r\nThis award is an outcome of the NSF 06-504 program solicitation \"George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Research (NEESR)\" competition.  This award includes participants from The University of Texas at Austin, North Carolina A&T University, University of California at San Diego, and Washington State University.  The proposed research has three linked objectives: (1) to develop the technical groundwork necessary to implement the next generation of performance-based earthquake design of new masonry structures; (2) to use that development as a vehicle for strengthening interactions between code developers and the architectural community (which often plays a leading role in creation of masonry buildings); and (3) to use that development as an educational-outreach mechanism aimed at increasing regional and national awareness of the principles and benefits of earthquake hazard mitigation.  The first objective will be achieved by coordinated experimental and analytical studies of the behavior of masonry shear-wall and masonry veneer elements, and will culminate in the full-scale tests on the large outdoor NEES shake table at the University of California, San Diego.  Results will be used to propose specific updates to current masonry design provisions and to support the next generation of probabilistic performance-based seismic design provisions.  The second objective will be achieved by a series of outreach and communication activities with the architectural community, carried out in parallel with the above.  The third objective will be achieved by a series of outreach and communication activities with the K-12 and college-level educational communities, carried out in parallel with each of the above.  Intellectual Merit:  This project integrates architecture, design, and analysis for modern masonry structures, and provides much-needed test data to validate and improve building code requirements.  Broader Impacts:  The proposed project will provide the opportunity to integrate experimental and analytical research in earthquake engineering with practicing architects and engineers, with graduate and undergraduate education, and with outreach activities to broaden the participation of under-represented groups.  Research results will provide vital guidance for the seismic design of new masonry structures using the next generation of performance-based design recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
