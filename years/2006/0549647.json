Self-assembled monolayers of functionalized thiols on gold surfaces are used as the model interface.  Molecular beam scattering and infrared spectroscopic methods are employed to understand these interfacial processes.  Professor Morris and his students at Virginia Polytechnic and State University are obtaining this fundamental information about gas-surface interactions, which will be useful in understanding environmental processes involving aerosols, water droplets and volatile organic compounds.  The research project also serves as an excellent vehicle for the training of students across a diverse range of communities.  \r\n\r\nWith the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Morris is examining the fundamental interactions of gas phase species such as Ne, CH4, NH3 and H2O with model organic interfaces.  Self assembled monolayers are used as characterizable model substrates, and molecular beam scattering and infrared spectroscopic methods are used to probe the gas-surface interactions.  Fundamental information obtained from this work will be used in environmental and materials contexts, and the research serves as an excellent training ground for a variety of graduate and undergraduate students.  \r\n",
