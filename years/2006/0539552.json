 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I research project will develop a novel liquid crystal polarization grating (LCPG) technology that operates on unpolarized light with strong potential to attain an unprecedented > 90% light diffraction efficiency. This will be the core technology for us to develop next generation liquid-crystal-on-silicon (LCoS) microdisplay systems. If successful, the technology will enable compact, highly portable, low-power projection displays at low-cost. While conventional liquid crystal based microdisplays have very low light efficiency, displays based on the digital-light-processor (DLP) technology have higher light efficiency but are substantially more costly. This proposal seeks the best of both (high light efficiency and low cost) by using a switchable LCPG technology integrated into an otherwise conventional LCoS fabrication process. It will develop a proof of principle prototype pixilated LCPG device, electro-optically characterize single and multipixel devices, identify key LC parameters using static and dynamic elastic continuum theory and optical numerical simulation, and optimize the fabrication process. Critical technology challenges will be identified and approaches to overcome them will be explored.  \r\n\r\nThe microdisplay market is enormous with a wide range of products ranging from consumer and business products such as front projectors, rear projection televisions, portable projectors, digital cameras, head mount displays, and near the eye displays. The microdisplay market, LCOS display in particular, is expected to grow rapidly over the next few years and has a great variety of applications. The portable projector market is an emerging market with the potential to grow even faster than others, because portable projectors have wide application, such as displays for DVD viewing, personal computers, TV streaming, and gaming. One of the biggest challenges for the portable projector is how to increase the light efficiency so that low-power consumption is achieved, that is always a key concern. LCPG technology will facilitate portable projectors which offer doubled light efficiency at low cost. Besides the commercial benefits, this research project will also benefit education and technology development. \r\n",
