The full ESF project is a collaboration of researchers from 4 countries, including the US, Canada, and Finland.  This particular project, which represents the US NSF contribution to the BOREAS effort, focuses on the theme of social change in Nordic prehistory through the creation of a GIS database for archaeological and geographic data from the Yli-li area of Northern Finland and the Wemindji area of James Bay, Canada.  By collecting and analyzing archaeological and paleoenvironmental data from these two geographically different regions, the investigators will shed light on issues of sustainable adaptive responses to climate change.    \r\n\r\n",
