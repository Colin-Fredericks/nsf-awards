However, the existing electromagnetic modeling techniques are not amenable for circuit design due to model limitations. The PI proposes to develop next generation accurate and efficient electromagnetic modeling techniques applicable to the design and analysis of mixed-signal RFICs. The research will be closely integrated with educational and outreach activities, including the up-to-date curriculum development of electromagnetic courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, the unusual offering to undergraduates of early research experience, and the creation of a virtual electromagnetic experimental laboratory. \r\nIntellectual merit of the proposed activity: The proposed research will provide viable, accurate, and efficient solutions for many key electromagnetic modeling issues in mixed-signal RFICs. It will also enrich the modeling methodology with new de-embedding and model order reduction techniques. The education plan will introduce electromagnetic state-of-the-art modeling techniques and help to build a stronger electromagnetic education program by creating a virtual electromagnetic experimental laboratory.\r\nBroader impacts resulting from the proposed activity: The outcomes will help to attract, recruit, and retain engineering students and broaden the participation of minorities and women in engineering programs. The research findings will have a significant impact on designing new RFICs. The findings will also lead to advances in developing efficient algorithms in areas such as landmine and underground facility detection and electromagnetic nondestructive evaluation.\r\n",
