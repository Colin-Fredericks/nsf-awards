 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project suggests investigations in the area of Harmonic \r\nAnalysis and Nonlinear Hamiltonian Equations.  One direction \r\nof the research in the analysis of singular integral operators.\r\nCurrent interests include Lebesgue space estimates on Fourier \r\nintegral operators associated to singular and nonsingular \r\ncanonical relations. Such estimates provide important tools \r\nfor the analysis of properties of solutions to nonlinear \r\nHamiltonian systems: global existence, smoothness, and stability. \r\nThe other direction of the research concerns specific properties \r\nof solitary wave solutions to nonlinear Hamiltonian systems.\r\nSuch soliton-like solutions were proved to exist in many\r\ndifferent contexts. If the equation is invariant under the\r\naction of some Lie group, then the solitary waves may possess\r\nstability properties. The program of research focuses on the\r\nstability of solitary waves with minimal energy, which are\r\nexpected to be of particular importance for applications.\r\n\r\nWhen the amplitude of the waves increases, their interaction with \r\nthe medium becomes important. This interaction may seriously\r\nchange the behavior of the waves and lead to the appearance of\r\nnonlinear solitary waves, or solitons. Such nonlinear waves\r\ndescribe central phenomena in fiber optics, plasma physics,\r\ntheory of superconductivity, theory of elementary particles,\r\nmeteorology, and oceanology. Detailed knowledge of properties\r\nof such waves, and in particular their stability or instability,\r\nwill allow to predict the chances of sudden weather changes,\r\ndevelop optical waveguides, and describe quantum effects on\r\nthe scales being inexorably approached by today's electronics\r\nand chip manufacturers, let alone the Experimental Physics.\r\nNatural phenomena pose new challenges to the intricately related \r\nfields, Harmonic Analysis and the Theory of Nonlinear Equations, \r\nand stimulate further refinement of the tools of modern\r\nMathematics.",
