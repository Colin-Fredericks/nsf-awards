 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is awarded under the Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowships and Supporting Activities Program for 2006.  Cell division is a fundamental process in the growth and proliferation of all living organisms.  This entails the accurate duplication and the faithful distribution of the genome from the mother cell to the daughter cells.  For this purpose, the ring-like cohesin complex physically links sister chromatids to prevent their premature separation during cell division.  However, despite its importance in chromosomal stability, little is known about the interaction of cohesin with chromosomes.  Previous laboratory findings have revealed that cohesin relocates from its initial binding sites and accumulates at sites of convergent transcriptional termination along Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes.  To elucidate the nature of cohesin binding to chromosomes, this project, under the mentorship of Dr. Uhlmann Frank at the London Research Institute, will investigate the mechanism of cohesin relocation in vivo.  Specifically, this study will a) characterize the translocation of cohesin upon induction of transcription and b) assess the behavior of cohesin during centromere breathing.  This analysis will test whether cohesin relocation occurs by sliding along chromosomes or by reloading of the complex downstream of the initial binding site.  Since cohesin is essential for mediating sister chromatid cohesion during cell division, these findings will provide novel insights about the mechanism of action of a critical component of eukaryotic chromosome segregation. \r\n      My postdoctoral project builds on my strong interest and background in genomic maintenance and extends it toward an understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in chromosome stability.  I will acquire complementary skills in molecular genetics and cell biology, and I will gain experience in utilizing budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as a model organism for examining fundamental eukaryotic cellular processes. I am firmly committed to pursuing an independent research career, which will enable me to promote diversity in science and to serve as a mentor and role model for students, especially young scientists from underrepresented groups.\r\n",
