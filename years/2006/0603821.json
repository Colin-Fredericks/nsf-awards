 "awd_abstract_narration": "Let F be a multivariate generating function for an array\r\n{a_r r in Z^d} of numbers of interest.  In the univariate\r\n(d=1) case broadly applicable methods are known for obtaining\r\nestimates of a_r from the univariate generating function.\r\nIn the mutlivariate case, no general method is known for\r\nextracting asymptotics of a_r from F.  The PI has been working\r\non this with various collaborators since 1998, along the following\r\nlines: use the Cauchy integral formula to write a_r as an integral;\r\nuse topological and geometric methods to reduce part of this\r\nintegral to a residue computation; use saddle point methods\r\non the remining integral to find an asymptotic expression for a_r.\r\nThe research proposed here will extend the class of functions F for\r\nwhich we are able to compute asymptotics for the coefficients a_r.\r\nA second component of the research is to provide algorithmic\r\nmeans for doing the computations.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of this work is to facilitate computation.\r\nSuppose an array of numbers is described by a recursion; for\r\nexample, suppose each one is the sum of all the ones immediatley \r\nbelow and to the left.  When the definition is recursive, \r\ncomputing one of the numbers may require computing each of the\r\nones before, and there is no evident way to jump in and compute\r\nsay the 1,000,000th entry.  The research in this proposal concerns\r\na way to do just that: to compute an entry arbitrarily far out\r\nin the sequence or array without having to compute each \r\nintervening entry.  These computations are approximate but they\r\nare fast.  Moreover, they can be automated, and in fact a part\r\nof the proposal is to write software that will perform all the\r\nnecessary computations.\r\n\r\n",
