 "awd_abstract_narration": "RUI: A SURVEY OF THE MOSS DWELLING TARDIGRADES OF CHINA\r\nWilliam R. Miller, Clark Beasley, and Marshall Crosby\r\n\r\nTardigrades or water bears are small moss dwelling animals that exhibit\r\ncryptobiosis, the remarkable ability to withstand extreme heat, cold,\r\npressure and other severe environmental conditions. Generally less than 1 mm\r\nin length, the slow moving tardigrade resembles a cute miniature bear or\r\ncaterpillar. They are found on every continent in the moisture trapped by\r\nmoss, lichen, soil, or marine sediments. Their cryptobiotic life stage has\r\nbeen defined as the reversible suspension of metabolism and may last for\r\ndecades.  While desiccated in cryptobiosis, tardigrades have been\r\nexperimentally subjected to temperatures between -272 C and +150 C, to 6000\r\natmospheres of pressure, to complete vacuum, to high radiation, to common\r\ngases, and still they returned to an active life stage.  These results\r\nkindle both physiological and evolutionary speculation, including the\r\npossible ability of the animal to be transported through space. Yet, the\r\necological requirements and life cycles of tardigrades remain little known.\r\nThey are suspected of being carried around the world by the winds, but their\r\nglobal distributional patterns are very incomplete.  For example, only 47\r\nout of 950+ described species of tardigrades have been reported as occurring\r\nin China. By comparison over 500 species are known to occur upwind in\r\nEurope. Although water bears are often abundant, their contribution to the\r\nlife web of the planet is still a mystery. This project will develop\r\nundergraduate research teams at Chestnut Hill College, Philadelphia, PA, and\r\nMcMurry University, Abilene, TX.  The teams will conduct a survey of the\r\ntardigrades of China, and over four years, more than 20 student researchers\r\nwill collect, identify and publish in the project.  First, the teams will\r\nextract tardigrades from the 10,000 moss samples collected by the Missouri\r\nBotanical Garden in their NSF-funded \"Moss Flora of China\" project.  Second,\r\nthe teams will conduct an expedition to China in collaboration with a member\r\nof the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and collect 2000 additional samples.\r\nFinally, the teams will work at the Academy of Natural Sciences in\r\nPhiladelphia to build and document a voucher collection.\r\n\r\nThe teams will contribute to the understanding of global diversity by adding\r\npossibly as many as 300 species of tardigrades to our knowledge of the\r\nChinese fauna.  Our students will probably discover and describe many new\r\nand endemic species.  We will expand the understanding of the ecological\r\nrequirements of the animals and test several hypotheses relative to local,\r\nregional, and global distributional and spatial patterns.  The data will be\r\nadded to the new Tardigrade Reference Center web site for tardigrade\r\neducation and research. The ultimate product will be a data based, digital,\r\nand printable catalogue to the Tardigrades of China, complete with\r\ndescriptions, images, identification keys, geo-referencing, and\r\nbibliography.  Such a reference resource will aid taxonomists, ecologists,\r\nbiogeographers, teachers, and students all over the world who will be able\r\nto use tardigrades in assessment studies, education, experiments, and\r\ndiscovery.\r\n",
