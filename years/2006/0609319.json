 "awd_abstract_narration": "A three-day meeting will be held during the period September 29-October 1, 2006 on Mackinac Island, Michigan. This meeting will bring together researchers of all career stages and graduate students, mainly from the Midwestern area, who work in quantitative biological sciences.  The conference will greatly contribute to the advancement of research and teaching in the area of mathematical modeling and scientific computing in the biological sciences. The conference will serve as a forum to foster research exchange and collaboration between mathematical scientists and biological scientists who are addressing fundamental problems in biology from gene regulation, cellular structure and processes to systems and macroscopic phenomena.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the cross-fertilization between biological and mathematical scientists at first tier research institutions, this conference will influence and invigorate the educational developments in many Midwestern regional colleges and teaching universities. Special efforts will be made to ensure a broad participation by students, junior researchers, college faculties, especially women, under-represented minorities and persons with disabilities.",
