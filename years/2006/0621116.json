 "awd_abstract_narration": "Existing physical artifacts, including sculpture, mechanical parts, and anatomical structures, are commonly acquired by modern surface and volumetric scanning technologies for archival, visualization, and diagnostic purposes. Using recently developed meshfree technology, PIs established feasibility of performing engineering analysis directly on acquired geometry, bypassing tedious, error-prone, and artificial reconstruction methods. This proposal calls for a thorough investigation of the potential of this exciting technology by addressing basic accuracy and resolution issues, efficient implementation and complete automation of all steps, application of the technology to selected applications, and careful validation of the results. A successful outcome of the proposed research will result in a breakthrough technology for performing rapid engineering analysis on physical artifacts in situ. Rapid growth and adoption of acquired and digitized data in design, manufacturing, and engineering at large underscores the significance of the proposed research. More broadly, the proposed research will lead toward next generation systems where designed and acquired geometric information is integrated with physical models and are treated in a common computational framework. This holds the promise of extending the benefits of traditional CAD/CAE tools to works of art and architecture, biomedical applications, reverse engineered models, as well as complex assemblies and systems.\r\n",
