 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) In this exploratory project faculty in Computer Science and Forest Resources are developing materials for a \"cornerstone\" sequence in Environmental Science and Resource Management (ESRM) that takes advantage of networked computational and communication devices in the classroom. The technology (Classroom Presenter) supports group work, allows the exchange and capture of materials, and enables public display of student work to promote classroom discussion. The project represents the first use of the technology outside small enrollment computer science courses, thus it promises to contribute to the literature on the impact of pervasively networked devices on enhancing the learning environment of the classroom. Evaluation efforts involve expertise from major centers at the PI's institution, including the Center for Instructional Development and Research and the NSF Science of Learning Center on \"Learning in Informal and Formal Environments.\" Evaluation components include classroom observations, pre-and post-testing of concepts, examination of student work, and comparison of classes employing and not employing the networked technology. Dissemination efforts are exploiting the broadening interest within the computer science community in using Classroom Presenter technology as a specific application featured in Microsoft sponsored workshops on the use of Tablet PCs. Presentations and publications are also planned for the Ecological Society of America and the American Society for Engineering Education.",
