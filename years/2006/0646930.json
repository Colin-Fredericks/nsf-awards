 "awd_abstract_narration": "A one-day workshop will be held at the National Science Foundation on October 23, 2006, that will bring together a diverse group of scientists and engineers to discuss the fundamental issues surrounding Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS), to recommend ways to address the outstanding issues, and to establish a vision for a path forward for the adoption of such materials.  Rapid advances are being made in materials for transportation vehicles that reduce mass by increasing strength and stiffness. Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS) offer amazing combinations of strength (for light weight, performance) and ductility (manufacturability). They are particularly promising for crash-resistant autobody structures, where stiffness, strength, and energy absorption are required in stamped parts. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the workshop includes providing a forum for researchers from industry, government laboratories, and academia to interact and recommend future directions in AHSS research. Many fundamental technical questions, at all length scales, must be answered before 2nd and 3rd generation AHSSs can be used more widely. The workshop will provide the expertise to guide research decisions to accomplish the promise of these advanced materials. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the workshop include the potential societal advantages of AHSS: energy conservation, increased safety, and reduction of environmental impact of transportation vehicles that are used by nearly every American. The workshop will help realize these benefits by addressing the critical obstacles to their development and adoption. \r\n\r\nAn executive summary and comprehensive report will be prepared to summarize the outcomes of the workshop which will be distributed to workshop participants and disseminated via a web site. \r\n",
