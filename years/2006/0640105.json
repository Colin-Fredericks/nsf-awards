 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal requests funds for a five day workshop on quantum control to be held at Harvard University\r\nin August of 2006. The goal of the workshop is to foster an understanding among control theorists of\r\napplication-driven needs for methods to design control schemes and an appreciation of the practical\r\nconstraints on their implementation. We also hope to build an appreciation among experimentalists\r\nand theoretical for the range and utility of analysis/design methods from control theory. Finally, we\r\nhope to begin the development conceptual and mathematical languages for quantum control. research\r\npresentations will be integrated with tutorial lectures. We are requesting funds from several sources with\r\nthe expectation that we will be able to cover the travel and living expenses of about 55 attendees from\r\noutside Cambridge and about 20 local.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit The workshop aims to bring researchers from diverse field of physics, chemistry,\r\ncontrol theory, dynamical systems, stochastics, signal processing and information science to identify\r\nmathematical models and control problems whose study and solution will have significant bearing on\r\ntechnologies and experiments involving control and manipulation of quantum systems. Experience has\r\nshown that systematic use of methods of control theory that lead to significant improvement in the state\r\nof the art methods in fields ranging from magnetic resonance to quantum information processing. The\r\nworkshop aims to build on these successes to create a unified language and system theory of quantum\r\nmechanical systems with potential impact on areas of atomic, molecular and optical physics, coherent\r\nspectroscopies in chemistry, magnetic resonance, quantum communication, information and computation.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact Important component of this meeting are tutorial sessions that aim to educate students\r\nand researchers in areas of physics, chemistry and magnetic resonance, the analysis and design methods\r\nof control theory. There will also be tutorial session on basic models that arise in applications involving\r\ncontrol and manipulation of quantum systems to researchers and students in engineering. There is a\r\nformidable gap between the types of models and analysis commonly utilized by application-oriented\r\npractitioners and those studied by control theorists. The workshop aims to bridge this gap.\r\n",
