More concretely,\r\nhe plans to study the following problems: (1) general properties of\r\nfinite groups of symplectomorphisms of a symplectic 4-manifold,\r\n(2) whether a symplectic circle action on a 6-dimensional manifold\r\nis Hamiltonian if its fixed-point set is non-empty and finite, and\r\n(3) general, global restrictions on the occurrence of quotient singularities\r\nin an algebraic surface. A unifying theme in these studies is a theory,\r\nyet to be developed in this project, on the Seiberg-Witten and Gromov\r\ninvariants of a symplectic 4-orbifold, which will be built on and\r\nsubstantially extend the related fundamental work of Taubes on\r\nsymplectic 4-manifolds.\r\n\r\nA 4-dimensional orbifold is a space which locally looks like the space-time  \r\nwe all live in, except that there is a certain degree of ambiguity caused by\r\na finite symmetry occured locally.  Many examples of this kind of space can be\r\nfound easily and naturally in Mathematics (e.g. topology and geometry) as well\r\nas models in Theoretical Physics (e.g. orbifold string theory).  The proposed\r\nresearch seeks to understand a fundamental duality in a 4-dimensional orbifold\r\nbetween a certain type of fields that are distributed all over the space and a certain\r\ntype of worldsheet that is wiped out by a collection of strings in the space which\r\nis condensed in a 2-dimensional subspace. When there is no such \r\nambiguity of finite symmetries, such a duality is well-understood, and \r\nis a fundamental piece of\r\nmathematics.\r\n",
