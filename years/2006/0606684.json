 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southeast Geometry Conference (SEGC) is an annual event, now in its seventeenth year, that brings together mathematicians  working in geometry (and related areas) at institutions in the southeastern United States.   In recent years,  talks at the conference have covered a wide range of subjects, such as computational geometry, geometric optimization, integral  geometry, the geometry of differential equations, and geometrical methods in  mathematical physics. By combining geometers with researchers who apply geometric techniques  to other areas of mathematics, the SEGC helps members of each group recognize  unexpected connections and new directions for future research.  The conference  also plays an important role in bringing together researchers in the Southeast  with new and existing collaborators from other parts of the U.S.\r\n\r\nThe Southeast Geometry Conference is the only regular multi-day  conference devoted to geometry in this region.   Since the year 2000, the site of the conference has rotated among the University of Georgia, the University of South  Carolina, and the College of Charleston, and has involved speakers and participants from a broad spectrum of types of institutions (public and private research universities, prominent regional  universities, and liberal arts colleges). Moreover, the organizers have actively sought to involve young  researchers and graduate students in the conference.  In particular, the SEGC provides a rare  venue for new and recent PhD recipients to give full-length presentations  (typically, 45-50 minutes in length) of their latest results.  In recent years, the SEGC has also included an evening  poster session for graduate students to present their dissertation research. More information can be found on the conference web site:\r\nhttp://math.cofc.edu/SEGC/default.html",
