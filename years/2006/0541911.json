 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL EXPLANATION\t\r\n\r\nThe focus of the experimental program is to synthesize new materials of strongly correlated electron systems that are near electronic and structural instabilities, and to fine-tune the competing electronic interactions through the unstable region in a controlled way.  Experience shows that materials with novel and useful behavior are likely to be discovered when competing electronic interactions exist.  In low-dimensional (LD) materials the interplay of competing electronic interactions is enhanced.  The object of this project is the synthesis and characterization of new reduced and oxidized-transition metal compounds with quasi-Low Dimensional properties.  Systems of interest include transition metal perovskite-based oxides, Ruddlesden-Popper phases, and layered double perovskites.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION\r\n\r\nThese studies are expected to yield not only fundamental understanding and control of the properties of novel electronic and magnetic materials, but also to provide advanced materials for potential applications in microelectronics and magnetoelectronics including computers, sensors and communications.  These are critical areas for maintaining US technological leadership worldwide.  Moreover, the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in solid-state chemistry/materials science is essential to meet the technological challenges of the twenty first century.  The research is highly interdisciplinary.  Collaborative work of the PI with other chemists, physicists and ceramicists is well established nationally and internationally.  Single crystal and other material products of the work are provided to the scientific community for further investigations. These areas are of high interest to industry, and students trained in these areas are very competitive in the job market.",
