 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physically Aware Agile Networking\r\nPI: Brendan Mumey\r\n\r\nThis research project considers agile constraint-based routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) strategies to mitigate physical layer impairments that affect the end-to-end performance of next generation all-optical networks.  The RWA methods being developed take into account changing traffic patterns, resource availability, and the behavior of the underlying physical layer under transient conditions to minimize impairments and assure that Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are achieved.  Physical layer network impairments that affect end-to-end path performance include switching transients, amplifier gain fluctuations, and channel cross talk.  Temporal and geographic variations in network traffic can also affect network performance.  A general framework for studying the cumulative effects of such impairments and traffic variations is being designed and conducted using the Montana State University optical network testbed.  This work requires a combination of modeling, simulation and validation steps.  Based on this new framework, state-of-the-art physically aware RWA algorithms are being designed, implemented and tested.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\n\r\nThe outcomes of this research will become an important component for future cyber infrastructure by exploring methods to manage the underlying network that are consistent with the new application-driven network demands. This project will integrate teaching and research activities in electrical and computer engineering with computer science, bringing together faculty and students from both disciplines to address system-level design issues spanning both disciplines. The project team will engage undergraduate students in the research through interdisciplinary senior design courses and individual research projects.  Outreach to minorities will be facilitated through the well-established programs at MSU that engage Native Americans in the sciences and engineering.\r\n",
