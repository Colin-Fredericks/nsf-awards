 "awd_abstract_narration": "Janelle Leger, University of Washington, is a Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellow for the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 academic years.  Her research plans are to develop a self-assembled, chemically-fixed polymer homojunction for organic electronics by incorporating ion-paired monomers in semiconducting polymer films.  She proposes to study the nature of the formed junction and apply the technique to both light-emitting and photovoltaic device applications. Leger also plans to establish an academic/industry research internship for graduate students associated with the CMDITR and also to host meetings with industry representatives to encourage technology transfer.  \r\n\r\nThis Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry, the Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.",
