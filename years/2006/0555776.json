 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT for the award DMS-0400386 of Stein \r\n\r\nThe Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and Mazur's notion of\r\nvisibility of Shafarevich-Tate groups motivate the computational and\r\ntheoretical goals of this research project.  The computational goals\r\nare to develop new algorithms, tables, and software for studying\r\nmodular forms and modular abelian varieties.  The PI hopes to create\r\nnew computational tools, including a major new package for computing\r\nwith modular abelian varieties over number fields, and enhance the\r\nmodular forms database, which is used by many mathematicians who study\r\nmodular forms.  The theoretical goals are to prove new theorems that\r\nrelate Mordell-Weil and Shafarevich-Tate groups of elliptic curves and\r\nabelian varieties.  These investigations into Mazur's notion of\r\nvisibility, and how it links Mordell-Weil and Shafarevich-Tate groups,\r\nmay provide new insight into relationships between different cases of\r\nthe Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.\r\n\r\nElliptic curves and modular forms play a central role in modern number\r\ntheory and arithmetic geometry.  For example, Andrew Wiles proved\r\nFermat's Last Theorem by showing that the elliptic curve attached by\r\nGerhard Frey to a counterexample to Fermat's claim would be attached\r\nto a modular form, and that this modular form cannot exist.  Our\r\nunderstanding of the world of elliptic curves and modular forms is\r\nextensive, but many questions remain unresolved. The first goal of\r\nthis project is to provide theoretical and computational tools to make\r\nmodular forms and objects attached to them very explicit, so that\r\nmathematicians can compute with them, test their conjectures on\r\nthem, and gain a better feeling for them.  The second goal is to use\r\nthese tools and other ideas to gain a deeper understanding of the\r\nconjecture of Bryan Birch and Peter Swinnerton-Dyer about the arithmetic of elliptic curves.\r\n",
