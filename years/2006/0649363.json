 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nWeiss\r\n\r\nThis proposal is to study several applications of dynamical systems to\r\nstatistical physics, geometry, and population biology/ecology.  (i) The pressure and free energy are the two fundamental objects of study in the statistical physics of lattice spin systems. However, even for the simplest lattice spin systems, the information about the microscopic potential that the free energy captures is subtle and poorly understood. The PI has started a program to study whether, or to what extent, natural classes of Holder continuous potentials for certain one-dimensional lattice spin systems are determined by their free energy. We also plan to investigate striking similarities between the rigidity of free energy and fascinating rigidity problems in spectral geometry and number theory. (ii) Little is known about the\r\ndynamics of the geodesic flow on positively curved manifolds.  The PI\r\nplans to continue studying the relations between positive curvature and\r\ncomplicated dynamics of the geodesic flow. (iii) The PI has started a\r\nprogram to systematically study the global dynamics and bifurcations for\r\nnonlinear Leslie models where the fertility rates and survival\r\nprobabilities have various natural functional forms as functions of the\r\npopulation size.\r\n\r\n(i) The pressure and free energy are the two fundamental objects of study in the statistical physics of lattice spin systems. Lattice spin systems provide an important and illuminating family of models in statistical physics, condensed matter physics, and chemistry. For instance, phase transitions correspond to non-differentiability for some derivative of free energy.  However, even for the simplest lattice spin systems, the information about the microscopic potential that the free energy captures is subtle and poorly understood. The PI has started a program to study whether, or to what extent, potentials for\r\none-dimensional lattice systems are determined by their free energy.  We\r\nhope this work will provide new insights into this important, yet\r\nmysterious, quantity.  (ii) Essentially all demographic and animal\r\npopulation models in current use are based on the linear Leslie model.  \r\nMany population biologists, ecologists, and demographers are now looking\r\nto nonlinear population models for more accurate population forecasting.  \r\nThe PI has started a program to systematically study the global dynamics\r\nand bifurcations for nonlinear Leslie models where the fertility rates and\r\nsurvival probabilities have various natural functional forms as functions\r\nof the population size. One of our ultimate goals is to create a\r\n``population modeling toolbox'' which could be used by a wide range of\r\npopulation modelers to more accurately predict animal populations.\r\n\r\n",
