It builds on prior work by Liffick supported by the NSF-CCLI program.\r\n\r\nThe accessibility of Web and software applications has been a developing area of interest since the passage of Section 508, a 1998 amendment to the Rehabilitation Act that requires Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. The project is creating curriculum modules (syllabi, lecture notes, slides, sample laboratory exercises, Web resources, and assessment tools) that integrate accessibility topics into software programming, user interface, Web development, and computer literacy courses; is testing an advanced elective course in adaptive technology proposed by Liffick and including a new component on programming for accessibility; and is developing guidelines for a model Assistive Technology (AT) laboratory, emphasizing low-cost solutions to assistive technology and software development tools.\r\n\r\nIntegrating accessibility into the computer science curriculum is a low-impact way to expose and train computer science undergraduate students on the importance of developing software that serves a more diversified population. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
