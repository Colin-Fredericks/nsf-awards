Support is also provided for selected cruises on R/V Ka'imikai O Kanaloa, a non-UNOLS research vessel owned by the State of Hawaii.  UHM will provide two shipboard technicians on each cruise of R/V Kilo Moana to support seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.  As part of  the basic services, they will maintain and operate the multibeam sonar systems on R/V Kilo Moana.  As specialized services, they will provide other seafloor mapping services using towed vehicles when required in support of NSF-funded projects.  They will also provide support for acoustic current profiling, including software updates and quality evaluation, for UNOLS operators.  The technical support and instrument maintenance provided via this award enables shared-use operation of this oceanographic facility by qualified researchers from throughout the US, and it enables efficient use of the vessel for federally-funded oceanographic research.  Budgets for technical support are evaluated annually, and the cost is based on the proportion of vessel use by each sponsoring agency.\r\n***\r\n",
