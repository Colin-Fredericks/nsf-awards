 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project extends search engine indexing and retrieval models\r\ndeveloped initially for structured (e.g., XML) documents to provide\r\nconvenient support for capabilities required by question answering,\r\ncomputer-assisted language learning, and other human language\r\ntechnology (HLT) applications.  These new capabilities are required\r\nbecause it is becoming common for HLT applications to use search\r\nengines to find information in large text databases.  HLT applications\r\ntypically use extensive text annotations to reduce the mismatch\r\nbetween the word-based representations convenient for text retrieval\r\nand the concept-based representations convenient for reasoning.  They\r\nalso can describe very specific requirements that retrieved text\r\npassages must satisfy.  This use of text search is very different than\r\nad-hoc, interactive search, and current search engines do not support\r\nit well.  This project extends probabilistic indexing and retrieval\r\nmodels to support multiple, detailed, overlapping text annotations,\r\nhierarchical text annotations, annotations with associated confidence\r\nvalues, and similar capabilities.  By explicitly recognizing HLT\r\napplications as first-class users, the proposed research broadens the\r\nresearch community's view of text search well beyond the simple\r\nqueries, text representations, and retrieval models that characterize\r\ninteractive, ad-hoc search today.  It may also lead to improved\r\ninteractive search by providing a medium in which search interfaces\r\ncan express constraints and preferences derived from sophisticated\r\nuser and task models.  Research results are disseminated in technical\r\npapers, and as part of the open-source Lemur Toolkit.  The project Web\r\nsite (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~callan/Projects/IIS-0534345/) provides\r\nadditional information.\r\n",
