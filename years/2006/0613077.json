 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on the development of chemistry needed for the site-selective preparation of molecules next to the electrodes in chip-based, addressable microarrays.  Further studies of the reagent synthesis/confinement strategies developed in the previous funding period, site-selective use of Lewis acids in microarrays, and strategies to construct core molecular scaffolds will be performed.  In addition to these synthetic efforts, new polymers and linkers for attaching small molecules to the surface of a microarray, utility of the microarray for determining relative binding constants for the molecules in a library with an added biomolecule will also be investigated.  \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Kevin D. Moeller of the Department of Chemistry at Washington University.  Professor Moeller s research efforts revolve around the efficient preparation of molecular libraries (collection of target compounds) in chip-based, addressable microarrays.  Libraries in such format have significant applications in biomedical research, as they could be used to identify target gene products with the tiny amounts of material generated by biological systems.  Ability to prepare libraries in such microarray format is also important for developing materials with novel properties.",
