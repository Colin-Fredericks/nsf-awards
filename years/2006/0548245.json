 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program supports work by Professor Christopher J. Chang at the University of California, Berkeley to study inorganic chemistry in living systems. The overall research goal of the program is to develop selective and sensitive chemosensors for neurotoxic heavy metals, with particular interest in detecting mercury and lead for biological and environmental applications. These fundamental studies will aid in the design of practical devices for rapid, on-line screening of toxic heavy metals in various samples, including food, drinking and waste water, and blood and tissue. \r\n\r\nThe application of these chemical tools will also provide insight into molecular targets and mechanisms of heavy metal toxicity and the future design of therapeutics to treat their accumulation. Educational plans connected with this research are equally dedicated to demonstrate the vital role that inorganic chemistry plays in modern society. Efforts will include developing and implementing a new inorganic curriculum for chemical biology majors at the undergraduate and graduate level, with specific focus on a unique entry-level undergraduate course on inorganic chemistry in living systems.",
