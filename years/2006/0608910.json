 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a three year renewal of the NIH-NSF Bioengineering and Bioinformatics Summer Institutes (BBSI) Program, entitled, the University of Minnesota Bioinformatics Summer Institute (UMBSI), at the University of Minnesota (UMN) under the direction of Dr. Yiannis N. Kaznessis.  Faculty members from UMN Digital Technology Center, the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute, the Bioinformatics Graduate Program, the Center for Bioethics, and the Plant Genomics Program are teaming up to host a ten week summer education and research program for a total of 48 undergraduate students, 16 per year, for a total of three years.  The mission of the UMBSI program is to provide the highest quality undergraduate level education and research experiences in bioinformatics, equipping the new generation of this burgeoning professional community with the tools for a successful career in bioinformatics.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual focus of the UMBSI will be centered around a series of workshops, seminars and research projects that will result in participants who have,  1) an introductory understanding of contemporary issues in bioinformatics, 2) an ability to develop and apply information technology solutions to investigate biological systems, 3) an ability to work in multi-disciplinary teams and a realization of the importance of doing so in bioinformatics, 4) a beginning understanding of the impact of bioinformatics solutions on society, including economic, ethical and environmental impacts, and 5) a keen interest in pursuing further studies and a career in bioinformatics.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed UMBSI program is to help develop a cadre of scientists trained in computer applications to biology and medicine  who are capable of conducting the bioinformatics research required to advance the field. This project will train students, including women and underrepresented groups, in bioinformatics, independent research methodologies, and methods of professional advancement, which will increase the number of well-trained students pursuing careers in bioinformatics-related field.\r\n\r\nThis program is being co-funded by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS)/Division of Mathematical Sciences, the MPS/Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA), the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)/Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI)/Plant Genome Research Program (PGRP), the Directorate for Engineering (ENG)/Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC), and the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB).  \r\n",
