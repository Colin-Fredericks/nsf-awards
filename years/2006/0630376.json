 "awd_abstract_narration": "The UTeach Noyce Scholarships Phase II project at the University of Texas Austin is awarding stipends to 32 post-baccalaureate candidates preparing to become secondary level science and mathematics teachers in the Austin Independent School District and other high need school districts  and is conducting a longitudinal study of the graduates of the program.   During the initial period of awarding Noyce Scholarships, the UTeach student population grew from 350 to 450 students, and the number of graduates grew from 45 to over 70 per year.  The project has secured sustained funding for the undergraduate scholarships.  The new teachers supported by UTeach Noyce scholarships are providing instruction to thousands of students in low-income districts during the years they serve in the classroom.  New teachers benefit from the UTeach Induction Center,  online telementoring support, and Saturday sessions focusing on new teachers' needs.  The longitudinal study of UTeach Noyce Scholars is informing the national debate over the merits of different pathways to teaching, and the value of having teachers who possess both deep content knowledge and careful pedagogical preparation.",
