 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) and the \r\nInternational Committee on Computational Linguistics (ICCL) are two \r\nprimary international organizations in the field of natural language \r\nprocessing and language engineering. For over forty years, the two \r\norganizations have sponsored conferences to facilitate the exchange of \r\nresearch ideas. This year, the two organizations will co-host a joint \r\nconference from July 17th  to July 21st, 2006, in Sydney, Australia. It \r\nis the major international conference for the field. This award \r\nsubsidizes the expenses for students selected to participate in the \r\nStudent Research Workshop associated with the main COLING-ACL \r\nconference. The students-only workshop allows participants to present \r\ntheir research and receive feedback from a panel of established \r\nresearchers in the field. The forum provides students the opportunities \r\nto gain exposures to external perspectives on their work at a critical \r\ntime in their professional development. The intimate format encourages \r\nstudents to begin building rapport with established researchers. The \r\nStudent Research Workshop contributes to the maintenance and development \r\nof a skilled and diverse computational natural language workforce, \r\nhelping to produce a pool of future researchers for Natural Language \r\nEngineering. The workshop encourages a spirit of collaborative research, \r\nand builds a supportive environment for a new generation of \r\ncomputational linguists.\r\n",
