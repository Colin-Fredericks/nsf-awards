 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development of modern technology requires robust, efficient and highly\r\naccurate numerical methods for solving time-dependent partial\r\ndifferential equations, including multidimensional systems of hyperbolic\r\nconservation laws, balance laws, convection-reaction-diffusion equations\r\nand related problems. A family of simple, universal and high-resolution\r\nfinite-volume central schemes has been recently offered as an appealing\r\nalternative to more complicated and problem oriented upwind methods.\r\nThe main goal of the project is applying the central schemes to various\r\nmulti-phase and multi-fluid flow models, the Saint-Venant system of\r\nshallow water equations (which describes flows in rivers and coastal\r\nareas), multi-layer shallow water equations (arising in oceanology),\r\nmodels of transport of pollutant in shallow water, several chemotaxis\r\nmodels, reactive flows (in particular, the models describing stiff\r\ndetonation waves), shallow water equations on a rotating sphere,\r\nheterogeneous elasticity, granular material flows, dusty gas models\r\n(which describe volcanic eruptions), and others. Naturally, these\r\napplications, especially in the cases of high space dimensions, complex\r\ngeometries and moving boundaries/interfaces, require development and\r\nimplementation of additional numerical techniques such as different\r\nadaption strategies, hybridization with Lagrangian-type methods,\r\naccurate and efficient operator splitting, numerical balancing between\r\nthe terms that are balanced in the original system of partial\r\ndifferential equations (development of well-balanced schemes), and\r\nothers that will be in the focus of the proposed research project.\r\n\r\nCentral schemes have proved to be a reliable and robust tool for solving\r\nmultidimensional systems of partial differential equations that describe\r\na variety of fundamental conservation laws in fluid mechanics, gas\r\ndynamics, geophysics, meteorology, magnetohydrodynamics, astrophysics,\r\nmulti-component flows, granular flows, reactive flows, semiconductors,\r\nnon-Newtonian flows, geometric optics, traffic flow, image processing,\r\nfinancial and biological modeling, differential games, optimal control,\r\nand many other areas. However, the models used in most practical\r\napplications are more complicated than just hyperbolic systems of\r\nconservation laws, and therefore central schemes may only serve as a\r\nbasis in designing robust, efficient and highly accurate numerical\r\nmethods. This project is aimed at developing a series of supplementary\r\ntechniques that are essential for the extension of applicability of\r\ncentral schemes to many practically important problems, some of them\r\nare currently out of reach because the existing numerical methods are\r\neither too inefficient/inaccurate or not applicable at all.\r\n",
