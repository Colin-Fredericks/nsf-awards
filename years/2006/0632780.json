 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will support the measurement of mercury (Hg) emissions during a multi-investigator aerosol research project at the Fire Science Laboratory in Missoula, MT.  Biomass burning is a significant contributor to the global atmospheric Hg budget.  This study will investigate the conditions that result in gaseous vs. particle emissions of Hg.  It is hypothesized that high-intensity fire conditions will lead to emissions of gaseous elemental Hg, which will add to the atmospheric pool of this long-lived species.  Conversely, smoldering fire conditions are expected to lead to the release of oxidized Hg associated with particle emissions that will result in more local pollution.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide educational opportunities for an undergraduate student and a female high school student.  The societal impacts will be an improved knowledge of mercury emissions from wildfires, which are expected to become more common in the future due to global warming.",
