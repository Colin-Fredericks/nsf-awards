 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent breakthrough in producing the Standard Model of particle\r\nphysics within heterotic string theory is a perfect illustration of the\r\npower of algebraic geometry at the service of physics. Using techniques\r\nfor construction of non simply connected Calabi-Yau threefolds and of\r\nbundles on them satisfying various constraints on their chern classes and\r\ncohomology, the PI and a collaborator have recently constructed the only\r\nknown example of a heterotic string compactification which produces\r\nexactly the Minimal Suppersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) spectrum of\r\nparticles and forces, with no unwanted exotic matter. This opens up\r\nnumerous questions related to investigation of the High Country region of\r\nthe Landscape of string vacua. These problems are of great interest in\r\nboth algebraic geometry and string phenomenology. Other physics questions\r\ninvestigated in this proposal using techniques of algebraic geometry\r\ninclude exploration of the duality between the heterotic string and\r\nF-theory, and the Large N Duality. The purely geometric issues include\r\nseveral extensions of the spectral construction and Fourier- Mukai\r\ntransforms to gerbes and non-commutative and related situations where such\r\nextensions would have many applications. These yield a proof of Langlands\r\nduality for Hitchin systems with arbitrary structure groups, and include\r\nseveral problems about the moduli of Calabi-Yaus, their degenerations, and\r\nthe integrable systems arising from them.\r\n\r\nString theory is the leading physical candidate for a unified field\r\ntheory, incorporating both general relativity and quantum field theory.\r\nAlgebraic geometry is the mathematical investigation of spaces defined by\r\nalgebraic equations. It provides an extermely versatile and powerful tool\r\nfor applications to string theory and to many other areas. The main thrust\r\nof this proposal is the use of techniques from algebraic geometry to\r\nderive the Standard Model of particle physics as a concrete instance of\r\nstring theory.",
