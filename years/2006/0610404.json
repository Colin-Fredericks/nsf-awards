Glumac, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign\r\n\r\nA two day workshop will be held to identify critical research issues related to combustion in the future hydrogen economy. The workshop will take place in Arlington March 9-10, 2006 and will involve participants from academia, industry, and national laboratories. The program will include presentations from 30 individuals, with other attendees invited to participate in breakout groups and round table discussions.  The goals of the workshop are (1) to  assess the state of current hydrogen combustion research programs in the U.S., (2) to identify, within each sub-area of hydrogen combustion research, the essential science and engineering issues that remain unknown or incompletely resolved, (3) to identify opportunities within the potential technologies of the hydrogen economy where further combustion research is needed, and (4) to communicate these critical needs to the science and engineering community.  The workshop includes sessions on fundamental processes in hydrogen/air combustion, hydrogen internal combustion engines, hydrogen-powered gas turbines, combustion synthesis of hydrogen, and heterogeneous combustion of hydrogen.  The outcomes of the workshop will be a website and a final report prepared by the meeting participants.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this workshop lies in the advancement of knowledge in the area of combustion for the future hydrogen economy. The workshop will help to identify critical hydrogen-related technologies and science issues that need to be addressed by those working in the combustion areas so that the full potential of the hydrogen economy can be realized. The broader impacts of the workshop are in the area of learning for the participants who will be working in this critical area of research and for others, such as students, who will read the report and visit the website. Results will be disseminated via the internet and directly to federal agencies, industries with interest in combustion of hydrogen, independent funding organizations and foundations, and national laboratories. Invitations will be sent to a diverse range of researchers from assistant professors to full professors, with participation by women and researchers from underrepresented groups.\r\n",
