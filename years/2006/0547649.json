 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant provides funding to use advanced scaling principles, experimentation, and simulation to understand, optimize, and design new non-equilibrium materials processes with emphasis on welding and casting. Scaling principles include techniques such as dimensional analysis, similarity, asymptotics, scale models, and two other novel techniques: Order of Magnitude Scaling for scaling of differential equations, and the SLAW algorithm for the scaling of statistical data.  Within this scope, the Friction Stir Welding of high temperature metals will be addressed in depth. This technology is considered to be the manufacturing process with the greatest potential by the Next Generation Manufacturing Technology Initiative Consortium.  The educational goals of this work are to train graduate and undergraduate students in scientific research, develop a new course on Modeling of Materials Processes incorporating advanced scaling principles, implement active learning emphasis in the classes, and develop an Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program at Colorado School of Mines.  The new course will be an integral part of the new manufacturing degree in the Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this work relates to the large economic size of the activities.  Welding and casting combined account for $74 billion of the U.S. economy.  Society will benefit from this research by having access to products made with these new processes.  Simultaneously with the research activities, two educational and outreach activities will be grown to maturity: 1) the Bicycle Building Club, and 2) the Friday Free Pour.  In these activities, students, staff, and members of the community are welcome to come and try their hand at welding their own bicycle frame or casting their own piece.  A new student chapter of American Foundrymen Association will be started.  The ultimate payoff of this work will be the ability of engineers to quickly design and tune new materials processing systems, even when they involve complex, coupled physics.\r\n\r\n",
