 "awd_abstract_narration": "A one-day forum is being held in San Francisco, California on December 4, 200, to discuss continental growth of continents in space and time. The forum consists of overview presentations and breakout groups for discussion of hot topics and future research directions. The forum is another step down the road of synthesis and integration among the solid earth sciences disciplines. Additionally, future integrated solid earth sciences activities such as annual forums, summer schools (to educate the next generation of solid earth scientists within the new integrated science culture), summer retreats (for junior assistant professors and senior post-doctoral fellows) are being discussed. Broader impacts of forum art development of future directions in solid earth sciences research, exploration of future modes of preparing young scientists for careers in which integrated solid earth sciences takes center stage, providing stimulus to build shared infrastructure (e.g., databases), stimulating improved teaching, and encouragement of participation of scientists from underrepresented groups in earth sciences research.",
