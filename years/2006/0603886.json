 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many basic Markov processes evolve on a state space carrying\r\na related geometric structure. Brownian motion on a Riemannian\r\nmanifold,  random walks on Cayley graphs of finitely generated\r\ngroups and  finite Markov chains on \r\ncomplex combinatorial structures such as trees or matchings\r\nare all primary examples.\r\nThis proposal focuses on the relationships between  \r\nthe behavior of such  processes and the properties of\r\nthe underlying geometric structure. \r\nIt involves problems at the interface between\r\nanalysis, geometry and probability with a major role played by\r\ngroups and their actions. Potential theory, i.e., the study of \r\nharmonic functions and, more generally, of solutions of the heat equation,\r\nis at the center of many of these considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\nRandom processes  play an important role in many aspects of science and\r\nhuman activity. The study of card shuffling  procedures is an entertaining \r\nyet complex and mathematically interesting example.\r\nVarious random processes are used to model complex phenomena,\r\nfrom polymer molecules, to DNA analysis, to image restoration, \r\nto financial markets. \r\nThey are also used as crucial tools for efficient computations. \r\nIn such cases, there are strong structural constraints underlying the behavior\r\nof these stochastic processes. These constraints are expressed in terms \r\nof the environment of the process \r\nwhich often has a complex combinatorial or geometric  nature.\r\nThis proposal focuses on the study of  the\r\nfundamental properties of such stochastic processes\r\nand on how they relate to the global structure of the environment.",
