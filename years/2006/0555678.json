 "awd_abstract_narration": "A series of problems are proposed in algebraic geometry, inspired by\r\nstring theory.  Some problems in string theory relating to algebraic\r\ngeometry are also proposed.  These include the study of\r\nalgebro-geometric invariants related to topological string amplitudes:\r\nGromov-Witten, Gopakumar-Vafa, and Donaldson-Thomas invariants, all\r\nconjecturally related to each other.  Particular problems include a\r\nrigorous definition of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants and their\r\ngeneralization from Calabi-Yau threefolds to more general threefolds,\r\ntheir computation in examples, and verification of the GW-GV\r\ncorrespondence, beginning with toric varieties and contractible\r\ncurves.  These invariants will be extended to threefolds which are not\r\nCalabi-Yau.  Computational methods for Gromov-Witten and\r\nDonaldson-Thomas invariants are proposed.  Several connections to\r\nphysics will be pursued, including black hole entropy techniques.\r\n\r\nThe project is a continuation of the exciting process of\r\ncross-fertilization between string theory in physics and geometry in\r\nmathematics.  In string theory, the fundamental particles of nature\r\nare small vibrating strings, and physical properties depend on the\r\ngeometry of the space that strings propagate in, much as the shape of\r\na drum affects the sound that it makes.  Physically relevant\r\nproperties can be determined by calculations in pure geometry, in this\r\ninstance calculations of intrinsic interest in mathematics.  When\r\nphysical methods of duality provide more than one mathematical model,\r\na consequence is a deep unexpected insight into geometry.  In this project,\r\nthe PI will develop tools to investigate the mathematical validity of\r\nsome of these predictions and will expand the geometric investigation\r\nbeyond the physically relevant context.  The PI will apply also\r\ngeometric techniques to advance understanding of string theory,\r\nespecially as it describes the statistical mechanics of a black hole.\r\nThe primary mathematical content is the counting of curves in curved\r\nspaces called Calabi-Yau threefolds which form the small extra\r\ndimensions in string theory.\r\n",
