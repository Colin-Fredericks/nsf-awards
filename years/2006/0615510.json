 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trichomycetes comprise a unique group of organisms that form symbiotic relationships within the guts of insects and other arthropods. They are distributed worldwide yet there are few reports for vast regions, especially the tropics. All evidence indicates that only a fraction of the species is known. Traditionally, the group comprises four orders, but now it is known, thanks to molecular studies, that two are fungi and the others protists. The proposed research will survey trichomycetes in Puerto Rico and adjacent islands. Many new species are certain to be discovered in new habitats and new hosts, which will increase our understanding of tropical biodiversity. Molecular sequence data will help develop hypotheses on the evolution of trichomycetes. New knowledge of both the hosts and their gut symbionts will augment our understanding of their possible co-speciation, dispersal, biogeography, and symbiotic relationships. Caribbean records will be added to a comprehensive relational database for all known trichomycete species worldwide. \r\n\r\nThis project will have immediate and long lasting impacts in training and education, in studies of tropical biodiversity and tropical symbiosis. The proposed work will particularly impact minority students directly by providing undergraduate research experiences at UPRM. Participants in this project will be trained in all aspects of the research, and will include several Hispanic graduate and undergraduate students. \r\n\r\n",
