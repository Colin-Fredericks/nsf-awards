 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nMounting U.S. external indebtedness, the advent of a single European currency,\r\nand the rise of China are fueling discussion of whether the dollar is at risk of losing its\r\ninternational currency role. The answer matters: recent estimates (e.g. Gourinchas and\r\nRey 2005) put the annual benefits to the United States of the dollar's key currency role at\r\n2 per cent of GDP. There is also the danger that, if the dollar abruptly loses its position\r\nas the dominant international currency, its exchange rate could fall sharply, with\r\nuncertain consequences for global macroeconomic and financial stability.\r\nThe prospects for the dollar as an international currency are not something on\r\nwhich existing scholarship sheds much light. The theoretical literature is small and\r\nstylized. The empirical literature relies principally on a couple of dozen annual\r\nobservations for the share of global reserves held in dollars and other currencies and on\r\nproprietary data available only to researchers at the IMF and national central banks.\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the development of new data and\r\napplication of new methods to these questions. The investigators' approach is theoretical\r\nand empirical, but also historical. Historical data provide the most obvious route to\r\nexpanding the data base. In addition, changes in the identity of the dominant\r\ninternational currency do not occur very often - over the last three centuries there appear\r\nto have been only two such shifts, from the guilder to sterling and then the dollar -\r\nmaking any serious investigation necessarily historical. Finally, modern theoretical\r\nmodels invoke network externalities when explaining the dominance of particular\r\ncurrencies in international transactions, and where there are network externalities, there\r\ncan be lock-in and path dependence, creating a role for history.\r\nThe investigators will develop two historical data bases for the period prior to\r\n1973, one on the currency composition of official reserves, the other on the actual use of\r\ncurrencies in foreign exchange markets. The first of these elaborates existing data,\r\nalthough the work of constructing it will be highly data and source intensive. The second\r\ndata base is entirely new; it will be constructed by assembling information on the\r\ncurrencies that are actually traded in foreign exchange markets. The investigators will\r\nanalyze these data using standard regression techniques but also the methods used by\r\nstatisticians and sociologists to study social networks - which is precisely the approach\r\nsuggested by the theoretical literature emphasizing network externalities.\r\nIn this way the investigators hope to establish the roles of current policy (as\r\nmanifested in external indebtedness, inflation proneness, and exchange rate instability),\r\neconomic structure and past economic performance (as manifested in the weight of the\r\nkey-currency country in the international system), and historical path dependence in the\r\nacquisition and loss of international currency status. The broader impact of the\r\nproposal and project will be to shed light on the dollar's prospects as an international\r\ncurrency, the immediacy of the challenge it will meet from current and future rivals, and\r\nthe implications for United States.",
