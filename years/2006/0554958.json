 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nMotives were introduced by Grothendieck in an attempt to unify\r\ncohomology theories and to reformulate the Weil conjectures. As\r\nwith other great mathematical ideas, it turned out there are many\r\nother reasons for studying motives. The most spectacular recent\r\nsuccess of the idea of motives was Voevodsky's proof of the Milnor\r\nconjecture for which he received the Fields medal in 2002. There\r\nhave been several other important applications of motives to problems\r\nin algebraic geometry and, as a language, the theory has a much\r\nbroader impact reaching into algebraic number theory and representation\r\ntheory via the Langland's program. Furthermore, recent developments\r\nindicate connections between motives, periods, and physics. The\r\nproposed conference intends to bring together researchers from\r\ndifferent areas that use motives. To our knowledge, this is the\r\nfirst conference of this kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theory of motives provides a framework that has proved to be a\r\nfundamental tool in clarifying and explaining some of the most\r\ndifficult unsolved problems in algebraic geometry and mathematical\r\nphysics. In recent years there has been dramatic progress in this\r\ndirection and motives have evolved from a largely conjectural theory\r\nto a theory that is concrete enough to provide a tool for answering\r\nproblems. The proposed conference intends to have leading experts\r\nspeak on their various areas of research emphasizing the connections\r\nbetween different fields. The immense progress in the study of motives\r\nand the many interactions of this theory with other branches of\r\nmathematics has led to a certain degree of inaccessibility, especially\r\nfor graduate students and non-specialists. We intend to bridge these\r\ngaps by having a number of distinguished speakers give survey talks\r\non different subjects. Last not least, we are planning to provide\r\nopportunities for young researchers to present their results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
