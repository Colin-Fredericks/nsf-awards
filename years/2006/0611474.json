 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polyolefins comprise an economically and technologically important class of materials.\r\nAs a subset of all polymers, they are in general well-known, but continuing improvements in\r\nmetallocene polymerization catalysis have demonstrated that enhanced physical properties are\r\naccessible through copolymerization, blending, and composites. Consequently, polyolefins and\r\ntheir blends span the gamut of possible applications, ranging from low-cost disposable foodpackaging to multicomponent composites for aerospace structural design. In all cases involving more than just a pure polymer, which is the majority, the morphology and local structure of the blend or composite determines the final physical and performance properties of the material.\r\nSurprisingly, first-principle mixing rules for polyolefin blends are not known, as these\r\nchemically simple polymers defy like dissolves like solubility conventions.                                                  \r\nIntellectual Merit. A conspicuous lack of experimental data at the molecular or chain level\r\nsuggests that chain-structure/miscibility relationships in bulk polyolefin mixtures are far from\r\nbeing realized. The microscopic to mesoscopic (i.e. angstroms to tens of nanometers) length\r\nscales accessible by solids NMR experiments can address this deficiency in a non-invasive\r\nmanner. Through acquisition of the chain-specific data (dynamics and distance) needed to\r\nresolve long-standing questions about the relative importance of chain packing and chain\r\narchitecture, the role of each in determining entropic versus enthalpic contributions to the overall\r\nphase behavior may be examined.                                                                                                                                     \r\nBroader Impact. The fundamental scientific questions surrounding polyolefin phase behavior,\r\nparticularly for amorphous polyolefins in the melt or solid states, are far reaching in that\r\nmixtures of these nonpolar, noncrystalline polymers constitute a limiting class of\r\nmacromolecular thermodynamics. As such, polyolefins and their blends are ideal systems for the\r\nexperimental study of some long-standing questions in polymer science. For example, bulk\r\namorphous polyolefins are concentrated systems, with many degrees of freedom. Given the\r\nvarying chain architectures possible with polyolefins, can distinct degrees of freedom within and\r\nbetween molecules (rational introduction of dynamic heterogeneity fluctuations) be identified\r\nand related to phase behavior/phase transitions? The length-scale and time-scale of phase\r\ntransitions in amorphous macromolecules, like those in liquid crystals, have been described in\r\nthe context of configurational entropy arguments. Can we, using bulk polyolefins and their\r\nblends, provide non-invasive experimental confirmation of this view at the local chain level (1-\r\n10 nm)? If glass formation in non-interacting molecules is driven by loss of configurational\r\nentropy, can molecular level (less than the polymer radius of gyration) experiments detect and\r\ndefine local Tg's? Can this data be used to help broaden the scope of current thermodynamic\r\nmodels of polymer phase behavior to include configurational entropy contributions?                              \r\nThe PI has been, and will continue to be, an active participant at all levels of education\r\nthrough this project. The PI, whose efforts are leveraged through the public outreach director in\r\nthe NCSU chemistry department, has presented multiple demonstrations in physical science, and\r\npolymer science, at elementary, middle, and high school venues. Moreover, the\r\nmultidisciplinary aspect of this project (spectroscopy, polymer chemistry, polymer physics,\r\nmaterials science) continues to attract top undergraduate and graduate students in the department.",
