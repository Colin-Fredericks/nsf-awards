The proposed research will address several key challenges in the archiving and dissemination of valuable 3D models and associated metadata. The long-term objective is to create a center to Serve and Archive Virtual Environments (SAVE), containing scientifically authenticated content derived from cultural heritage and other sites.  The investigators propose to address a number of open questions including those concerned with best approaches for archiving and preserving acquired virtual environments, flexible and open standards for storing and manipulating valuable 3D environments, and authentication and secure dissemination issues.  Test environments will include computer models of archaeological sites around the world, ranging from Peru to Israel and from the Bronze Age in Europe to the Colonial period in the Americas.   Research activities are expected to significantly advance the state of the art in secure remote delivery of interactive content, and  elucidate new techniques for future generations of graphics hardware and display technology.  The investigators are leading researchers in the fields of digital cultural heritage, perceptually guided geometric algorithms, and high performance distributed remote rendering. This team will address research challenges of particular relevance and application to the real world problems confronted by domain scholars in a number of areas and working in a variety of international collaborative contexts.",
