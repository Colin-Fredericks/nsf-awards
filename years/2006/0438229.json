The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-04556).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nThe partners include the University of Florida (Lead Institution), International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering, Marion County Public Schools, Santa Fe Community College, School Board of Alachua County, Enterprise Florida, Florida Department of Education, Central Florida Community College, Florida Research Consortium, School Board of Bradford County, Scripps Research Institute, and BioFlorida.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of the proposal follows. This proposal provides the opportunity to develop essential vocational/academic state-of-the-art workforce training for stimulating high-wage high-skill jobs in a clean industry. The goal is to create model curricula and pilot programs at both Community College and High School levels that will then be reproduced throughout the state and the nation. In addition, the effort will provide a unique capability for a realistic training environment and, ultimately, employment. Together, with the partners, Florida Partnership for Industrial Biology (FPIB) will: build infrastructure by equipping the Center of Excellence for Regenerative Health Biotechnology (CERHB) Education Center; develop curricula; train faculty; and deliver the curricula to attract and educate students for entry and mid-level careers in the biotechnology. \r\n\r\nPotential Economic Impact\r\n\r\nNew statewide initiatives are being implemented to expand Floridas biotechnology industry. Along with this expansion there is a need to fill technical positions with trained and qualified workers. In addition, as biotechnology companies transition discoveries made in the research laboratory into products, their workforce skill requirements change. Currently, there is a shortage of trained personnel who are capable of manufacturing biological and medical products.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project follows. The proposal is designed to train faculty and deliver curricula to high school/college students and provide training for entry and mid level jobs in the biotechnology industry that will stimulate and capitalize innovation in the area of workforce development. In addition the project will build infrastructure through the creation of an education center. The creation and access to new knowledge for workforce development will offer High school tracks and certificates in a very comprehensive approach to workforce preparation. The proposal offers an integrated approach to workforce development beginning at the high school level.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the activity follow. The potential impact on the economic well being of the region is significant in view of the overall economic push for this industry segment. The project is also designed for national dissemination and replication. In addition, the program will serve as an \"innovative, model\" project for the nation's Biotechnical field. The activity integrates community colleges and local school systems in the education and training of the diverse workforce.\r\n",
