The focus is on the universal trend\r\nto self-similarity, or dynamic scaling, in a variety of physical\r\nsettings, such as clustering of colloids in physical chemistry,\r\nselection of nonlinear waves in fluid mechanics and models of\r\npopulation biology, and coarsening of nanoscale islands in\r\nmaterials science.  The goal is to devise a unified framework for\r\nthe treatment of these problems based on methods from dynamical\r\nsystems, partial differential equations, and probability theory. \r\nThe work is driven by close analogies between the mathematical\r\nideas of infinite divisibilty and limit theorems for heavy-tailed\r\ndistributions in probability theory, and apparently unrelated\r\nproblems of dynamic scaling and selection in these diverse\r\nphysical settings.  \r\n\r\n     Progress in this program leads to deeper understanding of\r\nhow order emerges from complexity in a variety of problems of\r\nfundamental scientific interest in the areas of aerosol physics,\r\nfluid mechanics, materials science, and physical chemistry.  The\r\nwork on island coarsening promises to improve the physical\r\nmodeling of nanoscale step-terrace structures on crystalline\r\nsurfaces.  The work on coagulation aims to improve our\r\nunderstanding of models for the formation of clouds, smoke, dust\r\nand haze, which is of potential environmental importance.  A\r\nsignificant outcome is to link progress on apparently unconnected\r\nproblems with a basic mathematical framework that ties together\r\nprobability and dynamical systems theory and that broadly\r\nfacilitates the transfer of insights from one area to another.  \r\n",
