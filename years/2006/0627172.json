 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Number: 0627172\r\nPI:  Dirk Grunwald \r\nInstitution:  University of Colorado, Boulder\r\nTitle: NeTS-FIND: Radio Wormholes for Wireless Label Switched Mesh Networks\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses two related problems in mesh networking, quality of service and traffic engineering, by advocating a new wireless network technology that builds on existing technologies applied to optical and wired networks.  Mesh networks, which share properties of fixed multipoint wireless and ad hoc wireless networks, typically have lower throughput than fixed multipoint wireless networks because the same spectrum is used to deliver service to stations and relay traffic.\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks to extend and integrate three technologies to make mesh networks more useful. Overall, the proposal involves building \"radio circuits\" that use \"cut through\" switching similar to optical lambda switching.  Orthogonal frequency multiple access (OFDMA) serves as the underlying PHY layer. Individual mesh nodes are implemented using a software-based radio switch, which allows transiting packets to be rapidly forwarded. Lastly, the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label-Switching (GMPLS) protocol provides a management plane.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that this research will enable mesh and ad hoc networks to decrease latency, increase throughput and enable quality of service capabilities as well as provide mechanisms for traffic engineering. Wireless distribution is one of the three options for high speed broadband access (with cable modem and DSL being the other two). Effective mesh distribution networks will enable wireless to be a competitive alternative in broadband access. It will also provide a reliable network technology for rapidly deployable networks needed for disaster response and recovery.\r\n",
