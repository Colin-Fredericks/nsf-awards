This leads him to explore some\r\nalgorithmic aspects of monodromy invariants, most notably algorithms for\r\nmanipulating braids and braid factorizations, and the Hurwitz problem.\r\nHe also plans to investigate enumerative invariants for Lefschetz\r\nfibrations over the disc, and the relation between the contact homology\r\nof a contact manifold equipped with an open book structure and the Floer\r\nhomology of its monodromy. In a different direction, Auroux is exploring\r\nKontsevich's homological mirror symmetry conjecture and some of its\r\ngeneralizations, building upon recent joint work with L. Katzarkov and\r\nD. Orlov. The main ingredient is the study of Landau-Ginzburg models and\r\ntheir symplectic geometry, in order to understand mirror symmetry for some\r\nexamples of varieties of general type and explore various constructions\r\nin algebraic geometry from the perspective of homological mirror symmetry. \r\n\r\nSymplectic manifolds are geometric spaces with special structures (allowing\r\narea measurements, but not distance measurements). While they first arose\r\nin the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics, mathematicians have\r\nrecently become very interested in their geometry and topology (their\r\nintrinsic \"shape\"), in part due to motivating questions from theoretical\r\nphysics (string theory). This project aims to study the topology of\r\nsymplectic manifolds using an approach developped first by S. Donaldson\r\nand subsequently by Auroux, which consists in projecting them onto simpler\r\nmanifolds and studying the points where this projection is \"folded\".\r\nThis yields a complete description by combinatorial data, reducing much\r\nof the geometry to purely algorithmic considerations. One of the main\r\ngoals of the project is to relate the topological features of symplectic\r\nmanifolds with those of complex algebraic manifolds (a more special, much\r\nbetter understood class of geometric spaces). In addition, Auroux is also\r\ninvestigating the phenomenon of mirror symmetry, by studying the symplectic\r\ngeometry of spaces that are \"mirror\" to some well-understood families of\r\ncomplex manifolds; this is an important question at the interface between\r\nmathematics and theoretical physics.\r\n",
