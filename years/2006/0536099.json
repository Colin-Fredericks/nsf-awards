These changes foster an understanding of how ecosystems function on many levels and that all living components are linked in a number of ways. Students are evaluated for their learning ability on two main levels; laboratory skills and understanding theory, and their ability to cooperate and function as a member of an interactive research team using critical thinking skills to guide them to discover the proper method to employ in a given experimental situation. The curriculum enhancements feature linked molecular microbiology laboratory exercises using 16S ribosomal RNA genes to characterize and compare bacterial community diversity from selected sites in the Thorn Creek watershed. Students work in groups to investigate the bacterial population in a site they choose from several chemical and biological contaminant perturbed sites along the creek. In the first phase of the molecular laboratory students isolate community DNA, purify the DNA, amplify specific microbial genes from this material using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), clone these gene sequences, and then sequence the DNA. In the second phase students characterize and compare the sequence data using phylogenetic analyses available on the Internet and present it to the class and student research forum. The curricular changes are possible within the time period of the course by consolidating multiple labs focusing on biochemical tests through the introduction of the culture-based test packages Enterotube II and Biolog to the student laboratory.  The sampling sites in the Thorn Creek watershed include several research plots currently being used for plant, animal and microbial studies.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Students attending Prairie State College, a community college, are also engaged in the research described and upon graduation from Prairie State can continue for a Bachelor of Science degree at Governors State thus expanding the reach of the innovations and creating a bridge between their two year and four year college experiences. Project participants present at the Governors State University Student Annual Research Symposium or The Illinois State Academy of Science annual meetings. The dissemination experience contributes to students understanding of long-term research projects and links them to potential employment in positions involving scientific research.\r\n\r\nThis project is partially supported with funds from the Microbial Observatories and Microbial Interactions and Processes Program in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n",
