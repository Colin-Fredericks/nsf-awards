 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the PI develops algorithms and software to\r\nfacilitate the removal of Gibbs oscillations from the approximation\r\nof discontinuous data by high order approximation methods such as\r\npseudospectral and radial basis function methods. Current\r\npostprocessing techniques are somewhat successful in one dimension.\r\nHowever, the most powerful methods require that the exact location\r\nof the discontinuities (edges) be pinpointed and that function\r\ndependent parameters be specified in each piecewise smooth region.\r\nOne focus of the work is in developing Edge Detection free (EDF)\r\npostprocessing methods. The EDF methods are easily extended to\r\nmultiple dimensions and in some case to irregularly shaped domains.\r\nThe ultimate goal is a \"black box\" postprocessing algorithm.  A\r\nsecond focus of the work is in software development. A Matlab\r\ntoolbox which implements both classical and modern postprocessing\r\nmethods will be developed. The software will include a user friendly\r\ngraphical user interface facilitating use by the wider community.\r\nThe software will be used on benchmark problems to provide\r\nillustration of the methods for both the specialist and\r\nnonspecialist and to stimulate further research.  The software is\r\ndesigned to make it relatively easy for students to learn about the\r\nmethods and for researchers to apply them.\r\n\r\nFor the most accurate methods available to numerically approximate\r\nthe equations that govern natural phenomena, postprocessing methods\r\nare vital. This is because many phenomena in nature are inherently\r\ndiscontinuous, and numerical methods do not perform well when the\r\nsolution to the governing equations are discontinuous. The\r\ndiscontinuities result in the methods producing solutions with\r\nnonphysical oscillations that do not truly represent the phenomena\r\nbeing modeled. Areas for which postprocessing methods are important\r\ninclude: gas dynamics, weather forecasting, earthquake and tsunami\r\nprediction, astrophysical modeling, multiphase fluid flow, the flow\r\nof glaciers, the propagation of waves in elastic solids, the\r\nseparation of chemical species, aerodynamics, detonation waves,\r\nacoustics, etc.",
