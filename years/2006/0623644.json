 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vulnerability assessment is being used as a tool to help manage and respond to disasters of natural origin. Most recent methods in vulnerability assessment largely emphasize bio-physical vulnerability over other types of vulnerability. The addition of utilizing the concept of social vulnerability will drive the next generation of research on disaster preparedness and impacts. Although recent vulnerability assessments in relationship to disasters have started to include social vulnerability, it is important to be able to capture the rich, complex underlying causes of disasters. While post-disaster recovery reveals the importance of societal capacity in recovery, the dimensions of social vulnerability have not been fully addressed in disaster recovery studies. This project will develop new and innovative methods for creating social vulnerability indices and will test its validity in the case of Thailand's recovery after the recent devastating tsunami. The principal question in the research is how social vulnerability can be analyzed more contextually and deeply, especially in post disaster events and in a developing country? The study aims to broaden the knowledge of vulnerability assessment in disaster research to embrace social vulnerability. The project will specifically focus on the formation of social vulnerability indicators for the case of the tsunami disaster in Thailand. In doing so, the project will analyze relevant and related documents and conduct in-depth interviews with various stakeholders such as governmental personnel, international organization officers, non-governmental organizations, and communities. \r\n\r\nThe study is expected to help advance the field of vulnerability assessment in terms of incorporating a social vulnerability dimension. The project will explore ways to reveal characteristics of social vulnerability that are contextually and culturally sensitive. The tsunami disaster is an important case study especially because of the uneven capacity to recover and the emergence of societal concerns. Although the tsunami devastated areas randomly, particular social groups have suffered more than others. Marginalized people who lack economic and political power usually have less ability to recover from such extreme events. Lessons learned from the recovery in Thailand will provide important knowledge for all coastal areas subjected to disaster events. Using a social vulnerability perspective will help us learn about how to enhance the capacity to cope with disasters and improve recovery planning.  To better understand social vulnerability and the underlying social processes in recovery from disasters will help in developing strategies for policy-makers to design programs and policies that will improve long term recovery. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent career in natural disaster research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
