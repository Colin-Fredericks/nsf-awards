 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for improvements in electrical supply and internet access at the Archbold Biological Station, a not-for-profit research institution dedicated to long-term ecological research. Archbold owns and manages a 3,653-ha globally significant scrub preserve located in the Lake Wales Ridge, central Florida, one of the most distinctive natural ecosystems in the US. Research at the station emphasizes population and conservation biology, fire ecology, and demographic shifts in rare and endemic species. In the last 5 years, Archbold has been used heavily for research and education by scientists (16,652 use days), for research training of graduates and undergraduates (115 students), by visiting college classes (864 use days) and for an active K-12 program (10,921 K-12 visits). A 2004 capital infrastructure planning process identified the upgrade of the Station's electrical distribution system as critical to future expansion of facilities. Four major hurricanes in the last 18 months, with concomitant power outages have emphasized the needs to be addressed with this award. The electrical distribution system to be improved services administration offices, reference collections, GIS lab, visitor offices, conference room, auditorium, animal house, fire/other equipment caches, Maintenance Shop, weather station, Water Tower, Pump House and Deep Well Pump, and seven residential visitor cottages. The upgrade includes distribution cables in conduit, cut-off boxes and new breaker panels. The improvements are expected to reduce power surges, brown outs and other power variation which damages sensitive electronic equipment.  The new conduits will be used to extend optical fiber to 2 remote campus buildings that will then be able to serve as wireless access points for internet service. Archbold conducts education programs that disseminate research results directly and involve students (K-12 and beyond) in the process of science. Public outreach includes guided tours, a Nature Trail, and public seminars. Research results are also disseminated to the public via a website, which is rich in science content but includes many pages focused on public education.",
