 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global warming poses a serious threat to biodiversity.  If individuals cannot\r\nadjust to sudden warming, three responses are possible: migration, local\r\nadaptation or extinction.  Understanding how populations have responded to\r\nhistorical climate change can improve our predictions for the future.  The North\r\nAmerican plant genus Dodecatheon provides an ideal study system.  Several rare\r\nDodecatheon species that are endemic to patchy, cool habitats are considered\r\nglacial relicts.  Other species are widespread and vary in both habitat and\r\nmorphology.  Testing the relative strength of the associations between\r\ngeography, traits and genetic relatedness in the group will indicate whether\r\nthese species have responded to historical climate change by migrating or by\r\nrapid local adaptation.  \r\n\r\nThis project has both applied and basic scientific importance with broader\r\nimpacts for society.  The results can help predict extinction risk for six taxa\r\nwhich have conservation status in 23 US States and two Canadian provinces.  The\r\napproach developed can provide basic insight into how climate influences the\r\ndiversity and distribution of plants.  The implementation of the project will\r\nfurther  efforts to train the next generation of diverse scientists by\r\nproviding research opportunities to minority students and by developing\r\nclassroom presentations for urban high schools.",
