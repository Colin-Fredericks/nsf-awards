PCDD/Fs are of great environmental concern because of their high toxicity to humans, widespread occurrence, and persistence in the environment. The PI recently found that zero-valent-iron (Fe0)-based bimetallic catalysts in the micrometer size range could transform 1,2,3,4-TCDD to di- and mono-chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins with a half life of one hour. The PI's results indicated that the reactions occurred at the solution-catalyst interface and rates were proportional to the specific surface area of the catalysts. Nano-scale iron particles of similar composition should be even more effective because of their very large specific surface areas. In this study, the PI will synthesize and characterize a range of different Fe0-based nanocatalysts with coatings of gold, silver, platinum and palladium and test them for their ability to rapidly transform PCDD/Fs. If successful, this study will open new possibilities for destruction of highly toxic and highly persistent PCDD/Fs in the environment. Rapid dechlorination of these compounds by Fe0-based nanocatalysts under ambient conditions would make it possible to decontaminate Superfund sites contaminated with PCDD/Fs. \r\n\r\n",
