 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this research project is to understand the effect of composite tin plating on the nucleation and growth of tin whiskers.  The approach to examining this objective is the following: 1) Develop a process to fabricate a composite anode that consists of tin as a matrix and nickel nanoparticles as a reinforcement that would be uniformly distributed through the tin-matrix. 2) Find an optimal chemical solution that will provide a parallel transport of tin and nickel nanoparticles from the anode to the cathode in the electroplating process. 3) Develop a procedure for accelerated nucleation and growth of tin whiskers. 4) Study the effect of nickel nanoparticles on the mechanisms that affect the nucleation and growth of tin whiskers, such as type, intensity, and source of internal stresses, the presence of nickel underlay, and the diffusion process.  Various techniques, including x-ray diffraction, focused ion beam, scanning auger microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy will be used to study the whisker growth kinetics and effect of the presence of nickel nanoparticles on its growth. \r\n\r\nThe addition of Nickel nanoparticles to tin will change drastically the morphology of the solder joint by blocking the initiation and growth of whiskers as well as change the interface between solder and substrates. If successful, this research will provide manufacturers/users of electronic components and assemblies with an environmentally friendly tin-plating technology that will drastically decrease reliability risk issue of electronic components and assemblies by eliminating the growth of electrically conductive filaments in the form of tin whiskers.  The project will generate new directions in research, training and education related to materials science, electroplating, and the testing of electro-physical-mechanical properties.\r\n",
