 "awd_abstract_narration": "0201783\r\nBest\r\nUnder this Investigator Initiated Award, studies will be performed that will improve understanding of the fundamental biomechanics of skeletal muscle and its mechanical response to stretch injury and healing.  In particular, the stretch rate and stimulation effects on normal muscle behavior, and that of muscle recovering from eccentric stretch injury will be addressed.   Skeletal muscle is a complex material that exhibits nonlinear viscoelastic behavior.  Mechanical response to uniaxial stretch begins with nonlinear strain-stiffening, or toe-in behavior, followed by a linear response, and ultimately material softening prior to failure.  Sensitivity to stretch rate and stimulation state variations, in both healthy and stretch-injured skeletal muscles, will be examined in vivo in rabbit Tibialis Anterior muscles.  The PIs new phenomenological muscle model consisting of a nonlinear Maxwell fluid element combined in parallel with a contractile element and a stimulation induced linear spring, already demonstrated to explain the mechanical response outlined above, in conjunction with a carefully planned statistical design, will be used to interpret the experimental load-displacement data.  Results of the studies have the potential of influencing treatment plans for skeletal muscle injuries.",
