 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is well recognized that the 17th-century scientific revolution was driven not only by natural philosophers, but also by artisans, especially in fields like microscopy, anatomy and shipbuilding. Recent studies have argued that Renaissance and early modern artisans were secretive about their practices, and only published their scientific achievements when in search of patronage and investment. This Dissertation Improvement Grant in the History of Science calls attention to an equally important, but neglected phenomenon, namely, that some aspiring 17thcentury Dutch artisans used the form of illustrated publication to advertise and promote their scientific products and accomplishments in a growing international market. As most potential buyers were gentlemanly or aristocratic natural philosophers, artisans gained credibility as vendors by employing in their publications the textual rhetorics of natural philosophy and the visual aesthetics of Netherlandish painting. Secretive artisans therefore openly disclosed some, but never all of their scientific results in printed works that could be interpreted as advertisements for further, commercially available products, and also as part of the natural philosophical project of advancing science. They also lavishly illustrated these publications with illustrations shaped by the conventions of Dutch painting so as to incite the interest of aesthetically oriented gentlemen or aristocrats. The intellectual merit of this research is that it puts into perspective some of the claims that have been put forward concerning the development of the public sphere, and especially concerning the public nature of early modern science (Habermas 1989, Goodman 1994, Shapin and Schaffer 1985, Goldgar 1995, Bots and Waquet 1994). It argues that the early modern Republic of Letters, which was ideally conceived of as a space for the open and free, international exchange of scientific ideas, was used by Dutch artisans as a marketplace for advertising and selling scientific products. It also relies on recent studies on the influence of patronage networks on artisanal publication strategies (Long 2002, Smith 1997, Lefevre 2004, Eamon 1994, Iliffe 1992); and argues that, within the context of early modern capitalist Netherlands, artisans no longer relied on patronage networks, but on a growing market of customers within the reach of advertisements all around Europe. The impact of the proposed project is that it puts the Netherlands back on the map of European history of science (but see Cook 1992 and Berkel et al. 1998). American and English research on early modern Europe has mostly focused on England, France or Italy. Even within Dutch histories of science, not enough attention has been paid to the close relationship between the development of Dutch science and the Dutch Republic's emerging role as a European commercial entrepot (Israel 1990). In addition, the project intends to establish closer connections between American and Dutch historians of science, and findings of the research will be disseminated at talks in the United States and in Europe. Further dissemination will include publications in major history of science, history of medicine, history of technology and history of art journals, as well as an eventual book publication.  NSF funds will support travel to relevant archives in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Russia. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
