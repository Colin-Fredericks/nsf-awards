 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mitchener proposes to study stochastic processes and dynamical systems that model language learning and change, supported by statistical\r\nanalysis of manuscript and corpus data.  The proposed models are\r\ndesigned to account for variability in speech in ways that most\r\nexisting models do not.  Some of the proposed models are\r\ndeterministic, and represent the distribution of speech patterns in a\r\npopulation as probability density functions governed by\r\nBanach-space-valued differential equations.  Other proposed models are\r\nstochastic, based on discrete Markov chains and stochastic\r\ndifferential equations.  The Markov chain models are the most\r\ndetailed, including simulated learning algorithms based on Bayesian\r\nstatistics.  The PI plans to develop perfect sampling algorithms to\r\ndetermine the mixing behavior of these Markov chains, which should\r\ngive some insight into linguistic questions of how typical the set of\r\nexisting human languages is with respect to the set of all possible\r\nhuman languages.  The stochastic differential equation models\r\nrepresent the simplification of the Markov chain simulations to an\r\ninfinite population and continuous time.  For all of these models, the\r\nPI plans to run computer simulations and prove theorems about their\r\nbehavior using tools from dynamical systems theory, functional\r\nanalysis, and probability.  The research will first address the simple\r\ncase of unstructured, well mixed populations, then add social\r\nstructure, and then delay dynamics as a model of literacy.  The PI\r\nplans to find hypotheses under which the delay dynamics give rise to\r\nwell posed problems.  The PI is collaborating with linguist Misha\r\nBecker at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to develop\r\nrealistic models of human language learning and to test these models\r\nagainst linguistic data.\r\n\r\n\r\nMitchener proposes to study mathematical models of language learning\r\nand change.  Most existing models assume an idealized form of speech.\r\nFor example, each person might have just one way of stating a given\r\nmeaning.  In contrast, true speech is variable.  The same person can\r\nconvey the same meaning by using a variety of word orders, for\r\nexample: John gave Fred a book.  John gave a book to Fred.  Fred was\r\ngiven a book by John.  As an improvement upon models that assume\r\nidealized speech, the proposed models account for language variability\r\nin two ways.  Some of them represent each speaker's utterances with a\r\nlist of random choices among the alternatives.  The others are not\r\nexplicitly random, but instead keep track of how often a speaker\r\nprefers the possible options for expressing a meaning.  In a model\r\nwith idealized speech, learning takes place when a speaker chooses one\r\nalternative from a list.  Under a variable speech model, learning is\r\nmuch more complicated because each speaker must learn which of many",
