 "awd_abstract_narration": "0549059\r\nMcDonnell\r\n\r\nThe IAHS Decade on Predictions in Ungauged Basins (PUB) is an initiative of the\r\nInternational Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) aimed at formulating and\r\nimplementing appropriate science programs to engage and energize the scientific community,\r\nin a coordinated manner, towards achieving major advances in the capacity to make reliable\r\npredictions in ungauged basins. Now two years into the effort, PUB participants have\r\ndefined a set of community science questions in the hydrological sciences with broad\r\nconsensus and community buy-in.\r\nAs the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI)\r\nbegins its community science question-building effort, there is much that can be learned\r\nfrom the PUB experience?both good and bad. The PUB example provides a potential template\r\nfor the USA CUAHSI community.\r\nThis proposal requests NSF funding to support the preparation and implementation of a\r\nfour-day workshop to catalyse the identification of community science questions by the USA\r\nhydrologic community. Workshop goals are: 1) introduce PUB science processes to the USA\r\nhydrological community; 2) explore the utility of six major PUB science themes as a\r\npotential template for USA community science questions; 3) critically discuss the open\r\nquestions in hydrology as they pertain to the establishment of hydrologic observatories;\r\nand, 4) spark dialogue among participants to identify the most promising avenues for the\r\nefficient development of community science questions.\r\nThe workshop will be convened by leaders of the USA?s hydrologic science community and\r\nfeature presentations by over 30 experts widely recognized in their fields. The workshop\r\nwill be among the first to be conducted in association with the newly established National\r\nCenter for Hydrologic Synthesis at the University of California, Berkeley. The workshop\r\nwill employ the AGU Chapman Conference style that features substantial discussion ?space?\r\nto facilitate a high level of thoughtful participant interactions with speakers and each\r\nother.\r\nThe workshop?s intellectual merit derives from the clear need for USA hydrologists to\r\nshare experiences, debate approaches, and reach consensus on a new science plan that\r\nembodies a response to the growing demand for multidisciplinary approaches to advance the\r\nscience of hydrology. The workshop?s nationally- and internationally-recognized speakers\r\nwill deliver compelling content over a broad range of hydrologic topics to\r\nparticipants?all within a format designed to challenge assumptions, optimize debate, and\r\ninform agreement.\r\nThe broader implications of the workshop reach to society?s ability to access, understand,\r\nand act upon improved prediction capacities resulting from a new, more holistic, and\r\neffective orchestration of hydrologic inquiry. The workshop will help define a new\r\ntrajectory of research that will allow water resources decisions to be made with greater\r\nresolution, in a more timely manner, and with substantially more confidence.\r\n",
