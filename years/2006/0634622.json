This workshop will build on the results of the 2005 ONT-2, held at the NASA Ames Research The purpose of this grant is to seek funds for the Optical Center in Mountain View, CA. The goal of the workshop is to assist the advanced networking community in transitioning toward communication services based on next generation optical networking. Furthermore, the workshop will emphasize the theme of next generation international optical communication services. As with other ONT workshops, ONT-3 is invitation-only. The total number of participants will be approximately 125. This grant intends to cover 25% of the proposed cost of the workshop, to be used exclusively for venue expenses. This workshop has the potential to identify important areas of optical networking research that are not being addressed, or that require further development. It will have strong impact on the migration of appropriate technologies from optical r",
