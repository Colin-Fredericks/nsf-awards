 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will advance the state of the art in network forensics. For the first time, methods will be available to interactively investigate large datasets and then later detect similar scenarios when they recur. This is critical for large organizations so that they can respond quickly and correctly to cyber attacks. Because the methods are built upon a graph framework, analysts can easily interact with automated results to refine the investigation or rule out incorrect results from the system.  Also, the methods developed can be refined by training on labeled data to improve the accuracy of automated investigation system.\r\n\r\nThis project uses models from physics and spectral graph theory to extract attack scenarios from data collected in computer networks.  The primary goals of the project are to provide the first mathematically well founded and tunable methods to extract and recognize attack scenarios  in huge databases of network alerts, network flows, and expert knowledge. Secondarily, the methods are well suited to being transitioned to high performance computing technology and collaborative computing methods using established methods from the computational sciences. These methods derive from flow models in heat transfer and eigen analysis of graphs to extract meaningful features.\r\n",
