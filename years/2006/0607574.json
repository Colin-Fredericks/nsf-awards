NASA provides the entire cost of operation of the facility as well as visitor support for the astronomers carrying out programs focused on solar system objects. The rest of the observing time is allocated to observational programs of scientific interest outside the solar system and in particular astronomical studies typically supported by the NSF. Under an agreement between NSF and\r\nNASA, the NSF provides funding for visitor support for the approximately 50% of observers whose programs are not related to solar system objects. The IRTF has been managed, operated and maintained for NASA under a Cooperative Agreement with the University of Hawaii (UH) through\r\nits Institute for Astronomy during the past 5 years. This Cooperative Agreement provides funding for the cost of IRTF operations and for support of visiting observers engaged in solar system observations. Over 145 refereed publications resulting from IRTF observations have been produced in the last 5 years. This award covers the NSF-related visitor and observing support costs for observers who either come to the observatory or observe remotely. These costs include the cost of lodging and food at the Mauna Kea Observatory mid-level facility, ground transportation between Hilo and the summit, cryogens for instruments, and payment of up to one-half of page charges for IRTF publications (up to $5K per year). For remote observing the costs include support for a\r\nsecond person at the summit (for safety reasons) and food and lodging for this person at the mid-level facility. \r\n\r\nMost of the IRTF staff is based at the UH facilities in Hilo, and it is situated in a largely rural setting with large minority communities. Several underrepresented groups (e.g. native Hawaiian) are employees of or are UH students with the IRTF. As part of the training of astronomy graduate students at UH, one or two graduate students funded by the IRTF will acquire instrumentation experience. In addition to disseminating the results to the scientific community the IRTF contributes to outreach within the Hilo community through two major programs  Journey through the Universe (JTTU) and the Mauna Kea Astronomy Educational Center (MKAEC). The JTTU program (the IRTF is part of the team) is a community based program sponsored by the National Center for Space, Earth, and Flight Sciences that brings together the resources of the entire local community (schools, families, businesses, civic groups, local government, and academic/research institutes) to promote astronomy and science to K-12 students through the development of an astronomy curriculum for all grade levels. The IRTF will be a resource for highlighting exciting examples of science and technology in Hilo. MKAEC is a recently funded outreach center currently under construction in Hilo and is intended to educate the greater community on astronomy and its connection to the Hawaiian community, both present and past. The IRTF will be supplying MKAEC with educational materials and interacting with its staff.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
