 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to make progress towards uncovering and understanding the nature of space and time at extremely short intervals. The underlying hypothesis motivating most of this research is that, rather than being infinitely divisible, space and time intervals of physical rocesses are discrete. The research topics include (i) a continued search for observable consequences of the possible violation of the complete relativity of motion, called \"Lorentz violation\" (LV), (ii) study of the impact of short distance LV on black hole entropy and Hawking radiation, (iii) investigation of the implications of LV for the deep problem of the role of time in quantum gravity, and (iv) formulation of physical models of discrete dynamical spacetime. Research probing a thermodynamic interpretation of the gravitational field equation, and a study of the quantum evaporation of black holes will also be undertaken. \r\nThe nature of time and space is an age old question that underlies the basic framework of science. The development of scientific knowledge has gone hand in hand with deepening our understanding of this question. Many believe that to successfully address the most fundamental scientific questions of today will require new insights into the nature of time and space. Contributing to that insight is the goal of this research. The research will involve the training of young pre-doctoral and postdoctoral scientists, and the results will be communicated in scientific publications and presentations. It will also inform university instruction from graduate to undergraduate levels, and will be shared with the general public in lectures and in written form.",
