The migration behavior of particles in porous media is complex. Factors\r\ninfluencing this behavior include the particle density, size and surface chemistry, the\r\nwater chemistry, the interstitial velocity, and the characteristics of the porous medium. In\r\nthe case of biological particles, motility, chemotaxis, growth and decay are also\r\ninfluential.\r\nConsiderable insight into particle transport in porous media has been gained from\r\nexperimental programs based on batch and column testing. Nonetheless, work of this\r\nnature cannot resolve, in real-time, the processes governing particle transport in the\r\ninterior of a porous medium. This limits the scale of understanding that can be gained\r\nfrom such experimental approaches. In order to further understanding of the fundamental\r\nprocesses governing particle fate and transport in porous media, alternative methods that\r\ninvolve visualization studies of particle behavior within a porous medium are needed.\r\nIn prior work, the Investigators of this proposal developed a visualization\r\ntechnique to study particle behavior in the interior of a porous medium. Use of this\r\ntechnique enabled the proposition of new hypotheses regarding particle transport\r\nbehavior. The goals of this exploratory research project are to further the new\r\nvisualization technique, and to provide further support for the emerging hypotheses on\r\nparticle transport behavior. Specifically, the project will:\r\n1. Extend the new visualization technique to enable better resolution of particle\r\nbehavior, including resolution of individual particle tracks at the micro-scale and\r\ndistinction between aqueous and solid phase particles at the macro-scale.\r\n2. Prove, irrefutably, that, during non-Brownian particle transport under\r\nunfavorable electrostatic conditions, observations of decreasing particle attachment rate\r\nwith transport distance are attributable to the early filtration of heavier particles as a\r\nresult of gravitational sedimentation, and\r\n3. Establish the impact of flow direction on particle transport for micron-sized\r\nparticles whose behavior is, theoretically, dominated by Brownian motion.\r\nBroader Impacts The proposed research will provide a visualization tool that can\r\nspatially and temporally resolve microscopic and macroscopic particle concentrations in\r\nthe interior of a porous medium. The research will also improve understanding of\r\nattachment and detachments mechanisms that impact particle interaction with a medium's\r\nsolid phase. In particular, it will provide an explanation for why irreversible particle\r\nattachment rates decrease with transport distance under unfavorable electrostatic\r\nconditions. Research training will be provided for one graduate student. Undergraduate\r\nstudents will also be engaged in the research through MIT's Undergraduate Research\r\nOpportunities Program.\r\n\r\n",
