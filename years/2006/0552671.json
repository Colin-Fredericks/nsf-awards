 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposers plan to provide opportunities for seven undergraduate students each summer to become active participants in solar physics research in the Earth-Sun Exploration Division in the Science and Exploration Directorate at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. These opportunities will combine the advantages of the multi-disciplinary environment of a NASA laboratory with the guidance provided by researchers committed to education, as well as the encouragement of women, underrepresented minorities, and students with disabilities. The proposers' previous fourteen years of experience managing an NSF REU site has enabled them to establish a formal program for students interested in Solar and Space Physics at the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA), and to develop NASA-funded opportunities in addition to those funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). During its existence as an NSF REU site, Catholic University of America (CUA) has seen over 250 students actively participate in over 270 different research opportunities, with many students continuing their space physics studies during the academic year.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will allow CUA to provide promising undergraduates the opportunity to perform research in solar and space physics while working with scientists and engineers at one of the nation's premier scientific laboratories. Many of the students participating in this program become future engineers and scientists, and those who choose other careers greatly benefit themselves and society by having a deeper understanding of the importance of space science.",

Of those responding in Table 1, none will have had time to complete a PhD. Of those that did respond, one was working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, one received an NSF graduate fellowship, one was working on mission operations for SOFIA, and one completed the Navy\u00c6s officer candidate school for nuclear engineering.  One student has been a teacher in a STEM-related discipline. Close examination of Table 1 indicates that all respondents are well on their way to successful scientific or technical careers, while 18 out of 24 with a B.S. degree are either now in, or plan to go to, graduate school in the near future.  Half (14 out of 28) continued their research initiated during the first summer in our SESI program.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Frederick C Bruhweiler"
