 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of the project are to develop a divergence free H(div) finite \r\nelement method for the Navier-Stokes equations and provide divergence free \r\nsubspace bases for the three dimensional H(div) elements for the method.  The \r\nfinite element formulations using H(div) conforming elements for the \r\nincompressible flow problems have been studied by the PI and other \r\nresearchers. The H(div) finite element methods have the advantage that the \r\nincompressibility constraint is satisfied exactly. Furthermore, if a basis of \r\nthe divergence free subspace for the H(div) element is available, the velocity \r\ncan be approximated in the divergence free subspace. This eliminates the \r\npressure and the whole incompressibility constraint from the large complicated \r\nsystem. As a result, the computational cost is reduced significantly.\r\nTherefore construction of the exactly divergence free subspaces bases for the \r\nH(div) elements has theoretical and practical significance. The proposed \r\nresearch will lead to an efficient and accurate algorithm for a large class of \r\nthe problems with a special feature: the divergence free condition is \r\nsatisfied exactly.\r\n\r\nPartial differential equations may arise in all fields of science and \r\nengineering. The study of numerical solutions for solving partial differential \r\nequations is extremely important in practice. A large class of the partial \r\ndifferential equations derived from different fields has the constraint that \r\nsome interesting variable is divergence free.  For example, such equations \r\narise in the study of incompressible flow problems.\r\nMany numerical methods have been developed for solving this kind of problem. \r\nHowever, very few of them satisfy the exact divergence free condition. The \r\nproposed research will provide engineers with a promising numerical algorithm \r\nfor the problems arising from computational fluid dynamics and other fields \r\nwhere the divergence free constraint arises. The proposed project pays \r\nintensive attention to promoting teaching, training, and learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
