 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Alaska Southeast (UAS) offers a summer research program for undergraduate students interested in the physiology, ecology, and behavior of organisms in Alaska's marine and coastal environments. The UAS Juneau Campus, located on Auke Bay, provides opportunities for hands-on research experiences with marine algae, invertebrates, birds, and mammals. In addition to the Juneau area, field research projects take place in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, the Tongass National Forest, the Gulf of Alaska, and the Arctic Ocean. Student involvement in research projects will last 10 weeks or, in some cases, 12 weeks. The program begins in early June with the exception of two projects which starts in early May. Student participants conduct research under the guidance of UAS Biology faculty and collaborating research scientists. The program is supported with funds from the National Science Foundation and the University of Alaska Southeast. Each student participant will receive a stipend, housing while in Juneau, travel funds to and from Juneau, and travel and subsistence within Alaska.  A workshop at a wilderness lodge near the UAS campus will include presentations by mentors on their research, training in the conduct of science, selected field methods, and field and laboratory safety. Students will work intensively with their mentors on individual projects and present their results in a seminar at the completion of the program. Opportunities also exist to present at national meetings. When not in the field, students and mentors will also participate in weekly discussions and lectures. Applicants must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents and enrolled as undergraduate students at accredited institutions. The program seeks academically strong students interested in marine biological research. Minority applicants are especially encouraged. More information is available at http://www.jun.alaska.edu/uas/biology/REU03b.html, or by contacting Elizabeth Mathews at beth.mathews@uas.alaska.edu, tel. (907) 796-6027.",
