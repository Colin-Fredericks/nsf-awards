 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project targets nuclear structure topics of current interest, not fully explored theoretically and experimentally: structural evolution, dynamical symmetries, phase transition and critical points, as well as the structure of odd and doubly odd Fr nuclei, and chiral rotations and vibrations. Dynamical symmetries, phase transition and critical points are key role-players not only in nuclear and other physics fields but also in chemistry and biology. We will search for nuclei that display or are close to displaying the characteristics of the E(5) and E(5/4) symmetries, map the trajectory of the Ba isotopic chain over a wide range of neutron numbers in the symmetry triangle. To complement the existing data and provide a perspective for the theoretical description, as well as to assess the degree of symmetry breaking and the perturbations that may be responsible for it, we will perform Interacting Boson Approximation, Shell Model, Cranking Shell Model and Particle-Vibrator Coupling Model calculations. As a result, we will have (1) a better understanding of dynamical symmetries and critical point transitions, (2) new knowledge on heavy nuclei, and (3) a better understanding of chirality in the mass 100, 130, and 160 regions. \r\nThe work - a continuation of existing collaborations between theoretical and experimental groups at the University of Richmond and the Wright Nuclear Structure Laboratory at Yale University - will enhance and integrate research and education in the theoretical nuclear physics areas while promoting training and professional development of undergraduate students at the University of Richmond, a primarily undergraduate institution. This project is important to the long-term vitality and infrastructure of the physics department. Current students' involvement in research provided (at least in part) the seed for the recruitment in the past few years of more majors and minors in several Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology disciplines. We also expect an increase in the number of undergraduate students fed into national graduate programs.\r\n",
