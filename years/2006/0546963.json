The proposed research  aims to establish a novel smart sensing technology which will integrate wireless sensor network, sensor data compression, and structural system identification technologies. Novel high-performance data compression algorithms, which use structural system information to maximize the compression performance, will be developed for vibration sensor data. An integrated education plan is also included to enhance the impact of this cutting-edge technology on college students, G6-12 students and practicing engineers.  A series of lecture modules in smart structure technologies for non-engineering students will be developed under a creative engineering minor program for non-engineering majors at Lehigh University. This project also includes outreach activities in smart sensing technologies for the S.T.A.R. program at LU, which are designed to encourage economically and academically disadvantaged at-risk students for higher education. Assessment technology for teaching and learning will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed education and outreach activities in collaboration of educational faculty experts on campus. \r\n\r\nThe outcome of this investigation is expected to have a strong impact on the advancements in sensor and structural health monitoring technologies.\r\n\r\nThis is a FY 06 CAREER award.\r\n",
