 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how new species arise and how barriers between species are maintained is critical for determining how biodiversity originates and successfully persists.  The key factor that determines if new species arise or whether species barriers are maintained is the performance of hybrids between two species.  If hybrids perform poorly, species barriers will be maintained, whereas if hybrids do well in their environment species barriers will break down.  The proposed research will evaluate what factors contribute to hybridization and assess how behaviors that preclude hybridization may arise.  The work will combine experiments in the wild with laboratory and genetic studies to address this goal.\r\n\r\nAssessing whether and how hybridization is detrimental is critical for understanding not only the origins of biodiversity but also how to preserve it.  Moreover, by evaluating the nature of hybrid performance, this research will contribute to our ability to use hybridization to control pest species and prevent hybridization between invasive (or genetically engineered) species and resident species.  This project will also increase representation of underrepresented groups in basic biology research by providing access to research opportunities for students from historically minority universities.\r\n",
