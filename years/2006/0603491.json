 "awd_abstract_narration": "To fulfill the need for research-skilled laboratory technicians in biotechnology, this project team is developing a true 2+2+2 program in which high school students are introduced to biotechnology and follow a seamless transition from high school to community college to baccalaureate-granting institutions to the biotechnology research workforce.  The community college biotechnology curriculum is strengthened by incorporating research techniques associated with the sequencing and characterization of the Sphingomonas elodea genome.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project is 1) introducing summer workshops for high school teachers so that they can develop biotechnology skills; 2) establishing a formal partnership with regional high schools offering biotechnology programs so that their students can earn college credit through dual enrollment; 3) establishing formal partnerships for student internships in regional laboratories so students can develop critical research skills and make informed decisions regarding the pursuit of advanced degrees; 4) integrating genomics research into the current community college biotechnology program curriculum to complement genome sequencing research currently underway in the region; and 5) identifying ways to streamline the transfer process by harmonizing curriculum and developing formal transfer partnerships with educational partners.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This 2+2+2 project is unique because it uses genomics research to prepare high school science instructors with the necessary skills and curriculum to better prepare and transition high school students for post-secondary degrees in biotechnology-related fields.  Students in the biotech 2+2+2 programs are provided with the intellectual framework required in real-world research settings and also with opportunities to explore both advanced degree research and industry research through internships.  Many of the projects undertaken during their tenure in these partnerships ultimately lead students to authorships in peer-reviewed publications, something that is rare at the undergraduate level let alone at the community college or high school levels.  Project evaluation is based on project features such as the integration of research and curriculum, and industry partnerships.  Dissemination occurs through Bio-Link, regional and national conferences, and workshops.  Furthermore, the genomic data generated from this project is made available through The National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) website, the project's website, and peer reviewed journals.",
