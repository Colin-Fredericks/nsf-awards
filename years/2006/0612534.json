This study will quantitatively document how increases in shrubs have altered the abiotic environment and caused a fundamental change in the functional attributes of these systems in arctic Alaska.  \r\n\r\nThe specific goals of this project are to: \r\n1.\tquantitatively document how shrub increases affect the year-long temperature and water regimes of arctic tundra and how shrub increases change the energy balance of the system; \r\n2.\tdelineate the processes controlling shrub increases, especially soil and plant nitrogen cycling and the physical protection of shrub meristems and branches by deeper snow; and \r\n3.\tquantitively describe how shrub density increases have affected the patterns and magnitudes of carbon [C] cycling [C gain, C loss and C allocation], water sources and growth, both aboveground and belowground.\r\n\r\nObserved shrub expansion within portions of arctic Alaska may have significant consequences, including shifts in the albedo-climate feedback, altered animal abundances, and changes in carbon and nitrogen cycling processes.  As warming is progressing at a rapid rate in Alaska, a mechanistic understanding of the biotic response is needed, if informed land use decisions are to be made and if accurate forecasting models are to be developed.\r\n",
