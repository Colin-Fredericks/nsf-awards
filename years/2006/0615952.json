 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Stephen G Weber of the University of Pittsburgh is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop fluorous extraction materials containing specific receptors for the selective extraction of analytes, based on noncovalent interactions.  The new materials exhibit the selective solvating properties of fluorocarbon liquids and the robustness of Teflon membranes.   The goals of the project are: (1) to develop quantitative understanding of specific noncovalent interactions in fluorous phases; (2) to develop novel solvent systems for extractions; and (3) to understand and use fluorous polymers in separations.     \r\nThe impact of this work lies in materials chemistry, chemical synthesis, extractions, separations, host/guest recognition, and sensor development.  Extraction of compounds of interest from complex mixtures is the key to the quantitative isolation of such compounds in laboratory and manufacturing processes. Also, extraction of an analyte into a separate phase with some selectivity can be the basis for sensors.   The project provides an opportunity for the students involved to conduct fundamental research in chemistry, and to see the larger implications of the research in terms of real world application.\r\n",
