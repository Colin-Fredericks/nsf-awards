 "awd_abstract_narration": "The FASEB Conference on Posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression: mechanisms of mRNA decay is scheduled to be held in Snowmass Village, CO on June 24-29, 2006.  The intellectual merit of this meeting lies in the importance of mRNA turnover to overall cellular gene expression.  The proposed FASEB conference is unique in concentrating on mRNA decay, thereby exploring in diverse biological settings the mechanisms, both at the cellular and molecular levels, that underpin this universal process. Speakers will include scientists who study both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.  Topics will focus on mechanisms by which RNAs interact with the decay apparatus, the translation apparatus, and the factors which modulate decay.  In each session junior investigators, including senior graduate students, postdocs and assistant professors, will be chosen to speak, based on their abstracts. The broader impact of the meeting will be the opportunity for junior investigators to present their research and confer with the leaders in the field. Not only will the established researchers share new ideas, but also junior scientists will have the opportunity to be exposed to leaders in the field.",
