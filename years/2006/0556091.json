 "awd_abstract_narration": "Minmax relations for graphs\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nA graph is a mathematical model for various networks, including\r\ncommunication networks, transportation networks, and social networks. Many\r\nimportant network parameters, like the capability, flexibility, and\r\nreliability, are often very difficult to compute. The goal of this project\r\nis to identify graphs for which some of these parameters are efficiently\r\ncomputable. To accomplish this, the PI proposes to study the structure of\r\noptimal solutions. These structural results are fundamentally important\r\nand they will have numerous applications on computing many related graph\r\nparameters.\r\n\r\nTo be precise, the PI proposes to study the following three fundamental\r\nproblems in combinatorial optimization:\r\n      1. To characterize graphs for which the clutter of (edge-sets of)\r\n         odd st-paths is ideal/Mengerian. This problem generalizes the\r\n         ordinary matching problem as well as the ordinary edge-disjoint\r\n         paths problem.\r\n      2.\tTo characterize graphs for which the clutter of (vertex-set of)\r\n         odd circuits is ideal/Mengerian. This is a problem very closely\r\n         related to the t-perfect graph problem, which arises naturally\r\n         in the study of stable sets in graphs. One of the goals of this\r\n         project is to discover the connections between these two\r\n         problems.\r\n      3.\tTo characterize perfectly 2-edge-connected graphs. This is a\r\n         problem originated from the study of the Traveling Salesman\r\n         Problem. One of its attractive properties is that being\r\n         perfectly 2-edge-connected is preserved under the \"dual\" of the\r\n         induced-minor relation, which is a graph containment relation\r\n         preserved by many important graph properties.\r\nAll the proposed problems are fundamental and attractive. They resemble\r\nthe perfect graph problem in many ways: they all involve beautiful minmax\r\nrelations, they all have polyhedral and algorithmic implications, and they\r\nall generalize many known results.\r\n",
