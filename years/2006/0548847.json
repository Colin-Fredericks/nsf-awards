Microtomes and ancillary sample preparation and storage equipment will facilitate the processing and preparation of fossil tissues for subsequent microstructural and histochemical characterization and may allow for identification of molecular source materials from fossilized tissues.  Research facilitated will enhance understanding of how soft tissues, cells or molecules are preserved in the fossil record and could lead to previously unattainable information about extinct life.  The equipment will support the research training of a diverse range of graduate and undergraduate students.  Material prepared using this equipment will support the development of permanent museum exhibits in both the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and the Museum of the Rockies.\r\n",
