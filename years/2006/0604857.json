Its principal goal is the\r\ninvestigation of the dynamical and geometric structures of\r\n\"higher rank\" systems.  Such systems appear naturally in\r\ndynamical systems, geometry and even other seemingly quite\r\ndiffernt areas such as number theory.  The investigator will\r\nstudy rigidity properties of actions of higher rank abelian and\r\nsemisimple Lie groups and their lattices with the ultimate goal\r\nof classifying such systems under suitable geometric or dynamical\r\nhypotheses.  In particular, he will study higher rank hyperbolic\r\nabelian actions, and actions by semisimple groups and their\r\nlattices preserving affine and geometric structures.  The\r\ninvestigator will also investigate rigidity properties of actions\r\nof discrete groups in rank one semisimple Lie groups.  In\r\naddition, he will analyze Riemannian manifolds (especially higher\r\nrank ones) and their geodesic flows.  Geometric, dynamical and\r\ngroup theoretic tools will be used in this research.\r\n\r\nDynamical systems and ergodic theory are relatively young fields\r\nthat investigate the evolution of a physical or mathematical\r\nsystem over time (e.g. turbulence in a fluid flow).  New ideas\r\nand concepts from dynamics such as chaos and fractals have\r\nchanged our perception of the world fundamentally.  Dynamics and\r\nergodic theory provide the mathematical tools and analysis for\r\nthese investigations.  Dynamical systems have had a major impact\r\non the sciences and engineering.  Symbolic dynamics for instance\r\nhas been instrumental in developing efficient and safe codes for\r\ncomputer science.  Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics are used\r\nas far afield as cell biology and meteorology.  Geometry is one\r\nof the oldest fields in mathematics, and generally studies\r\ncurves, surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues, their\r\nshapes, shortest paths, and maps between such spaces.\r\nDifferential geometry had its roots in cartography, and is now\r\nstudied for its close ties with physics and other sciences and\r\napplied areas (computer vision e.g.) as well as internal\r\naesthetic reasons.  Geometry and dynamics are closely related as\r\nsome important dynamical systems originate from geometry, and\r\ngeometry also provides tools to study dynamical systems.  One\r\nmain goal of this project studies when two dynamical systems\r\ncommute, i.e. when one system is unaffected by the changes\r\nbrought on by the other.  Important examples of such systems\r\narise from geometry.\r\n",
