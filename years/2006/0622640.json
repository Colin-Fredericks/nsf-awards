 "awd_abstract_narration": "Annual Absolute Velocity Structure along AR7W in the Labrador Sea since 1995 \r\n\r\nThis project involves processing and analyzing lowered and shipboard acoustic \r\nDoppler current meter (LADCP, SADCP) velocity data that have been collected \r\nalong a transect of the Labrador Sea (\"AR7W\"), usually once each year in \r\nspring/early summer, since 1995.  This transect crosses the southern part of \r\nthe region of strong convection that occurs most winters in the Labrador Sea. \r\nHydrographic data were also collected on these cruises, allowing for the \r\ncomputation of absolute velocity fields for the transects in two ways:  using \r\nthe ADCP data alone, and using it in conjunction with the hydrographic data. \r\nIn addition, the combination of absolute velocity and hydrographic data can be \r\nused to evaluate the heat flux across this transect.  The goals of this \r\nproject, using these results, are:  1) to quantify the relationships between \r\nthe strength of the circulation, the strength of convection, and forcing \r\nparameters; 2) to evaluate the various components of meridional heat transport \r\nacross AR7W and relate them to deep convection and boundary current strength; \r\nand 3) to examine the continuity of the Labrador Current/Deep Western Boundary \r\nCurrent around the Grand Banks.  Also, as part of this project, the LADCP \r\ninstrument will continue to be sent on these annual cruises, so that this time \r\nseries can be extended through at least 2010:  this is important because \r\ninterdecadal variability in the region is expected to be significant. \r\n\r\nThe processed lowered ADCP datasets will be made public in a timely manner, \r\nthrough a website, while the shipboard ADCP data will be submitted to both the \r\nnational Canadian archive as well as the NODC JASADCP.  The Labrador Sea \r\ncontinues to be an area of active research, and indeed our project complements \r\nother programs recently funded for this geographical region.  Furthermore, \r\nalthough we plan to address specific scientific questions with this dataset, the \r\npublic availability of the velocity observations may stimulate additional \r\nresearch opportunities for scientists and students in this and related fields. \r\n\r\n",
