However, this is adequate only for purely brittle or ductile\r\nlimiting cases. Here the key idea is that, for the transitional\r\nrange of quasibrittle structures (concrete structures, fiber\r\ncomposites, rigid foams, ceramics, rocks, ice, soils, wood, etc.,\r\nand those on approach to nanoscale), the safety factor must depend\r\non structure size and geometry, and that to ensure tolerable\r\nfailure probability, such as one in a million, the safety factor\r\nmust be determined from extreme-value statistics based on stress\r\ndependence of activation energy of interatomic bonds. The strength\r\nprobability distributions of material elements and of structure,\r\ndeviations from power-law size effect, kinks on strength\r\nhistograms, and dependence on temperature, loading rate and\r\nduration, are derived and exploited for verification and\r\ncalibration.  Relevance and practical applications are\r\ndemonstrated by stochastic numerical analysis of documented\r\nstructural disasters. Major implications for design codes and\r\npractices for quasibrittle structures, as well as reliability of\r\nmicro-nano-scale thin films and MEMS, are identified.\r\n",
