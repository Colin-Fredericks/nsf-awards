 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major intent of the project is to examine the use of logic models in evaluation practice in ways that provide an empirical base for understanding and improving the use of logic models throughout the stages of design, implementation, and evaluation of STEM education programs.  Concurrently the project engages eight graduate interns of color in conducting this inquiry (students are enrolled in an internship at Duquesne sponsored in part by AEA). The internship training and will be evaluated and improvements of the training in response to what is learned will be documented. Research questions address actual and stated purposes of logic models in the study context, how logic models drive work through all phases of the evaluation and reporting, what knowledge is drawn upon in use of logic models, what consequences follow logic model use, and what differences show up across types of programs.  Methodology for examining logic model use and appropriateness includes: multiple measures include telephone interviews, face-to-face interviews, observations, e-mail correspondence, online surveys, and case studies.  \r\n",
