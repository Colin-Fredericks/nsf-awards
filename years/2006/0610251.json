 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is awarded under the Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowships and Supporting Activities Program for 2006. \r\n\r\nIRON ACQUISITION BY PSEUDOMONAS MENDOCINA STRAIN YMP\r\n\r\nIron is the most abundant element on earth and perhaps not surprising that most forms of life have evolved an obligate dependence on iron.  However, under aerobic conditions the majority of iron exists as insoluble ferric mineral forms. In response to such environmental pressures, prokaryotes have evolved strategies such as the use of siderophores for sequestering iron from a limited soluble supply.  Siderophores and siderophore-producing microbes have been shown to have significant effects on rates of mineral dissolution.  Mineral stability at DOE Nevada test sites, particularly those proposed as storage sites for mineralized radionuclide waste, is clearly critical. The fundamental interest in microbial contributions to iron cycling is therefore compounded by concern over possible unwanted repercussions of microbe-mineral interactions. Isolated from the DOE site, Pseudomonas mendocina strain ymp has been studied for siderophore production and mineral dissolution.  However, very little is known about the genetic content of any strain of P. mendocina. The goals of this project are to identify, classify, and organize genes involved in iron uptake by both siderophore-mediated pathways, and by unanticipated pathways.  Finally in the process of meeting these aims, a number of genetic and molecular biological tools that will make P. mendocina more amenable for future biogeochemical investigations will be developed.  The research will be conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Jennifer DuBois at Univeristy of Notre Dame.  Dr. Awaya aims through the NSF Minority Fellowship, to strengthen his skills as a molecular microbiologist and to provide an alternative approach to understand microbe-mineral interactions.  The main objective of this postdoctoral training is to construct a solid foundation for him to become a leading environmental scientist in molecular microbiology in the future.  He will attend several scientific meetings to present his research findings, make personal contacts for future collaborations and receive feedback to strengthen his abilities as a researcher in the scientific community. One of his plans is to be able to establish his own laboratory and teach at a univeristy. \r\n",
