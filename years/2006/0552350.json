 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Summer Undergraduate Research Experience in Pure and Applied Mathematics (SUREPAM) at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire is an eight week program designed for ten undergraduate students. The students will become part of a thriving multidisciplinary summer research community. The participants will work in two-person teams. Each team will prepare presentations which will expose all participants to a variety of projects, both pure and applied. Our research topics will include: Banach spaces, combinatorics, fluid dynamics and elasticity, Lie groups, deformation algebras, non-standard analysis, and wavelets and signal processing. The program offers strong prospects for the students to obtain meaningful results in mathematics. The research mentors have solid records of successful research collaboration with undergraduate students and have developed research programs accessible to undergraduates. External faculty mentors and other visitors will broaden the perspective of both the students and mentors. Students will write a scientific research paper, and present their research at an on-campus Workshop to be held during the eighth week of the program. Some of the research problems have industrial applications and this will increase awareness of possible career options. Each student receives a stipend, housing, and funds for travel from and to his or her home institution. Preference will be given to students who are engaged with faculty from their home institutions in a study or a research project related to their anticipated project prior to their arrival at SUREPAM. This possibility of involving faculty from the students' home institutions will serve as a catalyst for expanding mathematics research opportunities for more undergraduates and will build ties between students and faculty from different universities. Eau Claire is located 90 miles east of the Minneapolis / St Paul metropolitan area. The students will have the opportunity to visit some of the many famous attractions of the region, including the Minnesota Science Museum and the Mall of America.",
