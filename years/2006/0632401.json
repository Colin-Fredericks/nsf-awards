 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"PolarTREC (Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating)\" is a three-year\r\nteacher professional enhancement program that will advance polar science education\r\nby bringing K-12 educators and polar researchers together in hands-on field\r\nexperiences in the Arctic and Antarctic.  PolarTREC activities and products will foster the\r\nintegration of research and education to produce a legacy of long-term\r\nteacher-researcher collaborations, improvement of teacher content knowledge and\r\nteaching practices, shareable online learning resources based on real-world science,\r\nimproved student knowledge of and interest in the Arctic and Antarctic, and broad public\r\nengagement in polar science.  ARCUS will adapt and extend existing Teacher Research\r\nExperience (TRE) models and its own experience delivering TREC -- a TRE program\r\nsupported by NSF for the Arctic -- to develop PolarTREC, a comprehensive, sustained\r\nfield research experience program for K-12 teachers focusing on IPY science themes at\r\nboth polar regions.  Thirty-six teachers will spend two to six weeks in the Arctic or\r\nAntarctic studying a topic relevant to one of the IPY emphasis areas, with \"Live from\r\nIPY\" calls, Internet presentations, and podcasts from the field, daily teacher journals,\r\ninteractive bulletin boards, photo galleries, online multimedia learning resources and\r\nactivities, and participation in CARE (Connecting Arctic/Antarctic Researchers and\r\nEducators) web-meetings to support translation of experiences into the classroom and\r\nbeyond.  PolarTREC is relevant to the education goals of the IPY by 1) providing a\r\nhands-on field research experience that can be realistically implemented in the polar\r\nregions; 2) broadly disseminating teacher experiences to students and other\r\nprofessionals; 3) developing a sustainable learning community; and 4) providing clear\r\nand appropriate measures of project success through a formative and summative\r\nevaluation.  Additionally, the PolarTREC evaluation will provide a basis for replicating or\r\nexpanding the program structure and best practices.  PolarTREC will benefit from close\r\ncoordination with logistics providers and international programs to ensure operational\r\nfeasibility and an international reach.",
