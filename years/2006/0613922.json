 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI), jointly supported by the NSF and Department of Energy (DOE), will take place in Cuernavaca, Mexico in April 2007 on the study of surfaces, interfaces and catalysis. Organized by Dr. Wilfred T. Tysoe of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, the institute will familiarize advanced graduate students, post-doctoral, and junior researchers from the Americas with modern techniques in surface science and serve as an introduction to the latest theoretical methods used to study surface-chemical phenomena. Activities will include lectures, poster sessions, and advanced topic presentations, in order to train young scientists in new techniques and bring together research groups. \r\n\r\nThe wide range of applications and materials will impart a significant interdisciplinary nature to the institute, and should foster the cross-fertilization of new ideas to advance these fields and, ultimately, increase relations between Latin American junior and senior investigators and their counterparts in the U.S.  Materials presented at the institute will be published in a journal and the notes will be posted in a website in order to enhance their dissemination. \r\n",
