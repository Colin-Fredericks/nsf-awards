 "awd_abstract_narration": "CSR-AES: Interactive Parallel Platforms for Multi-Experiment\r\nComputational Studies\r\n\r\nScientists and engineers increasingly rely upon computational studies\r\ninvolving multiple experiments (runs of simulation software) in domains\r\nranging from engineering design-space exploration to drug design.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative project develops foundations for a system that\r\nfacilitates interactive computational studies involving large numbers of\r\nexperiments, permitting the user to continuously monitor and steer how\r\nthe study unfolds, based on partial results. The work specifically\r\ntargets engineering design applications involving small-to-medium size\r\nsimulation problems running on tightly-coupled parallel machines, and\r\nemphasizes (1) higher-level user control of the overall study; (2) reuse\r\nof data from prior experiments in carrying forward new computations; (3)\r\ndynamic management of system resources by relying on a tighter coupling\r\nbetween application and system software; and (4) software reuse based on\r\ncommon component architecture (CCA) compliance and standardization of a\r\nmore permeable system-/solver-level interface.\r\n\r\nThe system architecture builds upon the SCIRun2 framework and\r\nincorporates modules for translating high-level user specifications into\r\nrequired experiments, for allocating parallel machine resources to\r\nexperiments to optimize study progress, and numerical methods and\r\nalgorithms for estimating simulation time and resource costs.\r\n\r\nThe primary impact of the work is expected in engineering design, with\r\nbroader applicability to additional classes of biomedical and geometric\r\nmodeling applications.  The project will also have important educational\r\napplications, by creating hands-on simulated exploration experiences for\r\nstudents, and by training system computer scientists with a deep\r\nunderstanding of specific scientific domains, simulation frameworks, and\r\nnumerical solver interfaces.\r\n",
