 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the investigator will study questions in algebraic geometry \r\nthat require the use of algebraic stacks.  One aspect of this research \r\nwill study how in the context of the study of Gromov-Witten invariants, the somewhat \r\nexotic structure of Deligne-Mumford stack \r\ncan be related to the more familiar resolutions of singularities which have long \r\nbeen a staple of algebraic geometry.  A second project will focus on bringing \r\nto bear the machinery that has been developed in the theory of algebraic stacks \r\non the study of Donaldson type invariants.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometry is among the oldest branches of mathematics and is \r\nconcerned with studying the solutions of systems of polynomial equations.   Modern \r\napplications of this theory often place a strong emphasis on understanding \r\nthe symmetries of such systems.  The most powerful framework for understanding \r\ngeometry in conjunction with symmetries is the theory of algebraic stacks.  \r\nThis point of view has acquired extra significance due to a surprising \r\nconnection to theoretical physics, where attempts to unify quantum \r\nfield theory and general relativity have led to a host of interesting \r\nmathematical problems concerning the symmetries of various geometric \r\nstructures. This interaction provides a rich source of problems where the\r\nlanguage of stacks, which has a reputation for being excessively abstract and technical,\r\ncan be used to study very concrete questions about simple geometric objects.\r\n",
