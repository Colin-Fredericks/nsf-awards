 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emergence of the primary election process during the 20th Century is widely\r\nthought to have transformed American politics. For example, primary elections\r\nallegedly weakened political parties and fueled the rise of personalistic, incumbency\r\noriented politics; and primary elections are though to have made politicians much more\r\nideologically extreme than the electorate as a whole, because candidates must first win\r\napproval of a partisan subset of the electorate before they can even qualify for the\r\ngeneral election.\r\nAddressing even the most basic questions about this two-stage process is difficult\r\nbecause no comprehensive database on primary election results in the U.S. currently\r\nexists. This project assembles a database on primary elections for statewide and\r\nfederal offices. For each state, we collect election returns for every statewide and\r\nfederal office for major-party primary elections from the year the first primaries were\r\nheld to the present.\r\nOur project yields broad educational and social benefits including useful digital\r\ndatabases archived at the ICPSR and on our own websites, publications in a variety of\r\nmedia, data sets made available to state election boards and/or secretaries of state,\r\nresearch collaboration between three major educational institutions, mentoring and\r\nemploying research assistants who are women and under-represented minorities, and\r\nprofessionalization of undergraduates and graduate students who co-author with the\r\nprincipal investigators.",
