The Observatory will operate two 8-meter optical/infrared telescopes in a collaboration consisting of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. \r\n\r\nThe Gemini telescopes are located at sites with excellent observing conditions, one in the northern hemisphere on Mauna Kea in Hawaii and one in the southern hemisphere on Cerro Pachon in Chile.  Gemini's scientific mission is focused on fundamental questions, using new technologies and new observational and operational approaches.  \r\n\r\nGemini's science community has devised an ambitious plan for the next five years of science exploration. This plan for research and new instrumentation exploits Gemini's unique capabilities to attack many of the outstanding grand challenges in astrophysics and cosmology. These include: how galaxies, stellar, and planetary systems form; the frequency of occurrence of extra-solar planets, including earth-like planets; how super-massive black holes and galaxies are related; determining the nature of dark matter and dark energy; how the cosmic dark age ended; and how stars produce the chemical building blocks of life.  \r\n\r\nDuring the next five years of operations, researchers will continue to exploit the current set of powerful instruments addressing these questions as well as others.  This work will answer many questions in its own right, as well as provide a bridge to the science to be done with a new suite of instruments under development during this award period.  \r\n\r\nWhile primarily focused on scientific exploration, Gemini will produce many broader impacts.  Its public information and educational outreach program will continue to disseminate Gemini science discoveries to the world on scales from local to international. It will continue to enhance the educational infrastructure and the development of new generations of scientists and technologists through teacher training and community programs. Gemini's highly diverse international staff and program will continue to stimulate international and intercultural understanding and cooperation. \r\n\r\n",
