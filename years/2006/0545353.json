 "awd_abstract_narration": "Four middle and upper atmosphere lidar groups collaborate to unify the scientific and technological applications of resonant lidar systems now at the University of Illinois, the Alomar Observatory in Norway, and at Colorado State University. The consortium structure coordinates simultaneous performance of the lidar systems and the sharing of existing data, coordinates data taking strategic planning within the upper atmospheric lidar community, facilitates more rapid dissemination of technical lidar advances, and coordinates education, training, and outreach activities. The consortium establishes a Technology Center that focuses on unified establishment of robust and stable lidar operation, the exploration of advanced laser and optical technologies, and the expedition of technology transfer within traditionally isolated and competing lidar groups. The initial goal of the consortium is to make regular nighttime and daytime measurements of temperatures and winds in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere commonplace and consistent at the three primary lidar sites.",
