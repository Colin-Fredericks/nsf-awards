 "awd_abstract_narration": "This exploratory grant is aimed at demonstrating a new concept for achieving high quality transistors on flexible substrates. It makes use of a transient metal substrate for Sior Ge- based transistors, and allows lamination onto a flexible polymer carrier. The process facilitates the incorporation of additional active and passive components, thus providing the key building blocks to achieve complete low cost, large area mechanically flexible electronic systems.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe proposed research represents an entirely novel approach to an important problem, namely that of obtaining high performance semiconductor devices on flexible substrates.  This is an intellectually important challenge, and the proposed approach sidesteps issues encountered by the current, heavily researched approaches (polymer transistors, or low temperature processed amorphous silicon). The proposed research also addresses important materials processing challenges associated with materials compatibility. A fundamental thermodynamic approach will be taken to address these issues.\r\n\r\nBroad Impact:\r\nIn terms of broad impact, the project will contribute to the education and training of a US national PhD student in Materials Science and Engineering. Moreover, the successful demonstration of the concept is expected to greatly expand the capability of low cost electronic systems on flexible substrates, opening up entirely new applications for flexible electronic systems.\r\n",
