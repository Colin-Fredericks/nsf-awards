 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development of a Novel Wireless Sensor System Test-Bed for Infrastructure Health Monitoring and Biomedical Applications \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent years have seen tremendous interest in wireless sensors for applications ranging from package tracking to infrastructure health monitoring and telemedicine to implanted disease diagnosis. The development of efficient sensors is currently inhibited due to a lack of knowledge on their system level performance metrics. The goal of this project is to develop a novel wireless sensor system testbed within which sensors will be designed and tested for infrastructure health monitoring and biomedical applications. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe unique wireless sensor test-bed proposed in this project does not currently exist. The limitation of most far-field chambers lies in their enormous cost and complexity since they are designed to measure a diverse array of antenna and transceiver characteristics. This work will develop a small, low cost, portable wireless sensor testbed, which will be used to measure the range and data link margin of a wireless sensor as function of the reader output power, antenna type and embedding medium.  The project consists of developing a non-radiated and a radiated characterization testbeds. The first component will consist of simple fabrication, integration and test facilities to assess the non-radiated performance while the second component will consist of instrumentation to conduct radiated tests to measure power and data link margin.   \r\n\t \r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe novel wireless sensor system testbed will help create miniature wireless sensors with high efficiency and data throughput. The technology developed will be made available for use by academic institutions and commercial companies. The instrumentation infrastructure developed in this project will be an asset to foster economic growth in the state of South Carolina. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students and will involve students from underrepresented groups and minorities.  \r\n",
