During this conference leaders from academia and industry in bioengineering and nanotechnology will come together to discuss problems and issues of importance to these fields. This conference is the second time that an international forum will be devoted to bioengineering and nanotechnology.  The first was in Singapore in 2004. The focus of the California conference will be new directions that unite engineering, science and medicine including delivery systems, imaging, medicinal chemistry, chiral pharmaceuticals, tissue engineering, molecular diagnostics, biomimetics, and nanomaterials.  The objectives of the conference are the exploration of common challenges, fostering of interactions and relationships for collaborations, and discussion of research methods, techniques and tools to advance science. Biological Engineering is playing a leading role in the remarkable applications of biological systems to human health, production of pharmaceuticals, commodity chemicals, foods and solution of environmental problems. The identifying of common challenges and the fostering of interactions and relationships for collaborations is a highly beneficial result that will facilitate these applications.\r\n",
