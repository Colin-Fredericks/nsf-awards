 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support part of the IAI core budget operational expenses for a three-year period (October 2005 - September 2008). The IAI is an intergovernmental organization supported, at present, by 19 countries in the Americas dedicated to pursuing the principles of scientific excellence, international cooperation, and the open exchange of scientific information to increase the understanding of global change phenomena and their socio-economic implications. The IAI's mission is to develop the capacity to understand the integrated impact of past, present and future global changes on regional and continental environments in the Americas and to promote collaborative research and informed action at all levels. \r\n\r\nThe request is to cover 85% of the costs of the IAI Directorate international staff salaries along with part of the costs associated with travels of the IAI Directorate staff and of the Scientific Advisory Members (SAC) members and part of the costs of communications (dissemination/documentation/publication) at the institute. The remaining expenses to be supported by the IAI core budget are covered by the other IAI member countries. \r\n\r\nBackground \r\nThe IAI has been listed by the State Department as an international organization within the meaning of the Federal Employees International Organization Service Act, covered by 5 U.S.C. 3343 and 5 U.S.C. 3581. \r\n\r\nCore Budget support, for which this proposal is submitted, allows the operation of the Directorate of the IAI. Currently, the IAI Directorate is hosted by Brazil in Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo state, on the campus of the Brazilian National Space Research Institute (INPE), where the IAI Directorate functions as an internationally recognized juridical personality, with the corresponding privileges and immunities granted by the Government of Brazil. \r\n\r\nCore Budget commitment pledges are made by the all Parties to the Agreement Establishing the IAI: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, the USA, and Venezuela. Amounts are arrived at by consensus at an annual meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the IAI Agreement. \r\n\r\nThe IAI is a U.S. initiative to stimulate cooperative research on global change issues among the scientific institutions of the Americas. The National Science Foundation is the lead U.S. Government agency designated by the White House to carry out U.S. responsibilities within the IAI.",
