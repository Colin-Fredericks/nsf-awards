 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers at New York University, Monmouth University and the\r\nUniversity of Colorado are constructing Japanese/English and\r\nChinese/English machine translation systems which automatically acquire\r\nrules from ``deep'' linguistic analyses of parallel text.  This work\r\nis a natural culmination of automated example-based Machine\r\nTranslation (MT) projects that have become increasingly sophisticated\r\nover the last two decades. The following recent advances in Natural\r\nLanguage Processing (NLP) technologies make this inquiry feasible: (1)\r\nannotated data including bilingual treebanks and processors trained on\r\nthis data (parsers, PropBankers, etc.); (2) semantic post-processors\r\nof parser output; (3) programs that automatically align bitexts; and\r\n(4) bilingual tree to tree translation models.\r\n\r\nNatural languages vary widely in the ordering of corresponding words\r\nfor equivalent expressions across linguistic boundaries and within a\r\nsingle language. This research investigates ways to minimize the\r\nvariations within a single language using a type of semantic\r\nrepresentation (GLARF) that is derived automatically from syntactic\r\ntrees. Such semantic representation provides for: (1) a reduction in the\r\nnumber of ways of representing the same underlying message, and (2)\r\na way to handle long distance dependencies (e.g. relative\r\nclauses) as local phenomena. Therefore, there is no need to resort to\r\narbitrarily long sentence fragments or large trees for\r\ntraining. Furthermore, since less data is needed, it\r\nminimizes the sparse data problem.\r\n\r\nIn the training of this translation model, because of (1), the number\r\nof mapping rules between the source tree and the target tree is\r\nreduced.  The translation model, then, is a tree transducer, with\r\n``deep'' linguistically analyzed trees for both source and target\r\nrepresentations.  In order to provide efficient computer algorithms\r\nfor such partial mappings, this research needs to focus on\r\n(a) the training algorithm and the (b) the constraints over the\r\nmapping rules in order to reduce the computational complexity.\r\n\r\nThis research is expected to yield several advantages: The core\r\narchitecture of this transducer using ``deep'' linguistic analyses\r\nshould yield more accurate results. The GLARF architecture allows\r\ncontrol over different granularity of automatically-obtained\r\nlinguistic analyses.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The demand for machine translation spans from the\r\nlocal government (e.g. police forces) to national government\r\n(e.g. CIA) and the private sector.  Given the growth of the Internet\r\noutside the English speaking world, better machine translation is of\r\ncritical importance for the broader community.  This work directly\r\naffects the ability of English speakers to understand websites written\r\nin Chinese and Japanese, two of the most widely used languages on the\r\nInternet. The technique is generalizable to other language pairs and\r\ncan ultimately have even wider impact.\r\n",
