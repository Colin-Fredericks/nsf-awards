 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drought stress is ubiquitous and is an important selective agent in the evolution of plant growth, development, and physiology.  Drought stress is also a major limiting factor to crop productivity worldwide. Many plant species vary among genetic lines in their ability to cope with drought and this variation provides a unique resource for exploring gene function.  This 2010 project will identify genes and physiological networks associated with drought resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana using genome-wide molecular techniques and natural variation among accessions from different locations. Drought-induced gene expression and physiological differences among accessions with extreme high and low water use efficiency will be characterized and genes involved will be mapped to genomic positions.  In addition, new resources will be developed for quantitative genetic studies in Arabidopsis, including a mapping population and a series of genetic lines capturing genomic regions from physiologically diverse accessions.  \r\n\r\nResults from this project will be useful for application to crop improvement and to understanding evolution of drought resistance in plants. The project will provide training for postdocs and students in molecular genetics, evolutionary biology, physiology, and bioinformatics - skills necessary for the next generation of successful genomic scientists. Undergraduate and community college students will gain research experience and career exploration and preparation.  All plant materials and associated genotypic data will be made available using The Arabidopsis Information Resource infrastructure (http://www.arabidopsis.org).  Project progress will be available at the project website (https://webspace.utexas.edu/tjuenger/www/2010.htm).  Microarray data generated through the project will be submitted to AtGenExpress (http://web.uni-frankfurt.de/fb15/botanik/mcb/AFGN/atgenex.htm). \r\n\r\n\r\n",
