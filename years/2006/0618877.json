 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) Intellectual Merit:  This project merges and expands two efforts: The Paradigms in Physics Project, a complete redesign of the upper-level physics major, and the Vector Calculus Bridge Project, an effort to \"bridge the gap\" between the mathematics and physics of vector calculus. The merged project is run by an established team, with two new members in education research, appropriate to its expanded role. The primary thrust of the project is to design materials that provide multiple entry points to these successful curricula, aimed not only at encouraging full adoption of all 18 redesigned courses, but also at supporting faculty teaching more traditional courses who may wish to experiment with one or more pieces, whether a single activity or an entire course. Four main strands have been identified:\r\n\r\n1. New content: The PIs are developing new materials for textbooks for quantum mechanics and for vector calculus, emphasizing their innovative approach to these topics, while encouraging, but not requiring, the use of active engagement. \r\n2. Case studies: The PIs are expanding their existing websites to provide the information necessary for successful adoption of one or more of their activities, showing how to combine lectures and active engagement in a coherent way.\r\n3. Community of scholars: The PIs are hosting a small number of visitors who are immersed in, and contribute to, the entire Paradigms package.\r\n4. Education Research: The PIs are doing research into students' ability to reason harmonically and metacognitively, and how these skills are affected by their materials.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  In addition to the impact on students, faculty, TAs, and visitors directly involved in the project, the primary goal of this project is to make the materials and techniques available to as wide an audience as possible. Broad impacts are expected as a formal part of the project, but also in other ways, due to the use of multiple forms of dissemination.  The textbooks can be used by many students and faculty beyond the immediate adopters of the Paradigms program. The case studies on the website can be used for training TAs and other teachers. Visitors can infuse the Paradigms vision with unexpected insights and knowledge that will spin off in new directions. The information gained by this research into student learning is being made available to the entire education research community.",
