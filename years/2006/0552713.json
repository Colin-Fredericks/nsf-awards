 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the Oak Crest Institute of Science for the summers of 2006-2008. The program director is Marc Baum. Nine students each year will do research in the environmental sciences providing an ideal framework for a diverse, yet focused research portfolio. The range of research projects includes: CO2 activation; molecular recognition of environmental analytes; particle science and spectroscopy; biocatalysis; vehicle exhaust emission measurement; and colorimetric detection of arsenic in natural waters. The team of eight mentors is comprised of faculty from: Oak Crest (5); the California Institute of Technology (1); and Pasadena City College (2). The proposed REU site is designed exclusively to involve community college students and, therefore, operates year-round with admissions tri-annually and makes allowance for part-time participation at a minimum of 20 hours per week (total: 400 hours). Part-time students often work in teams of two to further productivity. Undergraduates will experience the complete academic life cycle, including project selection, proposal preparation, conducting the research, and communication of the results both orally and in writing. They will take part in workshops, group meetings, a Journal Club, and will attend seminars at local universities. All research activities will take place at Oak Crest, which possesses the required infrastructure to implement the above research projects.",
