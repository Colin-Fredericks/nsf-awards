 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nAcquisition of 600 kips High-Capacity Servo-Hydraulic Tensile/Compression Test Machine for Integrated Research and Education in Structural Material Engineering\r\n\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation grant is for the acquisition of a high capacity servo-hydraulic tension/compression test machine with the ability to apply cyclic loading to support education and research activities in structural material engineering. The equipment and instrumentation consist of an Olsen L series 600 RB servo-hydraulic tension/compression test machine with a capacity of 600 kips capable of static, fatigue testing; (2) hydraulic service manifolds and hydraulic power pumps; (3) electronic control system; and, (4) high-capacity data acquisition system unit.  \r\n\r\nThe new test machine will benefit students and faculty in the Civil Engineering Technology, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering Technology, Electrical Engineering, Electrical Engineering Technology as well as students and faculty from other academic departments such as Physics and Agriculture. Faculty in these departments are actively pursuing and conducting interdisciplinary research projects and have been successful in obtaining the support of private industry as well as state and federal agencies. The primary areas of research, research training, and educational activities that will be supported by the equipment are: (i) structural testing of components and subassemblies; (ii) behavior of ultra-high performance nano structured concrete materials; (iii) testing and evaluation of high strength steel tubes; (iv) structural health monitoring of civil infrastructure, (v) testing and evaluation of nanoelastomer for bridge bearing,  (vi) long-term durability evaluation of concrete/composite interface, (vii) evaluation of multifunctional nanocomposite structural system, (viii) NSF-research experience for undergraduate students and (ivv) personnel training in concrete strength testing. \r\n\r\nThe new test machine will allow the implementation of materials and structures demonstrations and teaching laboratories. The laboratories will feature experimental testing, data acquisition and simulation systems to conduct planned tests.  Students will also improve both their creativity and analytical thinking.  More than seventeen courses will be affected by the implementation of the laboratories in addition to individual students working on their senior project or participating in the NSF-REU site.   With the new equipment, AAMU will be in a position to offer fully functional facilities to its faculty, graduate and undergraduate students to carry out significant research and educational activities that address the nation's needs as well as will allow AAMU in attracting significant corporate and government research funding and draw a larger number of graduate and undergraduate students to pursue careers in engineering and technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
