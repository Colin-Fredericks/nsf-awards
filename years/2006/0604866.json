 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the last thirty years, much of the progress in our understanding   of 3-dimensional topology has been grounded in hyperbolic (non-  euclidean) geometry and in topological quantum field theory. However,  these two branches of mathematics have long evolved in parallel, without much interaction with each other. Hypothetical bridges   between these two fields are now beginning to emerge. One of them is the Volume Conjecture, experimentally verified by a few computations, which connects the asymptotic growth of the Jones polynomials of a  knot to the volume of the canonical hyperbolic metric of its  complement. The goal of the Project is to develop a conceptual framework combining the two points of view. The Project has a 2- dimensional component, focussed on the representation theory of the  quantum Teichmuller space of a surface, as introduced by physicists  to model quantum gravity in dimension 2+1. A second part of the Project builds on the insight gained in dimension 2 to develop  invariants of hyperbolic 3-dimensional manifolds, closely related to the objects appearing in the Volume Conjecture.\r\n\r\nThe Project aims at gaining a better understanding of 3-dimensional  geometry, such as the problem of deciding when two knotted curves in  space can be deformed to each other. One traditional approach to this  problem involves the algebraic manipulation of certain polynomials  associated to pictorial descriptions of these curves. Another  powerful technique, with widely used software implementation, uses  hyperbolic non-euclidean geometry. Experimental evidence suggests an  unexpected connection between these two points of view. The goal of  the Project is to develop technical and conceptual tools to confirm  (or disprove) this connection, and to better understand the phenomena  involved.\r\n",
