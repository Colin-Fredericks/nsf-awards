 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nThe development project is aimed at advancing the design technology for ultra-high-resolution small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) instrumentation and x-ray optics with broad applications in nanoscale structure characterization.  A new optical design concept that can significantly enhance (up to 10-fold) the resolution and signal-to-noise ratio in SAXS measurements will be developed.  The superior performance results from a compound optical configuration incorporating both a primary monochromator mirror and a pre-sample secondary focusing mirror to increase resolution and peak intensity.  This unique design is expected to supplant the prevalent three-pinhole configuration in current SAXS instruments. The scientific and engineering problems of interest cover a range of multidisciplinary fields including soft condensed matter, biological physics and bioengineering, neuroscience, and bioinorganic chemistry.  The instrument will operate out of the x-ray facility of the Materials Research Laboratory, with an established user base of more than 250 researchers from campus, other institutions and local industry. The development should broadly impact the national academic research infrastructure by advancing the optical design and performance of SAXS instrumentation used in diverse research areas in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The investigators of this project will continue their involvement in their numerous outreach programs available at UCSB to improve access to science for diverse groups, including undergraduate and graduate student training, outreach to K-12 students and teachers, and community outreach.  \r\n\r\nLay Abstract\r\n\r\nEnhancing structure characterization of nanomaterials is critical to the emerging areas of nanoscience, nanotechnology, and biotechnology.  We will develop a laboratory-based microbeam x-ray scattering instrument for discovering the structures of novel new materials on the 1 nanometer to 1000 nanometer scale. The performance of this new instrument will exceed the best commercially available x-ray instrument and will provide a significant enhancement to the campus infrastructure in nanoscience and technology. The development of this cutting edge x-ray characterization tool will establish UCSB as one of strongest institutions in the x-ray characterization area, which will attract users not only from multiple campus groups but also from other research institutions as well. The project provides an excellent training opportunity to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who will not only participate in building the cutting-edge x-ray tool but also be able to utilize it in a series of research projects which will take advantage of the new capability afforded by the instrument. The x-ray development program will be integrated with the ongoing outreach activities of the principle investigators in mentoring undergraduate students and local high school teachers participating in the large number of ongoing summer internship programs at UCSB. \r\n\r\n",
