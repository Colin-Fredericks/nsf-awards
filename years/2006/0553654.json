 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\n\r\nRUI: An innovative Hybrid Technology for the Removal and Destruction of Perchlorate from Aqueous Systems Using Polymeric Ligand Exchange Technology and a Packed Bed Bio-Reactor\r\n\r\nPerchlorate, ClO4-, contamination in groundwater is a significant environmental concern\r\nin many regions of the United States and throughout the world. For this reason, perchlorate has been on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Contaminate Candidate List since 1998. Human consumption of perchlorate is known to affect the function of the thyroid gland by inhibiting the uptake of iodide. The affects of perchlorate consumption on children and pregnant women can be especially severe because of the role that the thyroid plays in human development. Because of its nonvolatile, highly soluble, and kinetically inert nature, perchlorate remediation of contaminated groundwater by conventional techniques is inefficient. Current research explores many new remediation technologies, with ion-exchange seemingly the most promising method.\r\nAn efficient, innovative, and economically-feasible procedure for the separation of perchlorate from contaminated groundwater coupled with an environmentally benign process for its destruction will be developed. The study will contribute significant new information for the development and use of a new class of polymeric ligand exchangers for perchlorate separation.\r\n\r\nThis project will also focus upon  (1) Promoting Teaching, Training and Learning: Each of the PIs has an appointment in a different discipline, and each will contribute to this projects success through his/her own expertise. Lafayette College students, many of whom pursue careers in environmental science, policy, and management, are eager to obtain an understanding of the fundamental principles of research in chemistry, engineering, biology, and environmental science. This research provides an ideal multidisciplinary opportunity for teaching and training this group. Students from many different majors will take part in this research. (2) Broadening Participation of Underrepresented Groups: Among the five undergraduates who have helped produce the preliminary research, three are women; we anticipate that, because of its environmental focus, this project will appeal to female students. (3) Benefits to society: Perchlorate contamination in drinking water is a global problem and the development of a cost effective means of its removal is of considerable importance to public welfare. \r\n\r\n",
