 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humpherys\r\nDMS-0607721\r\n\r\n     This work focuses on the stability theory of traveling\r\nwaves, with an emphasis on front propagation arising in the\r\ncontinuum and kinetic theories of compressible flow.  This class\r\nof problems models key real-world phenomena such as shock waves\r\nin a viscous gas or plasma, detonations in a reactive gas, and\r\nthe propagation of phase boundaries in a viscous fluid.  The\r\ninvestigator studies long-standing open questions about the\r\nstability of traveling waves in these areas by exploring the\r\neffects of key structural features, such as symmetrizability and\r\ngenuine coupling.  Through an exhaustive numerical study, which\r\nincludes Evans function computation, he seeks a better\r\nunderstanding of the stability properties of traveling waves in\r\nthese important problem areas, particularly in regimes where\r\nanalytical methods currently provide little information.  In\r\nconnection with recent work with his collaborators, the\r\ninvestigator develops better algorithms for Evans function\r\ncomputation.  An additional benefit of this work is the continued\r\ndevelopment of the investigator's freely available numerical\r\nEvans function toolbox, which also allows for the exploration of\r\nsystems beyond our immediate interest.  Moreover, the\r\ninvestigator uses this package as an investigative tool in\r\nstudent-focused undergraduate research. \r\n\r\n     Traveling waves are ubiquitous in nature, occurring\r\neverywhere from population models in ecology to the propagation\r\nof tsunamis in the oceanic sciences, or from shock waves of a\r\nsupersonic jet to the flickering pulses of light in a fiber optic\r\ncable.  The stability properties of these traveling waves\r\ndescribe the degree to which they can persist in the presence of\r\ndisturbances.  This work focuses on the mathematics of traveling\r\nwaves and develops computational methods for exploring the\r\nstability properties of waves in a myriad of areas in the pure\r\nand applied sciences.",
