 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract:  Recent advances in nanotechnology are driven by the growing demand for ever smaller and faster electronic devices. Among such devices, quantum dots are especially promising. At the heart of a quantum dot device lies a tiny droplet of electron liquid.  Modern experimental techniques not only allow exquisite control over the shape and size of such droplet, but also offer precise control over the number of electrons in it.  This high degree of tunability guarantees that quantum dot-based devices will play a prominent role in future technologies. The spectrum of possible applications ranges from a nanoscale alternative for a conventional field-effect transistor to spintronics devices to building blocks for quantum information processing.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will explore theoretically the possibility of utilizing the tunability of the quantum dot-based artificial magnetic impurities to realize the critical regime of the two-channel Kondo and two-impurity Kondo models. These two models are perhaps the simplest and the best understood ones in which thermodynamic and transport quantities display singularities at low energies, in an apparent contradiction with predictions of the Fermi-liquid theory. The goal of the proposed research is to formulate a clear strategy of tuning quantum dot devices to the vicinity of quantum critical points, and to present detailed theoretical predictions concerning transport properties of quantum dot systems in the critical regime.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit of the proposed activity. This proposal presents a set of theoretical projects at the cutting edge of the low-temperature physics of nanoscale systems. This work will substantially advance the state-of-the-art of theoretical modeling of transport in single-electron devices in particular and nanostructures in general, and will have a crucial impact on the interpretation of the existing and future experiments seeking undisputable realizations of the multi-channel and many-impurity Kondo physics.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will have a broader impact in the areas of education and outreach. Integration of research and education through involvement of students in the research program is a priority. The PI is committed to the principle of diversity and will take proactive steps to engage members of underrepresented groups in the proposed research. The proposed program will be linked to the existing Georgia Tech outreach programs aimed at enhancing public awareness and understanding of the principles and promises of nanoscale science and technology, and the ways they may benefit the society.\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Abstract:  Recent advances in nanotechnology are driven by the growing demand for ever smaller and faster electronic devices.
