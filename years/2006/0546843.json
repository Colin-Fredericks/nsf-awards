 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Women in Science and Engineering System Transformation (WISEST)\r\nproject, at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), is to increase the number, participation,\r\nand leadership status of women, majority and minority, in eleven science and engineering\r\n(STEM) departments through institutional transformation. WISEST will use an innovative\r\napproach of a network of faculty facilitators from all STEM departments working with\r\ndepartment heads and an executive committee of key administrators and a social scientist.\r\nThis network will carry out five integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies: warm the\r\nclimate and decrease the isolation of women STEM faculty; recruit minority women faculty\r\nthrough an unique mentored postdoctoral program; transform STEM departments to foster\r\ndiversity and womens leadership; promote womens scholarship and teaching; and improve\r\nthe ability to track and report on gender equity. Proposed outcomes for STEM women\r\nfaculty include: increased numbers of majority and minority faculty; improved retention\r\nrate; salary equity with men of similar accomplishments and productivity; increased\r\npercentage of leadership positions; improved job satisfaction; and increased national visibility\r\nfor our scholars. The intellectual merit of WISEST is that it will assess the impact of\r\nsystemic change to erase gender stereotyping rather than individual remediation and it will\r\nspecifically extend the focus of action to include the postdoctoral level to recruit faculty. Its\r\nbroader impact will be the creation of a life-friendly work climate for all UIC faculty.\r\nWISEST will share its experiences nationally, and serve as an exemplary model for fostering\r\ngender equity and diversity in academe.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nMo-Yin Tam, Principal Investigator\n moyintam@uic.edu\nwww.uic.edu/depts/oaa/wisest\n\n The overall goal of the UIC WISEST program is to increase the number, participation, and leadership status of minority and majority women in academic science and engineering through Institutional transformation.  During the five years of the grant, WISEST initiated and facilitated the implementation of a number of programs including\n\nstart-up support for new women hires\n\n\ntraining to increase awareness of unconscious gender bias in faculty hire evaluations as well as promotion and tenure consideration\n\n\nwork-life friendly policies including the automatic tenure hold (compensate for time loss for building up scholarship records towards tenure without having to make a request) and modified duties (providing time off from teaching) for faculty with a new child\n\n\nWork-life friendly programs including the provision of an infant and elder care resources and referral service.   \n\n\nThese programs targeted women faculty of 11 departments in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines at UIC but they also applied to all faculty aiming at warming the work climate for the entire institution.  They resulted in significant improvement in the representation of women in STEM and increasing faculty satisfaction.\n\nRepresentation of women in the 11 STEM departments increased from 34 (13.8%) in 2005 to 48 (20.8%) in 2011.  \n\n\nThe number of underrepresented minority (URM) STEM faculty increased from 10 (4%) in 2005 to 15 (6.5%) in 2011.  The number of URM STEM women increased in number from 4 in 2005 to 8 in 2011 and as a percentage of STEM women from 11.8% in 2005 to 16.7% in 2011.\n\n\nSTEM women thrived at UIC, with 5 of the 24 women (20.5%) hired as assistant professors from 2005-2011 receiving the prestigious NSF early CAREER award.  They stayed (91% retention rate during the period 2005-2011) and were tenured and promoted (at 86% rate during the same period).\n\n\nDespite having gone through three years of salary freeze and one year with mandatory furlough days due to declining fiscal state support, faculty became more satisfied with their positions and career progressions as assessed by two climate surveys (in 2004 and 2011).\n\nFaculty overall were more satisfied with their current positions (79% being \"satisfied\" in 2011 compared to 70% in 2004) and with their career progression (82% being \"satisfied\" in 2011 compared to 77% in 2004)  \nSTEM women indicated similar increase in satisfaction. More importantly, the percentage of STEM women being \"very satisfied\" with their current positions almost doubled (from 16.7% in 2004 to 27.8% in 2011) and the percentage being \"very satisfied\" with their career progression more than tripled (from 12.5% in 2004 to 38.9% in 2011).\n\n\n\n\nThrough numerous presentations and publications during the grant, WISEST shared with the ADVANCE communities its products that had contributed to its success. \n\nWISEST organizational model:  WISEST mapped within its structures three groups of change agents which played the roles of the three elements in the Architecture of Inclusion framework identified by Susan Storm (2006)[1] as essentials for institutional transformation: namely, organizational catalysts, institutional intermediaries and institutional citizenship.\n\n\nWISEST faculty-facilitator model: One facilitator appointed in each department worked individually and as a group to serve as mentors for STEM women, advocates of the WISEST mission in their departments, as well as linkages between the STEM faculty and the campus leadership.\n\n\nWISEST SUCCEED training program:  Training provided by faculty-facilitators to increase awareness of unconscious gender bias in faculty search and promotion and tenure consideration.\n\n\nWISEST unique postdoctoral program: Unlike a traditional postdoctoral program, it had distinct features (including having 5 postdocs hired by WISEST as a cohort to conduct research in the areas of their choice, being mentored by a cadre of mentors and provided a monthly series of mentoring seminars) contributing to its success.  After completion of the program, all 5 postdocs secured appointments with research universities and 3 of them became tenure-track assistant professors.\n\n\nWISEST \"First-Lecture\" for engineering students:  Senior faculty members delivered presentations to students on their day of classes to increase their awareness of unconscious gender bias setting the tone for a positive learning environment built on mutual respect and inclusion.\n\n\nSince the end of the grant, a number of WISEST programs have been institutionalized in UIC with expectation to be expanded beyond the 11 STEM departments in the future.\n\nWISEST has been integrated into the Office of the Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs with a new Director.\n\n\nSUCCEED training becomes mandatory for faculty search committees and promotion and tenure committees in the Colleges of Engineering and Liberal Arts and Sciences.  It also has become part of the annual orientation for the Campus Promotion and Tenure Committee. \n\n\nThe faculty-facilitators continue to be funded by the Provost and the Deans in the 11 STEM departments.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Storm, Susan (2006).
