Shmoys\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit - For most applications in which optimization algorithms  are employed in industry, the input data is actually not known. This might be  because the data is based on measurements, which are estimates due to noise, or because only a forecast of future data is available. Stochastic  optimization models incorporate this uncertainty as part of the input, and are  harder to solve than their deterministic counterparts. This research  investigates algorithms that compute provably near-optimal solutions for \r\nstochastic optimization problems; in contrast, traditional approaches mostly  show convergence results without guarantees to efficiently produce  near-optimal solutions.  Broader Impact - Finding good approaches to  gain new efficiencies in logistical planning is important for the overall US  economy.  This research develops new algorithmic techniques to do this. By studying simplified models, this research devises algorithmic paradigms that  can then be applied in more concrete applications, thereby providing industry \r\nwith better solutions.  Furthermore, it is important that the US workforce has  sufficient expertise to meet the technological challenges of the coming  century, and by integrating this research with the training of both graduate  and undergraduate students, this work helps to meet this need in maintaining  the economic competitiveness of the US.\r\n\r\nThis research addresses a number of specific discrete stochastic optimization  problems, focusing primarily on problems from logistics: routing, scheduling,  inventory management and network design. This research focuses on a \"black box\"  that specifies the probabilistic input by means of polynomial independent \r\nsamples from the underlying distribution;  this is important when one has  access to historical data.  This work studies the stochastic TSP, max cut, and  single-machine scheduling problems; 2-stage with recourse models of the  survivable network design and maximum job selection problems, and multistage \r\nstochastic models from inventory control, options pricing, and AdWords bidding.  This research also studies the deterministic asymmetric TSP, bin-packing, and  capacitated facility-location problems. \r\n",
