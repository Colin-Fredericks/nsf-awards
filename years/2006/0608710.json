 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current radio technology trends promise to enable \"Dynamic Spectrum Access\" (DSA) networks, using wide-band spectrum sensing, real-time spectrum allocation and acquisition, and infrastructureless mesh networks.  These trends challenge the existing technologies and the traditional \"command and control\" methods of allocating and licensing spectrum by government fiat.  IEEE DySPAN is the premier symposium on DSA Networks that brings together the technologists designing and building these new exciting devices with the spectrum policy community that will be charged with re-architecting the legal regime for managing spectrum in the 21st century that must accommodate these new technologies.  DySPAN 2006, sponsored by IEEE Communication Society and ACM SIGMOBILE, will be held in Dublin, Ireland.  Participation in events like this is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the field.  The support provided enables the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend DySPAN 2006 at such an international venue.",
