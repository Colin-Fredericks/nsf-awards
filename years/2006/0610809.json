 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to synthesize and characterize new optically addressed molecular switches and incorporate them into an innovative reflective display films. These materials will then be studied for optical addressing and erasing of high-resolution images under various molecular alignments achievable in an electro-optic driven bi-stable display cell. Prototype display films coated on thin flexible plastic substrates well be fabricated and evaluated for control of image lifetime in ambient light and for use as a low-cost (pennies) display for tagging and related applications.\r\n\r\nPhotochemical chiral materials will be utilized to create a photographic film in which an image can be erased and a new image optically addressed repeatedly on the same film. As a paper replacement, these displays are developed for such applications as point of purchase, identification, and production line tags as well as updatable displays on credit and debit cards. If successful, this will create a new market that electronically addressed displays have not been able to penetrate because of their high cost due to attached drive and control electronics.\r\n",
