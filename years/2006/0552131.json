 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Agricultural Science Summer & Research Education and Development (ASSURED) REU Site is held at the New Mexico State University's Chile Pepper Institute. The ASSURED program accepts 10 students for a ten-week summer research session in genomics, plant science and agriculture.  The program's goal is to have underrepresented first generation college students from immigrant farm labor families expand their appreciation of agricultural science in a university, research-rich context.  Students engage in a research program that explores questions relevant to agricultural science. Students are also given the opportunity to learn about various careers available in agriculture from restaurant management to genetics, microbiology and crop production. In the ASSURED research environment, students take real life situations and apply the scientific method to the discovery process. Students learn from mentors and contribute to the research program of the mentors. Student projects include genetics, breeding, plant physiology, insect control, economics, weed control, agricultural engineering, and many others. Weekly group meetings, workshops and lectures cover ethical conduct in research, career choices, etc.  The students are required to prepare an oral presentation, a poster presentation and a written report on their research findings.  Students with disabilities are also eligible for the program. More information is available by contacting Dr. Paul Bosland or Mrs. Danise Coon at the Chile Pepper Institute, (505)646-3028, hotchile@nmsu.edu or by visiting www.chilepepperinstitute.org.",
