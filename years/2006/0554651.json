 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project would develop professional resources to help elementary teachers strengthen their students' writing skills, particularly writing in science notebooks. The proposed resources would include print and multi-media formats for teachers and handbooks for their professional development providers.  The project is based on a highly successful program developed in the Seattle Public Schools.  During the program's six-year history it has undergone extensive evaluation by Inverness Research Associates demonstrating the program's efficacy and positive impact on student performance.  Co-PI Fulwiler received foundation grants to further develop and refine components of these resources.  Prior to dissemination the proposed resources would undergo further field tests in central Washington and rural Maine.  Heinemann Publishers is committed to publishing the completed resources. \r\n",
