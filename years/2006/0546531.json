 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports Dr. Seth Cohen at the University of California at San Diego to use heteroditopic chelators to prepare new metalloligands for the construction of functionalized metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).  The ability of metalloligands to replicate known MOF architectures will be examined in order to delineate fundamental design principles required for predictable network formation.  Preliminary studies show that with some linking motifs, metalloligands can successfully reproduce the topology of target MOFs.  Early findings also show that homochiral MOFs can be prepared that exploit the chirality of an octahedral tris(chelate) building block.  Furthermore, guest exchange studies show that these MOFs are robust and can readily exchange encapsulated species.  Studies will be undertaken to investigate metalloligands of different symmetries and linking motifs, as well as the host-guest properties of the resultant frameworks.  Ultimately, this research program seeks to reveal the essential design parameters for a metalloligand needed to generate a desired MOF topology.  Elucidating these central parameters will allow for the rational modification of coordination complexes for use as building blocks in functionalized MOFs with a predictable structure.\r\n\r\nMaterials that possess nanoscale pores and channels will be designed and synthesized.  Such materials may find a host of applications in the rapidly growing field of nanotechnology, where they may play central roles in fuel cells, catalysts, and sensors.  Capitalizing on the increased interest in the subject of forensic sciences, forensic themes will be incorporated into introductory chemistry courses as a means to excite and engage students early in their academic career.  Guest speakers from local forensic laboratories will illustrate the applicability of the concepts being presented in general chemistry courses.  The commencement of a co-op program between U.C. San Diego and the Southwest Laboratory of the Drug Enforcement Administration will give undergraduate students an opportunity to learn about on-the-job applications of fundamental chemical principles and methods.  This co-op program benefits both the academic and government institutions by providing a real chemistry work experience to the undergraduate participants, while simultaneously connecting the local DEA laboratory to a potential source of future forensic chemists, who have an excellent working knowledge of the job requirements.  Other educational goals include outreach and liaison efforts to campuses with significant populations of underrepresented minorities in science, and sabbatical visits for educators from primarily undergraduate institutions.\r\n",
