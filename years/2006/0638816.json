 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Number: 0638816\r\nPI:  Barmish\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\n\r\nThe major objective of the proposed multi-disciplinary exploratory research is to develop system models and the associated nonlinear feedback control theory which is specific to new classes of Multi-Functional Materials. Such materials are typically anisotropic composites having microstructure of nano or micro inclusions optimized to perform multiple tasks. In this regard, the primary motivation for the proposed exploratory research is derived from the following fact: In addition to their traditional load-carrying function, they also exhibit electro-active or magneto-active behavior; e.g., their  mechanical properties can be controlled via application of an electric or magnetic field. This leads to new classes of control and optimization problems. The intellectual merit of this work will be to introduce some new paradigm problems into the systems and control community. Our efforts will concentrate on the formulation and solution of fundamental problems which can be used as a takeoff point for new lines of research.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nWith regard to broad and long term impact of the proposed work, we envision several new mainstream research directions supporting our main objectives. The first activity includes new control algorithms capable achieve desirable results with lesser actuation requirements. Should this exploratory research be successful, we envision a continuation of this work which focuses on design and optimization of materials composition and structure. This direction would be complimentary to ongoing research in carbon nano-tube based composites. To address the major objectives in material-oriented control, the expertise of the principal investigators is drawn from two distinct areas. Professor Barmish has made significant contributions to the robust control area and Professor Shkel has made significant contributions in multi-functional smart materials. The proposed research has both theoretical and experimental components. To this end, there will be constant interaction between the investigators involving modelling, testing of new control algorithms and iterative material design using equipment which is already available. Education-wise, this project suggests unique opportunities to introduce graduate students to a number of new inter-disciplinary ideas spanning electrical and mechanical engineering and material science. The plan is for Professor Barmish to introduce a number of new material science concepts into control courses and for Professor Shkel to introduce a number of new control concepts into material science courses.\r\n\r\n",
