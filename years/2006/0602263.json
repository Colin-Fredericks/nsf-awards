 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the basic ideas in the science and art is the idea of {\\em symmetry}. For example\r\none expects that the best solutions of technical problems are symmetric (an archetypical\r\nexample here is the wheel -- highly symmetric shape that is so useful in our everyday\r\nlife). On a deeper level it is expected that all the physical laws should be symmetric with\r\nrespect to a change of point of view and this appears to be the guiding principle of\r\nmany modern physical theories (starting with Einstein's Relativity Theory). It is quite a\r\nnontrivial problem to express the idea of symmetry in mathematical terms; but we\r\nhave a great progress in this direction. Actually there are at least three levels of abstraction\r\nin the solution of this problem: groups, Hopf algebras, tensor categories. The first part\r\nof this project is related with highest level of abstraction in this list, that is with tensor\r\ncategories. Despite of this high level of abstraction the theory is useful in the applications:\r\nin physics the language of tensor categories is used in theoretical study of phase\r\ntransitions and surface phenomena (and this is important if we want to produce more\r\nefficient computers); on the other hand the tensor categories are used in computer\r\nscience as a working tool for the constructing of the \"quantum computer\", a new\r\nconceptual approach to the computer architecture. So one expects that the study of\r\ntensor categories would be useful in the development of modern technologies.\r\nThus it is suggested to study the tensor categories\r\nfocusing on the construction of new interesting examples\r\nand the solution of classification problems.\r\nThe second part of the project is devoted to the representation theory. One can think\r\nabout representation theory as about the study how a symmetry can be realized in\r\nmathematical equations. Thus for a given symmetry (which is described by group,\r\nHopf algebra etc) representation theory aims to describe all the ways this symmetry\r\ncan show up in mathematical models. In the second part of the proposal it is suggested to\r\nstudy certain questions of representation theory of groups using insights\r\nfrom the theory of tensor categories (thus we would like to employ symmetry\r\nfor studying symmetry and this is indeed one of the guiding principles of the theory).\r\n\r\nMore technically, in the first part of the projectit is suggested to find new examples\r\nof fusion (= semisimple tensor) categories by studying fusion categories graded by\r\nfinite groups and by constructing new examples of module categories (then dual\r\ncategories will provide new examples of tensor categories). The second part\r\ndeals with geometric representation theory.  An extremely important class of objects of\r\ninterest for the representation theory is formed by character sheaves that were\r\nintroduced and classified by G.~Lusztig.",
