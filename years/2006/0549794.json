 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite its role as a vital nutrient, the distribution and dynamics of the marine phosphorus (P) cycle are poorly characterized compared to those of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). Given recent work suggesting that P may limit primary production in various oceanic regimes, and the large contribution of the coastal ocean to global production and C-export, it is essential to understand dynamics of P biogeochemistry and bioavailability in coastal systems. Taking advantage of prior NSF-OCE funded work off the coast of Oregon, this multi-disciplinary effort by scientists from the University of Hawaii, Oregon State University, and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, will result in a comprehensive evaluation of coupled C-N-P cycling on the upwelling-dominated Oregon coast. Specifically, they will quantify P-speciation of water column particulates, quantify molecular weight distribution of DOP and bioavailability of different molecular weight classes, quantify changes in particulate and dissolved C:N:P with water depth and integrate this uniquely comprehensive data set into a P-based, coupled circulation/ecosystem model to test fundamental hypotheses concerning P-dynamics, P-bioavailability, and P-stress/limitation. The synthetic effort will culminate in a P-based ecosystem model that will result in significant advances in our understanding of marine P-cycling, as well as in biological, biogeochemical, and ecosystem processes in the coastal ocean. \r\n\r\nIn terms of broader impacts, all three female scientists will advise and teach students from under-represented groups.  They will also create an interactive learning exercise in collaboration with a small educational company.  Their virtual world will engage girls (ages 8-14) in science and math activities and so expose millions of children to scientific inquiry and the coastal ocean ecosystem. In addition, new insights into coupled C-N-P dynamics in upwelling systems have societal impact, particularly in view of recent findings of a compromised ecosystem due to hypoxia and development of a 'dead zone' in coastal Oregon waters, possibly linked to global warming.  \r\n",
