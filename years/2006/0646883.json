 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new generation of non-chemical insecticidal textiles has broad applications in prevention of disease and reduction of environmental risks associated with insecticidal chemicals. Increasing incidence of resistance to existing insecticidal agents casts doubt over their future effectiveness for vector control and disease prevention, and provides additional impetus to developing novel approaches.  To create a \"next generation\" of insecticidal textiles that relies solely on non-chemical, non-toxic, and risk-free properties that physically prevent insect biting and disable or kill insects via physical interactions with the textile surface or interior, the project will: evaluate factors in fabric construction (porosity, thickness) that control ability to bite through the textile; evaluate interactions of mosquitoes with a variety of fabric surfaces and structures and evaluate potential for injury; design fabric structures that prevent bites and disable insects.\r\n\r\nThis high risk approach seeks to exploit mosquitoes' vulnerability to injury via purely physical interactions with textile structures. The results of this cross-disciplinary collaboration between textile scientists and entomologists are expected to enhance the knowledge of both fields and result in the development of a new paradigm for the design and manufacture of protective textile materials.\r\n\r\nBroader use of safe and durable insecticidal textiles, e.g. clothing, blankets, tenting, etc., may provide health and economic benefits for civilians and military personnel. High market demand for these novel textiles is anticipated for multiple applications including recreational and protective apparel, crop and livestock protection. Technology transfer will bolster the textile industry, create new job opportunities, and generate income\r\n",
