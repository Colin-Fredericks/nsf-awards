To foster the development of\r\ncomputational and mathematical science skills,  in this CSUMS\r\nproject the investigator and his colleagues establish an ongoing\r\nprogram of undergraduate research at George Mason University. \r\nThe program involves selected talented undergraduates in several\r\noverlapping research opportunities that share a reliance on\r\ncomputational mathematics.  Undergraduate mathematics majors work\r\nwith established professors on timely problems of computational\r\nmathematics with immediate applications in materials science,\r\nastronomy, space weather, dynamical systems modeling, biophysics,\r\nneuroscience, financial mathematics, statistics, and fluid\r\ndynamics.  The five co-investigators on the project, from the\r\nDepartment of Mathematical Sciences and the Department of\r\nComputational and Data Sciences, are joined by 20 other\r\nprofessors with experience in mentoring high-school and\r\nundergraduate students.  Each CSUMS cohort works together in a\r\ncentral knowledge core class, to rotate from year to year, and\r\nshortly thereafter specializes to one of several particular\r\nresearch projects related to the core.  Students are supervised\r\nby tenured/tenure track faculty and produce a poster and a\r\nwritten thesis describing their research by the end of the year. \r\n\r\n     This project addresses the important need to inspire and\r\neducate the next generation of computational scientists.  Due to\r\nthe heavy reliance of contemporary science on computational\r\nmodeling, experts in computational mathematics will be necessary\r\nfor the advancement of science in the U.S.  This project assists\r\nin the creation of well-trained computational mathematicians by\r\ninvolving today's mathematics majors in significant applied\r\nresearch at the undergraduate level.  Research experiences make\r\nthem more likely to succeed at the graduate level, in the\r\ncompletion of advanced degrees in computational areas.  The CSUMS\r\nprogram at George Mason University exposes the student to\r\ninteresting, computationally accessible research problems in\r\ncritical competitiveness areas, including materials science,\r\ncomputational fluid dynamics, financial mathematics, and several\r\nother areas in the biological and physical sciences. \r\nAdditionally, the program educates students about the value of\r\ncomputational skills while they are still formulating their\r\ncareer directions.  The project is supported by the MPS Division\r\nof Mathematical Sciences, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary\r\nActivities, and the EHR Division of Undergraduate Education. \r\n",
