 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) \r\nThe goal of this project is to add to the growing body of innovative public domain electronics laboratories and to improve regional electronics instruction by developing electronics labs that foster learning of electronics concepts and produce a proficiency at using modern electronic tools.  This project achieves the goal by adopting and exploiting contemporary tools such as automated data acquisition workstations, programmable chips, and simulations. In the same way that these powerful and flexible tools have generated impressive gains in productivity in the industrial sector, these electronics tools increase the efficiency with which students learn electronics.  Students begin by building circuits by hand but soon proceed to use these tools to yield multiple benefits in terms of student learning. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the labs are designed to interest and engage students. The project includes exploring implementation of labs that apply to real-world electronics using modern tools, and developing new labs made possible by the tools.  Several labs involve students in designing and burning their own integrated circuits. This project is also harnessing the creative inspiration of the students themselves by incorporating student-designed lab projects into the curriculum. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project builds on previous NSF-funded activities that have been successfully implemented, develops new labs using state-of-the-art tools, and shows improvement in student learning of advanced material.  The project includes a broad coalition of interested parties that has committed significant resources to the project.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This project contributes to the undergraduate STEM education knowledge base by prototyping local implementation of a proven approach to electronics laboratories. Because of the rapid rate of technological development in the electronics industry, electronics labs need frequent updating. This project illuminates the challenges of implementing these successful innovations at small to mid-sized universities.  A key part of this project is the active regional dissemination of electronics laboratory innovations by establishing a cohort of five interested electronics faculty in the greater Twin Cities region. This project encompasses three undergraduate courses plus a summer course that is designed for high school teachers who will in turn have a significant impact on their students.",
