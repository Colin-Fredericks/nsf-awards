 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zhou\r\nDMS-0604912\r\nForest\r\nDMS-0604891\r\n\r\n     This collaborative project targets mathematics and\r\ncomputation for a technologically important class of materials\r\ncalled polymer nano-composites (PNCs).  The investigators study\r\ntwo topics: the hydrodynamics of processing, and effective\r\nproperty characterization (e.g., conductive and mechanical\r\nproperties).   PNCs consist of ensembles of thin rods or\r\nplatelets (millions in a cubic micron, generating football fields\r\nof surface contact with the solvent), whose orientational\r\ndistribution and superior properties relative to the matrix have\r\nexhibited huge enhancements of materials properties in test\r\nsystems.  However, success in Nature and industry with fibers,\r\nwhich uniformly align the load bearing or conducting\r\nnano-elements, has not been duplicated for films and molds,\r\nthereby dramatically limiting the range of applications.  The\r\ndifficulties are widely documented in benchmark experiments: \r\nshear dominated, confined steady processing yields complex\r\ndynamics and heterogeneity in the rod or platelet ensemble. \r\nResultant film properties are highly anisotropic, non-uniform,\r\nand sensitive to nano-particle geometry, volume fraction, and\r\nprocessing conditions.  Theory, models, analysis, and numerical\r\nalgorithms are undertaken to explain these phenomena, to explore\r\nthe most perplexing observations, to map out parameter domains of\r\nrobust film flows, and to characterize the conductivity and\r\nmechanical effective property tensors.   The key object across\r\nall projects is the orientational probability distribution\r\nfunction (PDF) of the nano-particle ensemble.  The PDF is\r\ndescribed by the Doi kinetic theory and its extension to\r\nviscoelastic solvents, which the investigators and their\r\ncollaborators merge into homogenized averaging and\r\npercolation-dominated effective property characterization.  \r\n\r\n     The promises of nano-composite materials are profound. \r\nNano-scale \"designer\" molecules are added at very low percentages\r\nto traditional materials, with the result of huge gains in\r\nperformance properties of the composite relative to the original\r\nmaterial.  The nano-elements are much stronger, conduct\r\nelectricity or heat significantly better, or are impermeable to\r\ngases and liquids that contaminate traditional materials.  There\r\nis an engineering price, however, in that the smart engineering\r\nmodels and numerical codes that perform effectively for\r\ntraditional composites simply do not apply to nano-composites. \r\nThere are millions of nano-particles per cubic micron, with\r\nfootball fields of new surface area per raindrop of volume. \r\nThus, nano-composite flows cannot be simulated with existing\r\nsimulation tools.  The principal investigators are designing new\r\nnumerical simulation tools, based on new theoretical models,\r\nwhich extend the traditional flow processing models and codes by\r\naddition of new physics specific to nano-composites.  The\r\npredictions are tested in conjunction with nano-engineering\r\nexperimentalists.  The goal of this effort is a platform for\r\ndesign and control of nano-composite materials, with the ability\r\nto steer the processing phase to achieve targeted property\r\nspecifications.  \r\n",
