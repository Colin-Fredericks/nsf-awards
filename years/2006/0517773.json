 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nPaleontological and molecular evidence indicates that early whales are most closely related to\r\nartiodactyl land mammals, probably early anthracothere artiodactyls that were close to the ancestry of\r\nliving hippos. Two stages of Eocene archaeocete evolution are now well known morphologically: (1) an\r\nearly protocetid stage represented by 47 million-year-old early middle Eocene Rodhocetus; and (2) a\r\ngeneralized basilosaurid stage represented by 37 million-year-old middle-to-late Eocene Dorudon.\r\nField work carried out through 2004 in collaboration with the Geological Survey of Pakistan\r\ndemonstrates that it is possible to collect well-preserved and virtually-complete skeletons of archaeocete\r\nwhales from upper Ypresian through Priabonian strata deposited in eastern Tethys and now exposed\r\nspectacularly in the Sulaiman Range of central Pakistan. New field and laboratory research proposed\r\nhere includes three successive annual field expeditions to Pakistan, with two objectives:\r\n1. Recovery and study of articulated skeletons of primitive archaeocetes from 48-50 million-yearold\r\nstrata of the marginal-marine low-sea-stand Baska Formation of central Pakistan. The\r\nhypothesis to be tested is that whales of Pakicetus-grade were terrestrial. Whether the hypothesis\r\nis corroborated or not, good skeletal remains from this interval will greatly enhance our\r\nunderstanding of the cetacean transition from land to sea.\r\n2. Recovery and study of articulated skeletons of protocetid-to-basilosaurid archaeocetes from 38-\r\n45 million-year-old strata of the shallow marine upper Domanda, Pir Koh, and lower Drazinda\r\nformations of central Pakistan. The hypothesis to be tested is that advanced protocetids like\r\nGeorgiacetus were fully aquatic and lacked connection of the pelvic girdle to the vertebral\r\ncolumn, precluding support of their weight on land. Whether the hypothesis is corroborated or\r\nnot, good skeletal remains from this interval will greatly enhance our understanding of the\r\ntransition from foot-powered swimming like that of primitive protocetids to tail-power swimming\r\nlike that of basilosaurids and modern whales.\r\nField methods to be employed are standard GPS/GIS-enhanced methods, preparation and replication of\r\nfossils will take place in a state-of-the-art preparation facility at the University of Michigan, and analysis\r\nwill involve extensive quantitative description and functional interpretation in comparison with living\r\nand extinct semiaquatic mammals.\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research is recovery of tangible evidence of new morphologically\r\nand temporally intermediate stages of early whale evolution that enable assessment of many aspects of\r\nadaptation to life in water. Such new evidence is essential for advancing knowledge of early whale\r\nevolution and for enhancing our understanding of macroevolution across adaptive zones (in this case in\r\nthe transition from land to sea).\r\nBroader impacts of this project include enhancement of infrastructure for research and education\r\nthrough discovery of new skeletons representing stages of whale evolution that are presently poorly\r\nknown. The project will provide international research experience for American and foreign nationals.\r\nThe greatest impact may be enhanced public understanding of evolution through better geological and\r\npaleontological evidence for one of the principal evolutionary transitions of wide interest. Whale\r\nskeletons collected by previous expeditions are now exhibited in museums, illustrated in textbooks, and\r\ndiscussed in classrooms all over the world.",
