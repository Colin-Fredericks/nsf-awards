 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title:\r\nCollaborative Research: CSR---AES: A Framework for Optimizing Scientific Applications\r\n\r\nThe Design Optimizer for Scientific Applications (DOSA) framework\r\nallows the programmer or compiler writer to explore alternative\r\ndesigns and optimize for speed (or power) at design-time and use its\r\nrun-time optimizer as an automatic application composition system\r\n(ACS) that constructs an efficient application that dynamically adapts\r\nto changes in the underlying execution environment based on the kernel\r\nmodel, architecture, system features, available resources, and\r\nperformance feedback.  DOSA allows design-time exploration and\r\nautomatic run-time optimizations using continuous performance\r\noptimizations (CPO) so that application programmers and compiler\r\nwriters are relieved from the challenging task of optimizing the\r\ncomputation in order to achieve high performance.  As an illustration\r\nof the DOSA framework, one complex, full application is optimized for\r\nIBM Cell.  The innovative performance optimization techniques for the\r\nmemory hierarchy use new techniques for reducing I/O complexity, data\r\nlayout, data remapping, and in-memory processing, and are supported by\r\nDOSA, the semi-automatic design framework and dynamic run-time\r\nsystem. This framework allows rapid, high-level performance estimation\r\nand detailed low-level simulation by incorporating high-level\r\nperformance models into the model-integrated computing framework.  The\r\nrun-time system dynamically improves application performance using the\r\ncomponent library, the models, and the run-time optimizer.  The\r\napplication studies are chosen for their broad impact to traditional\r\nand emerging scientific areas such as bioinformatics, computational\r\nbiology, and medical applications, as well as for national security.\r\nThe project especially encourages the participation by women,\r\nminorities, and underrepresented groups.",
