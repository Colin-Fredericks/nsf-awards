 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three-year project to conduct an observation and data analysis effort centered on the incoherent scatter radar and optical facilities at the Arecibo Observatory.  The scientific focus of the proposed study is gravity waves in the thermosphere over Arecibo, especially questions related to their detailed characteristics and origin.  A special radar technique based on Photo-Electron Enhanced Plasma Waves (PEPW) as well as advanced analysis techniques developed by the proposing team will be utilized.  These provide electron density measurements of unprecedented accuracy and allow for the identification of gravity waves in the radar observations at all times, day and night.  In addition to collaboration with the radar staff at Arecibo, the proposal involves an extensive collaboration providing auxiliary data from imagers, lidars, and other instruments as well as widespread expertise on interpretation of these observations.  Undergraduate and graduate student research opportunities will be provided as part of this proposal as well as other public outreach and educational activities at the Arecibo Observatory.",
