The forefront of the research into the fundamentals and applications of laser-matter interactions will be identified and current research needs and shortcoming will become more apparent.  The conference will feature 16-18 invited lectures given by established leaders in the field and bright young researchers, as well as approximately 140-170 contributed oral and poster presentations.  The traditionally broad representation of researchers from around the globe will be maintained as the ICPEPA makes its debut in the United States.  Approximately half of the delegates to the conference are expected to be international participants.\r\nThe NSF funding of travel grants to US students and young researchers will enable their participation in a top-level research conference, and provide them with training opportunities in a scientific area of high current interest.  The support for senior participants will help to attract well-established leaders in the field and to maintain a high scientific level of the conference.  Broad international participation of young and established researchers from different countries will be equally beneficial for the US and foreign researchers, facilitating exchange of ideas, providing opportunities to establish collaborations, attracting best international researchers and students to the US, and exposing the US students and young researchers to international opportunities.\r\nConference web site:  http://www.seas.virginia.edu/academic/icpepa5/\r\n",
