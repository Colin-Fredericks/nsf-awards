McLeod, University of Colorado at Boulder\r\n\r\nThis new architecture requires an equally novel integration platform for hybrid electro-optic systems.   The proposed platform can be thought of as \"optical wire-bonding\" in which arbitrary discrete RF or optical components are interconnected in 3D to form complex, dense circuits.  This process is made possible by advanced photopolymers that can simultaneously encapsulate the individual hybrid subcomponents and can be photo-patterned in 3D to develop micron-scale gradient index features.   These index features in the form of optical waveguides are aligned to the encapsulated hybrids by a custom 3D lithography system, avoiding all active alignment.   \r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis proposal presents a revolutionary integration technology for RF/optical components in the context of a hybrid wireless/optical communication system. The architecture supports multi-channel, mobile GHz bandwidth without the limitations of traditional spread-spectrum codes or adaptive beam-steered antenna arrays. The cornerstone of the communication architecture is a smart electro-optic node (SEON) that adaptively tracks multiple broadband mobile transmitters.  Reception is performed with a small-aperture adaptive array automatically listening on as many channels as it has antenna elements; a scaling which is significantly better than current adaptive beam-forming systems.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe proposed hybrid circuits are fabricated on a single, inexpensive lithography station that, similar to rapid-prototyping processes, can fabricate complex single parts with no costly masks using only low-cost monomer.   This enables both large economic impact in small production volumes and large-scale undergraduate educational use. The PI's will extend this educational impact via a new graduate course, ECEN 5004, Fundamentals and technology for RF-optical communication systems\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project investigated a signal processing method for radio-frequency signals and an fabrication platform that could create such systems in compact circuits.  An unexpected discovery during this program was a new method to create very small features with photolithography, the primary fabrication technique for semiconductor electronics.  Each is described briefly below. \n\n \n\nThe blind source separation scenario occurs in many data analysis and signal processing applications. Sensors simultaneously receive signals from multiple sources and one must unscramble the sources with no a priori information about the signals or how they are mixed together. Although BSS has telecommunications applications, all experimental solutions to date have been limited to audio bandwidths. In this program we shoed the experimental realization of an optical system which performs real-time BSS on signals with bandwidths up to 10 MHz &ndash; two orders of magnitude higher than previously published.  We believe signal separation on signal bandwidths of 1 GHz is achievable with our optoelectronic feedback loop which allows real-time BSS on high bandwidth, radio frequency signals.\n\n \n\nIn comparison to microelectronics, these sorts of optoelectronic systems are significantly more difficult to field in high volumes due to the lack of a fabrication platform that can automatically and reliably interconnect dissimilar materials with the required submicron tolerances.  We developed a multi-functional polymeric material and automated lithography tool which implements an \"optical wire bonder\" that connects heterogeneous subcomponents with single-mode 3D-routed tapered waveguides.    The one-photon polymerization response is nonlinearly localized by a saturable inhibitor to achieve the resolution of two-photon polymers with orders-of-magnitude less power.   The direct-write lithography tool uses microscopes to accommodate the position tolerances of subcomponents encapsulated in this material, avoiding active alignment.  We demonstrated analog index change up to dela-n=0.01 to fabricate sub-diffraction single-mode waveguides with 0.13 dB/cm excess propagation loss and symmetrical tapers up to 1:2.5 using 1.5 microwatts of continuous write power.  These waveguides are connected to fiber in several geometries with no detectable misalignment loss. \n\n \n\nThe photolithographic method used to create these waveguides is limited in resolution, like all such techniques including those used to create electronic circuits.  This limit is imposed by the physics of optical diffraction.  Controlling and reducing the developed region initiated by photo-exposure is one of the fundamental goals of optical lithography.  Here, we demonstrated a two-color irradiation scheme whereby initiating species are generated by single-photon absorption at one wavelength while inhibiting species are generated by single-photon absorption at a second, independent wavelength.  Co-irradiation at the second wavelength thus reduces the polymerization rate, delaying gelation of the material and facilitating enhanced spatial control over the polymerization.  Appropriate overlapping of the two beams produces structures with feature sizes and monomer conversions otherwise unobtainable using single- or two-photon absorption photopolymerization.  Additionally, the generated inhibiting species rapidly recombine when irradiation with the second wavelength ceases, allowing for fast sequential exposures not limited by memory effects in the material and thus enabling fabrication of complex two- or three-dimensional structures.\n\n \nIn addition to these technical results, the program funds have been leveraged to support a large number of graduate and undergraduate students, particularly women and under-represented minorities.  Specifically:\n1.      Eight graduate students have received partial support.  Six of these eight were women.\n2.      Two of these women including one African-American have received their Ph..."
