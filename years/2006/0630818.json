These  problems are related,\r\nbut not limited, to the study of the Carleson operator \r\nand the bilinear Hilbert transform. Recently a significant\r\nbreakthrough on the bilinear Hilbert transform was made \r\nby the inspiring work of Lacey and Thiele. It turns out \r\nthat the time-frequency analysis is a powerful tool to \r\nsolve problems related to the study of multilinear \r\noperators. Moreover, although this is still under \r\ninvestigation,  the analysis of these problems gives us \r\nhopes to solve other important and difficult problems in \r\nthe field, such as the Hilbert transform along vector fields, \r\nthe Kakeya problem, and Carleson's maximal operator of \r\nthe partial sums of Fourier series in two dimensions. \r\nIt will also be very interesting to see how \r\nto use this delicate  analysis to solve some problems in \r\nother fields such as partial differential  equations, \r\nnumber theory, etc.  Actually, multilinear operators \r\nhave  been used in the study of partial differential \r\nequations, since they naturally appear in series expansions \r\nof solutions of many equations.  \r\n\r\nHarmonic analysis is  not only an area of theoretical \r\nmathematics, but also an applicable area lying at the\r\nheart of the intersection of fields as diverse as optics, \r\nsignal processing, meteorology, and music. The main them\r\nin Harmonic analysis is about disassembling and assembling\r\ncomplicated objects into simpler well-understood pieces, \r\nby analogy to decomposition of intricate musical pieces \r\ninto arrangements of a few basic notes. In signal processing,\r\nharmonic analysis is used  to detect irregularities of \r\nsignals and images. The Fouriertransform is a very  useful \r\ntool to locate these irregularities. The appearance of a \r\nnonsmooth  symbol inthe study of multiplier problems is \r\nanalogous to  physical phenomena where the frequencies of \r\nsignals are altered by an abrupt operation, such as  the \r\ninterruption of radio communication or television \r\ntransmission by meteorological phenomena. Such a sudden \r\nand unexpected operation  causes the loss of information. \r\nTo avoid the loss of information or to retrieve the \r\noriginal data is the main topic of the theoretical research \r\nproposed here.  \r\n",
