It is also planned to conduct some laboratory experiments to test the predictions of these theories and develop efficient numerical methods for simulations of the models. The hope is that this work will help understand the efficiency of different types of compensation schemes for parties in a contract and for society as a whole. \r\n\r\nThis project will study models of optimal contracting using stochastic optimization with decisions made dynamically in time using forward backward stochastic differential equations. The analysis will include high-dimensional models which are needed when there are more than two contracting parties involved. It is proposed to develop efficient numerical schemes for computing solutions of these problems.\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
