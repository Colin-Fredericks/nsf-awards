 "awd_abstract_narration": "JTEC SOLAR POWERED CELL TOWER GENERATOR\r\n\r\nThis project will attempt to resolve the key technical issues and uncertainties regarding a\r\nbreakthrough concept for low-cost high-efficiency solar power. The proposed approach is based\r\non a conceptual system for providing independent power for cell towers that will allow them to\r\nfunction even after emergencies like hurricane Katrina. The solar engine is based on the Johnson\r\nThermoElectrochemical Converter (JTEC) concept for converting heat to electricity invented by\r\n(Lonnie) Johnson, who will be available to assist Tuskegee University in carrying out this work.\r\nExcept for the working fluid, JTEC is an all solid state engine that does not have mechanical\r\nmoving parts. Different from conventional solid state thermoelectric devices, it does not have\r\ninherent parasitic heat loss paths. JTEC uses Membrane Electrode Assemblies (MEA) similar to\r\nthose used in fuel cells; however, it does not require oxygen or a special fuel, only heat. The\r\navailability of a range of proton conductive membrane materials that operate from room\r\ntemperature up to and exceeding 1200oC suggests that JTEC could generate electricity from\r\npractically any heat source, from very small, just a few degrees, to very large temperature\r\ndifferences. JTEC approximates the Ericsson thermodynamic cycle which is Carnot equivalent.\r\nResearch on this technology offers the potential for achieving solar power efficiency of 50% in\r\nthe short-term and 80% in the long-term, far beyond what is expected from photovoltaics both in\r\nefficiency and in cost.\r\n\r\n(1) Intellectual merit of the proposed activity\r\nJTEC is a fundamentally new solid state engine concept. Critical research is needed to enable a\r\ncredible analysis of its potential. Research is needed into the properties of proton conductive\r\nmaterials needed to make a working system. The materials are similar those being studied in\r\nfuel cell research, but new material properties must be investigated in order to optimize the\r\nchoices for this application. Research is needed to model, simulate and optimize an integrated\r\nsystems design for cost-effective recharge power for cell towers.\r\n\r\n(2) Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity:\r\nCell towers running out of battery power were a crucial problem in the wake of Katrina and\r\nresulted unnecessary deaths and destruction. This project, with follow-on research, could\r\nprovide un-interruptible, cost effective power for communications in areas threatened by\r\nhurricanes and other disasters that is not limited by battery life. The proposed engine technology\r\nwill have major impacts on the international energy economy particularly with respect to the\r\nneed for economical, green, renewable energy. This research is consistent with NSF goals for\r\nminority education and outreach. Tuskegee University is a HBCU institution and Johnson\r\nResearch is a minority owned small business.",
