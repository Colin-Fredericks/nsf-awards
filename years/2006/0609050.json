 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF05-610, category NIRT.  The objective of the research is to develop and study solution-based methods for dispersion, sorting, and placement of carbon nanotubes.  The approach is based on the formation of hybrids of carbon nanotubes with DNA that have proven to be effective dispersants, have the ability to separate nanotubes, and result in a dispersion of charged colloidal particles that allow the development of placement techniques.  The overall goals are to develop the ability to:\r\n1)\tPlace carbon nanotubes at a given location on a substrate with prescribed density and orientation. \r\n2)\tSort a heterogeneous sample of carbon nanotubes into all its constituent types.\r\n3)\tDesign experimental conditions for controlled placement and separation.\r\n4)\tPredict structure of carbon nanotube/DNA hybrids.\r\n\r\nBecause of their superlative electrical and mechanical properties, carbon nanotubes have great potential for use in applications as varied as strengthening elements in composites, semiconducting channels in nanoelectronics, and as biosensors.  Perhaps the biggest obstacle in the way of realizing this potential is the difficulty in processing them, especially via a solution route.  Critical problems are effective dispersion, sorting according to length, diameter, and electronic character, and controlled placement on a substrate.  If effective ways are found to process carbon nanotubes, it will result in the development of new materials and devices with significant economic and health benefits.  Study of the underlying phenomena required for successful work on this problem will require us to tackle several fundamental problems in nanoscale science and engineering.   Graduate and undergraduate students participating in the program will be educated in highly interdisciplinary research including biological sciences, chemical engineering, mechanics, physics, and materials science.\r\n",

Kiely*\n\n18 October 2011\n\n* Lehigh University\n\n# CR&amp;D, The DuPont Company, currently at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\n+ Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nSingle Wall Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs) form a family of carbon-based materials that have a number of unique properties such as high stiffness, strength, electrical conductivity, and robust optical fluorescence.  For this reason, they have been researched and developed intensively over the last two decades.  Potential applications range from their use in electronics as semiconducting channels to biomedical applications, for example, use as imaging, sensing, and drug delivery agents.  However, SWCNTs have been difficult to handle because of their small size (only 1-2 nm in diameter), slender aspect (lengths hundreds of times longer than diameter), and particularly because their chemical synthesis results in a mixture of species (e.g., different diameters).  It is imperative that these species be sorted out into pure fractions, but this task has been a difficult one.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nBased on our discovery that DNA forms stable hybrids with SWCNTs, rendering them dispersible in aqueous medium, we have been able to use sorting techniques originally developed for biological molecules to separate SWCNTs into nearly pure fractions.   A fundamental aspect of our work is the finding that certain DNA sequences \"recognize\" and bind strongly to specific SWCNT species.  This finding helps to understand how nanomaterials interact with biological molecules, which informs us on the molecular basis of their potential toxicity.  This finding has also helped in the development of SWCNTs as biomedical imaging, sensing, and drug delivery agents.  This central aspect of our work has been supported by a number of investigations to quantify and understand the interaction between DNA and SWCNTs, and by several theoretical and modeling studies to establish the structure, binding, and thermodynamics of this system. \n\n \n\nBroader Impact\n\nOur project has supported the training of a number of graduate students and a post-doctoral associate.  Through their work in this highly interdisciplinary group, they have been trained to conduct cutting-edge research, to generate new knowledge, and to create new technologies.  Our work has provided pure SWCNT samples for a number of fundamental studies and for the demonstration of devices based on purified samples.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/19/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anand Jagota"
