Duke\r\n\r\nThis REU award for a Site supports 10 undergraduate students each year for three years in a 10-week summer research experience at Auburn University.  The research projects will be interdisciplinary in nature and have a strong focus on micro and nano-material science and technology.  Specific topics will include materials synthesis and characterization, micro/nano particle formation processes, nanomechanics of thin films, carbon-nanotubes, inorganic nano-rods, MEMS, nanoparticulate systems and micro films for drug delivery, nanofibers yarns and fabrics, nanoparticle thin films, and others.\r\n\r\nIn addition to performing research mentored by faculty mentors, graduate student mentors and undergraduate student mentors, the participants will be involved in a number of weekly seminars and workshops that allow cross cultivation of the individual experience as well as address professional development (e.g., research methods, transferring to a bachelor degree program, steps in the graduate school application process, technical writing, presentation skills, professional etiquette training, ethics in science and engineering, and patents and commercialization, etc.). \r\n\r\nThe REU Site program will contribute to the development of a diverse group of undergraduate participants from four-year institutions and community colleges that have a limited opportunity to engage in research activities. This REU site has the potential to increase the number of women and underrepresented minorities in research, encourage community college students and siblings to pursue bachelor degrees in science and technology areas, and encourage students and siblings at undergraduate institutions to pursue graduate degrees.  \r\n",
