 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates site at Ursinus College (Collegeville, PA) offers paid summer research opportunities in environmental science in the areas of microbiology, climate change, ecology of mammals, and watershed management.  Interested students, particularly minority students and students with limited research opportunities at their home institutions, are invited to apply.  All students receive a stipend, housing, research supply money, and funds to travel to and from the lab.  REU students will become part of a thriving multidisciplinary summer research community.  The 10-week program begins in mid-May with a mini-course that gives all students an introduction to environmental science including research methods and ethics.  Students design and carry out research projects tailored to add to existing knowledge in environmental science and to prepare them for careers in this discipline.  Students work closely with a professor and will join Ursinus College's summer undergraduate research community.  The community is bound together by lunch seminars, celebration of student achievement through the end-of-the summer research symposium, and recreational activities. Students write a scientific research paper, and present their research at an on-campus symposium.   Students acquire skills that should help them enter research careers or graduate school.  Ursinus College is located in southeastern Pennsylvania, 30 miles from Philadelphia.  Summer research students have the opportunity to visit the Liberty Bell, Valley Forge National Park and other educational attractions.  More information are available at http://academic.ursinus.edu/reu, or by contacting Dr. Kate Goddard at 610-489-4111 x2327 or kgoddard-doms@ursinus.edu.",
