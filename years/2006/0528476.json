Gardella Jr. is a professor of Chemistry and Biomaterials at the State University of New York at Buffalo (SUNY-Buffalo) and also serves as the Associate Dean for External Affairs in the SUNY-Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences. Gardella has directed over 60 undergraduates in traditional junior/senior research experiences, as well as with a number of graduate students -- he has demonstrated strong mentoring to a substantial number of students. His mentoring activity extends into the support of junior faculty and to broadening institutional support for and engagement in mentoring. Gardella's research interests are focused in environmental science, which he links to work with urban (and rural) communities affected by toxic sites (\"brownfields\").\r\n\r\nGardella's work with graduate students has included his participation in the Sloan Foundation initiative on Professional Science Masters' degrees, an effort that ties academic efforts with industry in collaborations that address workforce needs. He has also worked with the NSF ADAVANCE program to further address his efforts in improving the opportunities for women in STEM.\r\n\r\nAs part of his community outreach activity, Gardella has developed linkages with Native Americans/American Indians to improve the access to STEM education and careers. A partnership with the Seneca Nation works to support identification and recruitment of high-schools students, and activities with the Buffalo PS Native American Magnet School (K-8) include tutoring, science demonstrations, and STEM curriculum support.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
