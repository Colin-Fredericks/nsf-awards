 "awd_abstract_narration": "The photonuclear physics group at James Madison University is engaged in a\r\nprogram of Compton scattering and meson production located at the Laser\r\nElectron Gamma Source (LEGS) at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS)\r\nat Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), and the High Intensity Gamma Source\r\n(HIGS) facility at the Duke Free Electron Laser Laboratory (DFELL)\r\nlaboratory at Duke University (DU). The work at both facilities is focused\r\non polarized photon beams and targets. At LEGS, the experiments will use a\r\npolarized HD target especially constructed for this program. Polarized\r\ntargets are being developed for the program at the HIGS facility at the\r\nUniversity of Virginia (UVA), DU and JMU. These include several polarized\r\ntargets, including the polarizable scintillator target using material\r\nfabricated at JMU.\r\n\r\nThe LEGS effort focuses on the distillation of high purity HD for target\r\nproduction and the participation in the final phase of data collection. The\r\nHIGS effort is concentrated on the fabrication of polarizable scintillator\r\ntargets and the construction of a detector assembly and testing laboratory.\r\nThis lab will be equiped using JMU money and will permit NaI detector\r\nassembly and testing for HIGS. All the students are involved in distillery\r\noperation. This provides them with an opportunity that is unique at JMU.\r\nThis is the only cryogenic laboratory of any kind on campus. In addition,\r\nthis distillery is unique in the world making this facility on the JMU\r\ncampus a critical component for the LEGS program and an ideal learning\r\nsituation for our students. The HIGS NaI detector testing lab will serve as\r\na starting point for the development of a nuclear physics lab course to\r\ncomplement the existing lecture introduced by the PI and will allow\r\nextension of a new department outreach program to include nuclear physics.\r\nThe preparation of polarizable target materials at JMU is generating a\r\ncloser connection with the material science group here. This builds\r\nconnections among the students in different research groups and connections\r\namong the faculty.\r\n",
