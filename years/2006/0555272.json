 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years there has seen a very fruitful exchange between ideas in the theory of kinetic \r\nequations and the theory of weak solutions for hyperbolic systems. At the core of this \r\nexchange lies the issue of deriving continuum theories from microscopic models of kinetic \r\ntheory of gases or statistical physics. In this context transport properties play a crucial \r\nrole whether in a framework of kinetic equations, or in a context of nonlinear transport \r\nas it appears with differential constraints in the context of polyconvex elastodynamics or \r\nnonlinear models for Maxwell?s equations. This proposal has the objectives to perform \r\nanalytical and modeling work on the topics: (i) transport and oscillations in systems of two \r\nconservation laws, (ii) collisional kinetic models and their hydrodynamic limits, (iii) effect \r\nof differential constraints on the equations of polyconvex elastodynamics, (iv) mathematical \r\naspects of kinetic theory of dilute polymers, and (v) development of kinetic techniques for \r\nhomogenization problems. \r\n\r\nHyperbolic systems of conservation laws express the basic laws of continuum physics and \r\nas such are central in modeling in the sciences. Kinetic modeling is becoming all the more \r\npronounced, as microscopic modeling and the associated derivation of mesoscopic equations \r\nis commonplace in today?s engineering applications. Understanding of homogenization issues \r\nand the couplings in problems where multiple scales interact are necessary ingredients for the \r\ndesign of e \r\ncient computational algorithms that proceed without resolving all microscopic \r\ninformation of the problem. The mathematical analysis of issues related to the passage \r\nfrom small to coarser scales has significant implications on the design of high-performance \r\ncomputing algorithms, particularly when treating problems where scale interactions occur. \r\nSuch problems are at the center of modern material science with several applications in \r\nchemical and materials engineering. \r\n",
