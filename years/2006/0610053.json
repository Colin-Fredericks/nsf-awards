 "awd_abstract_narration": "To address a lack of informal science education opportunities and to increase community capacity to support STEM education for their children, Washington State University's Yakima Valley/Tri Cities MESA program, the Pacific Science Center, and KDNA Educational Radio have developed a set of informal science initiatives that offer complementary learning opportunities for rural Latino families.  The goal of this four-year program is to create a sustainable informal science infrastructure in southeastern Washington State to serve families, increase parental awareness, support and involvement in science education and ultimately increase the numbers of rural Latino youth pursuing STEM-related under graduate studies.  This program is presented in English and Spanish languages in all of its interconnected deliverables. \r\n-Two mobile exhibits, beginning with one focused on agricultural and environmental science developed by The Pacific Science (PCS) Center. \r\n-Curriculum and training in agriculture, life sciences and facilitating learning.\r\n-Curriculum and training for community members to provide support to parents in encouraging the academic aspirations of their children developed by PSC and MESA.\r\n-420 Youth and parents from the MESA program trained to interpret exhibits and run workshops, community festivals, family science workshops and Saturday programs throughout the community. \r\n- Four annual community festivals, quarterly Family Saturday events, and Family Science Workshops reaching 20,000 people over the four-year project.\r\n-Take home activities, science assemblies, a website and CDs with music and science programming for community events.\r\n-A large media initiative including monthly one hour call-in radio programs featuring science experts, teachers, professionals, students and parents, 60-second messages promoting science concepts and resources and a publicity campaign in print, radio and TV to promote community festivals. These venues reach 12,500-25,000 people each.\r\n-A program manual that includes training, curriculum and collaborative strategies used by the project team.\r\n\r\nOverall Accesso la Ciencia connects parents and children through fun community activities to Pasco School District's current LASER science education reform effort.  This project complements the school districts effort by providing a strong community support initiative in informal science education.  Each activity done in the community combines topics of interest to rural Latinos (agriculture for instance) to concepts being taught in the schools, while also providing tools and support to parents that increases their awareness of opportunities for their children in STEM education. \r\n",
