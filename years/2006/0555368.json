 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nHigh energy physics and particle astrophysics are very dynamical fields, with new data revealing evidence of physics beyond the standard model through neutrino oscillations, dark matter and dark energy. This award supports research aimed at advancing the theoretical understanding of such aspects of physics beyond the standard model and at maximizing the amount of information that can be obtained from the experimental data by considering new analysis frameworks and exploring new connections between different phenomena. As part of this effort, the PI plans to work on optimizing the next generation of neutrino experiments and developing a better framework for understanding the experimental data and its implications for theoretical models. Another topic of research will be the study of models connecting neutrinos and dark matter/dark energy, with predictions for novel, interesting phenomena in both neutrino astrophysics and cosmology. The exploration of the possible connections between neutrinos and dark matter/energy candidates is now only beginning and the scenario discussed here provides a natural framework for the realization of such a connection.\r\n\r\nHigh energy physics, astrophysics and cosmology and the questions they are trying to address are very exciting and capture the interest of a larger public, providing excellent outreach opportunities. The PI will integrate her research into Penn State University educational outreach programs aimed at high school students and teachers. These include an annual series of summer Science Workshops for Educators aimed at secondary school teachers.\r\n\r\nUsing the existing infrastructure, the PI will add a new neutrino Physics/astrophysics workshop. In addition, the PI participates in the Adopt a Scientist program, aimed at exposing high school physics students to the opportunities available through science and enticing more young people to consider the sciences as a potential career choice.\r\n\r\n",
