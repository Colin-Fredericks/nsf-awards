 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shvydkoy\r\n0604050\r\n\r\n     Instability of fluid motion is the main subject of this\r\nproposal. Although it was a classical and rather experimental\r\nbranch of the hydrodynamics in the early days, it now stands as\r\nan actively developing area of modern analytical fluid dynamics,\r\nand it provides many challenging problems to mathematicians. The\r\nmotion of an ideal incompressible fluid is governed by the Euler\r\nequation. Because of the particular structure of the nonlinearity\r\npresent in the equation it appears to be notoriously difficult to\r\nanswer even the most basic questions in a rigorous mathematical\r\nway. One of these questions is to justify the Lyapunov\r\nlinearization method for stationary fluid flows. In particular,\r\nif the Euler equation linearized about a given equilibrium has\r\nunstable spectrum, does this imply that the equilibrium is\r\nunstable in the nonlinear sense, say, in the basic energy norm?\r\nThe investigator studies this and other questions related to\r\ninstability and spectra. These include: the question of finding\r\nunstable shortwave perturbations for general fluid flows;\r\nanalysis of the spectrum for the Euler equations and the\r\nrelationship with the spectrum of weakly viscous flows in the\r\nlimit of vanishing viscosity. The investigator examines these\r\nproblems using modern WKB-type asymptotic analysis for the Euler\r\nequations, pseudo-differential calculus, as well as newly\r\ndeveloped connections between the cocycle theory and fluid\r\ndynamics.\r\n\r\n     The questions addressed in this particular project are\r\nclosely related to the fundamental problems of environmental\r\nscience such as weather prediction, climate change, and oceanic\r\nmotion. Instability of large fluid masses is inherent in the\r\nnature of those processes, while large scale instabilities often\r\ngrow out of small scales. The investigator presents mechanisms\r\nfor such small scale instabilities and gives them a precise\r\nmathematical description. Understanding instabilities in fluid\r\nflows is important for a broad range of questions in atmospheric\r\nscience and geophysics.",
