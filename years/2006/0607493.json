Specifically, such observations yield trace constituent detections, Doppler wind determinations, and long-term characterizations of atmospheric variability that remain beyond the scope of planetary spacecraft missions. Active ground-based observation programs for Mars and Venus are limited in number, yet obtain disproportionate atmospheric results due to the emphasis of NASA missions on the surface environments of these planets. For example, the last NASA mission to Venus with a substantial atmospheric component was the Pioneer Venus orbiter launched in 1978. Similarly, the first NASA mission to Mars with a dedicated atmospheric sounder is scheduled to achieve orbit in 2006. As a result, the key discovery of large orbital variations in global temperatures, ice and dust aerosol loading, and photochemistry and the role these coupled variations play in the current and (possibly) past climate of Mars was revealed by earth-based millimeter spectroscopy and imaging rather than Mars spacecraft observations. The key Venus atmospheric discoveries of near-IR windows through its massive lower atmosphere all originated from earth-based observations over a long-standing hiatus in dedicated Venus NASA mission activity. \r\n\r\nWith this award, Dr. Clancy will carry out spectroscopic analyses of an accumulated body of sensitive measurements uniquely appropriate to the investigation of the dynamically and chemically time variable middle atmosphere (mesosphere) above the sulfuric acid cloud layers of Venus, and to the radiative dynamical state of the poorly explored mesosphere of the Mars atmosphere. New observations will be obtained with the James Clark Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii over the course of the grant period and their analysis will be integrated into the extensive existing data set.\r\n\r\nThe broader context of comparative planetology will be disseminated to the public and educational community through Dr. Clancys participation in the Mars Quest and Alien Earths museum exhibits at the Space Science Institute (SSI). SSI provides a unique environment of direct in-house collaborations between active space science researchers and multi-disciplined Education and Public Outreach (EPO) practitioners\r\n***\r\n",
