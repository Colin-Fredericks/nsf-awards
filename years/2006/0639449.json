 "awd_abstract_narration": "The organizing theme of this project are the two food-web modes of the planktonic community of the Coastal Gulf of Alaska (CGoA): small cell-dominated (prokaryotes, pico- and nanoflagellates) or large cell-dominated (primarily chain diatoms); that these modes are dictated by physical and biological conditions, both bottom-up and top-down; and that each mode has different consequences for the production of GLOBEC target organisms, with one system primarily supporting large copepods and the other system primarily supporting the microbial food web and the mucous-net feeding zooplankton (larvaceans and pteropods) that are prime prey for juvenile salmon. The interdisciplinary team will synthesize the physical, chemical, and biological data collected by GLOBEC NEP to address this central conceptual model of the linkages between environmental forcing (including climate change) and ecosystem state.\r\n\r\nThe research plan is organized into three interacting sectors of synthesis: (1) Describe the planktonic food web in the CGoA study region. (2) Provide an integrated view of conditions in the CGoA during each of the field years (1998-2004), and place these conditions in a multi-decadal climate context using longer-term environmental data sets. (3) Combine the environmental description for each year with food web structural/ and functional relationships to: (a) describe interannual variations in primary and secondary production; (b) investigate probable mechanisms driving these variations; and (c) determine the consequences for target organisms: Neocalanus spp., euphausiids and juvenile pink salmon. Box, statistical and 1-D ecosystem models will be employed to address a range of these questions about climate-food web linkages.\r\n",
