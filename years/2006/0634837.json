 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks a very modest amount of travel funds to support US faculty to participate in the 2006\r\nand 2008 workshops. This amount is set to approximately offset the extra travel costs associated with European rather than domestic travel.\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe development of a computer graphics curriculum and the necessary courses involves understanding the recent and current research and development of computer graphics techniques and technologies, and integrating this research and development work into undergraduate and masters-level education. We will\r\ninvolve computer graphics faculty who are actively involved in both research and teaching as we create the curriculum, and they will create courses based on their research and development experience. In this way we will move forward the entire computer graphics field and in particular will help prepare students for research work in the field.\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe computer graphics curriculum and courses that will be developed through this project will lead to a much broader kind of computer graphics studies in the US. These studies will involve integrating current or recent research work into pre-research computer graphics courses and will result in a group of computer science professionals who are much better educated in computer graphics, improving the\r\ngraphics capability of the computing profession.",
