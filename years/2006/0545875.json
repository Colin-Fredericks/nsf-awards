 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposal focuses on the problem of topical link analysis with a goal to improve the relevance of web search results. A web page (or author) is not equally authoritative on all topics.  However, traditional link analysis techniques consider only a single measure of authority, with little or no concern for the topic or community from which that authority is derived.  This research finds ways to determine the context of recognized authority, and to incorporate that context as topicality or community recognition into more accurate automated analyses of reputation.  This project further improves link analysis by distinguishing between popularity, quality, and authority.  By integrating such analysis into fundamental link analysis techniques, search result quality improvements are demonstrated using human relevance and quality judgments.  This contextual link analysis provides new opportunities to significantly improve measurements of authority and thus search engine result rankings (as well as topical rankings for other purposes), and to better understand the topical structure of interlinked document networks such as the Web and scholarly publications.  \r\n\r\nThe project additionally incorporates educational and outreach activities, including a program to stimulate undergraduate interest and experience in computer science research in area schools, while promoting interaction among nearby faculty. The project web page \r\n(http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/nsf/career-05.html) provides access to research results and additional information on project.\r\n",
