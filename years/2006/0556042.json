 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are two themes to this project. The first is the study of\r\nHochschild structures that arise naturally in algebraic geometry.\r\nHochschild homology and cohomology are essential invariants in both\r\nalgebra and geometry, and the PI proposes to study them from an\r\nalgebraic-geometric point of view. The second is the study of\r\nexplicit example of spaces which have the extra structure of {\\em\r\ngenus one fibration}. These spaces are ubiquitous in classical and\r\nmodern algebraic geometry, and the PI expects that by using the\r\ntechniques of derived categories new insights can be gained into their\r\ngeometry.There are three projects contained in the present proposal.\r\nThe first project is concerned with finding explicit formulas for the\r\nmultiplication in the Hochschild cohomology ring of orbifolds, with\r\napplications to the Ruan conjecture. The second aims at understanding\r\nthe abstract Mukai pairing on the Hochschild homology of smooth varieties,\r\nand its relationship to the Poincar\\'e pairing on differential forms.\r\nThis would provide a new perspective on the Riemann-Roch theorem.\r\nThe third project is a study of genus one fibrations with\r\nmulti-sections of small degree. It has applications to the study of\r\nstable singularities in string theory, as well as to the understanding\r\nof the Torelli problem for Calabi-Yau threefolds.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometry, which is the geometric study of solutions of\r\npolynomial equations, has seen in the last few years major\r\ndevelopments, especially in terms of its applications in other fields\r\nof science. Of particular importance are applications to modern\r\ntheoretical physics, in particular in string theory. The present\r\nproject will increase our general understanding of the geometry of\r\nsome of the spaces that are important in algebraic geometry and\r\nphysics.",
