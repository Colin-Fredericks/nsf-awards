The goal of this pilot study is to\r\nexplore the influence of science fiction in shaping the intellectual development of scientists and\r\nengineers, especially during their formative years. This project meets the requirements for a Small Grant\r\nfor Exploratory Research (SGER) because it constitutes preliminary work on untested and novel ideas.\r\nSpecifically, it proposes to explore the idea that science fiction influences the career choices and research\r\ntrajectories of scientists and engineers, a notion for which anecdotal support can be mobilized yet which\r\nhas never been substantiated through empirical research. This pilot study will serve as the foundation for\r\na larger proposal for an NSF Scholars Award to conduct follow-up research on the relationship between\r\ntechnoscience and science fiction.\r\nThis project emerges at the intersection of the fields of science and technology studies (STS) and\r\nlibrary and information science (LIS), and seeks to explore how exposure to science fiction influences the\r\ncareer choices and research trajectories of scientists and engineers. In so doing, it merges the theoretical\r\nstrand of the social shaping of technoscience from the STS literature with work on mass media in the life\r\nof the reader/listener/viewer/visitor/player from the field of LIS. The project is made possible by the\r\nhybrid expertise of the PI, whose Ph.D. is in STS and whose current faculty position is in LIS, and who\r\nhas previously conducted NSF-funded research projects on the ethical implications of values embedded in\r\ninformation technologies such as dissection simulations and computational models. This project will\r\nallow the PI to further his research agenda at the intersection of the fields of STS and LIS, and to conduct\r\nresearch that will make significant contributions to both fields.\r\nThe three primary objectives of this study are to develop a more robust understanding of the\r\nrelationship between technoscience and society, mass media, and science fiction. This study hypothesizes\r\nthat the career choices and research decisions of scientists and engineers are influenced by science fiction\r\nas well as other mass media and social factors as a whole.\r\nData collection includes ten semi-structured, open-ended interviews with scientists and engineers.\r\nInterview data will be analyzed using grounded theory such that research findings will be continuously\r\nintegrated to further refine the research design, leading to the construction of a theory that can provide a\r\npreliminary explanation how society, mass media, and science fiction influence scientists and engineers\r\nand which can be tested and refined through additional research. Results will be disseminated via\r\nacademic conferences and peer reviewed journals.\r\nIntellectual Merit: This study will contribute to the STS literature by exploring the social factors that\r\ninfluence the career decisions and research trajectories of scientists and engineers. The contribution to the\r\nLIS literature will be detailed exploration of the relationship between technoscience and mass media\r\nthrough an in-depth case study of mass media in the lives of scientists and engineers as\r\nreaders/listeners/viewers/visitors/players. Finally, this study will also contribute to the literature on the\r\nrelationship between technoscience and science fiction by exploring if and how science fiction might\r\ninfluence the career choices and research trajectories of scientists and engineers.\r\nBroader Impacts: This study also aims to produce broader impacts that focus on the recruitment and\r\nretention of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students. First, by improving\r\nunderstanding of how science fiction shapes the career choices of scientists and engineers, educators will\r\nbe able to determine when and how to use science fiction to promote student interest in STEM, potentially\r\nreinforcing and legitimating existing educational programs. In addition, this study may also be able to\r\nprovide insights into how science fiction can promote diversity among STEM students, through emphasis\r\non female and non-white authors and characters and feminist and multicultural themes. Finally, this study\r\nmay discover ways that science fiction can help students majoring in STEM to become more conscious of\r\nthe social and cultural dimensions of science and technology.\r\n\r\n",
