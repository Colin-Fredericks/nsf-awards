 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to CUNY Brooklyn College under the Direction of Dr. Ray Gavin to acquire a confocal laser scanning microscope for research and education in biological sciences.  The microscope will provide enhanced imaging capability for studies of cells and cell structure, in living and preserved specimens.  Research that will benefit include studies of organelles within single-celled protozoa, plant growth form as affected by bacteria, microtubule stability in yeast cells, and development of in mosquitoes.  The instrument will also be used in student research and coursework, where it is expected to have a significant impact on quality of training.  The majority of Brooklyn College science students are minorities or underrepresented groups in the sciences.    Classes in light microscopy, phase contrast microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy will utilize the instrument.  Graduate students at the masters and doctoral level will integrate the instrument into their thesis research.",
