 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes a comprehensive nanolithography and alignment system for integrated electronics manufacturing. The product driver for this application is the Molecular Transfer Lithography (MxL) template. It is a consumable, one-time-per-use item that forms patterns by bonding patterned resist layers onto a substrate surface, with subsequent dissolution of the template. MxL is a non-imprint, non-photolithography process that solves the defect propagation problem of contact printing, and is applied for large area, conformal printing at low costs and high throughput. The proposal seeks optimal replication of the MxL templates, and coordination with an advanced adaptive alignment system, to achieve unprecedented overlay and high resolution patterning for high-throughput next generation lithography of integrated circuits. MxL is a patent protected unique process using a dissolvable sacrificial polymer mask and offers a comprehensive high resolution printing solution that can be utilized scaled into very high volume electronics production.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is technologically superior to alternative approaches by combining low-cost processing with defect free conformal printing over large areas at high throughput rates. The proposed process and technological solution will significantly advance the capability to manufacture nanotechnological devices for wide range of applications including integrated circuits, CMOS sensors, displays, data storage, MEMS, as well as emerging areas in photonics, high brightness LED's, optoelectronics, life sciences, and nanotechnology.\r\n\r\n",
