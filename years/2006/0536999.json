 "awd_abstract_narration": "An-ad hoc committee, overseen by the Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public\r\nPolicy (COSEPUP) will produce a report guide to faculty, academic administrators and leaders,\r\nfunding organizations, and government officials to maximize the potential of women scientists\r\nand engineers and ensure the leadership of the nations science and engineering (S&E) research\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nMuch work has been done to assess the representation of women in academic faculty. However, few studies have adequately considered implicit and explicit barriers to career advancement and the intersectionality of race and gender when examining the representation of women among university faculty. What is needed is a synthesis of this data to produce a comprehensive interdisciplinary guide to effective policies and practices for recruiting, hiring, and retaining women faculty. The study committee will integrate the wealth of data available on gender issues across all fields of S&E, including data pertaining to institutional recruitment, retention, and promotion practices and policies. This study would address its findings and recommendations to each of the layers of faculty, administration, and funders who determine institutional culture and implement policies. The committee will recommend practical measures and policies to mitigate gender bias and other factors that limit career advancement for women scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nDiversity appears to be an important factor in creativity and productivity. In the corporate world, studies have shown that the companies with more women in leadership positions performed better financially. Women are an increasing proportion of those earning undergraduate and graduate degrees in S&E fields, however they have not been hired into academic faculty positions commensurate with this increasing representation.  The committee will focus on academe, but will examine other research sectors to determine effective practices and develop findings and recommendations for recruiting, hiring, promotion, and retention of women S&E researchers\r\n",
