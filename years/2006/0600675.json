The project includes manufacturing of fibers with surfaces modified by nanoparticles, manufacturing of composites reinforced with nanomodified fibers, experimental evaluation of interfacial fracture and friction, and development of multiscale models of stress transfer, fracture, and friction in these materials. The research will provide better fundamental understanding of complex interfacial phenomena in heterogeneous materials and foster progress in methods of design and engineering of interfaces at nano- and microscales. \r\n\r\nIf successful, this research can lead to improved lightweight composites with superior fracture toughness, fatigue durability, and impact resistance. Such composites will be usable in a variety of applications. The results will also be usable for other heterogeneous materials, such as polycrystalline materials and biological interfaces. Planned educational and outreach activities include support and research training of graduate and undergraduate students (the latter with support from NSF REU) and development of a new undergraduate/graduate course on nanocomposites.\r\n\r\n",
