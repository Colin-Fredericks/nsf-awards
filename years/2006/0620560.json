 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental function of the auditory system in humans is to process speech. Both \r\nspeech sounds and social vocalizations of other animals are complex in that they \r\nare comprised of many frequency elements that vary over time. When these sounds \r\nare first encoded by the cochlea in the inner ear, they are broken down into their \r\nindividual frequency elements and single neurons respond to individual \r\nfrequency elements. However, to enable perception of the whole sound, neurons in \r\nthe auditory system must recombine the individual frequency elements in the\r\nappropriate temporal order. In other words, individual neurons must integrate \r\nmultiple frequency elements over time. The first site in the ascending auditory \r\nsystem where individual neurons integrate across frequency elements in complex \r\nsounds is the inferior colliculus (IC). The objective of this research is to determine \r\nthe role of frequency and temporal integration in encoding complex sounds in the IC. \r\nIn this project, responses of individual neurons in the IC to spectrally and temporally \r\ncomplex sounds, including natural vocalizations, will be obtained. The project focuses \r\non characterizing neuronal responses that display nonlinear interactions to the\r\ncombination of two sounds with energy in different frequency bands. The project then \r\nexamines how these \"combination-sensitive\" neurons encode natural sounds by \r\npresenting natural mouse vocalizations. Neural responses elicited by the entire \r\nvocalization, individual frequency elements and combinations of elements with different \r\ntemporal relationships will be compared. The hypothesis tested is that neurons in the \r\nmouse IC show nonlinear frequency interactions to signals that contain biologically \r\nimportant frequency elements in the appropriate temporal order, and that these \r\ncombination-sensitive interactions are a mechanism for encoding natural\r\nvocalizations. The strength of this proposal is in utilizing naturally occurring, \r\nbiologically relevant vocalizations in an awake mouse model to study neural \r\nmechanisms underlying the processing of complex sounds. Because mouse \r\nvocalizations have similar structures to the vowels of human speech, and \r\nsimilarities exist between the perception of multi-harmonic communication calls \r\nin mice and humans, this project will be an important step towards identifying \r\nthe neural mechanisms of speech processing. The research activities in this \r\nproject have an impact beyond the scientific findings. Dr. Portfors has established \r\na diverse and committed record of educating students and the community. These \r\nactivities include engaging minority students through research opportunities, \r\nundergraduate students through integration of research and teaching activities, \r\nand members of the local community through teacher training workshops, \r\npublic lectures, and the local media. Dr. Portfors is regularly engaged in \r\nnumerous  activities outside the laboratory and classroom that have broad \r\nimpact on the community. In a typical year, she and her students give \r\n10-20 presentations to schools and community groups. This project will \r\ncontinue to foster interaction of undergraduate and graduate students in the \r\nlaboratory and provide outreach to the community through presentations on \r\nauditory neuroscience.",
