 "awd_abstract_narration": "A technical description of the project:\r\nHeavy (dense and viscous) oils are considered an alternative energy source\r\nbecause they constitute one of the largest reserves of\r\npreviously unexploited fossil fuels on earth.\r\nThe fraction of the original oils in\r\nplace that can be recovered by solution gas drive\r\ndecreases with increasing oil viscosity. For\r\nheavy oil reservoirs, the expected recovery factor\r\n(percentage of the oil in the reservoir that can be\r\nrecovered) by solution gas drive is typically lower than 5%.\r\nHowever, a number of heavy oil reservoirs under\r\nsolution gas drive show anomalous primary\r\nperformance: low production gas-oil ratios,\r\nhigh oil production rates, and high oil recovery.\r\nUltimate oil recovery can be as high as 20%\r\nin the primary performance of such heavy oil reservoirs.\r\nThe oil samples at the wellhead produced from these\r\nreservoirs are in the form of oil-continuous foam,\r\nwhich has the appearance of chocolate mousse\r\nand contains a certain volume fraction of gas.\r\nThe term \"foamy oil\" is often used to\r\ndescribe such oils. The flow behavior of\r\nfoamy oils is very complex, and remains controversial\r\nand poorly understood. This project is directed toward\r\nexperimental, theoretical, and numerical investigations\r\nof the flow behavior of foamy oils.\r\n\r\nA nontechnical description of the project:\r\nThe world needs enormous new crude oil reserves.\r\nDuring the next several decades,\r\nthere is not and there will not be an economical,\r\nabundant substitute for crude oil in the economies of industrial\r\ncountries, even with the price of a barrel of oil over $70.\r\nMaintaining the supply needed to support these economies\r\nand enable them to grow means that\r\nsignificant additional crude reserves must be developed. The\r\nconventional (light and medium) oil resources discovered up to\r\nthe end of 2002 will last at most 40 years\r\nat 2002's production rate. Thus additional development will\r\nbe primarily in the form of the sole alternative: heavy crudes.\r\nTwo crucial issues must be addressed before\r\nor during the design of any production project for these\r\nheavy oils: What is a suitable method for\r\nevaluating the foamy oil drive mechanism that plays a major role\r\nduring such oil recovery, and what is a reasonable percentage of\r\nultimate oil recovery for each project? Unfortunately,\r\nthese two issues have not been fully addressed and are still\r\nnot understood. The laboratory experiments, theoretical investigations,\r\nand numerical simulations proposed in this project\r\nwill greatly improve our understanding of these issues.\r\n",
