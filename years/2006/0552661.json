 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experience for Undergraduates Site provides opportunities for 10 advanced undergraduates to conduct 12 weeks of independent research on the emerging science and engineering of macromolecular and supramolecular materials that interact with, and respond to, electromagnetic energy.  The multi-disciplinary theme includes rational design and synthesis of functional polymers and their assembly into supramolecular constructs, improving understanding of response to electromagnetic fields within the context of well-defined chemistry and architecture, and the development and application of advanced measurement techniques to probe structure and response.  The undergraduate students work in a state-of-the-art research environment where they are mentored by leading faculty researchers from multiple disciplines. The activity focus is on the science and engineering of their disciplines, with added emphasis on building leadership, career planning, communications skills, and experiencing the gratification derived from integrating their science into the community.  The program includes a short course on the principles of polymeric materials and electromagnetic fields, interactive communications and ethics seminars, a career awareness workshop, and development of leadership skills through a science exhibition with Middle School students.",
