 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for partial funding of the 22nd Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM). The meeting will be held from the morning of March 2 through noon March 5, 2006, at the University of Florida as a highlight of the mathematics department's special year in Probability and Analysis. The University of Florida will provide facilities, cover local organizing expenses, and provide significant funding. National Science Foundation funding will be used as partial support for participant travel expenses. Priority will be given to graduate students, postdocs, members of underrepresented groups, and younger faculty.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of SEAM is to disseminate and exchange the latest ideas and developments in operator theory and functional analysis while encouraging the participation and professional development of junior members of the operator theory community. The program will consist of plenary talks by eminent mathematicians and parallel sessions of contributed papers by younger participants. There will also be two special sessions | one on non-commutative measure theory and the other on quantum field theory and functional analysis whose programs will consist of invited talks by leading scientists and contributed papers by participants.\r\n",
