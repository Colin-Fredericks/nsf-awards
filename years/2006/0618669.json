The PIs are creating fifteen (15) lean process design case studies that are linked to Time WiseTM Lean Higher Educational Modules based on a physical simulation of a multi-stage clock assembly process.  The case studies are complementing the modules providing a comprehensive set of materials allowing students to explore different applications (e.g. services, coordinating with small companies) and contrast the tactics used in different situations.\r\n\r\nExperiential workshops are developing faculty expertise by introducing materials and providing on-going developmental opportunities to improve teaching through interaction with lean practitioners.  The faculty are developing the case studies with expert instruction and assistance.  The curricular materials are being tested at fifteen diverse colleges and universities, representing two and four year colleges and minority institutions utilizing both engineering and operations management majors.  Applications at the high school level are also being explored.  Project results are being disseminated and mechanisms for self-sustaining national distribution are being created through MEP MSI's training and materials logistics network.\r\n",
