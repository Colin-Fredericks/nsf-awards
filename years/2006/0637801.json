The format will be highly interactive, with attendees identifying interesting work and experiences, as well as generating new ideas for advancing education, knowledge and practice.\r\n\r\nOrganized by the Center for Sustainable Global Enterprise at Cornell University, Engineers for a Sustainable World, Pennsylvania State University, and the World Resources Institute, the workshop focuses on catalyzing programmatic change in business and engineering education. \r\nPreparatory work in advance of the workshop will be performed by the organizers and follow-up work will also be done to measure the effectiveness of the workshop and build programmatic outcomes. A written report summarizing workshop outcomes and follow-up work will be provided to NSF.\r\n",
