 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed program of research is in the area of theoretical physics with an emphasis on solar and supernova neutrinos; fusion reactions below the Coulomb barrier; the origin of elements, in particular r-process nucleosynthesis; and other aspects of neutrino astrophysics. Theoretical research in these areas is chosen to have a close coupling with the ongoing experimental programs in the United States and abroad. Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Work: Successful completion of the proposed projects will lead to i) A better understanding of neutrino masses and mixings; ii) Understanding neutrino propagation through dense media including dense neutrino gases; iii)  A better understanding of various aspects of core-collapse supernovae; iv) A better understanding of the origin of elements, especially those produced in rapid neutron capture;  v) A better understanding of fusion in astrophysical environments; and vi) Exploring the potential of rare-ion accelerators for neutrino physics. Broader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity: Proposed research contributes to the support of national priorities in nuclear science such as the proposed Deep Underground Science Laboratory and Rare Ion Accelerator. In addition  to enhancing research and education infrastructure of the Nation in underground science and nuclear physics, these proposed facilities will have significant outreach efforts. The proposed research involves collaboration between University of Wisconsin-Madison and University of California at San Diego, as well as international collaborations between University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers and those from Brazil, France, Japan, and Turkey.\r\nThe principal investigator participates in multidisciplinary research activities that connect particle, nuclear, condensed-matter physics and astrophysics. He and other team members are also involved in exposing physics to broader audiences.\r\n",
