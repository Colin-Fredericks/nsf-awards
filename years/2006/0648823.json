The FOA conferences were established in 1983 in order to promote international scientific collaborations among adsorption scientists and engineers and the continued advancement of adsorption science and technology. The primary goal and hence intellectual merit of the 9th International Conference on Fundamentals of Adsorption is to allow scientists and engineers from all over the World to present their most recent research efforts in the area of Adsorption Science and Technology and to outline further developments in this area. The conference will allow US participants from academia and industry to interact with their international counterparts and especially to enhance and/or establish international collaborations and scientific exchange with adsorption researchers. The conference will cover a wide variety of adsorption related areas from fundamentals to applications in new and emerging fields including biotechnology, alternative energy, and environmental protection and remediation. The conference will consist of plenary sessions, oral sessions and poster sessions. To set the stage for the conference, plenary speakers will present in depth overviews of key research areas covering fundamentals, materials, molecular modeling, and processes. The conference will last for five and one half days, and host approximately 400 participants from around the world.\r\nOnly tenure-track faculty members and their graduate students in US educational institutions and researchers in US nonprofit research institutions who will have an oral or\r\nposter presentation at the meeting will be eligible to apply for this NSF support. Priority\r\nwill be given to young faculty (who have been in academia for no more than 5 years) and\r\nyounger doctoral students who are at least one year away from graduation, with each\r\napplicant receiving a minimum of $400 up to a maximum of $800. We anticipate making\r\nup to ten $500 awards to young faculty and up to five $600 awards to doctoral students,\r\nAny remaining funds will be used to make $400 travel awards to other conference\r\nparticipants on a need basis. Eligible attendees will be asked to send an application within\r\n45 days after the conference to the PI including a letter, co-signed by the Chairperson (or\r\nequivalent), requesting partial reimbursement of travel expenses and stating their\r\neligibility for refund under the NSF regulations and according to the above eligibility\r\ncriteria, an airline ticket receipt, and original boarding passes. The allowance for air\r\ntravel will not exceed the cost of a round-trip, economy airfare ticket; and eligible\r\nparticipants from the US will also be informed that they must travel by US-flag carriers,\r\nif available. The attendees will be reimbursed within 90 days after the conference.\r\nThe broader impacts of FOA9 are mainly associated with the potential technological\r\nadvances in energy, biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and environmental applications made\r\npossible by sharing new adsorption-related scientific information at the highest level.\r\nAdditional broader impacts will be associated with the participation of young faculty and\r\ndoctoral students facilitated by the proposed travel funds, and their exposure to the\r\nfrontiers of adsorption science and technology in a truly interdisciplinary and\r\ninternational scientific gathering.\r\n",
