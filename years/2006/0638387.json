 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scale of influence of global change and the added value of coordinating the scientific activities of the EU and North American countries to assess, predict, and mitigate the effects on marine ecosystems of the North Atlantic and their services is the justification for the development of the BASIN SSA. An important step towards such a coordinated approach is the development of an implementation plan whereby jointly funded international projects can be supported. The development of such a plan is the first key goal of BASIN. The second goal of BASIN is to develop an integrated basin-scale North Atlantic science plan. Programmatic goals will be achieved in working groups including experts from both the EU and North America. As a prerequisite for the development of this science plan BASIN will (1) assess the status of climate-related ecosystem research in the North Atlantic Basin and associated shelf seas, (2) identify gaps in systematic observations and process understanding of atmospheric and oceanic parameters, (3) identify the potential for consolidation of long-term observations from EU and international databases for modeling and prediction. The BASIN science plan will focus on: (1) Resolving the natural variability, potential impacts and feedbacks of global change on the structure, function, and dynamics of ecosystems; (2) Improving the understanding of marine ecosystem functioning; and (3) Developing ecosystem-based management strategies. BASIN will contribute significantly to the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) 10-Year Implementation Plan via the development of comprehensive, coordinated, and sustained observations of the earth system, improved monitoring of the state of the earth, increased understanding of earth processes, and enhanced prediction. This award supports U.S. participation in the BASIN project.",
