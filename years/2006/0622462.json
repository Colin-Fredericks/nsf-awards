 "awd_abstract_narration": "A combination of high school science, recruitment and retention activities are increasing the number of graduates in chemistry, computer science, engineering, mathematics and physics by 36 percent from 220 to 300 graduates annually.  Interdisciplinary teams of university and high school faculty are creating engineering and science explorations and design projects for high school students.  A five week summer enrichment program is aiding the approximately half of the entering university class that is not qualified to study calculus to improve their mathematics skills.  In addition to the mathematics studies, the students in the program are also enrolling in a three credit general education course selected from English, history, sociology or art appreciation.\r\n\r\nRetention efforts include peer mentoring by sophomore and junior STEM majors, and the required use of ALEKS, a web-based individualized learning assistant.  ALEKS uses diagnostic testing to identify a student's individual weaknesses and provides practice problems in those areas where the individual needs the greatest help.  Supplemental instruction is also contributing to the increased retention rate in STEM majors following the freshmen year.  The project is an outgrowth of a previous Integrated Engineering and Science Curricula initiative designed to help students make connections between mathematics, science and engineering. \r\n",
