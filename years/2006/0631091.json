Up to 30 scholarships are being annually provided to academically talented, financially disadvantaged students.  A rich array of opportunities are available for the scholarship cohort, including developmental seminars, comprehensive career counseling services, tutoring, internship, research and service learning positions, a laptop loaner program and mentoring from STEM alumni.  The program has 3 goals; sharpening students' problem solving abilities, building student confidence in their ability to succeed in their chosen STEM field, and exposing them to a breadth of STEM disciplines with an associate range of career opportunities.\r\n\r\nStudents are also participating in field trips to research institutions and local industries, exposing them to a wide venue of research environments.  Students are also attending workshops enhancing their professional and academic skills.  They have the opportunity to present their work at the Annual Undergraduate Symposium held on campus as well at other professional society meetings.  The project is being annually assessed utilizing both formative and summative methods with the results being disseminated at national meetings and via the project website.",
