 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis award supports the US Coast Guard (USCG) to provide Ice breaker services to the National Science Foundation both for the US Antarctic Program and for research support in the Arctic in Fiscal Year 2006. \r\n\r\nThe USAP funds a multi-disciplinary research program on the Antarctic continent and in the adjacent oceans. The research is conducted at three permanent Antarctic stations, from temporary stations and remote field sites, and aboard ships. Research projects developed by, or in collaboration with, other Government agencies are included, and there are frequent instances of cooperative research with scientists of other Treaty nations. The USAP provides for the direct operational and logistic support of science activities and the maintenance of an effective U.S. presence in Antarctica. The principal segments include DoD support, Department of Homeland Security (USCG) support and commercial contractor support. The DoD and the USCG provide operational and logistic support as requested by NSF on a cost-reimbursable basis. \r\n\r\nThe Arctic support responds to science proposal so it is variable from year to year.  This year work will occur in the both the Bering and Chukchi Sea of the Arctic.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
