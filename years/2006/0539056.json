 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project is to develop a proteomic-based biometric system for near-real time detection of sub-symptomatic exposures of CBRN materials. Protein expression and post-translational modification data such as protein arrays, LC/MS and gel electrophoresis (1-D or 2-D) data will be used to identify protein expression changes. The proteomics data will be integrated with gene expression data and metabolomics/metabonomics data to identify the molecular events up- and down-stream of these protein changes in the pathways involved in the cellular response to the external insults.  Phase I effort will be focused on defining and developing the bioinformatics tool that will be used to identify or link to databases that identify altered protein expression, to aid in the analysis and interpretation of proteomics data. This software tool will be capable of quantifying and interpreting complex and time-dependent global changes in various biological pattern profiles.  \r\n\r\nThe developed biometric system will have both military and civilian applications. It can be used by biotech and pharmaceutical companies to identify new biomarkers, by environmental conscious organizations to assess and monitor effects of low-level intakes of toxic materials, by the health care industry to monitor and assess the effectiveness of diet and fitness activities. It can also be used by the military to detect and diagnose exposure of toxic materials and make deployment decisions, and by the homeland security to monitor and detect suspicious terrorist activity and implement emergency response plans.\r\n",
