Gulliver, Tian-Jun Li\r\n\r\nThe principal investigators propose to organize the third Yamabe\r\nMemorial Symposium, with an emphasis on geometry and symplectic\r\ntopology, at the School of Mathematics of the University of\r\nMinnesota from Friday to Sunday, September 22-24, 2006.  The list\r\nof speakers will include Denis Auroux, Yakov Eliashberg, Mikio\r\nFuruta, Helmut Hofer, Dusa McDuff, Peter Ozsvath, Yongbin Ruan\r\nand Ronald Stern.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hidehiko Yamabe (1923--1960) was an active and highly\r\ncollaborative mathematician in the School of Mathematics of the\r\nUniversity of Minnesota from 1954 to 1960.  His sudden illness\r\nand untimely death occured in the same year that he moved to\r\nNorthwestern University.  His work on topological groups,\r\ngeometry and analysis were outstanding contributions to modern\r\nmathematics.  In year 2001, we proposed to enhance the Yamabe\r\nMemorial Lecture by creating the Yamabe Memorial Symposium, a\r\ntop-level biennial geometry conference in the School of\r\nMathematics, University of Minnesota.  Every two years, perhaps\r\nin the Fall of even-numbered years, mathematicians will gather at\r\nthe University of Minnesota for a long weekend to hear geometry\r\ntalks, discuss the latest research and interact with graduate\r\nstudents and junior researchers.  In each biennium, a specific\r\narea within geometry will be singled out for special emphasis.\r\nOne goal will be, as a way to honor the memory of Hidehiko\r\nYamabe, to advance areas of mathematics related to his interests,\r\nwhich touched in a substantial and ground-breaking way on several\r\nquite different areas of mathematics, all of which may be roughly\r\ndescribed as having significant geometric aspects. At the same\r\ntime, it will provide a valuable opportunity for graduate\r\nstudents and junior researchers to interact with, and learn from,\r\nmathematicians working at the highest international level.\r\nFinally, a long-lasting benefit will be the stimulation of\r\ninnovative developments in mathematics research.\r\n\r\nThe conference web page is http://www.math.umn.edu/yamabe/.",
