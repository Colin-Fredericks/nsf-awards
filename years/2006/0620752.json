 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is for the development of a new design methodology and associated manufacturing procedures for absolute minimum-weight structures, using the latest advanced materials and processes.  Of particular interest are manufacturing techniques such as laser net shaping and ultrasonic consolidation, which are capable of changing materials and properties in process and introducing ceramic fibers into metal alloys.  The basic design problem is to determine the optimal layout of a required structure given the varying material properties, the required loading, the required stiffness and the location of supports.  The investigators will develop a number of optimal analytical two and three-dimensional solutions with which to validate more powerful numerical optimization techniques to be developed in the research.  The latter will include a new approach to finite-element based structural optimizations, as well a growth method for weight minimization of truss-type structures.  Concurrently with this design work, the investigators plan to manufacture and test optimal multi-material structural prototypes.  The investigators, at both institutions in this collaborative research task, have working relationships with Sandia National Laboratories, which will guide them in the selection of test cases.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research could have a significant impact in the development of new classes of light-weight structures for use in aerospace, transportation, defense and other industries, wherever there is need to produce lighter products.  The research could also enable design structural optimization to be much more widely practiced in the engineering design community.  Currently the only methods available, for so-called structural topological optimization, require custom finite-element analysis (FEA) codes which can not be operated on commercial finite-element platforms.  The design tools planned in this research will not only allow application to multi-material property structures, but will also be capable of use with the commercial FEA codes in wide use throughout US industry.\r\n",
