However, it is extremely difficult to uniformly disperse nano-sized ceramic particles in Al alloy melts. The proposed research seeks to make substantial advances in understanding such Al matrix nanocomposites through an integrated processing, characterization and modeling approach. Experimental studies will be conducted to optimize the ultrasonic cavitation based dispersion of ceramic nanoparticles into Al melts for solidification processing, to characterize micro/nano-structures of the as-fabricated bulk nanocomposites, and to measure the mechanical properties of the Al matrix nanocomposites. These experimental activities will be accompanied by multiscale modeling efforts involving molecular dynamics simulations, micromechanics and continuum mechanics, which will establish the structure-property relations of the nanocomposites. The successful completion of this project will lead to new knowledge of ultrasonic-assisted nanoparticle dispersion and solidification, nanocomposite characterization and testing, nanomechanics, and physics-based multiscale modeling. The novel technology, ultrasonic non-linear effects (cavitation and streaming) based solidification processing, to be further developed in the project, will enable the production of high performance bulk Al matrix nanocomposites. New course development will enable engineering students to access cutting-edge research facilities and new knowledge. Mentoring activities will attract and engage students from under-represented groups. Outreach activities will expose K-12 students, teachers and industries to advanced technologies and multiscale simulations. Collaboration with the GOALI partner will facilitate immediate nanotechnology transfer and have a direct impact on the U.S. economy.\r\n",
