 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAMP Summary\r\nThe Louis Stokes California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) a ?Phase III?\r\nAlliance funded by the National Science Foundation, is a prime University of California\r\ninitiative to diversity the student population and the future faculty. Phase IV will\r\ncontinue the grant, HRD No. 0115115. UC Irvine serves as the lead campus and fiscal\r\nagent, under the established cooperative agreement. The primary goal of the eight UC\r\ncampus partners (Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, San\r\nDiego and Riverside) is to significantly increase the number of B.S. degrees granted to\r\nundererepresented minority students in STEM (science, technology, engineering,\r\nmathematics) majors at the University of California and to prepare these students\r\ncompetitively for the nations top graduate schools. This is accomplished through shared\r\nbest practices, networking, and a cultural change in the campus climate. CAMP represents\r\na systemwide community of UC faculty, program staff, and students working toward a set of\r\nshared goals, including not only B.S. degree completion but continuation on to graduate\r\nschool, completion of the Ph.D., and entry into the scientific and engineering workplace.\r\nThis collective effort has contributed to a 78% increase in B.S. degrees granted by UC\r\nfrom the baseline year (1990-91), for a total of 12,396 bachelors degrees awarded to date\r\nto underrepresented minorities by UC. In addition to faculty mentored research experiences\r\nand peer mentoring and tutoring, principal activities include collaborative learning,\r\npresenting at scientific conferences, science writing and co-authorship, technology\r\nproficiency, and preparation for advanced degrees. Graduate education is currently\r\nsupported by the supplemental activity, Bridge to the Doctorate, which currently has three\r\ncohorts, hosted respectively at UCLA, UCI, and UC San Diego. The Bridge Fellows represent\r\na robust effort to encourage and support minority graduate education and completion of the\r\ndoctorate. The Bridge to the Doctorate also represents the foundation for continuing the\r\nAMP program into Phase IV.",
