 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop stochastic dynamical \r\nmodels of video imagery for the purpose of synthesis and classification \r\nof spatio-temporal events in video.\r\nThe approach is based on exploiting tools from dynamical systems \r\ntheory, statistical signal processing, differential geometry and \r\nfunctional analysis in order to infer the spatio-temporal statistics of \r\na video segment and learn (identify) a dynamical model that represents \r\nits \"signature\". This allows generating novel portions of a video \r\nsegment, or recognizing it in previously unseen video. The \r\ninvestigators will develop identification algorithms for such models, \r\nsegmentation schemes to partition their spatio-temporal domain into \r\nstatistically coherent regions, and endow them with a metric structure \r\nto enable classification and recognition.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThe models developed will allow the generation of synthetic portions of \r\nvideo, and the manipulation of their spatio-temporal statistics, which \r\nis relevant for compression and transmission, and post-production \r\nediting and development of interactive games. Furthermore, these models \r\nsupport classification tasks, including detection of events of interest \r\nin video and segmentation into spatio-temporal segments. This is \r\nimportant for video-based recognition in security, surveillance, video \r\ncoding, and environmental monitoring (remote detection of fire, smoke, \r\nsteam). A particular class of spatio-temporal processes studied \r\nincludes human motion. The investigators will develop analytical and \r\ncomputational tools to enable the detection and recognition of \r\nindividuals and their gait from video data. Training students in such a \r\ndiverse set of analytical and computational tools is a challenge, but \r\none that must be tackled in a modern engineering academic environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
