They will be asked to present their accomplishments, and highlight their experiences in working with the industry.  They will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working on A GOALI project.\r\nThis workshop is only by invitation.  The speakers will discuss their accomplishments on different topics.  However, the interactions with the industry will be a common theme\r\nIntellectual merit:\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this workshop lies in bringing together PIs from broad areas of research fields, who will share not only the results of their research but will discuss their experiences with the industry.  GOALI awards have been given for the last 12 years.  This workshop will review the successful results of the GOALI awardees.  These awardees will also share their experiences as a result of their industry collaboration.  These discussions will help further improve the GOALI program.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  \r\n\r\nThe workshop will have breakout sessions in which the awardees will be asked to discuss specific questions to help further enhance the value of the program.  For example, the questions are:\r\n1 What Mechanisms can be used to increase student and faculty internships in industry and broaden participation of under represented groups in the GOALI program?\r\n2.  How can we encourage industry personnel to participate more actively at the university?\r\n3.  Should collaboration with NIST and other Federal laboratories be included in the GOALI program? What mechanisms should be used to included them?\r\n4.  What mechanisms can be used to commit industrial participation?\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the awardees presentation and the answers to the above questions will help define the future GOALI awards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
