 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project represents the initial steps towards a broad mission of establishing a multi-disciplinary theory of human task scheduling that draws upon classical scheduling theory, operations research, human factors engineering, and eventually other human and social sciences. This research targets warehouse order picking systems to drive the initial foundation for the theory. To this end, it is intended to (i) Introduce the notion of human task scheduling theory in which human characteristics are explicitly incorporated into mathematical scheduling models; (ii) Explore the single processor problem, which will form the foundation for more complex \"machine\" environments such as flow shops, job shops, and team work; (iii) Assess the impact of task sequencing on human performance, safety, and health, particularly order sequencing in labor-intensive warehouse order picking systems; and (iv) Report experiences, opportunities, and challenges associated with bridging the gap between Operations Research (OR) and Human Factor Engineering (HFE).\r\n \r\nUpon completion of this project, there will be contributions to both the academic and practicing communities. Academically, this project will enhance infrastructure for research and education by engaging faculty and students specializing in Operations Research and Human Factors Engineering in unique collaborative research and educational activities. It is also expected to mathematically describe the human characteristics associated with semi-automated order picking processes, and incorporate them into scheduling models whose solutions specify optimal pick sequences and break schedules with respect to ergonomic and productivity criteria. The findings will be communicated at major conferences and technical journals in both the OR and HFE areas, which will hopefully inspire other researchers to explore the potential of OR in contributing to the human performance domain. Consequently, it is expect to attract a critical mass of HFE graduate students who also enjoy mathematical rigor and/or algorithmic development. Finally, this project demonstrates the potential to improve human productivity, reduce the risk of injury, enhance job satisfaction, and minimize job-turnover in a labor-intensive service occupation. The contrived \"ergonomic pick sequences\" will implemented in real warehousing systems and the impact with respect to the above-mentioned criteria will be assessed.",
