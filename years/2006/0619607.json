The instrument includes both SEM and STEM imaging with a suite of analytical components and E-beam lithographic patterning down to 20 nm. The approach to accomplishing the objective will be to integrate the instrument into the existing campus Electron Microscopy Core Facility, which will maintain and provide access to the equipment.\r\n\r\nThe E-FE-S/TEM will allow researchers to image biological cells, antibodies, peptides, etc. without altering their properties. It will also allow users to pattern, image and analyze semiconductors with nanoscale features. Sample projects requiring this instrument include: biomolecule-mediated fabrication of nanoarrays, formation of protein nanopores on cell membrane, micro-DNA synthesis and analysis systems, and metal particle induced giant permittivity. \r\n\r\nThe instrument will enable scientists to advance our understanding of the natural world and to fabricate devices at the nanoscale in ways not possible with other approaches and instruments.  It will be used to train new scientists in the use of tools that will benefit engineering, the environment, and the life sciences.  New fields of study, such as biosensor development, will be opened up through use of this instrumentation.  It is likely that numerous advances that will benefit society will be developed with the aid of this equipment.  Among the anticipated advances are those that would improve national security, the environment, and public safety. \r\n\r\n",
