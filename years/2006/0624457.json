 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fort Valley State University (FVSU) HBCU-UP Targeted Infusion Project will incorporate plant genomics into the undergraduate curriculum of the Plant Science, and Biology departments. Genomics is a rapidly advancing interdisciplinary science.   This project will implement new inquiry-based investigations to allow students to further understand scientific method. To accomplish this objective a Plant Genomics senior level course will be developed and newly designed genomics modules will be incorporated into several existing courses such as: Genetic Engineering, Plant Biotechnology, Plant Breeding, Techniques in Molecular Biology, Botany, Microbiology, Research Methods, and Special Projects. The acquisition of a sequencer will provide students hands on experience with genomics research and facilitate on-going research efforts of faculty and students at FVSU.  Students enrolled in these courses will be better prepared for various careers in the biological sciences, particularly in the burgeoning fields of genomics and bioinformatics. The teaching materials developed at FVSU will be disseminated through a course website, conference presentations, and workshops for juniors and faculty members. The project will provide new educational tools for universities and colleges nationwide in order to help them meet the need for individuals knowledgeable in genomics.",
