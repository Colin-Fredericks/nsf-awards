The proposal is for a 2-day workshop to be held in the fall of 2006, a smaller follow-up\r\nmeeting to be held in the spring of 2007, and preparation of an edited volume. \r\nHistorians of technology have recently focused their attention on inequitable social\r\nagendas embedded in the design of artifacts, engineered structures and systems, and\r\nproductive labor. Similarly, historians of science have chosen to study applications of\r\nscience to the production and maintenance of racist thought particularly in the medical\r\nand life sciences. Both disciplines have begun to identify important ways in which the\r\npresumed objectivity of technological and scientific discourses supports racism. That\r\npresumption of value-neutrality has historically sustained not just racialized scientific and\r\ntechnical knowledge but exclusive occupational patterns in these supposedly meritocratic\r\nfields, as well. At the same time, scholars in other disciplines such as labor and\r\neconomic history, and race and gender or urban studies, continue an older commitment to\r\nstudying institutional and cultural practices that undergird inequality in the United States.\r\nFrom those disciplines there has arisen a vital body of theory regarding race, explicating\r\nhow notions of difference have achieved centrality in so many private and public spheres.\r\nThese fields address systemic inequities within urban planning, employment, education,\r\nelectoral or economic practices, and other structural aspects of modern society. Through a\r\ntwo-day workshop and subsequent, collective preparation of an edited volume of\r\nconference papers all of these scholars might profitably share their methodologies and\r\nfindings to bring a fuller picture of race in the United States. This cross-disciplinary\r\nexchange will explore how science and technology, and hierarchical features of American\r\nsociety, support one another. Intellectual Merit: This project integrates concerns of the history of science and\r\ntechnology with those of other disciplines, part of an initiative of the Society for the History of Technology to host small, inter-disciplinary meetings. Through invitations and a widely circulated call for papers we will convene twenty-five junior and senior scholars to discuss race formation in four arenas: The Built Environment, The Technological Career,Instruments and Other Knowledge Systems, and Bodies and Biologies. A follow-up workshop some six months later will bring ten of the participants together to\r\ncreate a published volume of conference papers of unusual scholarly reach. Broader Impact: Race has been understudied in the history of science and technologyand the exchange outlined here will support the address of historic inequities inoccupational, environmental and medical realms. It will also present to other social\r\nsciences techniques used in the history of science and technology, including the close study of material artifacts and knowledge systems associated with processes of raceformation. All of the organizers and many of the  participants will be women and minority scholars. \r\n",
