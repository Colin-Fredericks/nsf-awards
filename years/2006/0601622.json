 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nRecent developments in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have lead to a variety of microsensors\r\nand actuators that have great potential for guidance and control of aircraft and spacecraft. Such devices\r\ncan deliver high-bandwidth performance with low power consumption, and their small size and weight\r\npermit the use of numerous sensors and/or actuators in applications where conventional sensor/actuator\r\ntechnology limits the number of measurement channels and actuator degrees of freedom.\r\nFor these emerging technologies to realize competitive performance levels, innovative methods are required\r\nfor device calibration and closed-loop control. The necessity of such methods arise from the fact\r\nthat fabrication irregularities can produce a wide range of dynamic responses among any batch of supposedly\r\nidentical devices due to the microscopic scale of key electro-mechanical components. The sensitivity\r\nand variability of sensor and actuator dynamics can be compensated by precise calibration of individual\r\ndevices based on detailed modeling and parameter identification from input/output data, and by control\r\nloops built into the micro device.\r\nBroader Impact:This research focuses on the development of multivariable system identification and control strategies\r\nfor improving the performance of MEMS vibratory angular rate sensors. The intellectual merit of this\r\nresearch derives from the study of problems stimulated by the following needs: 1) The first major research\r\ntopic develops algorithms for achieving optimum device sensitivity. The highest signal-to-noise ratio\r\nis achieved when two dynamic modes of the sensor are rendered degenerate. Robust test methods and\r\nalgorithms have been developed that vastly improve the SNR associated with the angular rate estimate via\r\nreal-time tuning of the sensor dynamics. Furthermore, on-line algorithms continuously probe the sensor\r\ndynamics during operation in order to maintain the tuned condition; 2) The second major research topic\r\ndevelops a process for minimizing the rate uncertainty at designated integration times via the shaping of\r\nclosed-loop noise spectra. In this case, additional freedom in the control filters is exploited for shaping the\r\nAllan variance of the rate estimate in a desired manner.\r\nThis research program is conducted in the PIs Microsensor Laboratory on sensor prototypes loaned\r\nto the PI from NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The research contributions have significant broader\r\nimpacts well beyond graduate education. The algorithms and methods devised under this program have\r\nchanged the way the PIs collaborators at JPL and elsewhere model, test and control their sensor prototypes.\r\nIn the undergraduate engineering curriculum at UCLA, a series of design courses expose students to this\r\nrapidly evolving sensor technology with projects that include the design and construction of a stabilized\r\nsensor platform for the UCLA DARPA Grand Challenge Team using commercial GyroChip vibratory\r\ngyros donated by BEI Technologies.",
