 "awd_abstract_narration": "LIQUID CRYSTAL POLARIZATION GRATINGS FOR PHOTONICS APPLICATIONS\r\nMichael J. Escuti, NC State University\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The overall goal of this project is to investigate and apply a newly developed liquid crystal diffraction grating with broad applicability within many areas of photonics and optoelectronic devices due to its unique ability to manipulate the intensity and polarization of light.  The PI seeks to advance his exceptional experimental realization of high-quality switchable polarization gratings by pursuing (i) achromatic operation through multi-layer retardation compensation, and (ii) fast switching using ferroelectric liquid crystal materials, both in the context of attaining polarization-insensitive spatial-light-modulators. He will also develop a spectropolarimeter based on liquid crystal polymer polarization gratings capable of detecting all four Stokes parameters across a wide bandwidth simultaneously with no moving or tunable parts.  Due to the simplicity, robustness, compactness, and lightweight potential of its design, it also has the potential to significantly impact polarization-mode-dispersion monitoring, remote sensing and astronomy applications. We further propose the first significant numerical studies of these PGs using custom in-house finite-difference time-domain tools and with rigorous elastic continuum analysis. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This research project will furnish excellent opportunities for broad graduate/undergraduate training in LC devices and modeling, holography, functional polymer materials, and electro-optics characterization.  By partnering with the NCSU Science House, the research findings and optics/photonics fundamentals will be broadly disseminated to groups underrepresented in science and engineering. As part of this grant, the PI will establish a dedicated holography and optics \"educational corner\" within his lab, for use as he mentors minority students (9th-12th grades) in the Photonics Leaders and Xplorers programs and leads full-day photonics lessons. He will also assist in Science House teacher planning meetings, and help coordinate a summer 7-day internship to learn about current research efforts of photonics at NCSU and Research Triangle Park.\r\n",
