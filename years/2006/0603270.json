Culler, Steven Boyer\r\n\r\nThe subject of 3-manifold topology has a long history of deep and\r\ninteresting interactions with other parts of mathematics.  The\r\ncomplexity of these connections has increased with time, as the\r\nsubject developed, and it has exploded in recent years.  The\r\ncoincidence of this explosion with the recent solution of several\r\nof the major outstanding problems in the area make this a good\r\ntime for reflection on its relationship to the rest of\r\nmathematics.  This grant will support participants in a\r\nconference, to be held at CRM in Montreal, which aims to bring\r\ntogether a varied group of leading researchers whose work\r\ndemonstrates deep connections between 3-manifold topology and\r\nother areas of mathematics.  The speakers will include leading\r\nresearchers in areas such as: geometrization of 3-manifolds;\r\ncombinatorial group theory and coarse geometric properties of\r\ngroups; properties of random 3-manifolds and asymptotic\r\nproperties of hyperbolic surfaces; Floer homology,\r\nKhovanov-Rozansky homology; 3-manifold invariants arising from\r\ncontact structures; character varieties; and Dehn surgery.  The\r\nconference will honor Peter Shalen, whose work has been a major\r\nforce in bringing many different aspect of mathematics to bear on\r\nthe study of 3-manifolds, and in expanding the influence of\r\n3-manifold topology into other areas.\r\n\r\nThroughout history the interaction between mathematics and\r\nscience has been characterized by the mysterious phenomenon that\r\nmathematical ideas which are developed with no specific\r\napplication in mind turn out to be perfectly suited for future\r\napplications to science.  For example, differential geometry,\r\nwhich provided the ideal mathematical foundation for Einstein's\r\ngeneral relativity theory, was developed much earlier by\r\nmathematicians who could not have anticipated the way in which it\r\nwould be applied in physics.  On a smaller scale, there is a\r\nsimilar phenomenon involving different areas of mathematics.  A\r\nrecent example of this, which is directly related to the topic of\r\nthis conference, is provided by Perelman's proof of Thurston's\r\nGeometrization Conjecture.  This conference aims to facilitate\r\nthese sorts of unexpected fruitful interactions between different\r\nareas of mathematics.  The central topic of the conference is the\r\nstudy of 3-dimensional spaces.  Speakers have been selected whose\r\nwork involves significant new applications to this subject of\r\nideas which originate from a wide range of other areas of\r\nmathematics.\r\n\r\nThe conference web site is\r\nhttp://www.crm.umontreal.ca/cal/fr/mois200606.html.\r\n",
