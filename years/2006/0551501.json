V. S.\r\nInstitution: University of Texas at San Antonio\r\n\r\nThe University of Texas at San Antonio, a leader in higher education for Hispanic students and a rapidly growing research university, will establish a strong interdisciplinary research effort in wireless networks and security, high-speed networking, parallel and distributed computing, and image processing. Research includes progress on mathematical software libraries for cluster computers, 3D image reconstruction for tomography, persistent wireless networks, and energy-efficient and secure ad hoc and sensor networks. This award will support faculty and graduate student participants. Broader impacts of this project include increasing institutional capacity for research, increasing minority participation in graduate training, and enhancing the workforce for South Texas.\r\n\r\n",
