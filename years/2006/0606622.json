 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Whitney form revolution in computational electromagnetics, initiated  over two decades ago, builds on the mathematics which created discrete  Hodge theory, solved the Ray-Singer conjecture and set the stage for Dennis  Sullivan's approach to rational homotopy theory. The basic tools point to a  discrete framework for Ed Witten's TQFT approach to the Jones polynomial,  and associated computational complexity issues. Furthermore, this  interaction between electrical engineers and geometrically minded  topologists was largely unnoticed by applied mathematicians! ACE '06 will  bring together experts in very diverse fields to continue this technology  transfer from seemingly pure mathematics to deep problems encountered in  enlarging the scope of computational electromagnetics.\r\n\r\n\r\nElectrical engineers have always marveled at the beauty of Maxwell's theory  of electromagnetism and associated mathematical formalism. They have  pondered both the practical implications of this big picture, and the  difficulties of fitting it into the undergraduate curriculum. The Whitney  form  revolution of the past two decades has translated the formalism  associated with Mawell's equations into a discrete setting, has resolved  some of the deepest problems in computational electromagnetics, has lead to  very efficient software implementations, has enabled unforeseen applications  to be tackled, and has offered open research questions back to  mathematicians. A major objective in organizing this workshop is to get key  mathematicians who have been cited by engineers years ago, to finally rub  shoulders with the key players within the engineering community! By having a  diverse set talks, poster sessions, and panel discussions, ACE '06 will  sustain the strong level of cross-fertilization by bringing from different  countries, a diverse set of experts and academic disciplines, students,  professors, and engineers who have grown successful companies.
