 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project could result in a new one-step, environmentally friendly solid-state synthesis of novel hybrid pigments for a wide variety of applications such as the coloring of plastics, paints and coatings, and cement. The properties of the proposed pigments result from a chemical bond between organic dyes and an inorganic clay, imparting advantageous chemical functionality from both constituents. The purpose of this research is to develop a method for synthesizing these pigments. \r\n\r\nThe proposed pigments are a series of environmentally friendly, non heavy-metal containing organic/inorganic hybrid pigments. The advantages of the pigments include chemical resistance, light and heat stability and greater cost competitiveness. Meeting the objectives described in this project would result in a solvent-free innovation in manufacturing that replaces hazardous waste-generating commercial pigment manufacturing with an environmentally friendly, \"green\" production process. \r\n",
