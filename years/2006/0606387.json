 "awd_abstract_narration": "The involvement of students of any age in different phases of research can be  a  stimulating  experience  for  both the scientist and the student. We propose  to  continue  a  program  where  cutting  edge research is done in partnership  of faculty with students starting from high school through the post doctorate. We believe that this  arrangement can be beneficial for all participants.  The  faculty brings the excitement of original research into the  classroom, providing role models and motivation for the students. Post doctoral  and graduate students, who are heavily involved in the day to day research  activities  also   learn  teaching  and  mentoring skills through working with the undergraduate and high school students. Becoming  involved in  all  phases  of  the  research, undergraduate and high school students, learn  first  hand what is expected if they are to chose careers in science and engineering.\r\nA  central goal of the National Nanotechnology Initiative has recently been identified  by  an  NSF  report  to  be  the  ability to create \"smart\" and adaptable materials with atomic level precision and control in economically viable  quantities  that  would  \"be of broad benefit to industry, economy, health,  environment,  and society\".  The report pointed to \"our ability to achieve a better understanding of materials at dissimilar interfaces\" as a key  vehicle  to  attaining  this  goal. Polymers, which can be molecularly engineered   on  a  macroscopic  scale,  while  retaining  nanometer  scale precision,  play  a  central  role  in  attaining  this goal. This proposal therefore has  two  research  directions:  Engineering  biomimetic polymer  scaffolds for tissue engineering and fundamental studies of cell mechanical transduction  and  the  desing of self extinguishing polymer nanocomposites that  can  withstand  extreme  conditions.  This proposal therefore has two interrelated goals; (a) Produce   original   and    relevant  research  in  biomaterials  and nanocomposite  polymer engineering ;       (b) Allow for versatile training of   students   from  high  school,  undergraduate,  graduate  through  the post-doctorate  to  develop  necessary  skills  for  achieving professional careers in science and engineering.\r\n\r\n",

In their non-differentiated state, ADSCs were penetrated by the AuNPs and stored in vacuoles. The presence of the AuNPs in ADSCs resulted in increased population doubling times, decreased cell motility and cell-mediated collagen contraction. The degree to which the cells were impacted was a function of particle concentration, where the smaller particles required a sevenfold higher concentration to have the same effect as the larger ones.  Furthermore, AuNPs reduced adipogenesis as measured by lipid droplet accumulation and adiponectin secretion. These effects correlated with transient increases in DLK1 and with relative reductions in fibronectin. Upon removal of exogenous AuNPs, cellular NP levels decreased and normal ADSC functions were restore..."
