The 100th Anniversary Conference will be held in San Francisco, and will include EERIs 8th U.S. National Conference on Earthquake Engineering (8NCEE) and EERIs 58th Annual Meeting, SSA's Centennial Annual Meeting, and the OES Disaster Resistant California Conference. It is organized and focused to create the opportunity for a unique collaboration between earthquake scientists, engineers, and public policy professionals and to offer to the public at large current, concise, coordinated, and expert opinions regarding seismic hazard mitigation. The conference will have significant intellectual merit, advancing knowledge and understanding in each of the primary disciplines: the earth sciences, engineering, and emergency management and between these fields, as well. The conference will also have broad societal impacts. It will identify where we should go from here and kindle enthusiasm for and commitment to seismic safety and earthquake research in the SF Bay Area and beyond, and for the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, more generally. In addition to convening state-of- the-art conferences of the co-convening associations, the conference will take advantage of the expertise present to provide tutorials and other special sessions for elementary and secondary school science teachers, fire fighters, and other professionals interested in expanding their knowledge, as well as public forums aimed at all who are interested in seismic hazard mitigation technologies.\r\n",
