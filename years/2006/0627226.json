 "awd_abstract_narration": "Golden Richard\r\nUniversity of New Orleans\r\n0627226\r\nPanel:  P060969\r\nA Comprehensive Data Carving Architecture for Digital Forensics\r\n\r\nOne of the most important software techniques in digital forensics is \r\nfile carving, which uses a database of characteristics about commonly \r\nencountered file types to search physical disks for files of these \r\ntypes.  File carving is a particularly powerful technique because files \r\ncan be retrieved from raw disk images, regardless of the type of \r\nfilesystem, even if file metadata has been destroyed.  File carving can \r\nfind data associated with deleted files, in slack space, swap files, and \r\ndata \"hidden\" outside the filesystem.  The goal is to identify the \r\nstarting and ending locations of files in the disk images and \"carve\" \r\n(copy) sequences of bytes into regular files so their value as evidence \r\ncan be measured.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the scope of file carving is narrow and there are significant \r\nlimitations.  Patterns for new file types are typically created \r\nmanually, which is a tedious and error-prone process. \r\nCurrent-generation tools generate many false positives, carving files \r\nwhose formats are incorrect.  This wastes the time of investigators, who \r\nalready have overwhelming caseloads.  In addition, carving has not been \r\napplied extensively to volatile media such as memory and network flows. \r\nRAM carving is useful for low-level detection of installed malware, \r\nwhere high level detection (e.g., via OS facilities) might be thwarted \r\nby the malware.   Network data flow carving can help investigators \r\ndetermine whether specific documents were transmitted or whether \r\nversions of specific documents were transmitted.  This research explores \r\ntechniques for better automatic identification of documents, by \r\nexpanding on the header/milestone/footer search generally employed in \r\ncurrent generation tools.  The research also expands the scope of data \r\ncarving to include memory analysis and network flow analysis.   The \r\nentire architecture is be incorporated into the distributed digital \r\nforensics framework created by the PI and his collaborators at the \r\nUniversity of New Orleans.\r\n\r\n",
