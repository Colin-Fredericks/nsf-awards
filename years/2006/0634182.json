 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goals of this project are to generate new knowledge at the interface of mathematics and biology and provide an integrated bio-mathematical research experience for undergraduate students at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG). Each year, eight students, working in two teams will conduct research with professors on issues related to animal behavior, quantitative genetics, demography, or community ecology. Specific objectives include: generate new knowledge at the interface of mathematics and biology through mentored research; showcase mathematics outside the discipline and the use of mathematics and statistics in the field of biology; guide students to an increased proficiency of research skills including, prepare capable students with education and skills for careers and graduate education that integrate biological and mathematical sciences, increase student's awareness of graduate school opportunities and the preparation needed for graduate school and exposing students to career options in academics, industry and government.  \r\n\r\nUNCG has a strong history of involving students in research and is committed to recruiting students from underrepresented groups. This project is the first step to providing a more integrated curriculum in mathematics and biology at UNCG and will help us produce 21st century biologists and mathematicians with broad, interdisciplinary scientific training.   \r\n",
