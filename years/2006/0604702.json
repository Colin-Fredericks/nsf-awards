 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n An abstract:\r\n\r\nThe investigator and his colleagues will organize the New Researchers\r\nConference, a scientific conference for roughly ninety new researchers\r\nin statistics and probability. This consists of organizing an application\r\nprocess, selecting participants from a pool of applicants, coordinating\r\ntalks and poster sessions, arranging for senior speakers, and a variety of\r\nother administrative tasks (arranging for travel, housing, food, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe New Researchers Conference (NRC) is a conference for recent\r\nrecipients of doctoral degrees in Statistics and Probability. The primary \r\npurpose of this conference is to provide a much needed venue\r\nfor interaction among new researchers. At present, researchers develop\r\ncontacts with others in their field either through their own\r\ninstitutions or at meetings of professional societies. It is often the\r\ncase that junior researchers have limited\r\ncontact with senior colleagues, even at their own institutions.\r\nMeetings of professional societies are rather large and junior\r\nresearchers often find them overwhelming. The proposed meeting of new\r\nresearchers will provide a unique opportunity for these junior\r\nresearchers to exchange ideas and initiate contacts among themselves\r\nas well as provide them an opportunity to interact with the invited senior \r\nparticipants.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
