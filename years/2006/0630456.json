The Center's research projects will encompass\r\nthe Preparation and the Photocatalytic Reactivities of Nanostructured TiO2/Al2O3 Composites; the\r\nSyntheses and Studies of the Properties of Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes, Nanoporous\r\nMultifunctionalized Organosilicates, and Biofunctional Nanoscale Materials. The Center will\r\nsignificantly enhance the research capacity in nanotechnology at CAU by providing support for students,\r\ntechnical and administrative support for faculty, and upgrades to equipment for carrying out the research\r\nand education enterprise. CAU will provide salary support for a new faculty position in the area of\r\nnanotechnology. The Center will increase the number of talented minority students staying the course in\r\nthe science and technology pipeline by providing scholarships for promising high school students to enter\r\nthe program as Nano-scholars and by providing competitive stipend and tuition support for graduate\r\nstudents. The Center will allow CAU to leverage its participation in other NSF STC programs and extend\r\nopportunities for research in nanotechnology to undergraduate and graduate students.",
