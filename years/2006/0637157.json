 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop will take place from August 1-4, 2006 to identify important topics that EarthScope instructional materials should address and to engage members of the scientific and educational communities in developing instructional materials for secondary Earth science classrooms. This workshop will serve as a pilot project for engaging major stakeholders (scientists, teachers, curriculum developers, data providers, and EarthScope partner organizations) in teams to create quality educational materials on the topic of Cascadia, a focused geographic area of high scientific interest to EarthScope. A major result of this workshop will be a model for effectively presenting complex scientific principles, integrating EarthScope science into the educational community, and bringing individuals from the scientific and educational communities together to engage in EarthScope education and outreach endeavors. Following the workshop, curriculum developers from TERC will prepare one module for dissemination via the Earth Exploration Toolbook (EET). In addition, an executive report of the workshop will be prepared to aid in the development and implementation of similar EarthScope educational workshops in different regions in the future. A detailed evaluation plan has been established for this workshop involving data collection during and after the workshop on the impact of the workshop on teachers and scientists, strengths and weaknesses of the workshop, demographics of participants and teachers' student population, and student comprehension of instructional materials produced. The Plate Boundary Observatory Nucleus (PBO Nucleus) project at UNAVCO would lead this initiative in collaboration with Teachers on the Leading Edge, the EarthScope office, IRIS, and TERC.",
