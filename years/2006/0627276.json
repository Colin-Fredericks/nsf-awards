 "awd_abstract_narration": "Morgan State University (MSU) is advancing the fundamental scientific and technological knowledge necessary for the development new biological and chemical sensors for use in bioenvironmental research. This research is essential to the long-term success of Morgan's PhD in Bioenvironmental Sciences and Doctor of Engineering programs and will assist MSU's transition from a traditional undergraduate teaching institution to a doctoral-comprehensive research university. The interdisciplinary research projects are an outgrowth of previous NSF-RISE funding, which produced strong collaborations among researchers at Morgan in the School of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences, School of Engineering, and the University of Alabama at Huntsville. These research collaborations can potentially make major contributions to the\r\nfundamental understanding of the design and development of dual use biosensing systems for\r\nmonitoring the impact of environmental pollutants on urban and rural ecosystems, as well as for\r\nhomeland security applications. . A synergistic research program is being developed\r\nbased on the following subprojects: 1) Synthesis and modification of heptamethine near-Infrared\r\ndyes; 2) Development of a dual fluorescence lifetime biosensor; 3) Prediction of adhesion\r\nmolecule expression using a random walk technique; 4) Development of novel anion and amines\r\nsensors.",
