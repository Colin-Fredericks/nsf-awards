 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nSynthetic biology is the design and construction of new biological entities   such as enzymes, genetic circuits, and cells   or the redesign of existing biological systems. Synthetic biology builds on advances in molecular, cell, and systems biology and seeks to transform biology in the same way that synthesis transformed chemistry and integrated circuit design transformed computing. Just as engineers now design integrated circuits based on known physical properties of materials and then fabricate functioning circuits and entire processors (with relatively high reliability), synthetic biologists will soon design and fabricate biological entities to accomplish a particular task. To make this happen, biological materials properties (gene sequences, protein properties, natural genetic circuit design) must be formulated into a set of design rules that can then be used to engineer new biological entities.\r\nThe Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center (SynBERC) will lay the foundation for synthetic biology. The research program will develop the foundational understanding and technologies to build biological components and assemble them into an integrated system to accomplish a particular task. The Center's specific aims are 1) to develop a conceptual framework for designing small biological components (parts) that can be assembled into devices that will perform a well-characterized function under specified conditions, 2) to develop a small number of chasses (stable, robust bacterial hosts with known responses) to host the engineered devices and to assemble several devices to accomplish a larger vision or goal, 3) to develop a set of standards for the interactions of the parts and devices so that the devices can be built more readily and reproducibly, 4) to offer the parts, devices, and chasses as open source to other researchers and companies and 5) understand the biological and societal risks associated with synthetic biology and integrate these into the design process. These objectives will be achieved through four thrust areas in 1) Parts and Part Composition, 2) Devices and Device Composition, 3) Chassis Design, Construction, and Characterization, and 4) Societal Issues in Synthetic Biology. Two testbed applications will drive development of the thrusts. The resulting parts, devices, and chasses will be managed through a distributed web of Registries of Standard Biological Parts.\r\nSynBERC will offer a complementary education program that will 1) educate a new cadre of biological engineers capable of designing biological components, just as electrical engineers design and build integrated circuits, 2) educate the general public about the benefits and possible risks of synthetic biology, 3) educate public policy students and policy-makers about the benefits and real threats of synthetic biology, and 4) educate K-12 students about the opportunities offered by careers in science, engineering, and synthetic biology. Coupled with a strong outreach program to minority institutions and local community colleges and high schools, SynBERC will increase the participation of minority students in this emerging area and encourage high-school students to enter this exciting new area of engineering. \r\nThe new discipline, synthetic biology, will transform the biotechnology, high-technology, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries as well as suppliers of genetic tools and custom DNA synthesis companies. SynBERC will partner with key companies in these sectors to invite applications for and advice on our research program, to provide internships for undergraduate and graduate students, to speed technology transfer, and to develop SynBERC funding.\r\nIntellectual merit. Synthetic Biology will transform the field of biology into an engineering discipline by introducing into biology the concepts developed in other fields of engineering: ready access to off-the-shelf parts and devices with standard connections; a substrate onto which one can assemble the parts and devices and a power supply for the devices; standards for the basic components to enable their ready integration into a larger functional system; and open-source availability of parts, devices, and chasses. These developments will make the engineering of biology easier and more predictable. SynBERC brings together many of the pioneers (biologists and engineers from world-class institutions) of synthetic biology to work together to lay the foundation for this nascent field.\r\nBroader impacts. Synthetic biology (catalyzed by SynBERC) will transform the biotechnology, high-technology, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries, as well as suppliers of genetic tools and custom DNA synthesis companies. SynBERC will educate a new cadre of synthetic biologists and biological engineers capable of designing biological parts and useful biological systems. Finally, SynBERC's education program will provide general information on synthetic biology for the general public, in-depth offerings for public policy professionals, and motivational information on opportunities in higher education for K-12 students.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Intellectual Merit\nSynberc has defined Synthetic Biology as the design of novel - or the redesign of existing -biological systems for the purpose of producing outcomes that benefit society.  Examples of successful outcomes include microbes that sustainably produce biofuels or bio-based chemicals to replace those currently sourced from fossil fuels, or that produce new and inexpensive pharmaceuticals to combat current and emerging diseases, or microbes that can detect and destroy toxic chemical agents, or remediate polluted sites.  Beyond microbes, Synberc?s vision also includes pest resistant crops such as corn or soybeans that can fix atmospheric nitrogen so that they can grow in the absence of added fertilizers, and culturable human cells and organs that can be used to test the efficacy and safety of drugs and drug candidates in vitro, obviating the need for large scale animal testing.    Bio-based fuels or chemicals are generated from networks of enzymes that together produce a biosynthetic pathway.  Similarly, remediation or drug screening is also dependent on enzymes.  Enzymes are produced biologically from specific genes.  In most instances, therefore, successful outcomes will depend on assembling, in a desired host cell, a large network of synthetic or naturally occurring genes that may originate in different organisms, and designing systems to precisely control the expression of these genes so that the titers of the desired product, or the required internal enzyme levels for remediation or drug screening, will be predictably and reliably achieved.\nBy nature, biological systems are complex and unpredictable.  Over the years, however, microorganisms have been engineered to produce ethanol, or valuable drugs, or detect and degrade nerve agents, etc., but these biological engineering challenges have required long development times due, in large part, to our poor understanding of biological systems and to a lack of useful tools that would enable engineers to easily and predictably reprogram existing systems, as well as to build new enzymes, genetic circuits, and, eventually, whole cells.  Just as engineers use standardized parts and devices to build integrated circuits to achieve reliable output, Synberc embarked on the standardization of biological parts (genes), and devices (genes and their regulatory components), and their assembly into genetic circuits and networks to reduce the complexity of biological systems to achieve predictable and reliable research outcomes. \nBroader Impacts\nUnderstanding the risks that could be imposed through potential misuse of synthetic biology, Synberc developed a Human Practices component to both study issues related to safety and security.  We created an outreach program to engage with the public to provide awareness of the benefits and risks of this emerging technology and a diversity and inclusion program to encourage kindergarten through college level students to enter STEM fields.  We created both an Industrial Advisory Board composed of biotechnology companies, which grew to more than 40 members, as well as a Scientific and Strategic Advisory Board composed of experts in biology, chemistry, social sciences and security to provide input and guidance of our diverse research and communications agenda.   Starting in 206 with the assemblage of 10 leading investigators from five universities in the US, by 2016, this effort had grown to more than 500 people including 34 faculty members, their postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduates from more than 30 institutions.
