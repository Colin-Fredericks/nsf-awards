 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to use the Weather Research and Forecasting-Chemistry (WRF-CHEM) model to study the effects of aerosols and greenhouse gases (GHGs) on the atmospheric stratification (and consequent effects on dynamics/physics) over the Asian region. Sensitivity studies will be performed using this model to assess solar heating of the lower atmosphere in the presence of GHGs such as carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor, and tropospheric ozone, as well as aerosols, such as black carbon and dust.  Specifically, the sensitivity studies will seek to provide explanations for the following currently unresolved questions; i) do more aerosols or GHGs lead to an increase in the solar heating of the lower atmosphere; ii) does this increase the inversion (which inhibits convection) and thus contribute to the frequency and strength of pollution events; iii) which aerosols and GHGs affect thermal stability and precipitation processes the most; iv) do radiational effects or microphysical effects from aerosols have a greater impact on the forecast of precipitation; and finally, v) how much does the addition of interactive chemistry add to the forecast associated with the WRF model? From this study, the PI hopes to contribute to the development of the WRF-Chem model, and study the effect of aerosols and GHGs on the parameterization of precipitation and aerosol/radiative interaction over Asia.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: A graduate student will conduct this chemistry/meteorology research for her Ph.D. thesis under the guidance of the PI.   Improving predictions of weather and regional climate in Asia are significant for aiding this region with policy issues regarding impacts of air pollution on health and agriculture. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n",
