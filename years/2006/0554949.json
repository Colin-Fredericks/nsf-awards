 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with gathering perishable information and data about the basic features of the formal and the informal logistic systems supporting the recovery and the flows of critical and non-critical supplies to areas impacted by hurricane Katrina.  Prior research points to the challenges associated with setting up supply chains to an impacted site that fully account for immediate resource requirements, the range of supply sources and source mechanisms, as well as the management and prioritization of critical versus non-essential donations. This SGER project will (1) identify the basic features of the supply chains delivering resources to the Gulf Coast; (2) Gather data about the actual flows of critical and non-critical supplies; and (3) Document lessons learned, both positive and negative.  This research will provide future researchers with a clear picture of the supply chains in place at the site of an extreme event, which will enable the development of much needed decision support systems.  The proposed research involves multi-university collaborations between RPI and the University of Delaware.  It makes use of quick response data collected by the University of Delaware's Disaster Research Center in the weeks following the hurricane and leverages resources of Rensselaer's Center for Intermodal Freight Mobility and Security.",
