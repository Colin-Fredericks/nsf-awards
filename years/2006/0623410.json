Korzeniewicz\r\n          Natasha Sacouman\r\nInstitution: University of Maryland-College Park\r\n\r\nAssociational networks in poor communities often are described in the social science literature as being vertical and hierarchical.  As a consequence, according to this line of this interpretation, people in these communities are less likely to be prepared to be democratic citizens.  This study examines participation within a poor community in Argentina to challenge the predominant view that vertical-type associations always block democratic progress, and horizontal-type associations invariably foster democratization.  The study predicts  that \"vertical\" associations have the same, or even more, democratic potential as \"horizontal\" associations.  This research seeks to advance understanding of the effect of participation within associations and the role that vertical-type associations play in democratization processes in poor communities. Broader Impacts: The research has implications for understanding issues of democratic deficits in poor communities. The findings of the research will be analyzed to identify practices that deepen and broaden democracy in poor communities. \r\n",
