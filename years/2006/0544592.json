 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: Signal processing in the cells and circuits of somatosensory cortex.\r\n\r\nIn the real world, things change fast.  As such, many sensory systems in mammals are tuned for the detection of rapidly changing stimuli.  Here, the sense of touch in rodents is used to understand how the brain transforms rapidly changing stimuli into strong neuronal signals.    \r\n\r\nThis study explains how responses to fast sensory stimuli depend on:\r\n\tproperties of single neurons\r\n\tsynaptic interactions between multiple neurons\r\n\tchanges in these interactions induced by complex stimuli\r\n\tsuppression of unstable sensory responses\r\n\r\nThe project uses an innovative combination of experimental and mathematical techniques, including a novel application of real-time computing - connecting real neurons in a living brain slice to virtual neurons simulated on a computer.\r\n\r\nThe study will also provide a unique research experience for students at many levels.  Each of the research goals is accompanied by a specific educational vehicle to provide hands-on experience for students from high-school to graduate school.  The intent is to foster an educational atmosphere that breaks down barriers between biology and mathematics, education and discovery, research and play.\r\n\r\nBuilding the bridge from biophysics to behavior requires the development of new ideas and new techniques, such as those used here.  More importantly, the best hope for the future lies in training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists. For it is they who will carry the research forward, using the tools developed today for tomorrow's treatment of brain disorders and cognitive dysfunction.\t\r\n \r\n",
