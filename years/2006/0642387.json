 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds to support the efforts of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) will be used to promote undergraduate research and education.  Over the next several years (2007, 2008, 2009), the ASBMB National meetings will host two events, a symposium featuring the research of three undergraduate faculties and three undergraduates and the \"Classroom of the Future\", which will greatly strengthen the understanding of undergraduate training.  The classroom of the future symposium presents solutions to many challenges of the educator, including how to engage large classes in the excitement of science, integrate the quantitative aspects of science, effectively, and prepare students to think critically rather than \"memorize\" information.  Speakers for the Classroom of the Future symposium are chosen for both their demonstrated ability and commitment to undergraduate education and research.  Funding helps the society to disseminate research on classroom learning and supplement travel expenses.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: In addition to promoting undergraduate research in a wide variety of institutions and helping educators learn how to actively engage and attract students into the life sciences, efforts of ASBMB will provide opportunities for minorities to present their research.  Some speakers at the symposium will be selected from Minority-Serving universities or members of a minority group currently under-represented in science; the Minority Affairs Council of the ASBMB will assist with selection of these speakers.\r\n\r\n",
