 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes the development of a Non-Contact Stereo Mini-Micrometer (SMM) for remote visual inspection (RVI) applications. The proposed device will be used as a complementary tool that can be delivered through the instrument channel of conventional endoscopes to provide quantitative 3D evaluations of difficult-to-access internal cavities. The SMM will utilize a traditional triangulation stereo-measurement technique, but unlike the well-known method that produces stereo-images with two identical optical systems, the stereo-pair in SMM will be introduced via a single objective lens and a tilting, optically transparent plate in a MEMS configuration. The proposed approach will allow the outside diameter of the device to be downsized, will simplify the measurement algorithm, and will dramatically reduce the cost.\r\n\r\nThe major applications of the SMM will be in the remote visual quantitative evaluation of difficult-to-access cavities in a variety of industrial systems. The primary uses will be in the non-destructive evaluation of aircraft, spacecraft, transportation, electrical power production, and heavy machinery, and in all areas where endoscopic RVI quality assurance and/or scheduled maintenance is required. The second broad area of application is in manufacturing, where intermediate and end product quantitative on-line evaluations are required, but the areas to be inspected are not accessible with traditional optical micrometers.\r\n",
