 "awd_abstract_narration": "A common feature of my proposals is the use of algebro-geometric\r\ndegeneration to study an interesting irreducible variety in terms of\r\nthe many components it breaks into in a limit. Such degenerations are \r\nusually very destructive of the geometry, but the original and limiting\r\nschemes may define the same (equivariant) cohomology class in some\r\nambient space. The degenerations I intend to study are (1) of moduli\r\nspaces of representations of quivers, where the type A case has become\r\nwell understood in the last three years but types D,E are totally open;\r\n(2) of nilpotent orbits in Lie algebras, to the normal cones of their\r\nupper triangular part. The homology of the upper triangular part \r\ncarries a (Springer) representation of the corresponding Weyl group;\r\nthe normal cone I study has more components and, in the example\r\nI can compute so far, carries a representation of a richer algebra;\r\n(3) of subvarieties of projective space to reduced schemes with\r\nfinite maps to projective space, where the degree of the map carries\r\nthe information more usually seen in the nonreduced structure \r\nof the limit subscheme.\r\n\r\nIf we replace a polynomial equation, like xy = zw, by one of its\r\nmonomials, like xy = 0, the locus of solutions can often be made to\r\nretain the same volume even as it breaks into pieces.  Where xy=zw has\r\ninteresting nonflat geometry, but cannot be factored into pieces, xy=0\r\nhas interesting discrete structure (it has two pieces, x=0 and y=0,\r\nwhich intersect one another) even though each piece is flat.\r\nIn the general setup, we have many polynomial conditions to begin with, \r\nand each is degenerated\" to a simpler polynomial containing only some of\r\nthe original monomials; a complicated condition guarantees that the\r\ndimension and volume of the solution set remains constant.\r\nIn my work I study these degenerations where the ambient space is a\r\nspace of (lists of) matrices, and the original equations are natural \r\nmatrix conditions like \"matrices whose square is zero\". The difficulty \r\ncomes in finding degenerations that preserve the dimension and volume,\r\nand then studying the resulting equations to understand the simpler\r\npieces into which the degenerate locus factors. The resulting discrete\r\nstructure is then of great interest combinatorially, and sheds light\r\non the (topologically important) volume of the original locus.\r\n",
