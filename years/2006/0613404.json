 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding an adaptive and learning computing system such as the brain requires an understanding of the computations performed by its basic components individual neurons. At the single neuron level, the dendritic tree provides the means for interpreting spatiotemporal activity patterns of synaptic input. However, no comprehensive framework exists for translating dendritic features into a functional architecture that can be related directly to behavior. Our goal is to develop rules for how dendritic structure and synapse distributions follow functional architecture principles that relate directly to a neuron's individual behavioral requirements. In holometabolous insects, like the moth Manduca sexta, the structure, physiology and function of individually identifiable neurons are modified in parallel during metamorphosis, allowing for studies that directly relate structure and behavioral function. This remodeling has been described in particular detail for the motoneuron MN5, which transforms from a tonically firing larval crawling motoneuron into a phasically firing adult flight motoneuron. In this collaborative research effort, Dr. Sharon Crook and Dr. Carsten Duch will combine experimental and computational approaches to investigate the function of the structural and synaptic remodeling of MN5 for its changing behavioral role. We will also test Cajal's Neuron Doctrine, which envisions the neuron as the smallest functional entity, by examining the computational and functional independence of dendritic sub-domains. Another important aspect of our modeling studies is that we will investigate the roles of excitatory/inhibitory input synapse ratios and distributions in single neuron computation. Excitatory/inhibitory imbalances are known to contribute to several neurological diseases. The use of Manduca provides a unique model system where one neuron has completely different geometries, each of which is associated with dramatically different firing outputs. The results will contribute significantly to our understanding of single neuron computation, which is an important step towards understanding neural networks.",
