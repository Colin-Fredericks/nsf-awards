 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for junior scientists - postdocs and students - to participate in the 2006 Nuclear Chemistry Gordon Research Conference (NCGRC).\r\n\r\nA primary objective of the NCGRC is to provide the international community of nuclear scientists with a unique forum where the most recent developments and results in the field can be presented, extensively discussed and criticized. This years agenda follows the long tradition of (i) promoting critical discussions of the primary scientific issues in the field, (ii) encouraging new and explaratory ideas for future research, (iii) ensuring that discussions facilitate vigorous and open interactions between seasoned scientists, junior scientists and students. These goals will be achieved via the participation of a significant number of the leaders in this field, (including internationally recognized senior scientists) and the young and rising stars reflected in the population of graduate students and recent graduates.\r\n\r\nThe participation of younger scientists in the NCGRC is crucial to the continued vitality and manpower needs of nuclear science. Therefore, bright and promising postdoctoral researchers and graduate students have been selected for participation and are being encouraged [on several fronts] to attend and present their ideas. Their participation will undoubtedly provide them with unique and extensive access to the leaders in their field, expose them to new research opportunities and techniques and help prepare them for the leadership roles they will undoubtedly assume in the future. The program of the NCGRC includes the full participation of a diverse group of young scientists including underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\n",
