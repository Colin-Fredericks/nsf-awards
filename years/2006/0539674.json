 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project introduces a new infrared sensor technology for the detection and measurement of methane (CH4) and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) to measure the performance and control the operation of anaerobic digesters and - low to zero-emissions - power generators (e.g. microturbines and fuel cells). The proprietary technology will maximize the recovery of biogas, monitor the correlation between biogas quality (methane content) and power output, in real-time, and  optimize the biogas conversion efficiency. The implementation of this innovative technology in farms (biogas from livestock manure), waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), landfills and food manufacturing and processing plants will improve the value, cost competitiveness and reliability of biogas-to-electricity systems,\r\nand reduce the emissions of methane (CH4), a major contributor to Global Climate Change.\r\n\r\nThe technology will provide end users (e.g. farmers and operators of WWTP and landfills), the scientific community and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) a technology that delivers the relevant and adjustable parameters affecting the output of biogas-to-electricity systems. The collection of biogas for green power generation will decrease the risk of gas migration and explosions, and reduce the costs associated with environmental control and compliance.\r\n",
