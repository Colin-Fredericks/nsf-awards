Goddard, III, Co-Investigator, Caltech\r\nNagarajan Vaidehi, Co-Investigator, Caltech\r\nJames W. Canary, Co-Investigator, New York University\r\n\r\nGoals and Intellectual Merit:  The goal of this project is to use DNA nanotechnology we have developed to construct a ribosome-like nanoscale machine that can be used to convert a collection of organic monomers to polymers (~30mers) with precisely defined composition, sequence, and properties.  Thus, we wish to be able to make novel polymers for a variety of purposes with the same level of specificity and control that the cell uses to make proteins of defined sequences that lead to particular functions.  In addition to assembling polymers with novel features, our approach will allow the construction of molecules that reflect the history of a biochemical logic program, leading ultimately to a reflexive chemical synthetic system that builds constructs responsive to signals reflecting the environment of system. For the exploratory research proposed here, we will demonstrate the following proofs of principle: [1] The Seeman laboratory will demonstrate a primitive translation device with a fixed message; this device will simplify prototyping and trouble-shooting the use and coupling of pendant polymer components within the system. [2] The Goddard-Vaidehi laboratory will use first principles computational methods to optimize the reactants, the products, and the transition state of coupling reactions to enable the design of DNA templates with correct spacings to fit the transition state of the polymerization reaction. [3] The Canary laboratory will demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to remove polymers from the DNA in the DNA to template polymers.\r\n\r\nWe have already developed a sequence dependent rotary device that prototypes the translation of information from one chemical state to another, translating DNA signals into independent DNA sequences.  Now, we wish to extend this translational capability to build molecules whose implementation is of practical value, for example, non-linear optical devices.  We expect that the capability to make polymers with precisely defined segments of varied chemical properties to constitute a revolutionary step towards controlling the structure of matter at the polymer level, including precise control of polymer properties.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: All of the investigators work closely with minority graduate students; such interactions are particularly well-established at Caltech.  In addition, all train high school or undergraduate students in their laboratories. These activities enhance and further student careers through close interaction with faculty and research scientists. The NYU investigators have established a well-attended nanotechnology discussion group now in its fourth year that is well-attended by students and scientists from the NYC area. Seeman works closely with scientifically-oriented arts and entertainment groups, and is currently serving as the president of the newly-founded International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation, and Engineering. It seeks to provide a scientific home for nanotechnology scientists and students, so that they may obtain the recognition and support not readily available from societies founded on traditional disciplines.\r\n\r\n",
