 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes several problems in arithmetic\r\ngeometry and transcendental number theory that explore the arithmetic\r\nnature of special values of analytic functions.  In one project, the\r\ninvestigator plans to study transcendence and algebraic independence of\r\nnumbers in positive characteristic arising from Anderson-Drinfeld motives. \r\nThese transcendence questions are closely connected to Galois groups \r\nof Frobenius difference equations, and in particular the investigator\r\nproposes to pursue the interaction between transcendence theory and Galois\r\ntheory to study function field multiple zeta values, periods and logarithms \r\nof Drinfeld modules, and higher dimensional versions.  The investigator \r\nproposes to study Fourier coefficients of modular forms and their relationships \r\nwith finite field hypergeometric functions and Calabi-Yau manifolds.  He \r\nplans also to discover arithmetic properties of the extension groups of elliptic \r\ncurves and their connections with Galois representations.\r\n\r\nOne of the fundamental branches of modern mathematics, number theory\r\nserves as the basis for many applications, including cryptography and\r\ncoding theory.  The proposed research considers questions involving the\r\ninterplay between arithmetic and analytic aspects of number theory, which \r\nhave their beginnings in classical work of Euler and Gauss and which continue \r\nto have important implications today to the essential understanding of problems \r\nboth in number theory and in many other branches of mathematics.  Several parts \r\nof the project lead naturally to problems for graduate and undergraduate research.\r\n",
