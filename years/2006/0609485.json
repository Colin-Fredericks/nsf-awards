 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop efficient multi-photon absorption photoreactive materials, such as two-photon absorption polymerization photoinitiators. The approach is to utilize the unique non-linear optical properties of semiconductor nanoparticles for multiphoton light harvesting and funnel the energy or photogenerated charges to selected organic species that initiate polymerization reactions.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe potential impact of the proposed work is to address a number of fundamental scientific issues related to the use of semiconductor nanoparticles as light harvesting materials in hybrid inorganic-organic chemical reaction photoinitiators. The main scientific achievement would be a successful demonstration of a novel nanoengineering technology starting from basic building blocks and up to fabrication of complex \"large nanostructures.\"\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThis work would have a broad impact in many areas of modern society such as the creation of novel, efficient materials for high precision nanolithography and the development of novel drug delivery systems controlled by a tissue-penetrating laser beam. Such materials will push nanofabrication technologies toward consumer market by reducing the cost and enhancing the functionality of building blocks. It will also contribute to general nanoscience paradigms by demonstration of multi-level design and intelligent fabrication of nanostructures. The research proposed will also have a positive impact on the education. Besides providing invaluable multidisciplinary experience for the postdocs, graduate, and undergraduate students involved into the project, it will enrich academic curriculum at UCSB, enable K-12 teachers to gain hands-on experience in materials synthesis and characterization, modern technology, and nanoscience and pass it to students\r\n",
