Speakers are to be chosen by Federal representatives to the MATES IWG-- the Multi Agency Tissue Engineering Science Interagency Working Group.  The World Technology Evaluation Center (WTEC) is to provide logistical support for the workshop and produce a written report from the workshop in hardcopy and electronic form within two months after the workshop, and make it available to the public via the Web. The workshop is to assemble some of the world's leading experts in stem cell research and regenerative medicine/tissue engineering in the U.S. and abroad to exchange information on current research, research themes, and funding initiatives. These participants will be identified by bibliometrics and in consultation with experts in the U.S. Government.\r\n\r\nThe proposed activity will communicate the results for the benefit of the public via reports on paper and posted on public websites. The workshop results will themselves be beneficial, and may lay the groundwork for an on-site assessment of international research in the field. The workshop is to be held at NSF in the late Fall of 2006. Information generated at this workshop may be useful for planning purposes for the MATES IWG and the Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology (BEB) Programs in the Bioengineering and Environmental Systems (BES) Division of NSF, and will be distilled into a report for NSF and the MATES IWG.\r\n",
