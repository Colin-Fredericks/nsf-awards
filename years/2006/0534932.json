 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates a new dynamic, adaptable approach for constructing\r\nevaluation metrics and methods for various NLP applications, with a specific\r\nfocus on Machine Translation and Summarization.  The main objective is to\r\nestablish a general framework that can easily support constructing automatic\r\nevaluation metrics for a variety of specific NLP tasks and based on a variety\r\nof quality criteria.  For a given NLP task (e.g.  Machine Translation) and a\r\ngiven set of established quality criteria, the framework supports learning a\r\nset of parameters that result in an \"instance\" evaluation metric that has\r\noptimal correlation with the desired quality criteria.  Training a new\r\n\"instance\" metric for a different task, or for a different set of quality\r\ncriteria, can be accomplished by a fast training procedure using available\r\ntraining data consisting of system produced outputs, human-quality reference\r\noutputs for the same source data, and human quality judgments for the system\r\noutputs.\r\n\r\nA powerful new innovation of the new framework is its ability to use the set\r\nof all overlapping sub-sequences (also known as \"skip ngrams\") of the two\r\nstrings being compared.  The process of skip n-gram matching is augmented with\r\na powerful word-to-word alignment algorithm that pre-constrains the set of\r\nskip n-gram matches, while allowing matches between words that are\r\nmorphological variants, synonyms or otherwise related.  Furthermore, our\r\nframework uses a well-founded parameterized model for establishing the weight\r\nor significance that should be assigned to each detected overlapping\r\nsubsequence, and can calculate these weights as an integral process during the\r\ndetection of the matching skip ngrams.  The result is an extremely powerful\r\n\"metric-producing\" framework.  Under this framework, the project will produce\r\n(instantiate) specific metrics for machine translation, summarization, and\r\nother NLP tasks, that are more robust, sensitive, and have high-levels of\r\ncorrelation with human judgments.  The project also explores methods for\r\nreducing the reliance of our resulting metrics on human judgments.  The\r\nresulting framework and task-specific trained metrics will be made publicly\r\navailable to the NLP research community.  The impact of automatic evaluation\r\nmethods extends beyond providing a flexible performance measuring mechanism\r\nfor NLP tasks.  We expect our work to enable customizing evaluation metrics\r\nfor specific tasks within a variety of cross-lingual applications, which\r\nshould significantly boost the overall performance of these applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
