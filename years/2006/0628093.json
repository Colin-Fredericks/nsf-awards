 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flexible and efficient management of resources is imperative in the air interface and backhaul network, given the many challenges including the limited radio spectrum, high cost of radio access networks, volatile wireless channel conditions, and diverse and demanding QoS requirements. This research develops a comprehensive resource management framework for supporting both circuit-switched and packet-switched traffic seamlessly over an (initially CDMA-based) radio access system. Specific goals include studying the fundamental resource-allocation problems in the air interface and IP-RAN, understanding and incorporating the many interactions while implementing resource management, and trading-off optimality with control and management overhead.  This work is part of a broad and ambitious effort to fundamentally advance the understanding of the inter-dependency between different network layers and systems. Specific research results will include the development of new cross layer design and optimization techniques, and the enhancement of QoS and energy efficiency at various layers. The growth of powerful multimedia services over wireless terminals is having a profound impact on societies across the world. The practical implication of this research is to facilitate the integration of these services with the Internet, and to enable their seamless delivery over different wireless devices. In turn, these services can be deployed with lower cost, and with increased reach and quality. Finally, this research brings novel wireless networking projects into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum.\r\n",
