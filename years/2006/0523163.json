 "awd_abstract_narration": "The program addresses fundamental needs for an innovative solution to developing a new process for ultrasonically stimulated deposition of nanoparticles or quantum dots (QDs) on flat substrates such as bio-marker luminescent panels for early cancer detection. The objective of the proposed research is to improve the performance of bio-marker panels by increasing the luminous efficiency of the QDs and enhancing the methods for panel fabrication. The work will focus on the key aspects of the experimental approach utilizing ultrasound treatment (UST) applied to a new generation of luminescence nanoparticles with optical properties controlled by the particle size, shape, and surface. QDs are highly promising for biomedical application because of the advantages they offer over conventional organic dyes in terms stability, color tenability, and ease of control.  UST will be used (a) to densify and homogeneously distribute the bio-conjugated QDs by applying ultrasound during deposition onto the flat substrates, (b) to accomplish defect engineering of nanoparticle material itself by enhancing luminous efficiency, and (c) to adjust the size and size distribution of nanoparticles. Upon completion, the program will benefit and promote state-of-the-art nano-manufacturing approach in cancer prevention research and clinics using ultrasound. \r\n\r\nThe project is designed as an NSF-CONACyT collaborative program between research teams University of South Florida (USF, Sergei Ostapenko), University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC, Jin Z. Zhang) and National Polytechnic Institute of Mexico (NPI, Tetyana V. Torchynska). The USF team (S. Ostapenko) offers access and expertise in experimental methodology based on the ultrasound processing of electronic materials/devices. The patented UST apparatus is not available commercially and presents a state-of-the-art research tool. Dr. Zhang (UCSC) has been actively involved in the synthesis, characterization, and exploitation of applications of doped and undoped semiconductor nanoparticles for biomedical applications. The group in Mexico is experienced in theoretical modeling and diagnostics of luminescent nanomaterials including quantum dots, quantum wires, and nanocrystals.\r\n\r\nThe program will have broader impact to universities and society. It will assist in further developing the university infrastructure toward a goal of building a strong research program in nano-manufacturing. The program features international and interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers in academia (USA and Mexico) and professionals in biology and medicine through participation of researchers in Moffitt Cancer Center. The exchange of research personnel and graduate students within the NSF-CONACyT program will strongly facilitate mutual transfer of advanced knowledge and promote student training and education. Strong undergraduate student involvement in the project is planned, particularly women and underrepresented minorities. Universities have recently established a mechanism to involve high-school teachers and K-12 students to the research performed in the labs within Research Experience for Teachers (RET) and GK-12 programs. A follow-up transfer of experimental methods among the participating institutions is anticipated. Joint publications in referred journals and conference proceedings will be submitted, including NSF grantees' conference. \r\n",
