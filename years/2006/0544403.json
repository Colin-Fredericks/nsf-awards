 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants are the key components of the biosphere, essential for the survival of life on this planet. They provide food, fuel, building materials, oxygen and environmental clean up tools. Even with recent advances in plant biology, many processes such as plant development remain poorly understood.  Current molecular biological technologies allow genetic modification of plants to change or add desired characteristics such as pest and pathogen resistance, increased agricultural yield or production of inexpensive drugs or vaccines for the developing world. Thus, an understanding of plant developmental processes is of vital importance. In this project, the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana will be used to identify molecular components involved in root growth and stem gravity sensing.  The genes under study in this project are conserved across the plant groups making it likely that results from this work will be applicable to other plants including those of agricultural importance. The long-term benefits that could result from this research may, for example, include the production of super gravitropic plants that could produce straight stems under poor or uneven illumination or plants with longer roots that would be better adapted to dry soils. Furthermore, this project will provide research opportunities and training for both undergraduate and graduate students.",
