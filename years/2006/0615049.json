 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this new award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the work of Professor Lyle D. Isaacs of the Chemistry Department at the University of Maryland, College Park, MD.  This research will investigate the use of cucurbit[10]uril (CB[10]), the largest cucurbit[n]uril known, as a molecular container in aqueous solution.  In particular, the use of CB[10] as molecular chaperone to control the folding of melamine oligomers into well-defined conformations will be explored.  In addition, complexes between CB[10] and cationic (metallo)porphyrins will be prepared and their use in forming termolecular complexes with suitable molecular guests will be investigated. The CB[10]-porphyrin complexes will also be applied as catalysts for oxidation reactions in water.  This project will also investigate the possibility of allosteric control of the macromolecular conformation of cationic calixarenes inside CB[10] by the introduction of small molecules.  \r\n\r\nThese experiments will evaluate the potential for cucurbiturils to function as real-world molecular containers for applications such as drug delivery. This project will foster the training of students at all academic levels, including a number from underrepresented groups, as interdisciplinary scientists.\r\n",
