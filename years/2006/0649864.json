 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a workshop to identify research directions relevant to the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS) and NSF's Global Environment for Networking Innovations (GENI).  GENI is a critical emerging arena of technical innovation that can benefit from existing and projected IIS-related research, and that can create new needs and opportunities for IIS-related investigations.  The workshop will fill a critical niche in examining and surfacing many areas of joint concern and opportunity between networking research and such areas as information integration, intelligent systems, and human-computer interaction.  It will seek the most intellectually rewarding and productive directions in these areas, reviewing, analyzing, and finding ways to extend current research by IIS-supported communities to incorporate and support the goals and new possibilities of the GENI program.  The broader impacts of this work include potentially greater effectiveness, breadth of impact, and cross-community integration of the results of the GENI initiative itself; potentially more usable, manageable, societally-productive, cost-effective and efficient technologies for network design and application; and potentially wider application of novel networking technologies and capabilities for large-scale, distributed, and intelligent information discovery, management, and analysis tools and theories.",
