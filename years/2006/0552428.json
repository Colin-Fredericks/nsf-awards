 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Florida Mental Health Institute at USF conducts a 9-week summer REU on social and behavioral research within the context of the mental health and substance abuse service systems. The objectives are to: (1) provide an intensive research experience for 45 undergraduate students over a three year period; (2) provide a mentored research experience with a multidisciplinary perspective on social and behavioral health across multiple service systems; and (3) increase student knowledge of ethical issues in research. REU students participate in three primary activities: (1) mentored research project; (2) research seminar series; and (3) training in research ethics. Intellectual Merit - Given the increasing prevalence of mental and addictive disorders and the burden these conditions cause worldwide, the FMHI REU focuses on an important societal problem. Because it has become necessary to provide behavioral health services in multiple systems (criminal justice, education, mental health, and social welfare), new approaches to research are needed that cross disciplinary lines. FMHI's multidisciplinary approach focusing on issues across the lifespan and across multiple service systems makes FMHI a unique site for an REU. Students will conduct research in areas of critical societal need and learn first hand the relationship of research to policy and system enhancements. FMHI faculty are national leaders in the field and students will have access to these experts through the mentorship, seminar series, research rotations, and ethics training events. Broader Impacts - The combination of focused didactic techniques and hands-on research experiences provides an intense research experience for undergraduates which will well prepare the next generation of researchers for graduate school and behavioral and social science research careers. The REU experience allows students to conduct research with faculty working on national studies in critical topics that have a direct impact on the basic social and behavioral science fields and on the applied services and policy sector. It also contributes to improved teaching techniques through innovative approaches to ethics training, group ethics projects, a research rotation, and innovative teaching strategies used in research seminars. By recruiting students from Historically Black Colleges & Universities (HCBU), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI), and Tribal Colleges, the REU site broadens participation of underrepresented groups. All 45 students are expected to submit papers for consideration to: (a) state, regional, and national conferences; (b) undergraduate research conferences; (c) peer-reviewed journals. Students who have their paper accepted for presentation will receive financial support from the REU for their travel and conference registration fees. The REU includes an extensive evaluation component that will allow the faculty to identify effective teaching/learning practices and disseminate the results to others through journal articles and conference presentations.",
