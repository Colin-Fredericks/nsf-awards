Reynolds\r\nCarnegie Mellon University\r\n\r\nReasoning about Shared Structure and Concurrency\r\n\r\nThe specification and verification of computer programs is investigated, along with the semantics needed to insure the soundness of verification.  Of specific interest are:\r\n\r\nSeparation Logic, which treats programs employing shared mutable data structures or shared-variable concurrency.  The goal is to extend the logic to high-level languages using safe type systems and automatic\r\nstorage reclamation, and also to machine-level languages permitting pointers to code to be embedded within data structures.\r\n\r\nGrainless Semantics, which treats shared-variable concurrency without imposing any default level of atomic operations, by regarding race conditions (i.e., simultaneous access to the same storage by concurrent\r\nprocesses) as catastrophic events.  The goal is to simplify the understanding of programs by avoiding useless distinctions between programs with unacceptable behavior.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research is that it will substantially increase the domain of discourse of separation logic, and facilitate soundness arguments for this and other logics for shared-variable\r\nconcurrency.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact is that it will become easier to avoid errors in an important class of useful but difficult computer programs.  Eventually, it should be possible to automate proof-checking in the logic so that\r\nprograms in this class can be accompanied by    machine-checkable proofs of their correctness.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
