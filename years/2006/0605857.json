These\r\nmechanisms have been the subject of considerable study lately\r\nbecause it is crucial to understand whether the forces between\r\ngranular particles propagate in a manner that can be described\r\nunder an elliptic, hyperbolic, or parabolic framework.  The\r\nstarting point of this project is development of large scale\r\ndiscrete element simulations that are used to analyze response of\r\ndense granular systems to space- and time-dependent\r\nperturbations.  The results of the simulations are then employed\r\nto help formulate effective models for bridging the scales\r\nbetween micro (grain scale) and meso (hundreds or thousands of\r\ngrains) descriptions of granular systems.  Both static and\r\ndynamic granular systems are considered, making it possible to\r\nanalyze the interplay between granular dynamics and signal\r\npropagation.  This setup also allows for considering some\r\nimportant features of dense granular flows, such as the role of\r\nforce anisotropy and underlying microstructure. The project is\r\ncarried out in close collaboration with experimental work\r\nperformed at Duke University.\r\n\r\n     Dense granular systems are one of the most challenging\r\nsystems in the field of soft condensed matter, in particular\r\nbecause they are subject to jamming, and fall in between solid\r\nand liquid states of matter.  Analysis of signal propagation\r\nthrough these systems allows us to understand how granularity on\r\na micro scale influences macroscale behavior.  The novel research\r\ntechniques used here also can be applied to other soft condensed\r\nmatter systems that experience jamming, such as emulsions,\r\ncolloids, gels, and foams.  In addition, signal propagation\r\nthrough granular systems is of considerable importance in a\r\nnumber of practical problems including oil recovery,\r\nvibrofluidized beds, and some important humanitarian efforts,\r\nsuch as detection of land mines.  The project addresses basic\r\nissues in statics and dynamics of dense granular systems;\r\nunderstanding of these basic concepts allows for future progress\r\nin developing better models needed for numerous applications of\r\ngranular materials.",
