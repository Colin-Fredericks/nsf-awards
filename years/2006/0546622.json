 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n0546622\r\nAmy Langville\r\nCollege of Charleston\r\n\r\nUpdating Problems in Information Retrieval and a Mathematical Dissection Lab\r\n\r\nThis proposal is about information retrieval, the field of organizing information in order to retrieve\r\ndocuments relating to a specific information need. Information retrieval is divided into two categories: re-\r\ntrieval from web collections and retrieval from smaller, nonlinked document collections, called traditional\r\ncollections. Both types of retrieval, web and traditional, share at least one common problem: the updating\r\nproblem. Any time a document collection changes, which inevitably happens often as documents are mod-\r\nified, added, or deleted, several items must be updated, including performance measures, storage files, and\r\nmemory pointers. Of the many types of updating problems, this proposal deals with mathematical updating\r\nproblems. A mathematical updating problem for web retrieval that has impact for any application, such as\r\npopulation modeling, webpage ranking, graph theoretic measures, and email analysis, that uses the domi-\r\nnant eigenvector of a large, sparse, nonnegative matrix will be studied. For traditional information retrieval,\r\nthe project will study an updating problem regarding the so-called nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF),\r\nwhich has impact on the many other fields to which the NMF has been applied including image processing,\r\nfingerprint query processing, music processing, signal processing, movie animations, machine learning, data\r\nmining, and summary extraction for audio and video data. This research will be enhanced by a partnership\r\nwith SAS Institute, Inc.\r\nThe Education Phase of this project proposes the design and implementation of a Mathematical Device\r\nDissection Lab. The proposed lab, which is similar in spirit to the mechanical dissection labs found in many\r\nengineering schools, aims to solve a common problem with students perception of mathematics: students\r\nthink mathematics is merely about calculation, not concepts. To remedy this, the proposed lab allows\r\nstudents to dissect in a hands-on, interactive manner virtual mathematical devices that demonstrate the\r\nuse of fundamental concepts. The lab requires self-study by groups of students, and as such, mimics the\r\nresearch skills needed in the real world. This lab relates to the Research Phase of this project as three of\r\nthe labs nine modules will come from the above research in information retrieval. Each module describes\r\na virtual mathematical device. Examples include least squares, the vector space model of information\r\nretrieval, and Googles method of ranking webpages. All modules must be able to be described in low\r\ndimensional space, so that students can visualize the ideas, after which point, they will understand the\r\npower of mathematics to enable extensions to higher dimensional space. Modules also contain a scientific\r\ncomputation component as the students extend the simple models to much larger problems. Each module\r\nwill be posted on a website, making the modules available for worldwide dissemination and adaptation. In\r\naddition, the lab will be used in several outreach projects. One of the labs goals is to change students\r\nattitudes towards mathematics by demystifying the process of mathematical invention, showing them that\r\nmathematics is more than mere calculation, it is a creative process with broad applications.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This CAREER award contained two major components: a research component and an educational component.  There were several products or outcomes associated with each. The research component dealt with the problem of ranking, for which there is information about a set of items (e.g., products on Amazon, movies on Netflix, NCAA teams, political candidates, etc.) that must be used to create a ranked list of the items from best to worst.  The work for this award focused mainly on the problem of ranking in text collections, such as a traditional print media or the Web.  Several papers describe my work, but the most enduring is probably the book, Google's PageRank &amp; Beyond: The Science of Search Engine Rankings, which first appeared in hardback in 2006, and paperback in 2012 and has been translated into Japanese, Greek, and Russian.  A second book, on ranking more generally, appeared recently in 2012 and is titled \"Who's #1?: The Science of Rating and Ranking.\"  This grant and its research also supported and mentored several graduate students and resulted in 4 M.S. thesis and 2 B.S. theses.  Another notable product associated with this award is a module in SIAM's WhyDoMath? website.  We created a module that explains, to a non-technical audience, how Google's method for ranking webpages works.  This module also contains a 20-minute video that explains Google's famous PageRank algorithm to a general audience.\n \nSeveral similar modules were created for the educational component of this CAREER award.  These modules are meant to help students \"dissect\" mathematical ideas as they might dissect an everyday appliance to figure out how it works.  They range in topics from understanding fractals to the search engine at your local public library.  In addition, the success and limitations of these modules inspired the start of a textbook, tentatively titled \"An Illustrated Guide to Calculus\" to continue, expand, and spread the best of this \"dissection\", hands-on, project-based approach to teaching mathematics.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/26/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Amy N Langville"
