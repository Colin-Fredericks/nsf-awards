 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Institutional Transformation Award Program at Brown University is to increase the level of opportunity for faculty and implement mechanisms to protect and nurture faculty success.  The program will provide transparent formal programs to provide the ingredients for success often available informally, to guarantee access for women faculty. This will ensure that once recruited women faculty will have a working environment that will allow them to achieve their full potential and ultimately assume positions of power.  The ADVANCE program at Brown will include 1) a leadership program for women science faculty that will help them to develop peer networks and assume leadership positions, 2) a faculty development program for all faculty part of which will be a mentoring program designed to create a cadre of faculty informed about gender equity issues, 3) a department chair training program aimed at improving departmental climate and making departmental policies fair and transparent, and 4) a visiting scholar program that will bring experts to Brown to design model programs for the above.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  One of the goals of the program is to demonstrate that providing access to formal transparent faculty development programs ameliorates the problems of hidden bias and evens the playing field between male and female faculty.  The program is expected to have the following specific outcomes:  1) reduce faculty attrition, including attrition of women and minority faculty; 2) increase the number of women promoted to full professor; 3) decrease the time in rank of associate professors; 4) increase the number of women rising to leadership positions in either academic administration or areas of scholarly leadership; 5) prevent mid-career burnout by encouraging collaborative projects and brokering opportunities for science faculty to become involved in such projects;  6) increase the amount of funded research by alerting faculty to potential opportunities.  All of these potential outcomes will provide a return on investment for academic institutions. \r\n\r\nScientific Merit:  Collecting indicator data for the proposed program and disseminating it to the community will represent a significant contribution to understanding the barriers that inhibit the advancement of women scientists.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the ADVANCE program is to contribute to the development of a national science and engineering academic workforce that includes the full participation of women in all levels of faculty and academic/administration, particularly at the senior academic ranks, through the transformation of institutional practices, policies, climate and culture. \r\n",

These mechanisms included faculty mentoring, tools for grant writing for external funding, and tools for becoming leaders in academic and scientific communities.  Our overall goal was institutional transformation by utilizing the social science literature on gender equity in resources provided to department chairs and administrators in order to ensure the retention and advancement of women and minority faculty in STEM departments.\n\nADVANCE at Brown University consisted of four components briefly outlined below along with their outcomes.\n\nLeadership Program for Women Scientists\n\n\nThe Leadership Program for Women Scientists provided funding to enable women science faculty to advance their careers to the next level.  These award programs allowed for new collaborations with peers and mentors (Career Development Awards); provided support to ensure that women scientists? research continued while they held national roles of scientific leadership (Scientific Leadership Awards); and enabled women faculty to offer seminars at universities and conferences (Travel Grants). Outcomes of this component included &gt;20 seed grants awarded to women faculty to initiate new research projects and collaborations, which ultimately led to an order-of-magnitude increase in external funding by the participants. In addition, faculty engaged in leadership roles including department chairs, center directorships, and elected positions within their respective professional societies.\n\nFaculty Development Programs\n\n\nFaculty Development Programs sought to provide faculty with fair and transparent access to resources that supported career success at Brown University and the wider scientific community. These resources included a cross-departmental One-to-One Mentoring Program for new tenure-track faculty and peer-mentoring groups for women science faculty.

This framework provided information about best practices for recruiting and retaining women and minority faculty, managing departmental climate (including countering gender bias), and ensuring faculty success in tenure and promotion reviews.
