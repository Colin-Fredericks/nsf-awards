 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project is aimed at studying the geometry of subgroups of the mapping\r\nclass group of a surface acting on the Teichmuller space and other related\r\nspaces.  The guiding principal is an analogy between this action and the\r\naction of a Kleinian group on hyperbolic space.  The primary topics\r\nstudied by the PI are convex cocompactness (characterizations and\r\nexamples), generalized combination theorems for Veech groups (geometric\r\nstructure and ideal boundary behavior), and translation lengths for\r\npseudo-Anosov mapping classes acting on Teichmuller space (especially its\r\nrelation to minimal dilatation questions).  Various parts of this work\r\ninvolve ongoing joint projects with R. Kent, B. Farb, and D. Margalit.\r\n\r\nHomeomorphisms of a surface (which can be thought of as self-symmetries of\r\nthe surface in a very weak sense) and the mapping class group (which is\r\nthe collection of all such self-symmetries) are widely studied in\r\nmathematics.  While these objects are primarily of interest in low\r\ndimensional topology and geometric group theory--two fields which have\r\nseen significant growth over the last 20 to 30 years--they also arise in a\r\nvariety of other areas including complex analysis, algebraic geometry, and\r\ndynamics.  For example, one of the most intriguing spaces in mathematics\r\nis the space which classifies surfaces equipped with a variety of\r\ngeometric or algebraic structures (the so-called ``moduli space of Riemann\r\nsurfaces'').  This space is encoded in the Teichmuller space and the\r\naction of the mapping class group on it.  The goal of this project is to\r\ndevelop a better understanding of certain classes of subgroups of the\r\nmapping class group through the geometry of their action on Teichmuller\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n",
