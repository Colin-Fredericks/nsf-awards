The proposed research has therefore two main aspects:\r\nstudying fundamental questions for non-compact hyperkaehler\r\nmanifolds, such as Hodge theory and the Atiyah-Singer index\r\ntheorem, and applying these methods in other fields. The\r\nhyperkaehler spaces appearing in this proposal include: moduli\r\nspaces of Yang-Mills instantons on asymptotically locally\r\nEuclidean gravitational instantons; more generally Nakajima's\r\nquiver varieties; toric hyperkaehler varieties; moduli spaces of\r\nmagnetic monopoles on R^3; moduli spaces of Higgs bundles on a\r\nRiemann surface; and more generally hyperkaehler spaces appearing\r\nin the non-Abelian Hodge theory of a curve (like moduli of flat\r\nGL(n,C)-connections and character varieties) and in the Geometric\r\nLanglands Program. The fields of applications include:\r\ncombinatorics, representation theory, finite group theory, low\r\ndimensional topology, number theory, mathematical physics and\r\nstring theory.\r\n\r\nWhat is common in (1) the existence of a magnet with a single\r\npole (2) the reliability of computer networks and (3) code theory\r\nand code breaking?  My research provides an answer: these\r\nscientific problems can all be attacked using quaternionic\r\ngeometry. Quaternions are four dimensional analogues of complex\r\nnumbers. For problem (1) one can study magnetic monopoles using\r\nquaternionic equations. The possible existence of these and\r\nsimilar elementary particles could lead to new energy sources.\r\nFor (2) the proposed research shows that the number of holes on a\r\ncertain quaternionic surface attached to a graph agrees with the\r\nreliability polynomial of a computer network based on the\r\ngraph. Qualitative properties of this reliability polynomial,\r\nobtained from the study of the geometry of quaternionic surfaces,\r\nhelp explain how to make computer networks, like the internet,\r\nmore reliable. In (3) arithmetic study of certain quaternionic\r\nsurfaces sheds light on the representation theory of finite\r\ngroups of Lie type, which are used in various schemes in code\r\ntheory.  Information emerging from the geometry of these\r\nquaternionic surfaces, could help devise better codes.  In short,\r\nmy research is two-folded, first it studies fundamental problems\r\nin quaternionic geometry, and second it breaths life into these\r\ninvestigations by applying the results to other fields in\r\nmathematics and physics. This yields a colourful palette of\r\nvarious fields in mathematics and physics all related in one way\r\nor another to quaternionic geometry.\r\n",
