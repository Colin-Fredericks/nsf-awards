Most existing intrusion detection systems (IDSes) are\r\nsignatures-based. But such signatures are usually generated manually\r\nor semi-manually, a process too slow for defending against\r\nself-propagating malicious codes, or worms.  To evade detection by\r\nsignatures, attackers may also employ polymorphic worms which change\r\ntheir byte sequence at every successive infection.\r\n\r\nIn order to thwart a zero-day worm attack, it is essential to design\r\nan automatic signature generation system against polymorphic worms\r\nwhich may be deployed at the network gateways/routers and satisfy\r\nthe following requirements: network-based, noise-tolerant,\r\nattack-resilient, and having efficient signature matching.\r\n\r\nNone of the existing work satisfy all the requirements above. Thus\r\nthe PIs design NAPOLEON( Network-based Attack-resilient\r\nPOLymophic-worm signaturE generatiON), a network-based automatic\r\nsignature generation system with all the aforementioned properties.\r\nNAPOLEON has two components which complement each other: TOken-based\r\nSignature Generator (called TOSG) and LEngth-based Signature\r\nGenerator (called LESG).\r\n\r\nThis project combines theoretical computer science with practical\r\nnetwork security research. The PI has extensive experience on\r\nnetwork anomaly/intrusion detection. The co-PI's expertise is in\r\ntheoretical computer science and algorithms and has a track record\r\nof applying them to various applications including security.\r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary research will have a strong impact. For\r\nexample, during the PIs' collaboration, they have found that certain\r\nalgorithmic techniques in bioinformatics are directly or indirectly\r\napplicable to worm detection problems.\r\n",
