 "awd_abstract_narration": "WGBH is requesting a planning grant to support the development of a new public television initiative aimed at enhancing young children's mathematical competencies.  The target age for the \"Go Figure\" series is 3- to 6-year olds.  The goal of the proposed planning phase is to:  complete a math curriculum serving as the overall pedagogical framework for the series; develop a production bible that will include descriptions of the format, setting, characters, tone, sample storylines  and possible interstitials; produce a sample script and animatic, and conduct formative testing of the animatic.  Devising an outreach strategy in collaboration with key national partners will also be part of the planning phase.  The project will be developed by the WGBH children's television team, and advised by leading child development specialists and experts in early math education.   \r\n\r\n",
