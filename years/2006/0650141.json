 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Project Summary\r\nThere are many challenging problems at the interface of computer science and many other\r\nfields. Recently computer scientists have contributed extensively to areas such as DNA\r\nsequence assembly, sequence analysis, protein-protein interactions and intra-cellular signal\r\ncommunication. However, there are many system-level biology areas which are ripe for\r\ninter-disciplinary approaches. This proposal explores one such area - the immune system.\r\nIn response to a microbial infection, the immune cells which are highly specific to small\r\nstructural components of the microbe get activated. The process by which this highly parallel\r\nsearch gets accomplished will be studied. Another challenging problem is the process by\r\nwhich the immune cells develop tolerance. Such a study will be useful in understanding how\r\nmalignant cells become immortalized evading the immune cells.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe proposed research will provide a theoretical foundation to very important immunological\r\nphenomenon. New search algorithms based on spatial and temporal aspects require\r\ndevelopment of new theoretical tools.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nNew breakthroughs in cancer treatment will depend upon rapid advances in immunology.\r\nEven though generic treatments for cancer (radiation treatment for localized forms and\r\nchemotherapies for metastatic forms) will continue to play dominant roles in cancer treatment,\r\nmore targeted antibody and other immunological modalities will become more widely\r\nused. These will have potentially fewer side effects compared to generalized chemotherapies.\r\nA better understanding of the immune responses could result in new approaches for\r\ncoping with spam, phishing and viral attacks of computer systems.\r\nA-1",
