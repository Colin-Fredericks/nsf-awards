 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to the National Academy of Sciences (Donald Shapero, Principal Investigator, Board on Physics and Astronomy) supports a study to assess the forefronts of fundamental science at the interface of the physical sciences, including relevant disciplines in engineering, with the life sciences.  The study will develop an intellectual and conceptual framework for the scientific forefronts at the physical/life sciences interface, and identify and prioritize the most promising research opportunities. It will also articulate the potential benefits to society and explore ways to enable and enhance the integration of research and educational programs at the interface.  The members of the study committee will be drawn from the life sciences, the physical sciences and engineering, chosen for their diverse perspectives and backgrounds, as well as for their ability to consider fresh thinking and approaches. The audience for the report includes scientists and engineers, funding agencies, the interested general public, and science policy-makers.   Funding for the award is provided by the Divisions of Chemistry, Physics and Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the MPS Directorate; by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the BIO Directorate; and by the Divisions of Bioengineering & Environmental Systems, and Engineering Education & Centers in the ENG Directorate.\r\n\r\n",
