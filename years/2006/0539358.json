 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an imaging detector based on thermochromic liquid crystals. The principle of operation is to use the heat deposited by electromagnetic radiation on a thin sheet of thermochromic liquid crystal material, which reacts to temperature by changing color. The profile of the incident radiation is translated to a color distribution on the liquid crystal sheet. The sheet is imaged with a video camera and the image is processed to provide information about the radiation. The objectives of the project will be to choose the proper system components (crystal, thermal regulator, optics and video, controls and data acquisition) and assemble and test a proof-of-principle prototype. \r\n\r\nIf successful the out come of this project will be an inexpensive, broadband imaging detector with particular application in the far infrared to terahertz range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The far infrared and terahertz range of the electromagnetic spectrum is finding increasing application in science (astronomy, materials research, accelerator physics) and homeland security (detection of chemical and biological agents, explosives, and concealed weapons). While there is currently great interest in the field of terahertz radiation production and detection, the basic terahertz laboratory test equipment is not easily accessible due to high costs and involved operating techniques. While the detector would find immediate use in laboratories, applications to the industrial and security systems are envisioned. \r\n",
