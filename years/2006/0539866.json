 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will expand the field of carbon nanotube transistors applicability and provide a much needed safety improvement tool. The proposed work will address the feasibility issues associated with the detection of carbon monoxide.  Innovative research is required (1) in the development of recognition layers required to make a specific sensor; and  (2) in the integration of  carbon nanotube based platform onto a MEMS. For this first point, several different specific recognition layers for CO will be deposited on the nanotube device. These will be tested for their specific response to CO in varying temperature and humidity conditions as well as against cross reactants. Following device characterization and determination of the optimal working temperature, the end product of Phase I will be twofold, with (1) a working lab prototype for CO detection;  and, (2) a 100mm wafer of functional MEMS. \r\n\r\nThere is an identified need to monitor firefighters' exposure to CO, as they regularly encounter the poison when in the field, a situation that can significantly impaired their capacities, both physical and intellectual, therefore putting their life at risk. The proposed low cost device could easily integrate and calculate the built up of carbon monoxide in the blood, triggering an alarm when maximum permissible exposure is reached.  In addition,  the device would store this information into an integrated memory to build a profile for each individual firefighter.  Other population have been identified that could significantly benefit from personal carbon monoxide monitoring.  The total unmet need here is therefore in the order of 1.4 million people. Unfortunately, the price sensitivity of the personal safety and first response market has thus far prevented the application of widespread individual monitoring of carbon monoxide in the field, forcing people to take significant risks to achieve their duty. The proposed device will provide a solution that offers the technical aptitude of expensive technologies while retaining the ease of use and price consideration of most crude, colorimetric options. The low price target of the product is very attractive to the budgets of municipalities and fire departments. \r\n",
