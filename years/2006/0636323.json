 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER project focuses on a challenging, novel and important research topic. The project builds upon, extends and combines technologies from two disparate disciplines (study of cell kinetics and genetic programming) to formalize and implement the algorithmic constructs of geometric self-organization.\r\nFocusing effort on a project at the intersection of biology, engineering and computer science will advance the\r\nemerging field of bio-computing. The importance of achieving this technical goal is highlighted by the number\r\nof applications that can benefit from harnessing the power of self-organization (Chemotaxis Simulation, Tissue Engineering, Computer-Aided Geometric Design and Swarm Robotics). The PI is an accomplished researcher who has training in both the physical and computing sciences with specific expertise in simulations based on locally-interacting microstructures, as well as experience in managing large long-term collaborative projects.\r\nThe project has access to the substantial computing and human resources needed for its successful execution This proposal describes a multi-disciplinary project that brings together activities in computational biology, geometric modeling and evolutionary computing. SGER support will allow the PI to assess the feasibility of combining chemotaxis simulation with genetic programming in order to produce biology-inspired geometric modeling technologies. It will create a diverse team of students and faculty to conduct research at a unique technical junction. It will foster new avenues of research that incorporate concepts from cellular biological systems into computational solutions and algorithms. The project's outreach program builds upon established partnerships with Philadelphia inner-city schools and will expose under-represented minorities to the latest trends in computing and biology. The goal of the program is to inspire young students to become involved in the newly developing field of bio-computing. The PI has a strong track record of involving women and minorities in his research. This commitment will be sustained within this project. The project will reach out to build strong collaborations between groups within Drexel University's College of Engineering, School of Biomedical Engineering and College of Medicine, creating new scholarly synergies. The results will be disseminated widely through publications and conference presentations, web material, and outreach activities to the community. Given the application of Morphogenic Primitives to tissue engineering, robotics, sensor networks and computational biology, they promise to provide substantial societal benefits in the areas of engineering, medicine, health care and the basic biological sciences, as well as launch a new approach to geometric computeraided design.",
