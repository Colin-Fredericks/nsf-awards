 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nNanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize the human condition through fundamental contributions\r\nto science and technology. The chances of realizing the full potential of nanotechnology have been buttressed\r\nby recent demonstrations of rational control and manipulation of matter at the atomic level. Yet, in spite of\r\nthe remarkable feats achieved in its nascent years, nanotechnology has formidable challenges to overcome in\r\nthe areas of manufacturing methods, system design, and basic understanding. These challenges have to be\r\novercome before the promise of this new paradigm becomes a reality.\r\nThe goal of this proposal is to establish a paradigm for real-time use of models in Atomic Force Microscopy\r\n(AFM). The concept of using models in real-time has significant potential that has not received the deserved\r\nattention by atomic force microscopists as the related tools are primarily employed by engineers. Such a\r\nperspective facilitates interpretation of data since it provides a precise means of delineating the effects of\r\nthe inherent dynamics of the system from the properties of the sample being probed. Thus it provides an\r\neffective means of interpreting sample properties. In addition to the proposal goal of laying the foundations\r\nof a new paradigm, specific aims of the proposal will result in a new ultrafast investigation tool for AFM,\r\ntermed the Transient Force Detector (TFD). The prototype will yield hundred thousand features per second\r\ndetection rates without compromising sample size and resolution. A particular advantage of the TFD is that\r\nthe resolution of the detection process, dependent on the quality factor of the cantilever probe, is decoupled\r\nfrom the speed of the detection process. Issues of the loss of the probe signal and high resolution imaging\r\nbased on the likelihood that the probe is detecting the sample will be addressed. Use of models in realtime\r\nis very well suited to explore model based imaging where a more detailed information is desired when\r\ncompared to detection. A finer characterization of the sample will result only if cantilever-sample interaction\r\nmodels amenable for real-time use are available. Based on averaging theory, a methodology is proposed to\r\nextract sample characteristics that include topography, local stiffness and local damping at the nanoscale.\r\nThis includes a parallel operation where the sample characteristics will be gleaned by real-time models built\r\non the results of the averaging analysis of the tip-sample dynamics. Observer theory based active modification\r\nof the cantilever probe is presented. This systems viewpoint opens up new vistas for tailoring bandwidth,\r\nresolution and forces on the tip and sample. This enhanced flexibility is absent from the present set of tools\r\non modifying the cantilever dynamics. The innovative methods to be developed in the proposed investigation\r\nwill be complemented by the existing and future experimental facilities. Preliminary proof of concept results\r\nindicate the vast potential of the model based imaging paradigm presented.\r\nBroader Impacts: Micro-cantilevers are being used in diverse areas with increasing impact and has in-\r\nfluenced science in a fundamental manner. The methods proposed are enabling technologies and will open\r\ndoors for investigating basic science issues by providing ultra-high bandwidth and resolution. The innovative\r\ncontributions of the proposals will directly impact most aspects of scanning probe microscopy, as the proposed\r\nmethods apply to most of the existing setups. For example, it will directly impact the extremely high\r\ndensity data storage (3 Tb/in2) and read out technologies as well as the array technologies employed by the\r\nbio industry. The experimental aspects of the proposed research will be accomplished in collaboration with\r\nAsylum Research, and Bioforce Nanosciences Inc. both leading biology related scanning probe microscope\r\n(SPM) company. This collaboration is expected to foster transfer of the theory and technology developed\r\nin this program between the academic institution of the PI and the SPM industry. The PI has successfully\r\ndisseminated the system and control theory viewpoints to the physics community that is heavily involved in\r\nscanning probe microscopy. Under this proposal goals the PI will continue to push the synergistic transfer of\r\nknowhow between the two communities by exchanging student visits and presenting specialized workshops.\r\nA web based remote operation of SPMs is being explored by the PI in collaboration with Asylum Research\r\nthat can be used for remote operation that will aid this effort.\r\n",
