The approach is to: 1) fabricate low-mass (low-power) multicapillary columns having integrated heaters and temperature sensors for temperature programming using high-aspect-ratio silicon etching techniques and a silicon-on-glass dissolved wafer process, 2) deposit ionic self-assembled multilayers (ISAM) on the column walls as stationary phases with nanometer thicknesses, and 3) evaluate the column separation performance in terms of injection and detection issues, analyte resolution/reproducibility/peak shape, and speed of  repeated analysis. Separations of both normal and branched alkanes from C5-C16 and polyaromatic hydrocarbons of variable ring-size in less than 5 s are expected. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The ability to self-assemble both polar and non-polar stationary phase materials will lead to the separation of gas mixtures in a wide range of applications namely environmental monitoring, homeland security, and pharmaceutical analysis with a high degree of resolution and accuracy. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The outcome of this project will provide an outstanding example of how MEMS and Nanotechnology can become highly complementary methodologies to develop low-cost, low-power, high-performance devices that impact industries across the globe considering that the worldwide market for GC instruments is estimated to be around $1 billion annually. This research will also advance discovery while promoting teaching and learning through Virginia Tech's outreach programs, research opportunities for undergraduates, recruiting of graduate students from under-represented groups into a highly interdisciplinary research program, and incorporation of the project results in courses taught by the PIs in three different departments.\r\n\r\n",
