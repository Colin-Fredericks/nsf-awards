 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the\r\r\nUniversity of Iowa will purchase computer equipment (an Atipa\r\r\n64-bit Dual-Core Opteron Beowulf cluster for intensive computation),\r\r\nwhich will be used for the following research projects:  Extensions \r\r\nand applications of the smoothly mixing regression model (John Geweke); \r\r\nRegularization methods for high-dimensional regression models,\r\r\nwith applications to survival analysis, microarray normalization and\r\r\nROC classification (Jian Huang);  Parallel statistical computations in R,\r\r\nand Bayesian analysis of PET imaging data (Luke Tierney); Bayesian models \r\r\nand parallel and grid-based computing strategies for high-dimensional \r\r\nspatial and spatiotemporal data (Jun Yan and Mary Kathryn Cowles).  \r\r\nThese projects will make substantive contributions in Bayesian econometrics; \r\r\nstatistical genetics; statistical research, practice, and education; brain \r\r\nimaging; and environmental statistics.  For education, the new cluster \r\r\nwill be used for graduate courses on computational statistics and \r\r\ninterdisciplinary seminar courses on environmental informatics, as well \r\r\nas in thesis research by individual graduate students.  The cluster will \r\r\nbe integrated into the University of Iowa's research computational Grid \r\r\n(HawkGrid), which is a node of the Open Science Grid.  Thus, the cluster \r\r\nwill contribute to broader research on Grid computing methodology, and, \r\r\nwhen not being used to capacity by researchers in the Statistics and \r\r\nActuarial Science Department, it will be a research computing resource for \r\r\nthe greater University of Iowa community and for users of the Open Science \r\r\nGrid.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe last decade has witnessed an explosion of available data -- from \r\r\nsatellite images and medical images to remote sensing data to databases \r\r\nof customer information.  This phenomenon has been accompanied by an \r\r\nincrease in the complexity of questions that people in government, \r\r\nbusiness, and the sciences need answered.  Five researchers from the \r\r\nDepartment of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Iowa \r\r\nare developing and applying statistical computing methods to use massive, \r\r\ncomplex data to answer real-world questions.  John Geweke's work addresses \r\r\nsocio-economic issues, such as what factors drive the price of gasoline.  \r\r\nJian Huang's work involves collaboration with medical researchers in the \r\r\nCancer Center at the University of Iowa and will contribute to the \r\r\ndevelopment of more effective methods for using genetic information \r\r\nin the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.  Luke Tierney develops\r\r\nmethods to help people understand data by exploring it visually as well as \r\r\nstatistically.  This work will assist educators, researchers, and users of \r\r\ndata in business, government, and any other fields.  Tierney also is \r\r\ninvolved in the statistical side of brain imaging using PET technology.  \r\r\nJun Yan and Mary Kathryn Cowles are working to improve statistical \r\r\ncomputing strategies for data measured over space and time, and are \r\r\nusing their methods to study changes in the available water supply in \r\r\nthe western United States and levels of radon gas (a risk factor for lung \r\r\ncancer) in buildings.",
