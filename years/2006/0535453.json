 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a 3-year research project to determine occurrence statistics, wave characteristics, and dynamics of atmospheric gravity waves in the 80-100 km altitude region at four geographical locations. Mesospheric gravity waves will be recorded by four similar and proven all-sky imaging systems at four globally distributed locations: Millstone Hill, Massachusetts; Arecibo Observatory, Puerto Rico; McDonald Observatory, Texas; and El Leoncito Observatory, Argentina. The patterns of occurrence and the propagation characteristics of mesospheric gravity waves will be determined using collaborative temperature and wind measurements at each site. The patterns of seasonal occurrence and the effect of atmospheric tides and planetary waves will also be investigated. The observations will consist of campaign and continuous measurements with the campaign periods being planned to include temperature and winds measurements from simultaneous overpasses by the NASA Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite, which will provide complementary temperature and wind profile measurements. The varied locations of the four sites will allow several interesting comparisons to be made of gravity wave occurrence. In particular, possible sources of gravity waves, such as mountain ranges, space weather sources, and hemispheric differences. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the project includes the establishment of a strong scientific collaboration between the four observatories involved. Public outreach activities are planned for and research opportunities for undergraduate students will be provided as part of the National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program.",
