 "awd_abstract_narration": "A joint US-Germany workshop ``Algebraic structures in Symplectic   Field Theory (SFT) and Applications\" will take place in Leipzig, Germany in the period August 5--August 11, 2006. The workshop  is oriented both towards researchers in Symplectic Topology, as well as  graduate students, postdocs, and mathematicians interested in exploring a new emerging area of research.  The workshop will  consists of several intensive lecture series given by specialists, and of exercise sessions   run by graduate students and postdocs studying the new theory. The planned  lectures series will cover the following subjects:  new algebraic structures arising  in  SFT, the relation between SFT and string topology; the relation between  SFT and the theory of quantum integrable systems; applications of SFT in  symplectic topology and beyond.\r\n\r\nSymplectic Field Theory is a new emerging  subject which proved to  be relevant to Algebraic and Symplectic Geometries, Low-Dimensional Topology, Theory of Integrable Systems in Mathematics, as well as  to String Theory in Theoretical Physics. One of the goals of the workshop is  to help graduate students,  postdocs and  young researchers to enter the new area, as well as to help coordinating  the international effort in  the development  of the new theory.  The NSF funding will be used  exclusively for travel expenses of US-based graduate students and postdocs.\r\nMore information can be found on the conrefence web-page\r\nhttp://math.stanford.edu/~lipshitz/SFT.html",
