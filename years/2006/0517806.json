The FSU Stable Isotope Lab, which is located in the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, is a key part of our Geochemistry and Environmental program for both graduate/undergraduate research and the research of the PIs, which cover a wide diversity of research interests, including determination of paleodiet, study of paleooceanography,  reconstruction of paleoecology and paleoclimate, examination of carbon and nutrient cycling in soils, forests and wetland ecosystems, investigation of food web and trophic interactions, and study of methane oxidation in wetlands and landfills.  The lab has a state-of-the-art stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer and four peripheral instruments including a Gas Bench II device, a high temperature conversion elemental analyzer, a CarloErba elemental analyzer, and a gas chromatograph. These various peripheral instruments are interfaced to the mass spectrometer, allowing measurements of stable isotopic ratios of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and sulfur in a broad range of samples.  The technician will play a critical role in managing the stable isotope laboratory and will act as a facilitator for safe operation of the mass spectrometer and associated instruments by less adept users. The technician will train new users and ensure the smooth operation and proper maintenance of the mass spectrometer system, vacuum lines and other laboratory equipment, which will enable the laboratory to serve a large and highly diverse community of students, faculty and other investigators on campus and from other institutions, particularly Florida A&M University a historically black University located within a mile.  The technician will also assist outreach programs such as the REU program and the Young Scholar Program.\r\n\r\n",
