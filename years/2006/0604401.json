 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Permafrost in Asian mountain regions, especially on the Qinghai-Tibetan\r\nPlateau, is extremely sensitive to environmental change since the majority of permafrost is\r\nwithin several degrees below the freezing point. Global and regional climate models predict that\r\nmean annual air temperature on the Tibetan Plateau will increase 2 to 3oC by the mid of the 21st\r\ncentury. Construction of the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibet) Railroad, the biggest project in permafrost\r\nregion since the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline in the 1970s, and future railroad operations will have\r\nimpacts on surficial processes and permafrost environments. Climatic warming and railroad\r\nconstruction will accelerate the thawing and degrading of permafrost over the region. Permafrost\r\nscientists and engineers are now facing these new challenges on the response of permafrost to\r\nrapidly changing environments. The 1st Asian Conference on Permafrost will bring scientists,\r\nengineers, policy makers together, especially young scientists and graduate students, (i) to\r\nenhance communication within the national and international scientific community on the\r\nachievements and progress of the Asian permafrost studies in the past few decades (ii) to identify\r\nand recommend critical areas that need further study in the next decade, and (iii) expand the\r\ninternational collaborations on permafrost studies over this Asian mountainous region of China,\r\nKazakhstan, Mongolia and southern Russia.\r\nBroader Impacts: Conference themes addressed include: Permafrost engineering, properties of\r\nfrozen soils, model development, and their applications; Permafrost hazards and periglacial\r\nenvironments in mountain/plateau regions; Climatic and environmental and cryospheric changes;\r\nPermafrost hydrology and cold regions water resources and land use; and Monitoring, mapping\r\nand modeling of mountain and high-elevation permafrost. These topics relate to consequences of\r\na warming Earth and the many societal issues in the high latitude and high mountain regions of\r\nplanet Earth. The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) report in 2004 renewed concerns\r\nthat enhanced thawing or degradation of permafrost has had major impacts on infrastructure and\r\nlocal communities. The outcome of the conference will contribute to the bipolar environmental\r\nand engineering knowledge and to the assessment of recent changes in the landmass and\r\nterrestrial ecosystems. Experience gained by young researchers will contribute to their academic\r\nand professional development.",
