 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central goal in ecology is to determine how within and across species interactions determine the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Cannibalism is a common interaction with important consequences to the dynamics of food webs. Many species are often cannibalistic, but they are also subject to predation themselves. Although cannibalism is widespread in the animal kingdom and ubiquitous in most ecological communities, its effects of cannibalism on the prey and on the dynamics of predator-prey systems have not been explored. The objective of this study is to use field experiments with dragonfly larvae to determine the consequences of cannibalism to the structure and dynamics of natural communities. \r\n\r\nThese results will be of widespread interest to community, population and behavioral ecologists, because they will provide insights on how the interaction of within- and between-species processes shapes the structure and dynamics of natural communities. The research has also implication for conservation biology, disease control and agriculture such as predicting the impact of invasive predatory species and guiding the biological control of diseases and agricultural pests. The project will promote the integration of research and education by supporting doctoral research and including undergraduate students in summer research at Mountain Lake Biological Station. \r\n\r\n",
