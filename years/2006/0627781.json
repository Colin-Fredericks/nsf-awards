 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cryptographic proof systems have played an instrumental role in\r\ncryptography. The applications of cryptographic proof systems to an wide\r\narray of problems such as electronic voting, database security, secure\r\nelectronic commerce, identity management, computing on secret data,\r\ntrusted computing, and networking are well know. Significant efficiency\r\nbarriers remain to the widespread use of general cryptographic proof\r\nsystems.  We propose an ambitious focused research plan to overcome these\r\nbarriers, by developing a new methodology based on elliptic-curve groups\r\nto dramatically increase the efficiency of cryptographic proof systems.\r\nOur research plan has two main technical thrusts:\r\n\r\n(1) We propose to introduce a new technical framework for constructing\r\nnon-interactive cryptographic proof systems (such as zero-knowledge\r\nproofs), based on a direct commit-and-prove technique. Our framework\r\npromises to greatly reduce proof sizes for cryptographic proofs. In the\r\nmost general setting, where we are given a boolean circuit C and wish to\r\nprove that there exists some input x such that C(x) = 1, we seek proofs\r\nthat contain only O(|C|) group elements, where |C| denotes the size of the\r\ncircuit. \r\n\r\n(2) The very act of interpreting the statement to be proven as a boolean\r\ncircuit itself often introduces a substantial overhead. We observe that\r\nthere has been considerable recent development of cryptographic schemes\r\nbased on bilinear groups. We propose to develop a set of techniques that\r\ncan be used to directly prove a variety of interesting statements about\r\nessentially any cryptographic scheme based on bilinear groups.\r\n\r\n",
