Kukreti\r\n\r\nThis REU award is for 3-year Site for undergraduate research in \"Structural Engineering\" with a special focus on techniques to study the \"Development of Enhanced Materials and Structural Assemblages for Seismic Performance Evaluation Studies\" in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) at the University of Cincinnati (UC). Recently enhanced analytical and computational capabilities and higher strength materials have led to lighter, larger and more complex structures. To design them, the engineer must be able to evaluate their overall behavior, including their performance under possible heavy overloads of both static and dynamic (seismic, wind, blast) environments.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this 8- week REU Site is to immerse participants in research using modern technology and small-scale models to explore the use of innovative materials and components to mitigate damage caused by earthquakes.  The research projects for the site are designed to introduce undergraduate students from diverse engineering backgrounds to civil engineering infrastructure hands-on laboratory research experiences.  This REU program is a continuation of  3 successfully completed REU Sites, and it builds on the process and infrastructure already established..\r\n",
