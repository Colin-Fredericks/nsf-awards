 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER award supports a study that will contribute to a new Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) vision being developed in NSF's Computer and Network Systems division.  The goal of CPS research is new science and engineering methodologies that integrate the interacting cyber and physical elements of future engineered systems. CPS seeks new design principles and systems technology that can routinely yield high-confidence physical and engineered systems.  This study explores one aspect of CPS, research in resource virtualization and objectization, a component of the architectural principles and virtualization concepts for CPS.  The study also includes a research community workshop, held at the University of Texas, Austin, October 16-17, 2006.  The purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum for discussion of future cyber-physical systems challenges and opportunities, and to draw together a community spanning relevant subdisciplines to engage in research needs assessment and planning.",
