These two \r\nfields have flourished through the past 30 years, with numerous\r\nfruitful exchanges that have enriched both of them. Both fields have \r\nbeen heavily influenced by major conjectures; the Thurston Geometrization \r\nProgram in hyperbolic geometry and investigation of the intricate \r\nstructure of the Mandelbrot set in complex dynamics. Recent years have \r\nwitnessed many exciting breakthroughs in the both fields.  The program  \r\nprovides an opportunity to consolidate these recent achievements and to \r\ndiscuss further directions they open. It will also touch on a number of \r\nactive related fields: holomorphic dynamics in several variables, \r\nlaminations and foliations, partially hyperbolic dynamics, and \r\nTeichmuller flow. \r\n \r\nThe program will take place at the Fields Institute, which is mounting an\r\nintensive semester of activity in this area during the period January-May\r\n2006. A number of graduate courses, mini-courses and seminars, as well\r\nas three Workshops on various themes of the program will be carried \r\nout during that time. They will be largely directed towards young \r\nresearches who will have an opportunity to learn about most recent \r\nevents in the field. The NSF  funding will be used to support American \r\nmathematicians who wish to participate in this activity, principally \r\nyoung mathematicians without other sources of support.\r\n\r\nThe program Web site is \r\nhttp://www.fields.toronto.edu/programs/scientific/05-06/holodynamics/\r\n",
