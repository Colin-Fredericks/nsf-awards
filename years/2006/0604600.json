He uses their fundamental property: the dominant\r\ncontribution to the rate of thermal dissipation, elastic energy\r\nand other bulk properties comes from the areas between closely\r\nspaced particles.  This allows to develop Discrete Network\r\nApproximations to effective properties of a composite.  The main\r\ngoal of the project is to develop rigorous mathematical\r\nfoundations for these approximations.  The investigator studies\r\nthe concept of a Perforated Composite as the key step in his\r\nanalysis.  This concept allows to develop the discrete network\r\nmethod into an effective and attractive tool for analysis and\r\napplications.  He applies this concept to determine effective\r\nelastic properties of particulate composites, conductivity of\r\nstrongly nonlinear composites, and rate of viscous dissipation in\r\nhighly concentrated suspensions. \r\n\r\n     The investigator studies a class of heterogeneous media such\r\nas ocean flows, oil-bearing sands, particle-reinforced and\r\nfiber-reinforced composites, mud and blood among others.  These\r\nmedia are ubiquitous and characterization of their properties is\r\nparamount for development of new technologies and materials. \r\nExperimental studies of many such media are impossible or\r\nprohibitively expensive.  Computational studies of such media\r\noften are beyond our current capabilities.  The investigator\r\ncharacterizes analytically these media as networks, which allows\r\ndeveloping reliable and effective reduced models amenable to\r\nfurther analysis and numerical simulations.  Such models help to\r\nassess thermal and elastic properties of ceramics/polymer\r\ncomposites, augmented transport of plasma proteins in blood, and\r\nthe spreading of pollutants in ocean. \r\n",
