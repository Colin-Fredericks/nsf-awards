 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Puerto Rico Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (PR-LSAMP), Phase IV, builds on the successes of the alliances over the past 15 years in increasing the number of qualified, underrepresented minorities participating in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce.   Phase I and II focused on the revision of the STEM curriculum to emphasize depth of understanding, promote active learning, incorporate technology, and develop broad-based mathematics skills.  Mentoring and research activities are standard support activities for undergraduate students matriculating in the alliance programs.  In Phase III, the alliance built on these academic enhancements by developing interactive web-based learning for mastery of difficult concepts, developing electronic modules to expand interdisciplinary capabilities of undergraduates, scaling up of the successful teaching/learning strategies, developing Information Technology skills in STEM students, and expanding the research and mentoring program to include a large number of students.\r\n\r\nIn Phase IV, PR-LSAMP, through its systemic, integrative and collaborative approach that builds on institutional initiatives to improve STEM education will: (1) continue to increase the baccalaureate production of students in STEM disciplines; (2) continue to increase the number of students who complete a Ph.D program in a STEM field; (3) sustain the annual number of BS STEM graduates from PR-LSAMP institutions to provide a significant pool of STEM graduate degrees; (4) sustain and enhance the direct student support strategies that have proven successful to retain and motivate undergraduate STEM students to pursue graduate studies, such as undergraduate research experiences and mentoring, and (5) sustain the collaborative network among STEM faculty from the different PR-LSAMP institutions for exchange of and mentoring in the implementation of successful strategies to enhance the teaching and learning process.\r\n\r\nAn elaborate tracking system is in place to track the progress of Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) fellows.  PR-LSAMP tracks the academic progress of fellows while participating in BD programs and entrance into a Ph.D program as well as through completion of the Ph.D and entrance into the workforce.\r\n\r\nThe alliance consists of the University of Puerto Rico System which includes two graduate centers (UPR-Rio Piedras and UPR Mayaguez); 6 four-year campuses (Humacao, Cayey, Arecibo, Aguadilla, and Bayamon; and the Inter-American University System, which includes two 4-year institutions (Bayamon and Metro).\r\n\r\n\r\n",

As of June 2011, PR-LSAMP institutions have awarded 55,480 BS degrees in STEM fields (1991-2011).  To achieve this goal, PR-LSAMP works at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of undergraduate STEM education by transforming the teaching and learning culture of the participating institutions.

The Polytechnic University of P.R. left the alliance at the end of Phase III, and no other institution was added in Phase IV.  Since the emphasis of Phase IV is to increase the number of BS graduates that continue on and complete a graduate degree, the current three institutions in the alliance are the main P.R. institutions with this track record.\n\n \n\nDuring Phase IV, PR-LSAMP developed and implemented four main strategies:\n\n \n\n1.
