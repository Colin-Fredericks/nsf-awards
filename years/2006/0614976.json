 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large scale parallel systems are critical to take on the challenges \r\nimposed by highly demanding applications of critical importance. Pushing the \r\nlimits of hardware and software technologies to extract the maximum \r\nperformance can increase their susceptibility to failures. This arises as a \r\nconsequence of growing hardware transient errors, hardware device failures, \r\nand software complexity.  These failures can have substantial consequences \r\non system performance, and add to the costs of maintenance/operation, \r\nthereby putting at risk the very motivation behind deploying these large \r\nscale systems. Rather than treat failures as an exception and take\r\nreactive remedies, this project intends to anticipate their occurrence \r\nand take pro-active runtime measures to hide their impact.\r\n\r\nThis research is expected to make three broad contributions towards\r\ndeveloping a runtime fault-tolerance infrastructure.\r\nThe first set of contributions is on collecting and analyzing\r\nsystem events  from an actual BlueGene/L system over an\r\nextended period of time. The second set of contributions are models for\r\nonline analysis and prediction of evolving failure data.\r\nThe third set of contributions are on failure-aware parallel job \r\nscheduling and checkpointing. On the educational front, in addition to \r\nenhancing graduate curriculum and research, this project intends to involve \r\nundergraduate students and women. The tools developed in this project  and the \r\nrelated results will be made available in public domain and published in \r\nleading journals/conferences. In addition, the PIs will also push these \r\ntools to be incorporated on actual systems, to enhance their fault-tolerance\r\nabilities.",
