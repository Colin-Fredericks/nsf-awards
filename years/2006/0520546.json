 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this project is to continue the operations of the Kodiak SuperDARN Radar. \r\nThe Super Dual Auroral Radar Network, or SuperDARN, is an international collaborative\r\nexperiment for observations of plasma motions in Earth's upper atmosphere. By observing ionospheric plasma motions, a multitude of geophysical processes can be studied. These\r\nprocesses range from E-region plasma instabilities, to the relationships between auroral\r\nluminosity and electric fields, to the global-scale convective response to changes in the solar\r\nwind and interplanetary magnetic field. Each of these areas of study contributes to the overall\r\ngoals of space physics: developing an understanding of the coupling of energy from the solar\r\nwind into Earth's upper atmosphere and its effects on man or manmade systems. The Kodiak radar is particularly well suited for studies of he general areas to be addressed are convection observations, substorm processes, dayside transients, reconnection features at the cusp, mesospheric winds observed in meteor scatter, gravity waves, and thermosphere-ionosphere interactions, and these will be supported by this award.\r\n\r\nThe SuperDARN network comprises nine radars in the northern hemisphere, and seven radars in\r\nthe southern hemisphere, each operated independently by the member institutions, and supported\r\nby the national agencies in their countries of residence.  As is the nature of such networks, data from the SuperDARN network are used in such a wide variety of studies by such a wide range of scientists that it is prohibitive to produce a comprehensive list of the topics.\r\n\r\n",

In addition, a number of students worked on the project in ways that contributed significantly to their educations.\n\nMajor findings:\n \n\nThe first major study examined average flow patterns for ten substorm intervals in an attempt to identify common features. The features that could be identified were: 1) An increase of the zonal convection speed in the pre-midnight region equatorward of the convection reversal boundary associated with a southward turning of the IMF becoming effective at the dayside magnetosphere, 2) A further enhancement of the zonal convection speed about 8 minutes prior to expansion onset, and 3) An abrupt and significant decrease of convection speed at the onset time accompanied by a rotation of the near-midnight flow from zonal to meridional out of the polar cap.
