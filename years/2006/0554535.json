The project involves middle schools in four urban school districts that have partnered with the Institute for Learning at the University of Pittsburgh and has both a formal hypothesis-testing component and a design research component.  One outcome of the project is an implementation support framework that identifies key support structures, explains why they are important and illustrates how their development can be accomplished.\r\n",
