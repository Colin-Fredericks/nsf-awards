The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-04556).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nThe partners include Arizona State University (Lead Institution), Sandia National Laboratories, and Nitronex Corporation (a small business).\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of the proposal is research, technology transfer, and commercialization of light-emitting diodes based on group III nitride wide band-gap semiconductors based on quantum dots. Arizona State University will produce the zirconium-boron on silicon substrates, which are lattice-matched to the gallium nitride light-emitting diodes. The substrates are highly reflective in the ultraviolet spectrum, which overcomes the absorption and makes the laser efficient. Nitronex will grow the stress-relieving aluminum gallium nitride transition layers on the substrate to prevent thermal cracking in operation. Arizona State University will then grow the quantum dots of gallium arsenide, which are the optically active medium for the light-emitting diode. Sandia will grow the capping layer and the packaging elements. Sandia will also measure the efficiency of the light output of the devices.  Nitronex will commercialize the products.\r\n\r\nPotential Economic Impact\r\nThe proposed innovations will create highly energy-efficient, longer-lasting, and cost-effective lighting systems that will contribute significantly to the reduction of energy consumption. Further sustainable innovations include white light-emitting diodes through phosphor conversion, and laser systems for improved optical communications and data storage. This will open business opportunities in the multi-billion dollar range for the US lighting industry.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project is the growth and characterization of this new class of light-emitting diodes using the unique capabilities of each of the three partners. The new materials will have higher brightness and luminous efficiency than the conventional group III nitride wide band-gap light-emitting diodes, and the color specificity will be far superior because of the narrower emission line-width.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the activity concentrate on expanding the techniques to develop a new generation of light-emitting diodes will fulfill the criteria of both low cost and high luminous efficiency for applications in general illumination, as well as improved optical and data storage. The students will also be exposed to course and practical experience in entrepreneurship, i.e., first-hand experience in transforming knowledge into products that create new wealth and enhance the quality of life by reducing energy consumption.\r\n",
