 "awd_abstract_narration": "Novel Concentric, Hollow Silicon Microneedle Array for Diagnostics and Therapeutics\r\nShekhar Bhansali\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe goal of this project is to explore the development of an implantable micro-needle array for diagnostics and theraputics. The novel approach proposed is to use a concentric hollow silicon microneedle, with the outer needle providing a pathway for analysis and the inner needle acting as a drug reservoir for drug delivery.  The unique aspect of this design is a gas doped solid  doped silicon  barrier between the storage needle and the tissue, a novel approach to releasing drugs in-vivo.  This research is a quntum jump over current approaches that microneedle technology either as fluid extraction and in-situ analysis tools or for transdermal drug delivery. This research aims to establish the feasibility of an integrated diagnostics/treatment system. \r\nThe fabrication approach includes a combination of asymmetric masking, dry (isotropic/anisotropic) and wet etching to create concentric, beveled-tipped, and hollow microneedles. Successful accomplishment of the research objectives will have far reaching implications in health care by using technology to reduce the cost of health-care.  Successful development of this approach will reduce the need for monitoring patients inhouse all the time, improving the quality of life and reducing the need for nursing. It will lead to the development of integrated real-time diagnostic and therapeutic device while validating a novel drug delivery concept.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Proposed research integrates developments in different research areas (microfabrication, sensing, medicine and materials science) in a novel approach that will advance the knowledge and understanding in diverse fields. The research will provide a basis for integrated diagnostics and therapeutics tools using novel microfabrication techniques in developing microneedles. This is a major advance across fields.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  This research will enable reduction in cost of delivering health care, reduce the dependence on nursing staff (an area of critical shortage) and allow first response in the golden hour, by delivering drugs as soon as the symptoms of an illness arise improving overall success of treatment.  It will also train students in emerging cross-disciplinary areas (Electrical, Materials Engineering, Chemistry, Physics and Medicine). The research will have continued participation of undergraduate students and underrepresented groups (minority, women). The researchers from the Bridge to the Doctorate and Sloan Minority Ph.D. program will be drawn in this program. This will enable the PI to recruit students from diverse backgrounds and expose them to the needs of the new areas of bio-sensing, micro/nanofabrication, and lab-on-chip development.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
