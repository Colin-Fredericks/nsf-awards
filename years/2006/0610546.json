 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, we will develop computational tools for modeling the complex\r\ninteractions between the microbiological, architectural, and mechanical\r\nproperties of bacterial biofilms.  The tools will combine models for \r\nmulti-species biofilm growth and development, elasticity properties that\r\ndepend on the different species and their products, e.g. EPS, and the\r\ninteraction of the biofilm with overlying fluid flow.  As a test case, the\r\ntools will be used to study the behavior of heterotroph/autotroph two-species\r\nbiofilms commonly used for nitrogen removal in activated sludge reactors.\r\nThese biofilms exhibit complex behavior in their tendency to develop stratified\r\ncolonies where the fast growing heterotrophs cover the slow growing and brittle\r\nautotrophs.  The heterotrophs protect the autotrophs from fluid stresses, and\r\nalso consume the products generated by the autotrophs as they remove nitrogen\r\nfrom wastewater.\r\n\r\nBiofilms are a ubiquitous form of life that impact humans in many ways.  \r\nBiofilms are responsible for nitrogen loss from agricultural fertilizers, \r\ndeplete oxygen in streams, cause disease in humans and plants, and foul pipes, \r\nheat exchangers, and ship hulls.  It is estimated that biofilms cost the U.S. \r\nbillions of dollars annually in equipment and product damage, energy losses, \r\nand human infections.  The tools developed in this project will be general \r\nenough to be applied to a wide range of multi-species biofilm communities, and\r\nwill be useful in improving our understanding of these complex systems.  In\r\nthis project, the tools will be applied to activated sludge reactors,\r\nwhich are systems used for the treatment of wastewater.  In this system,\r\nbacteria and other microorganisms remove harmful substances for purposes\r\nof water reclamation.  For maximal efficiency of these reactors, the right\r\nbalance of autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria must be found.  The tools\r\ndeveloped in this project will improve our understanding of this system and\r\naid in the identification of the optimal operating conditions.",
