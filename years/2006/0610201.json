 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scintillators are usually consist of a transparent insulator and an impurity that functions as a luminescence center.  They are often slow or how low efficiency.   Colloidal nano-crystals in liquids, sol-gel and organic polymers will be developed.  The nano-crystal surface will be modified to make them soluble.  The optical response will be investigated and results compared across systems. The work will provide the first studies of the optical response of colloidal nano-crystals to irradiation.  It is anticipated that this effort will lead to identification of high-efficiency, fast scintillators utilizing 3D confinement of electrons and holes in nano-crystals.  It will provide a systematic database of gamma ray and neutron response and characterization of nano-crystals.  The work will contribute to the investigation of basic radiation effects on nano-crystals and their utilization in handheld, efficient detectors of nuclear radiation. The work should have a major impact on the development of scintillating materials and expand the range to nano-crystals.  The groups actively engages undergraduate students in the research through a specialized program focused on recruitment, mentoring, retention and graduation of members of underrepresented groups.",

In contrast to other lanthanide halide scintillators such as LaBr3 or LuI3 that are highly hygroscopic or even deliquescent, LaF3 is stable in presence of water.

Optical degradation of the NCs has been evaluated based on the measured dependence of their photoluminescence intensity on the irradiation dose. The colloidal NCs under test showed a wide range of radiation hardness. The lanthanide halide and lead halide NCs displayed a remarkable stability whereas the reference CdSe/ZnSe NCs degraded rapidly under gamma irradiation.\n\n     The lanthanide halide and lead-iodide-based NCs..."
