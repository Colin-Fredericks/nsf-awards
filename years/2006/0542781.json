 "awd_abstract_narration": "Species fundamentally vary in their abundance, spanning a range from federally endangered species to severely weedy invaders.  Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this pattern, but none sufficiently account for observed variation.  In part, this failure might reflect the fact that microbial symbioses (widespread, mutually beneficial associations between microbes and plants) have been largely ignored. This proposal forges a new direction by evaluating the role of microbial symbioses in governing rarity and invasiveness.  Taking advantage of the experimentally tractable symbioses between grasses and microbial endophytes (fungi that live within plant leaves), proposed experiments and demographic models test whether and how symbionts increase host abundance.  In grasses, endophytes may improve host resistance to herbivory through the production of alkaloids toxic to insects and mammals and also may enhance host drought tolerance. Comparative experiments on paired rare and common grass species will test predictions that symbionts benefits are greater for common than rare host species and differ between native and non-native hosts, providing the most comprehensive study to date on the ecology of grass-endophyte symbioses.  A clearer understanding of endophyte ecology can offer novel strategies for rare plant conservation and invasive plant control (e.g., via endophyte additions or eliminations).  Through networks established in both Indiana and Texas, information will be broadly communicated to state agencies, preserve managers, seed companies, and conservation organizations. The work will additionally integrate teaching and research, by training graduate and undergraduate students as well as bringing contemporary research into the classroom.\r\n\r\n",

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this variation, but the literature is replete with conflicting results, and currently proposed mechanisms do not sufficiently account for the observed variation.  Investigations of symbiosis may help resolve the lack of consistency in research on rarity, commonness, and invasiveness.  Beneficial symbionts can increase host resistance to biotic and abiotic stress and may thereby affect the ecological dominance of host species. \n\nThis research combined diverse approaches to test two related questions on the ecological impacts of symbiosis.  (A) Does symbiosis increase host abundance?  (B) Through what mechanisms do symbionts affect host abundance?  By drawing comparisons across several host species, including rare, common, and invasive grasses, I have built the most comprehensive study to date on the ecology of grass-endophyte symbioses, with results that generalize to other symbiotic interactions.

Historically, abiotic factors (resource availability, disturbance) and antagonistic interactions (competition, predation) have been considered the major determinants of abundance.  In contrast, symbioses have received little attention, despite their ubiquity and increasingly well-recognized importance in nature.  Specifically, few studies have linked the effects of symbionts on individual hosts to effects on host population growth.  This work necessitated large-scale and long-term field experiments that manipulated endophyte presence and tracked population dynamics across of several rare, common, and non-native grass hosts.\n\nThis research has transcended traditional approaches of plant-symbiont research by employing matrix models and integral projection models to predict rates of population growth and by making phylogenetically-controlled comparisons across multiple species.
