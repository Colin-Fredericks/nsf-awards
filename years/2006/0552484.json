 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Sites project continues the undergraduate research component of the on-going archaeological project at Sylvester Manor, Shelter Island, New York. The 250-acre site contains extensive and well-preserved archaeological remains of a Late Woodland (pre-contact) Native American settlement, and a 1652-1735 agricultural plantation established to ship provisions to the Caribbean. The primary goals of the research are to understand the patterns of cultural interaction and cultural change among the diverse groups on the plantation, and to reconstruct land use and landscape change through time. The undergraduate research on the project is a seven-week summer program divided into three consecutive components: one-week of orientation in the laboratory; three weeks of archaeological excavation and sample collection at Sylvester Manor; and three weeks of laboratory work studying excavated materials and field data. The primary focus of the laboratory work is the analysis of material culture and archaeobiological materials, including macrobotanicals, pollen, shells, and faunal remains. Intellectual merit: This research adds an important new perspective to our understanding of colonization and cultural transformation in Colonial America. The incorporation of sequential field and laboratory components emphasizes the key scientific linkages among research design, field collection of data, and laboratory analysis. Broader impacts: This project expands opportunities for undergraduate research on a significant archaeological study, engaging them in a collaborative, team-based project with scientists at the Fiske Center for Archaeological Research. This REU project enhances students' interest and understanding of scientific archaeology, provides experience in the preparation of scientific results for the public, and encourages them to pursue further study. By increasing the scientific knowledge of undergraduates and helping to attract a diverse and talented pool of students to the sciences, this proposal has the broader impact of assisting the development of a strong human infrastructure for the future of American scientific research.",
