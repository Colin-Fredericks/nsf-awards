 "awd_abstract_narration": "BMCC will assess current STEM curriculum and identify changes, which will provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to continue their education at 4-year institutions or enter STEM related careers that are essential to meet the needs of the communities BMCC serves. To assess current STEM curriculum, BMCC will form two committees. An internal STEM planning committee will meet two times per month for the entire planning year. These meetings will allow BMCC instructors, staff, and administrators the opportunity to conduct a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis of current STEM curriculum. This analysis will be shared with an external Advisory Development Committee. The external committee will consist of experts from universities across Michigan, the Tribal Chairman from a neighboring tribe, whose students represent a significant presence at BMCC, and the Director of Michigan Works. The external committee will further refine the analysis of STEM curriculum and assist BMCC in analyzing 4-year institution and industry requirements for STEM related careers.",
