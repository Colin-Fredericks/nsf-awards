 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nTransforming Resources for Individual Preferences\r\n\r\nThe WGBH National Center for Accessible Media (NCAM) proposes to embed the capacity to\r\ntransform and customize presentation of content based on individual user profiles within\r\nWGBH's TEACHERS' DOMAIN, a K-12 library of rich-media science resources that support\r\nstandards-based teaching and learning. The project will enable teachers or students with\r\ndisabilities to locate accessible resources within all current and future collections offered by\r\nTEACHERS' DOMAIN; identify what kind of content is being presented; determine if the content\r\nwill transform to fit their presentation preferences; and identify equivalent or alternative forms of\r\nthe content that better meets their stated preferences. The Center for Children and Technology at\r\nthe Educational Development Center (EDC) will evaluate the usability and effectiveness of these\r\nresources with students with disabilities and their teachers.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit of Project\r\nIMS Global Learning Consortium (IMS) accessibility specifications have been developed by an\r\ninternational working group comprised of leading learning companies, educational institutions\r\nand standards groups. Specifications define a universally designed infrastructure for adaptable\r\nlearning systems and content that will respond to individual needs and preferences. TEACHERS'\r\nDOMAIN will be the first-ever full implementation of IMS accessibility specifications embedded\r\nin a complete set of classroom resources. It will provide a real-world model that promotes\r\naccessibility as an essential design element that enables teachers and students to easily identify\r\naccessible learning content. Evaluation research will identify potential impacts on teacher\r\npractice and student learning and suggest areas to be explored in the future within large-scale\r\nassessments using these permanent resources.\r\n\r\nBroad Impact of Project\r\nThis project will result in a significant amount of accessible, high quality science resources that\r\nserve science educators and teachers working with students with disabilities. The project will be\r\nprominently profiled within major communities dedicated to technology and learning the\r\nNational Science Digital Library, the IMS Global Learning Consortium, the National Science\r\nTeachers' Association  and will utilize partner dissemination networks that regularly reach\r\norganizations and educators that serve students with disabilities; science educators and\r\ncurriculum developers; state education systems and school boards; education-focused\r\nprofessional organizations and trade groups; developers and purchasers of distributed learning\r\nplatform and resources; developers; and distributors and producers of educational multimedia.\r\nThe project will also serve as an international model of how digital libraries that utilize IMS\r\nspecifications can automatically respond to individual needs and preferences, paving the way for\r\nimproved learning experiences for all users. This will set a standard of accessibility that teachers,\r\nstudents and administrators should demand from learning platforms and content providers.\r\nIdeally, this will help catalyze demand for accessible learning platforms and appropriately tagged\r\nresources. This outcome will greatly impact the ability of teachers to more effectively and\r\nefficiently meet their students' needs for accessible and meaningful content. It will also greatly\r\nimpact the ability of students with disabilities to access and benefit from distributed learning\r\nresources.\r\n",
