 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the travel of 7 graduate students and 7 junior researchers from U.S institutions and to attend a joint U.S./Brazil workshop honoring Alberto Calderon's pioneer work on inverse problems at the National Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, January 3-12, 2007.   Brazilian coordinators are Rafael Iorio and Jorge Zubelli of IMPA, Antonio Leitao of the Federal University of Santa Catarina, and Gustavo Menzala of the National Laboratory for Scientific Computation (LNCC).  This Symposium will honor Alberto Calderon's groundbreaking contributions to inverse problems.  Analysis of such problems brings together diverse areas of mathematics such as complex analysis, differential geometry, harmonic analysis, integral geometry, microlocal analysis, numerical analysis, optimization, partial differential equations, probability etc. and is a fertile area for interaction between pure and applied mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe first three days of the workshop will consist of mini-courses intended for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  The workshop will have thirty plenary speakers from the U.S, Europe, and Latin America.  Each day there will be four to six parallel short talks per day, which are primarily intended for young researchers.  U.S. students will be able to interact with graduate students from Brazil and other Latin American countries.  This workshop builds on the PASI on Partial Differential Equations, Inverse Problems and Nonlinear Analysis, held in Santiago, Chile in January 2003.   The workshop will be supported by the Americas Program in the Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n",
