 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop acoustically enhanced droplet heat exchangers. Droplet Heat Exchangers (DHXs) have high contact area, no interface losses, low pressure drop, and superior heat transfer characteristics. By adding high intensity sound to the DHX design, the local gas motion generated by the sound both greatly enhances the droplet heat transfer and agglomerates small droplets. It is proposed to develop the fundamental and phenomenological modeling to support the design and operation of an acoustically enhanced DHX. An acoustically enhanced DHX will be designed, fabricated, and tested. Feasibility experiments will be performed that demonstrate the superior heat exchange characteristics of an acoustically enhanced DHX. \r\n\r\nThis program will be instrumental in developing the science and technology of a novel and more efficient heat exchanger device.   Many other applications of this technology are also possible, including droplet/particle reactors, humidifiers, and gas scrubbers. The commercial potential of these heat exchangers is great, as is their potential in other applications. Society will benefit from the improvements of heat exchanger technology and improved process energy efficiency.  \r\n",
