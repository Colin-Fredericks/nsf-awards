 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support a workshop entitled Workshop for Biologically-Inspired Design to be held May 10 - 13, 2006 in Atlanta, Georgia. Biologically-inspired design focuses on the use of biological processes, organisms and systems as potential sources of innovative solutions for vexing technological or engineering problems. The principle investigators bring mechanical engineering design and biological expertise to this endeavor. In order to facilitate the collaboration between biological scientists and engineers, the goals of the workshop are: 1) Gather together scientists who use biologically-inspired design in various fields as a way to identify common principles and approaches, and to identify critical areas that require coordination among different practitioners of biologically-inspired design; 2) Bring together scientists, engineers, and designers to facilitate the incorporation of biological principles into engineering design, and to familiarize biologists with challenges that are amenable to, but currently lacking in, biologically-inspired approaches;, 3) Educate industry about the benefits; and 4) develop strategies for teaching biologically inspired design that will facilitate collaboration early in the educational paths. The broader impacts of this workshop are expected to be significant, particularly in establishing a community that has the needed expertise to address sustainability of society issues. The education of future scientists and engineers who are trained in biologically-inspired design  will promote the design of innovative and sustainable products in the future.",
