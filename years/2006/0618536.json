 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project extends a novel idea for large introductory science courses beyond the institution at which it was first introduced and tested.  The approach asks students, working in groups, to consider a problem or concept, read a related assigned carefully chosen article in the primary literature, elucidate the hypotheses being tested in that article, analyze the data presented, and think of the next logical experiment.  At the end of each exercise the students pose questions for the authors of the article and communicate these to them.  The institutions involved in this phase 2 approach include:  private universities (New York University and Columbia University), public colleges (Hunter College) and community colleges ( Kingsborough Community College) in New York City and institutions external to that area, such as the University of Texas Austin.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Based on results with the first such courses offered at City College of New York (three cohorts of students) the approach does: (1) increase science participation interest of minority students, (2) increase student reading and critical analysis skills, (3) correct minority student misconceptions of science/scientists; and (4) produce major gains in students conceptual understanding of biology. The soundness of the approach and the feasibility of adapting it to a variety of settings is being further explored and tested.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project includes a one-year Faculty Development Workshop at the CUNY Graduate Center in Manhattan. As Workshop participants implement CREATE and assess the effect of the approach on the various student cohorts in their classrooms they are building a community of scholars in biology education in NYC; a set of science faculty knowledgeable about research on effective teaching.  The project is also increasing student interest in science careers and promoting a more realistic view of who can become a scientist.  All of these have important implications nationally for innovative approaches to introductory science courses.\r\n",
