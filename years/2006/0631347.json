 "awd_abstract_narration": "Igor Bondarev\r\nNorth Carolina Central University\r\n0631347\r\nSGER: Atomically doped carbon nanotubes for advanced optoelectronics\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is focused on theoretical studies of fundamental issues that are relevant to novel applications of atomically doped carbon nanotube systems in nanophotonics, nanoplasmonics, quantum communication and quantum information processing technologies. Such applications have not been explored before and can have significant impact on the fields. The goal of the research is to study the physical properties of quasi-one-dimensional resonance excitations of polaritonic type in atomically doped carbon nanotubes. Spe-cifically, the focus will be on: (i) studies of the atomic spontaneous and stimulated emission, en-tanglement, atom-nanotube and atom-atom interactions near carbon nanotubes, to explore applica-tions in nanophotonics, quantum communication and quantum information processing technolo-gies; and (ii) research into surface polariton dynamics in atomically doped carbon nanotubes, to explore applications in nanoplasmonics as high-intensity coherent field generators.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The development of materials that may host quantum coherent states with long coherence lifetimes is a critical research problem for the nearest future. The problem requires a variety of different strategies to be explored. The proposed research pursues a novel approach to develop such materials on the basis of atomically doped carbon nanostructures. The research opens paths for new applications of atomically doped carbon nanotubes in modern nanotechnologies, in-cluding nanophotonics and nanoscale cavity quantum electrodynamics, nanoplasmonics, quantum communication and quantum information processing. The research supports new courses on nanoscience offered by the physics department at the North Carolina Central University at intro-ductory, advanced undergraduate and graduate levels. Students will be given the opportunity of participating in the research, gaining necessary research experience. Increased exposure of stu-dents to this exciting and rapidly expanding field of nanoscience will lead to increased participa-tion of underrepresented minority students from the North Carolina Central University in scientific careers and in graduate study in scientific fields.\r\n",
