 "awd_abstract_narration": "Supercomputer simulations of stucture formation are an emerging tool\r\nfor understanding the physical properties that drive the formation and\r\nevolution of galaxies.  The computer cluster built with this SCREMS grant\r\nwill be used to run some of the world's largest Gadget-2 hydrodynamic\r\nsimulations, incorporating our promising galactic outflow model that\r\nhas enabled, for the first time, a fully dynamical investigation of the\r\ncomplex feedback cycle connecting galaxies and the intergalactic medium.\r\nThese simulations will be compared to a wide suite of multiwavelength,\r\nmulti-epoch observations of galaxies and intergalactic gas, in order\r\nto refine our models and identify missing physics.  Additionally,\r\nthis cluster will be used to run our advanced far-infrared radiative\r\ntransfer code called Turtlebeach, which makes observable predictions for\r\nfar-infrared emission from Gadget-2 simulations, for comparison to present\r\nobservations and future data from Herschel and ALMA.  The computing\r\npower provided by this grant will provide a new level of capabilities\r\nthat will significantly improve the dynamic range of our models, likely\r\nleading to substantial advances in our understanding of galaxy formation.\r\nThese science investigations will be complemented by a closely coupled\r\nprogram to expand training in supercomputing proficiency.\r\n\r\nWith ever-growing telescope power we can now detect galaxies back to when\r\nthe universe was just a few percent of its current age.  These images\r\nhave revealed a Universe filled with galaxies coming in a wide range\r\nof sizes, shapes, and colors, and evolving through a myriad of physical\r\nprocesses including gravity, shocks, radiation, and chemical synthesis.\r\nUnderstanding how the galaxies we see came to be is a central challenge\r\nin astronomy that can now be addressed using powerful supercomputers.\r\nSupercomputer simulations evolve the universe from shortly after the Big\r\nBang until the present day, and make predictions for the galaxy population\r\nthat can be compared to forefront observations.  Successful aspects\r\nof the model allow us to solidify our physical intuition, while areas\r\nthat disagree with observations motivate improvements and refinements.\r\nSupercomputers are required to comprehensively model the sundry physical\r\nprocesses operating over a large range of scales in space and time.\r\nThe supercomputer built using this SCREMS grant will enable some of the\r\nlargest, most sophisticated simulations ever to be done, which are sure\r\nto yield new insights into the physical processes by which galaxies come\r\nto look the way they do.  Furthermore, this supercomputer will be used to\r\nrun our state-of-the-art tools for comparing these models to observations,\r\nparticularly in the emerging arena of millimeter astronomy.  Finally,\r\nthis grant will enable the development of lesson units on supercomputing,\r\nto train the next generation of students to utilize this rapidly-advancing\r\ntechnology.",
