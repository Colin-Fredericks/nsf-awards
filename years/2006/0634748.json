 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Kurt M. Pickett of the American  \r\nMuseum of Natural History for the study of behaviorally important  \r\nwasps in the genus Polistes, or common paper wasps.  Within Polistes,  \r\nthe New World species form a lineage of 119 species, many of which  \r\nhave been the basis for the empirical and theoretical study of social  \r\nbehavior.  While many of these theories have been devised with paper  \r\nwasps in mind, their applicability extends well beyond wasps.   \r\nBecause many of these theories posit the sequence of behavioral  \r\nevolution through time, fully understanding the evolution of social  \r\nbehavior in paper wasps requires the evolutionary tree of the  \r\nspecies.  Based on molecular, anatomical and behavioral evidence, Dr.  \r\nPickett and co-workers will produce a robust evolutionary hypothesis  \r\nfor this group.  This hypothesis will clarify not only the evolution  \r\nof a diversity of behaviors, but also the taxonomy of the group.  The  \r\nproject will produce a series of scientific articles relating to the  \r\nevolution of social behavior and the taxonomy of the group, including  \r\nidentification keys to the species.  All data, illustrations and  \r\narticles will be disseminated via the World Wide Web.\r\n             The products of this project will enrich the community  \r\nin many ways.  Traditional and interactive keys to the species will  \r\nbe of broad use by applied entomologists and environmental  \r\nconsultants as well as the research community.  The project will  \r\ntrain three undergraduate students in advanced molecular techniques  \r\nand preparation of digital archives of anatomical variation.  One  \r\nintern will receive extensive training over 2 years, and will attend  \r\na scientific congress at which she will report her work to the  \r\nscientific community.  The project will also create new content for  \r\nthe OLogy website related to the proposed research.  OLogy (http:// \r\nology.amnh.org/) is a free, science-rich website designed for  \r\nlearners aged 7 and up to spark innate curiosity about the natural  \r\nworld.  Developed entirely in-house at the American Museum of Natural  \r\nHistory by teams of educational technologists, writers, programmers,  \r\ndesigners and scientists, OLogy takes advantage of the Museum's  \r\ncollections, scientists, and outreach capacity to provide standards- \r\nbased science educational content to children at home, educators in  \r\nschools, and the general public in libraries.\r\n\r\n",
