 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nThe research to be carried out here centers on the transportation of mass and angular\r\nmomentum in protoplanetary disks surrounding young stars. \"Turbulence\" or \"eddy\r\nviscosities\" have been invoked to solve a variety of problems, including the transport of\r\nangular momentum outward from a disk to allow mass to accrete onto a central protostar,\r\nthe accumulation of dust to produce planetesimals, and their ability to act as an enhanced\r\nviscosity which allows planetesimals or planets to migrate radially in the disk away from\r\nthe regions in which they formed. However, computing the transport of angular\r\nmomentum, dust, planetesimals, and planets within a disk using transport rates from\r\n\"eddy viscosities\" may well be incorrect. Here, the sustainability of another process,\r\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence (which is highly dissipative) and its ability to transport\r\nangular momentum, will be studied as a function of the disk's ionization. In addition, the\r\ninvestigator's previous work has shown that vortices are efficient at transporting angular\r\nmomentum. His 3D modeling further indicates that grains can be trapped in these vortices\r\nand concentrated. Using two new codes, one a hybrid particle/gas code and the other a\r\ntwo-phase flow code in which one phase is the gas and the other is the dust, the\r\naccumulation of dust in the disk's mid-plane, in the vortices that form within a disk, and\r\nin the inter-eddy regions of the turbulence will be examined. All of these locations have\r\nbeen suggested to be regions where dust concentrates and then undergoes agglomeration\r\nor instability to produce planetesimals. A proposed scenario by which protoplanetary\r\ndisks fills with vortices will also be investigated. In this model a small, initial\r\nperturbation produces weak internal gravity waves. Those waves, in a rotating, shearing\r\nstratified flow, create vortices. The vortices are not steady, but oscillate, creating new\r\ngravity waves, and the disk fills with waves and vortices.\r\nThe tools employed here are applicable to other problems as well, including the\r\ncirculation of Jupiter's atmosphere, modeling wake-vortices produced by wide body\r\naircraft, and the role of particulates in climate pollution. The results of this work will be\r\ndisseminated to the public through public lectures and popular articles. A graduate\r\nstudent will be supported and trained in numerical modeling of fluid flows.",
