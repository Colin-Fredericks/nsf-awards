 "awd_abstract_narration": "This IRES project will provide U.S. students from George Washington University with the opportunity to gain international research experience in experimental nuclear physics by spending 10 weeks at the Mainz Microtron MAMI in Mainz, Germany.  This project will fund the research of three undergraduate students and one graduate student per year for three years.  In addition, it will provide some support for the PI to stay in residence in Mainz while the students are there.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe researchers will perform an experimental study of the dynamics responsible for the internal structure of the nucleon and its excitations.  Their main objective is to study neutral meson photoproduction, and they will make use of the Crystal Ball and TAPS collaborations at MAMI to do this.  The high-quality program of photon-induced reactions that will be carried out a MAMI will enhance current studies of the quark structure of baryons and mesons.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nSupport is provided for 12 U.S. students to conduct research at MAMI in Mainz, Germany, thus providing a group of U.S. students with international research experiences that will prepare them to operate successfully in a global environment.  The linkages created by their visits will support lasting international collaboration.  The PI has shown success and dedication in mentoring women students, a group under-represented in experimental nuclear physics, and he is committed to involving women students in the research in this project.",
