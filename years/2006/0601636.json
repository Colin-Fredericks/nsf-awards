 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deregulation of the US electricity system has resulted in significant increases in transactions among players in the power market. An efficient tool is needed to monitor and control the performance of this critical infrastructure to avoid catastrophic failure events. This research aims to develop a decentralized Optimal Power Flow (OPF) with real-time voltage security constraints. This formulation will be based on an area-wise OPF that employs real-time Phasor Measurement Units as well as traditional state estimation inputs. Optimization techniques to be considered include adaptive dynamic programming, quadratic interior point optimization, and integer interior point optimization. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits: The proposed project will address an innovative approach to preventive control of power systems using real time data for computing a Voltage Stability Margin (VSM), and provide decentralized optimal power flow methods for alleviating the voltage instability problems. Broader Impacts: This proposal will address problems in the areas of systems, optimization and electric power. The research will support the PI s efforts in community outreach and mentoring students from underrepresented groups. The PI will also use local resources, including the Howard University Science, Engineering and Mathematics (HUSEM) Program and Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), to broaden this participation. \r\n\r\n",
