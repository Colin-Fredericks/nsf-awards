(2) We   study an \"inversion\" mapping on the space of matrices.  We will   determine the degree complexities of this map as it acts on various   subspaces of matrices.  (3) We will work with the complex Henon   family, which has served as an important model family to exhibit   complicated dynamical behaviors and has been important because many   observed phenomena can actually be proved in the complex case.  We   will investigate certain parabolic bifurcation phenomena within this   family.\r\n\r\nThis work involves the areas of Dynamical Systems and Complex   Analysis.  More specifically, the geometric shape of the dynamical   set is connected with the dynamical behavior that takes place on the   set, which is an interesting object of study within Complex Analysis.  The mapping studied in (2) arises from certain fundamental symmetries in Lattice Statistical Mechanics.  And part of the study of the complex Henon family in (3) should impact a \"complex\" approach to Quantum Mechanical Tunneling.  Thus the work in (2) and (3) will have impact on Mathematical Physics.\r\n\r\n",
