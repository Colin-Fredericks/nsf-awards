 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since Darwin, a major focus of evolutionary biology has been the elucidation of the mechanisms resulting in population divergence, reproductive isolation, and ultimately speciation. This CAREER project involves the development of a research program to better understand plant evolution, the genetic mechanisms underlying plant speciation, and to further the phlox family (Polemoniaceae) as a model system for genetic studies.  The proposed research will elucidate the genomic regions shaping flower evolution and pollinator specialization in two subspecies of the wildflower Ipomopsis aggregata by combining genetic mapping and genomic analyses. Together, these studies will provide some of the first data on the genetics of barriers to gene flow and traits from natural plant populations.\r\n\r\nA major goal of the proposal is to train student teachers in evolutionary biology and create a support network that disseminates materials, resources, and develops interaction among teachers to improve evolution teaching. The core of the outreach program will be a working group comprised of student teachers, Master's students, working teachers, and the PI. The working group will identify problematic areas for focus in evolution curricula, research the best strategies for teaching each topic, and develop lesson plans.  When possible, we will incorporate inquiry-based and active-learning methods integrating evolutionary concepts across a diversity of topics in biology. Ultimately, our efforts will be disseminated as widely as possible through a teacher network, educational conferences, a website, and publications.\r\n",
