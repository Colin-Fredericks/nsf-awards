 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to develop advanced computational\r\ntechniques in order to perform large-scale, state of the art\r\nsimulations of two-phase transport problems arising in proton exchange\r\nmembrane (PEM) fuel cells.  Because of the complexity of the\r\nunderlying mathematical models for fuel cells, current solution\r\ntechniques are far from being satisfactory, and therefore more\r\nefficient numerical techniques are urgently needed.  While there is\r\nstill a long way before we can solve all the coupled systems\r\nefficiently, this proposal will be devoted to solution techniques for\r\nan important subsystem posted on the gas diffusion layers and the gas\r\nchannel.  This subsystem of equations possesses a number of critical\r\nnumerical difficulties caused by anisotropy, large discontinuity,\r\ndegeneracy and nonlinearity.  The goal of the proposed project is to\r\naddress these difficulties simultaneously by developing proper\r\ndiscretization techniques and robust iterative methods for solving the\r\ndiscretized systems.  The discretization techniques to be developed\r\nwill be mainly based on adaptive finite element/volume methods and the\r\niterative methods will be based on multigrid techniques.  The accuracy\r\nof the discretization scheme and the efficiency of the iterative\r\nmethods for solving the discretized system will be studied.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe importance of the fuel cell technology can hardly be\r\noveremphasized as PEM fuel cell engines can potentially replace\r\ninternal combustion engines in the future.  Since a PEM fuel cell\r\nsimultaneously involves electrochemical reactions, current\r\ndistribution, two-phase flow multi-component transport and heat\r\ntransfer, comprehensive mathematical modeling and computational\r\nsimulation are required in order to: (1) understand the many\r\ninteracting, complex electrochemical and transport phenomena that\r\ncannot be measured experimentally; (2) identify limiting steps and\r\ncomponents; (3) simulate dynamic responses under vehicle driving\r\nconditions; and (4) provide a computer-aided tool for design of future\r\nfuel cell engines with much higher power density (kW/liter) and lower\r\ncost.  The integration of the different expertise of the PI and co-PI\r\nis expected to lead to significant progress and likely breakthroughs\r\nin the field of fuel cell simulations.  Newly developed numerical\r\ntechniques will be immediately employed in the existing library of\r\nnumerical codes that have been developed for years by the Penn State\r\nElectrochemical Engine Center (ECEC), lead by the co-PI. It is hoped\r\nthat the new numerical techniques to be developed will lead to at\r\nleast an order of magnitude improvement over the existing methods.\r\nApplication and impact to national security/enviroment and to industries \r\nare naturally expected for this research because of the close tie of ECEC\r\nwith national labs and automobile manufactures. Moreover, this work\r\nwill provide a unique interdisciplinary research opportunity for\r\ngraduate as well as undergraduate education.\r\n",
