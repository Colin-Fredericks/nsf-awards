 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator and his colleagues have designed this conference to reach out to faculty and professionals interested in statistics for business and economics, particularly in the context of business schools. The primary aims of the conference are to improve the teaching of statistics and the level of statistical thinking in business education and practice.  In addressing these themes, the conference has sought to attract faculty from both teaching and research oriented schools.  In addition, major aims of the conference are to draw in faculty members from small schools and to encourage the participation of doctoral students in statistics who are planning to become faculty members in a business school.  The organizing committee recognizes that funding is often not available for these groups and so will provide grants to enable these individuals to participate.\r\n\r\nThe conference themes reflected in the title will be addressed by special sessions on statistical advocacy, recent research developments, the use of technology to stimulate active learning, and a panel discussion on how to improve statistical practice in business schools.  The conference will also include poster sessions for participants, and software and textbook exhibits.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
