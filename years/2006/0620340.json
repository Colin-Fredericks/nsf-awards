 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant requests funding in support of a US delegation to attend the international\r\nconference entitled Service Operations and Logistics, and Informatics (SOLI) to be held\r\nJune 21-23, 2006 in Shanghai, China. The role of services as a discriminator and its\r\nability to impact value and profit has increased the focus on research. There is a\r\nsignificant research and educational gap, and it is important to accelerate the relevant\r\nresearch in the pivotal areas to develop the knowledge and skills required in a servicesled\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this delegation is to deliver a keynote, a visionary panel\r\nsession, and 4 tutorials to publicize the NSF SEE research programs and address key\r\nresearch and educational issues while providing a platform to spread the importance of\r\nresearch in service oriented operation at this worldwide gathering. Some international\r\ncollaboration initiatives are expected. This annual conference is the first one of this kind\r\nto promote services sciences, management, and engineering research around the world.\r\nThe majority of delegates thus are from NSF SEE grantees, and researchers and\r\neducators in service engineering. As the conference participants are from different\r\nsocieties (e.g., IEEE, INFORMS, ACM, ASME) and disciplines (IE, OR, Manufacturing,\r\nBusiness, Engineering), this support will also help delegates build research\r\ncollaborations among not only NSF grantees but also researchers and professionals\r\nfrom around the world. A significant portion of this grant will provide support to women\r\nand minorities to encourage them to stay active in this new and vibrant field.\r\n\r\n",
