 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genetic code is degenerate in that many more codons are needed to specify a smaller number of amino acids. In turn, changes naturally occur in a number of RNA molecules within cells to accommodate genetic code degeneracy. One of these essential changes is the process of tRNA editing and it is Dr. Alfonzo's view that tRNA editing provides a mechanism to effectively accommodate genetic code degeneracy. This project will focus on answering the specific questions of the nature of the machinery that specifies tRNA editing. It will also explore the possibility that changing editing levels may have a direct effect on gene expression. This project is significant in that it introduces the possibility of modulating editing as a way of regulating gene expression.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project are its focus on undergraduate and graduate education as well as curriculum reform. Specifically this project will serve as the scientific platform to enhance the outreach activities with the single-minded goal of attracting, mentoring and training of students from diverse backgrounds, especially those belonging to underrepresented minority groups. This proposal already includes two outreach activities, initiated by the PI, involving a scientific collaboration with a laboratory in a historically Black college and establishing academic ties with a primarily Hispanic university. However, the broader impact is not limited to these important outreach activities but also includes a continuation of efforts in engaging undergraduate students in active research. To both ends, the project involves a number of scientific approaches, which will provide ample opportunities for training undergraduate and graduate students in both the values of hypothesis-driven research and, from a practical aspect, the powers of Biochemistry and modern Molecular Biology techniques.",
