This pioneering effort will significantly advance understanding of cardiovascular flows and in particular flow transition. Implementing a unique combination of experimental tools and integrating the effects of three important cardiovascular parameters, pulsatility, vessel compliance, and curvature, allows the modeling and analysis of their individual effects as well as their complex interactions. Cardiovascular disease has historically been the leading cause of death in the US and accounts for approximately one third of all deaths worldwide. Cardiovascular flows are governed by complex fluid-structure interactions within short, curved, branching, elastic tubes that undergo lateral dynamic motions while interacting with propagating and reflecting pressure waves. Analysis of the fluid dynamics in the cardiovascular system is a topic of paramount importance, because of the relationship among the hemodynamics, the endothelial cell response and the vascular pathology. Moreover, transitional and turbulent flows are intrinsically related to endothelial cell injury and the origin of vascular disease. However, despite many years of research, cardiovascular flows are poorly understood. The goal of the integrated educational component of this grant is to develop a new model for engineering education using research-based learning. This effort will reinvent and reenergize the classroom experience, demonstrate the multidisciplinary character of modern engineering and stimulate the students intellectual growth. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance recruitment and retention for engineers, including members of underrepresented groups, and to motivate the students to commit to a life-long process of learning, advancing engineering and benefiting society.  This goal will be accomplished by translating fluid mechanics and biofluids research to engineering education from middle school to undergraduate and graduate level.\r\n\r\n",
