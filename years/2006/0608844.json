 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops and analyzes mesh and method-adaptive high-order numerical methods\r\nfor solving partial differential equations. That is, high order methods such as spectral\r\nmethods, WENO schemes, radial basis functions and discrete variable expansions will\r\nbe incorporated with various mesh sizes to create a highly accurate, flexible and robust\r\nmethod that varies by domain depending on the smoothness of the solution in that region.\r\nHigh order adaptive viscosity discontinuous Galerkin methods will also be considered to\r\nstabilize the nonlinear problem and enhance accuracy. Such techniques can be considered\r\nas optimal, since they combine the best mesh with the highest possible order accuracy\r\nthroughout the computational domain. In one important application, an efficient three\r\ndimensional parallel multi-domain mesh-adaptive spectral penalty code will be created for\r\nthe simulation of the reactive flow in a scramjet engine's cavity flame holder, which is\r\ncritical for designing a supersonic engine. This work will use an already successful two\r\ndimensional static multi-domain spectral penalty reactive code. One and two dimensional\r\nmesh-adaptive hybrid methods will be simultaneously developed.\r\n\r\nThese robust, accurate and adaptive techniques have a broad range of applications,\r\nincluding combustion, wave propagation in heterogeneous media and supersonic shock\r\nwaves. Such problems demand highly accurate and efficient numerical algorithms in order\r\nto capture small-scale features of the solution. The proposed techniques in this project are\r\nwell suited to perform these types of simulations. In addition to the supersonic scramjet\r\nengine example, one interesting application is the modeling of water propagation in a\r\nfuel cell unit. Understanding the small-scale phenomenon is critical to enhance the fuel\r\nefficiency of a fuel cell. In this case, the adaptive high order numerical simulations are\r\ncrucial since the laboratory experiments are costly, difficult to measure and even fail to\r\ncapture such small-scale phenomenon. Finally, this project advances state of the art\r\ncomputational methods and will provide valuable insight into the investigation of various\r\nchallenging physical and engineering problems.",
