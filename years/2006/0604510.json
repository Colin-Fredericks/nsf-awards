Despite its successful\r\nuse in a variety of important areas including computer vision,\r\nimage processing, biomedical imaging, cognitive perception,\r\ncomputational neural science, and general data mining with\r\nclustering and categorization, the classical Mumford-Shah model\r\nhas gradually revealed its insufficiency in modeling and\r\ncomputing more general classes of image and visual signals.  The\r\napproach here is to advance the Mumford-Shah model in three\r\ndistinct directions of stochastic, functional, and geometric\r\nmodeling and analysis.  The new models can effectively and\r\nfaithfully analyze and compute more complex signal patterns that\r\ndemand innate randomness, oscillations, or high-order geometric\r\nregularities and are beyond the scope of the original\r\nMumford-Shah model.  The main mathematical tools essential for\r\nthe project involve stochastic analysis, functional analysis,\r\ndifferential geometry, nonlinear partial differential equations,\r\nnon-convex optimizations, and scientific computing. \r\n\r\n     A fundamental problem common in many nationally important\r\nareas involving vision and images is to determine whether some\r\nspecific pattern of interest is present, be it an enemy's\r\ndisguised tank, a long knife in a passenger's carry-on, or a\r\ntumor block in a brain scan.  Behind the split-second decision by\r\nhuman intelligence is an ensemble of sophisticated (but often\r\nsubconscious) and clever decision rules, balance principles, and\r\ninformation blocks.  To reveal and emulate such remarkable human\r\nintelligence in object identification and extraction is the major\r\ngoal of the segmentation problem, and it has never been more\r\nurgent than in today's information age when massive sets of\r\nimage/visual data are encountered everywhere.  Automation,\r\naccuracy, genericity, adaptivity, and speed are key qualities\r\nthat have been driving all the research efforts in the past few\r\ndecades.  Based on the classic method of Mumford-Shah, by\r\nincorporating several modern mathematical tools the investigator\r\ndevelops newer models that are more faithful in detecting real\r\ncomplex patterns, more broadly applicable and flexible, and\r\ncomputationally more efficient and tractable.  The project helps\r\ntrain graduate students in these crucial areas.  Results are\r\nvaluable for scientific, engineering, medical, and industrial\r\napplications where pattern classification and data analysis\r\nmethods are widely used.",
