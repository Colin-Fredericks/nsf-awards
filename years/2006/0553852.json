Vivoni of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in a research collaboration with Dr. Christopher J. Watts of the Universidad de Sonora in Hermosillo, Mexico. The researchers intend to conduct hydrological studies aimed at increasing our understanding of the North American monsoon. Despite the fact that this seasonal climate phenomenon controls the distribution of rainfall, streamflow and vegetation in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, little is known about it. As the summer monsoon can account for up to 70% of the annual rainfall in the region, there is a pressing need for binational studies that properly characterize the spatial and temporal variability in hydrologic variables such as precipitation, soil moisture, and streamflow.  For this IRES proposal, the researchers will promote binational research for early career scientists, stimulate learning of hydrologic field methods, and lead to an improved understanding of the spatiotemporal variability of hydrologic processes during the North American monsoon. The Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Earth Sciences of NSF will contribute funds for the research.\r\n\r\nThe collaborators will bring complementary skills to the project with a program that includes various components: (a) a field program in Mexico for instrument deployment and data collection, (b) research training for undergraduate students prior to and after the field study, and (c) mentoring activities to promote hands-on, team-based learning in a field setting.  Educational activities will expand collaborations between the Universidad de Sonora and the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology to enhance the long-term impacts of the project. Results will be disseminated through public presentations, web-based materials, and research publications. \r\n\r\n",
