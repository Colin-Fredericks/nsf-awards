Moehlis, University of California-Santa Barbara )\r\nTitle: CAREER: Dynamics of Individual and Coupled Oscillators  \r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThere are many natural and technological systems that undergo oscillations in mechanical, electrical, and/or chemical properties, ranging from simple pendula to pacemaker cells in the heart and blinking fireflies.  When such oscillators interact, their dynamics can adjust to give synchronized behavior.  Such synchronization can be beneficial: for example, generators of electrical power acting on a common load synchronize under appropriate conditions, a crucial effect for the normal functioning of power-generation networks.  Synchronization can also be detrimental: for example, tremors arising from Parkinson's disease are due to pathological, synchronized brain activity.  This project aspires to understand, use, and control the synchronization of individual and coupled oscillators to external signals and to each other.  This work will enhance the understanding of entrainment and interactions of cellular circadian oscillators, and will provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease using the therapeutic technique known as deep\r\nbrain stimulation.  This work will also enhance the theoretical basis for new mechanical filtering and sensing capabilities, which exploit coupling between microelectromechanical oscillators.  In addition to research activities, this project includes the development of a freely available, interactive website on oscillators and synchronization.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant funded research at the University of California, Santa\nBarbara which led to the development of a new control algorithm to\ndesynchronize a population of neurons, which could lead to a more\nefficient method for treating neuromotor disorders such as Parkinson's\ndisease.  This algorithm, which has been verified through computer\nsimulations of neurons, relies on a feedback mechanism in which the\npresent state of the neurons is used to determine when an electrical\ncurrent stimulus is necessary.\n\nThe research was inspired by Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), an\nFDA-approved therapeutic procedure used to treat brain disorders\nincluding Parkinson's disease.  Here, a neurosurgeon guides a small\nelectrode into the motor control region of the patient's brain, and\nthen connects the electrode to a pacemaker implanted in their chest.\nThe pacemaker sends electrical current signals directly into the brain\ntissue.  Given evidence that Parkinson\u00c6s disease is associated with\nthe pathological synchronization of neural activity in the motor\ncontrol region of a patient's brain, the goal of DBS is to\ndesynchronize the neural population.  \n\nAs presently implemented, the DBS signal is a simple waveform that is\nalways on.  The new algorithm involves applying a stimulus only when a\nvoltage measurement shows that the population is pathologically\nsynchronized.  Furthermore, the stimulus is chosen to be optimal, in\nthe sense that it most rapidly drives the neurons to their phaseless\nset, at which they are extremely sensitive to noisy, naturally\noccurring brain signals.  The noise effectively randomizes the phases\nof the neurons, giving desynchronization, and, hopefully, relief from\nParkinsonian tremors.\n\nThis grant also funded other research involving the control of neurons,\nand other research on the dynamics and control of nonlinear oscillators \nof technological interest.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/09/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey M Moehlis"
