 "awd_abstract_narration": "Joseph Fortunak, Howard University, is a Discovery Corps Senior Fellow for the 2006-2007 academic year.  Fortunak proposes an international project that would explore the feasibility of an industry in Nigeria to produce food- and pharmaceutical-grade microcrystalline cellulose from elephant grass and other biorenewable resources.  The goals of the project include developing green processes for the production of microcrystalline cellulose; research new products derived from Nigerian cellulose biomass; and stimulate Green Chemistry education and manufacturing in West Africa. \r\n\r\nThis Discovery Corps Senior Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the Africa, Near East and South Asia Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering. The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.",
