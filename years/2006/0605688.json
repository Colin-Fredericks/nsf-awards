The desired molecular components are structurally analogous to macroscopic compasses and gyroscopes, and their crystalline aggregates are expected to form dipolar rotary arrays with many interesting properties. It is predicted that changes in molecular and crystallographic symmetry will lead to materials with spontaneous dipolar order, either ferroelectric or antiferroelectric, with a number of states (orientations) that will depend on the rotational symmetry order.  Recent advances in communication technologies have stimulated much interest in the field of photonics, including materials with tunable transmittance, refraction, polarization, and color.  The students involved in aspects of this project include three women and two Hispanics. A post-doctoral NSF discovery corps fellow who participates in this project leads the research group in outreach activities, which involves interactions with teachers at Abraham Lincoln High School of the Los Angeles Unified School District, with a student body that is 85% Hispanic and 15% Asian.\r\n\r\nNon-Techical:\r\n\r\nAdvances in communication technology continue to have a very strong impact in all aspects of our daily lives, including improvements in entertainment, education, and national security.  In this context, one of the most promising areas for future development is the field of photonics, where light takes the place of electricity to help us read-write, store, process, and transmit information.  While light has many interesting properties (color, polarization, brightness, does not produce heat, etc.), it is still quite difficult to handle and manipulate.  The main purpose of this project is to develop and test a new class of functional solid state materials designed to help control the passage of light by using structures with molecules that change their state of motion and orientation in response to electric fields. The desired molecules are structurally analogous to macroscopic compasses and gyroscopes, and are able to orient themselves towards the strongest fields or to change their state of motion when an external force is applied.  The students involved in various aspects of this project are trained in cutting-edge research techniques while developing some of the newest technologies.
