 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on critical needs in the preparation and long-term development of\r\npre-service, undergraduate, K-6 teachers of science.  The goal is to investigate the\r\nimpact on these students of undergraduate, standards-based, reform entry level science\r\ncourses developed by faculty based on their participation in the NASA Opportunities for\r\nVisionary Academics (NOVA) professional development program.  Thirty reform and 30\r\ncomparison undergraduate science courses from a national population of 101 diverse\r\ninstitutions, stratified by institutional type, are being selected and compared in a\r\nprofessional development impact design model.  Data is being collected using multiple\r\nquantitative and qualitative instruments and analyzed using comparative and relational\r\nstudies at multiple points.  Research questions to be explored include:  determination of\r\nshort-term impacts on undergraduate students and long-term effects on graduated\r\nin-service teachers in their own classroom science teaching; identification of\r\ncharacteristics of reform courses that produce significant impacts and identification of\r\ncharacteristics of effective faculty development efforts.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project evolves from the large sample of reformed courses\r\navailable for study (all based on the same extensive longitudinal professional\r\ndevelopment model developed through NOVA).  The study is advancing understanding\r\nof effective faculty professional development and of the characteristics of undergraduate\r\nscience courses that impact student subject matter and pedagogical content knowledge.\r\nThe broader impacts of the project stem from the diversity of the student populations\r\nand variety of the institutions involved in the study.  The population from which the study\r\nsample is drawn consists of over 30% minority institutions, is geographically diverse,\r\nand is representative of the variety of teacher preparation institutions.  The study is\r\nadvancing the teaching, training and learning of undergraduate science faculty and\r\ntheir students at the 30 institutions directly involved and, more broadly, at a national\r\nnetwork of institutions.\r\n\r\n",

At the same sites, data were collected from 99 elementary teachers who had completed these courses.\n\n We can report several important findings. The professional development experienced by course faculty enabled and facilitated their development of undergraduate science courses with reform characteristics.  The elements of effective reform courses had a significantly greater number of indicators of inquiry learning that related to course design, instructional strategies, and the curriculum.  Faculty teaching reformed courses had a significantly higher level of instructional expertise, engaging students more effectively in active learning. Students in the reformed science courses indicated that they experienced more facilitative classroom learning environments as compared to more traditional courses.  Students experiencing higher levels of reform also demonstrated higher levels of achievement.

Additional findings were that collaborative faculty teams effectively developed and sustained course reform over time, and that successful course reforms were influencing factors for other faculty who eventually reformed their own courses.\n\nThe results of our national study provide information on several important questions: (a) What is an effective reform course?

Reform efforts were found to be sustainable with dedicated, collaborative faculty who have continuing administrative support.  A significantly high level of reform in both quantity and quality, however, is required to observe greater than expected gains in student outcomes.  Adding a single innovation to a traditional course, or poorly performing an innovation, does not affect student outcomes.  Effective reform requires significant multiple innovations by faculty over a sustained period of time to create real change.  The broader impacts of this study advance the teaching, training, and learning of undergraduate science faculty and the development of more effective entry-level courses.  \n\nThroughout the duration of the project, we used multiple forms of dissemination which proved to be important in providing faculty across the nation with research-based practices for reforming courses. Two national conferences with the theme of research-based undergraduate science teaching were held involving 150 researchers from 85 higher..."
