 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, \"NUE: New Vision for Built Environment-Integration of Nanotechnology into Civil Engineering Undergraduate Curriculum,\" at  Jackson State University, under the direction of Dr. Wei Zheng, will bring together a multidisciplinary and multiorganizational team from Jackson State University (JSU), an Historically Black University, the University of Texas-Pan American (UTPA), University of Oklahoma (UO), and include partnerships with industries and Canadian Institute of Research in Construction.  The project goals include: introducing the application and cutting-edge research development of nanotechnology in civil engineering to undergraduates, updating the mainstream civil engineering curriculum, and developing new teaching strategies to achieve undergraduate educational outcomes.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project initiates original multi-disciplinary collaborative efforts to enhance the curriculum of Construction Materials with nanotechnology-enabling materials and devices.  It will provide students basic understanding of the fundamental principals of nanotechnology and its application in civil engineering, and well prepare them to work with nanotechnology in the future.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The new course modules developed for the Construction Materials course will be integrated into other courses related to civil engineering.  These modules will be implemented at the three participating universities and will be available for implementation nationwide.  This project will help facilitate future collaboration to establish a new advanced joint curriculum of Structure Control for students in the civil engineering, mechanical engineering and technology department amoung participating universities and will help to strengthen the civil engineering program at both JSU and UTPA.\r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) Program Solicitation (NSF 06-538) and is being co-funded by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Design and Manufacturing Innovation (DMI), the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems (CMS), and the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC).",
