 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nThe work to be carried out here centers on the common envelope phase of the evolution\r\nof close binaries,  a point in the system's evolution when the companion orbits inside the\r\nenvelope of the evolved primary. During this event, the spiraling in companion donates a\r\nfraction of its orbital energy to unbind and expel the envelope, resulting in a binary with a\r\nshorter period. It is the workings of this interaction, poorly understood at the moment,\r\nwhich dictate the properties of all evolved close binaries. Here it is postulated that the\r\nmajority of, if not all, planetary nebulae central stars are post-common envelope binaries,\r\nwhich is contrary to the canonical view that planetary nebulae arise through the natural\r\nevolution of single stars. With this in mind, three projects will be undertaken to explore\r\nthe physics of the common envelope phase, its effects of the distribution of various\r\nevolved close binary types, and the possibility that the central stars of planetary nebulae\r\ntend to indeed be binaries. First, using radial velocity techniques, initial (and suggestive)\r\nsearches for binarity among central stars will be continued and extended to determine the\r\nplanetary nebulae binary fraction. Second, common envelope interactions will be\r\nnumerically modeled to determine the angular momentum loss as a function of primary\r\nand secondary masses as well as other stellar and system parameters. The initial\r\nhydrodynamic modeling will be undertaken with both Lagrangian Smooth Particle\r\nHydrodynamics and an Eulerian Adaptive Mesh Refinement codes and the best suited\r\napproach will be selected to carry out the bulk of the investigation. Finally, the results of\r\nthis modeling will be incorporated into a population synthesis code to test the outcome by\r\nreproducing the results of binarity among planetary nebulae established in the first\r\nproject.\r\nThe results of this work will be featured in outreach programs through the American\r\nMuseum of Natural History, the Rose Center for Earth and Space, and the Hayden\r\nPlanetarium. Visualizations of common envelope interactions will be developed for\r\ndisplay at the Museum and included in the Science Bulletins. A course on stellar\r\nevolution with emphasis on binarity will be developed and offered on repeat occasions\r\nwithin the context of the Museum's evening courses. The simulation outputs and all\r\nspectroscopic data will be made available to the community through the Museum's data\r\narchives.",
