 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI is proposing to investigate geometry of the moduli space of\r\nprincipally polarized complex abelian varieties. He proposes to\r\nundertake (together with collaborators) a study of the cone of\r\neffective divisors on the moduli space, of the intersection theory\r\nof divisors, and of the compactifications induced by vector-valued\r\nSiegel modular forms. The PI further proposes to examine the geometry\r\nof Kummer varieties, and in particular of their secants, generalizing\r\nand extending the earlier work related to the trisecant conjecture, to\r\ndefine a natural stratification of the moduli space. To this end, he\r\nalso proposes to investigate the geometry of the 2Theta linear\r\nsystem, aiming to get a description of base loci and singularities\r\ngeneralizing Riemann's theory for Theta. The PI proposes to combine\r\nmethods of algebraic geometry, number theory/modular forms, and even\r\nintegrable systems to undertake this study.\r\n\r\nAbelian varieties and their moduli spaces are one of the classical\r\ncentral objects in algebraic geometry and number theory. An abelian\r\nvariety is an algebraic variety with a group structure, i.e.\r\nessentially it is a geometric object on which the operation of taking\r\na sum of two points is defined. The complex dimension one case -\r\nelliptic curves, which can also be thought of as cubic curves like\r\ny^2=x(x-1)(x-a) - gives rise to many beautiful classical geometric\r\nconstructions: for example, to compute the sum of two points one draws\r\nthe line through these two points, take its third point of intersection\r\nwith the graph and change the sign of y. In every dimension there are\r\nmany different abelian varieties (varying \"a\" above gives different\r\nobjects). Understanding the geometry of the moduli space - the set of\r\nall possible abelian varieties of a given dimension - could\r\nyield insights in topics as varied as algebraic geometry, number\r\ntheory, integrable systems, and string theory.\r\n",
