 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conventional parallelization strategies do not scale\r\nwell when the computational effort arises from the\r\nneed to simulate to long time spans, rather than from\r\nlarge state space. Molecular Dynamics simulations\r\nconstitute an important class of applications where\r\nthis proves to be a bottleneck. The investigators\r\ndevelop a new approach to parallelization of Molecular\r\nDynamics, which is based on the observation that\r\nsimulations typically occur in a context rich in data\r\nfrom other related simulations. They use such data to\r\nparallelize the time domain, which yields a more\r\nscalable algorithm. This approach is based on the\r\nobservation that long time-spans are often encountered\r\nin simulations with multiple time scales. The fine\r\nscales are responsible for the large computational\r\neffort. However, the important contribution of the\r\nfine-scales is often to the effect they have on the\r\ncoarse scale. The investigators use reduced order\r\nmodeling to identify important coarse scale effects.\r\nThey use clustering and machine learning to\r\ndynamically determine the relationship between the\r\nsimulation being performed and prior data. They use\r\nODE and controls theory for stability analysis,\r\nuncertainty estimation, and system identification.\r\n\r\nThe investigators validate their techniques using a\r\nvariety of realistic applications in nano and bio-nano\r\nmaterials. The importance of the applications chosen\r\narises from the fact that materials have historically\r\nplayed a pivotal role in human progress. An indication\r\nof their importance lies in the fact that eras of\r\nhuman progress, such as the iron age and the bronze\r\nage, are named after the materials that contributed to\r\nsuch progress. Nano and bio-nano materials, designed\r\nbased on fundamental understanding at the atomic\r\nscale, promise yet another revolution, leading to\r\nproducts such as fuel efficient cars, disaster\r\nresistant structures, and new ways of treating\r\ndiseases. The investigators' techniques remove an\r\nimportant impediment to such developments.\r\nFurthermore, the students involved obtain training in\r\ninterdisciplinary research. Inclusion of a\r\ncollaborator with a joint appointment at an HBCU\r\nensures that under-represented students too benefit\r\nfrom this work.\r\n\r\n",
