 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project comprises studies that seek to answer basic questions arising \r\nin two areas of Probability Theory, Interacting Particle Systems and\r\nPercolation. They include the construction and application\r\nof nucleation processes\r\ntaking place at the touching points of forward and backward\r\npaths in the (double) Brownian web and the conceptually related\r\nmarking process on the ``double points'' of the (critical) continuum\r\nnonsimple loop process. This loop process, constructed by the PI\r\nand Federico Camia based on the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE)\r\nand the work of Schramm and Smirnov, is the full scaling limit\r\nfor two-dimensional critical percolation. The double points,\r\nwhere the loops touch themselves and each other, represent the\r\nscaling limits of lattice sites where a change in microscopic state\r\nhas a macroscopic effect on connectivity.\r\n\r\nThere are many situations, such as the functioning of the Internet\r\nand the behavior of engineered materials and of the economy,\r\nwhere many small individuals (web sites, molecules, investors)\r\ninteract with each other in seemingly random ways leading to\r\nnovel behavior of the entire system. A classic goal of Probability\r\nTheory and Statistics is to understand these situations. A particularly\r\nintriguing set of problems concerns so called ``critical'' systems\r\nwhere even one individual can provide a tipping point for the whole\r\nsystem. The goal of this research project is to lay a firm foundation\r\nfor the mathematics needed to understand such critical systems, at least\r\nin some special situations where there have been theoretical breakthroughs\r\nin the past several years. It is hoped that progress in these\r\nspecial cases will lead to more general progress.\r\n",
