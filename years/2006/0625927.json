 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract \r\n\r\nStone-based infrastructure materials, including Portland cement concrete, asphalt concrete, and human augmented soils, form the core of the physical infrastructure that underpins humanity's accomplishments in every arena. Stone-based materials are similar in their structure, which consists of an aggregate (or stone) skeleton, a binding medium, fillers, and air voids. Due to different binding media, soil, asphalt concrete and cement concrete have significantly different properties; however, due to the common aggregate skeleton structure, these materials can demonstrate similar behavior. In the last few years, developments in experimental characterization techniques such as X-ray Computed Tomography, discrete and continuum modeling techniques, nanomechanics-based FEM (Finite Element Method) and DEM (Discrete Element Method), and high performance computing have allowed the computer simulation of the behavior of stone-based materials instead of relying solely on experimental characterization, thus saving tremendous costs in equipment, materials and manpower. With these advances, research in stone-based materials can be unified in experimentation, modeling and computer simulation. The goal of the proposed research is to develop this unified approach, focusing on (a) developing a robust framework for characterizing the 3-D microstructure of stone-based infrastructure at multiscales from nano to centimeter; (b) integrating discrete and continuum modeling techniques; (c) computing material properties; and (d) using simulations of material behavior to design better stone-based infrastructure materials in a unified manner through partnership and collaborative efforts of researchers at Virginia Tech and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The partnership will share resources, ideas and facilities. NIST scientists can extend their research into asphaltic materials, which are of interest to the Federal Highway Administration; and Virginia Tech researchers can adapt the use of computational materials science techniques pioneered by NIST scientists to their research and education on stone-based materials.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
