The concept of window in stream processing is generalized and enhanced to a semantic window that can be applied to both streams and events. Quality of service (QoS) requirements is addressed in the context of event processing (using scheduling and load shedding strategies) to obtain a seamless end-to-end system. Current time-based semantics of event operators is extended to include attribute-based semantics to increase the expressiveness of event operators. Optimization of event operators in the presence of attribute-based semantics is addressed as well. A proof-of-principle system to incorporate the results of this research is implemented. Extensive performance and scalability experiments are conducted using data from linear road benchmark and intelligent home monitoring (e.g., MavHome) to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms and the implementation of the system. The results of this research will have far reaching effects on sensor as well as pervasive computing applications such as environmental monitoring, RFID- and GIS-based tracking and monitoring systems.  They will be integrated into graduate and undergraduate courses taught at UTA, and will be disseminated through papers and reports and via the project Web site (http://itlab.uta.edu/sharma/projects/mavestream/index.htm).\r\n",
