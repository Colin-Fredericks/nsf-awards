 "awd_abstract_narration": "0610358\r\nPavlostathis\r\nThis proposal proposes the potential of anaerobic digesters to produce or degrade NDMA and NDMA precursors.  N-nitrosamines, especially N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), are extremely potent carcinogens with cancer potencies much higher than those of trihalomethanes, for example, and are listed on the 2003 CERCLA Priority List of Hazardous Substances (U.S. EPA, 2003).  Although industrial applications of nitrosamines in rocket fuel, polymer and rubber production, etc. have largely been curtailed, nitrosamines continue to be common environmental pollutants as side-products or impurities in many food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and pesticide products, and in tobacco smoke (DHHS, 2002). Research in recent years has shown that nitrosamines, particularly NDMA, can be generated in water treatment systems by chlorine-based disinfection processes (particularly chloramination), making them an important emerging group of potentially hazardous disinfection byproducts (DBPs).\r\n\r\nStrengths of this proposal includes the fact that the PIs have identified an unexplored facet of Waste Water Treatment Plant operation that could significantly impact NDMA contributions to natural waters.  The research assesses potential formation or removal of NDMA precursors. The research also includes field-testing for precursors at municipal treatment plant anaerobic digestors, testing in laboratory-scale digestors, and biotransformation potential of NDMA and its precursors under conditions prevalent in an anaerobic digestor.  NDMA and N-nitrosoamines pose sever health and ecological risks. If NDMA is formed in anaerobic digesters, and these impact Waste Water effluent streams, then it would be valuable to develop/invent methods to decrease their formation.  \r\n",
