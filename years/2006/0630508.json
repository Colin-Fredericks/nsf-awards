 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds for the Government University Industry Research Roundtable to support activities of the Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP), an ongoing cooperative initiative among university research administrators, faculty and federal agency representatives.  FDP, which currently consists of representatives from 99 academic institutions and approximately 10 federal agencies, offers a forum for members to improve the national research enterprise by its efforts to streamline and standardize research administration policies and procedures. During the current phase, FDP addressed and influenced the research establishment by providing guidance for several activities such as: standardizing data elements for federal grant applications, developing the first comprehensive survey of faculty administrative burden, streamlining interinstitutional audits, and revising grant terms and agreements that correspond with the Office of Management and Budget Circulars.  Additionally, through the newly developed Emerging Research Institutions category, a broader range of institutions, including minority serving institutions are eligible to participate. The organization continues to improve the relationship between federal agencies and the research community, ensuring the efficiency and integrity of STEM administration.",
