 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Integrated Biological Sciences Summer Research Program (IBS-SRP) for Undergraduates at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison aims to educate, encourage and prepare high potential students to pursue graduate study and careers in biological research, and to deepen their understanding of evolutionary theory. During this ten-week program students do individual research projects in faculty laboratories studying one of five areas: computational biology & biostatistics, neurobiology, cellular & molecular biology, plant biology, or environmental biology. These five, discipline-based groups of students and faculty form a large interdisciplinary learning community that explores connections across the students' research projects through evolutionary theory and the research process. In addition, the program fosters student professional development and builds cultural competency through workshops on science writing and presentation skills, preparation for graduate school, biological sciences research career opportunities, and ethics in biological research. Each student writes a research proposal at the beginning of the program and a final paper at the end. The paper is presented at a symposium for participants and other invited guests from the campus community. Students who are from ethnic groups underrepresented in biological sciences research, from low-income homes, first-generation college students, or attend small liberals arts colleges with limited research opportunities are especially encouraged to apply. For more information visit the program web site (http://www.wisc.edu/cbe/srp-bio/) or contact the program director, Dr. Janet Branchaw (branchaw@wisc.edu, 608/262-1182).\r\n\r\n",
