 "awd_abstract_narration": "The researchers, in a two year project, that will include collaboration with a panel of experts and qualified practitioners, will synthesize research-based \"best Practices\" for teaching and learning in informal science education settings to develop a user-friendly assessment tool that can be applied in a variety of informal science education programs. Major research questions are: (1) do gaps exist in the Field Day program curriculum and (2) how can the program be improved?  The observational assessment tool will offer data about  (1) organizational issues such as staffing, novelty of the setting, flow of traffic, etc. (2) teaching skills of the instructor; (3) commitment of the school's and teacher's to support the informal learning experience through pre- and post- visit activities, etc.; and (4) engagement of students with the informal learning process.  Other outcome questions relate to student learning; relationship of ISE experiences to science standards, etc.\r\n\r\n The first step will be the development and validation of a standard system for evaluating Environmental field days in MN. According to the narrative, Field Days in the State of Minnesota are held in 75% of the State Counties and reach an estimated 10,000 or more students annually.  As such they constitute an important opportunity to motivate and engage students who may have had little interest in STEM subjects. Strong support from a variety of institutions and agencies indicate that established organizations are eager for an assessment tool that can be used in their settings to aid continuous program improvement and link program outcomes to science content standards. \r\n",
