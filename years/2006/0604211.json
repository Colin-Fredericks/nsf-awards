 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nDesign and development of a method for monitoring homogeneity, quality control, environmental degradation, mechanical degradation and sensing capability of multicomponent materials.  Multicomponent materials are used in many electronic, structural and chemical applications.  Examples include biosensors, high-energy storage super-capacitors, fuel cells as well as high temperature components for air and space vehicles. Understanding the effect of the underlying structure on the resultant performance, from the nanoscale to the macroscopic scale, may serve as a guide for future design of better sensors and more accurate life assessment of structural components in the future.  Training of students in these new cutting edge technologies will prepare them to become responsible citizens who can maximize their contributions for the welfare of our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS:\r\n\r\nImpedance spectroscopy, an alternating current technique that can detect several mechanisms at once, will be used as a scanning probe on an atomic force microscope.  Composites comprising of an insulating matrix filled with conducting particles of different size and shape will be characterized point by point so as to generate 2D and 3D complete frequency electrical maps that can be compared with topographical images.  Both in plane and out of plane measurements will be carried out. Summation of the localized measurements will be compared to bulk measurements thus providing for the first time the opportunity to compare the microstructure and the controlling electrical response directly and permit development of microstructure-based electrical models. Additional supporting microstructural quantification will be collected using a variety of complementary techniques.  This project will train at least students from the undergraduate to doctoral level.  Research funds will be leveraged with graduate fellowships and by hosting students over the summer months from other on-campus programs.\r\n",
