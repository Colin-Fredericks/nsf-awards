Gordon, University of Arkansas\r\n\r\n\r\nMRI:  Acquisition of a comprehensive plasma diagnostic system for research and education   \r\n\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation grant is to acquire three state-of-the-art plasma diagnostic systems - optical emission spectroscopy, residual gas analysis, and Langmuir probe - to measure quantitatively and spatially: neutral and charged atomic and molecular ground and excited state number densities and energy; and electron number density and energy in low pressure plasmas. This acquisition will immediately and significantly enhance the progress of the following three current and innovative material- and device-related research projects: (1) develop a process for growing low temperature crystalline alpha-phase alumina thin films in a novel inverted cylindrical magnetron sputtering system requires spatially and time-resolved electron and ion density and energy measurements at the critical substrate and target locations, (2) to produce suitable vias in silicon crucial for dense, high performance, three-dimensional electronic packages used in avionic systems requires plasma characterization in two reactive ion etch systems, and (3) to realize the enormous potential of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes, functionalized with DNA for bio-sensor applications, requires understanding the role of ion concentration and energy, determination of growth species, and understanding the effects of electron density and energy that spatial measurements would provide. Work on all three plasma-based projects is on-going, but significantly enhanced productivity and fundamental understanding is possible using the requested plasma diagnostic equipment.  The investigations enabled by this equipment acquisition will aid on-going undergraduate and graduate research and improve existing undergraduate and graduate level teaching, directly affecting nearly 100 undergraduate and graduate students through research projects and courses. The impact of this research on industry and society is also significant because each project offers a high-value product. The proposed projects will also generate significant educational opportunities for the many high school students and teachers, and undergraduate and graduate students that have interacted, and will continue to interact, with faculty at the University of Arkansas through research and classes. The PI will continue to actively recruit underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students, and expand his current activities to involve more minority and female K-12 students and teachers.\r\n",
