 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on the study of combinatorial structures arising\r\nin algebra and geometry, with an emphasis on the theory and applications\r\nof cluster algebras. Cluster algebras, discovered by the investigator in\r\ncollaboration with A.Zelevinsky, are a class of commutative rings which\r\nhave found applications in several mathematical disciplines, including\r\nrepresentation theory, Teichmueller theory, discrete dynamical systems,\r\ntotal positivity, Lie theory, tropical geometry, and enumerative and\r\ngeometric combinatorics. The investigator develops general structural\r\ntheory of cluster algebras and related combinatorial constructions, and\r\napplies it to the study of concrete classes of cluster algebras arising\r\nin various applications.\r\n\r\nThe original motivation for this project comes from several classical\r\nareas of mathematics listed above. The main tools come from combinatorics,\r\nincluding combinatorial topology, algebraic and geometric combinatorics, \r\nand the theory of root systems. Combinatorics deals with discrete objects \r\nsuch as finite sets, graphs, permutations, partial orders, etc. Many \r\ncontinuous phenomena allow for a discrete representation, lending \r\nthemselves amenable to combinatorial methods of study. It is often the \r\ncase that identical or similar combinatorial structures underlie \r\nseamingly unrelated mathematical entities, revealing hidden connections \r\nbetween them and allowing to transport insights and techniques from one \r\ndiscipline to another. One case in point is the theory of cluster \r\nalgebras, which are the main focus of this project.\r\n",
