 "awd_abstract_narration": "Student Analysis of Data Driving Learning about the Earth (SADDLE): A Next Generation GLOBE Proposal\r\n\r\nThe Student Analysis of Data Driving Learning about the Earth (SADDLE) project is providing GLOBE students and teachers with opportunities to conduct inquiry-based investigations related to watershed science.  The project is creating student-friendly interfaces that allow students to interact with the real-time and archived databases associated with the large-scale scientific observatory being constructed by the Consortium of Universities for Advancement of Hydrologic Science (CUAHSI).  Specific topics being explored include the flow of water though a watershed, how human activities impact watersheds and vice versa, and land use impacts on watershed ecosystems.  Two new, open-ended science investigations will enable students to conduct investigations using CUAHSI and GLOBE data from their own watersheds.  In middle school grade levels, students will investigate the water budget for the watershed and developing data collection strategies to explore the origins of any flux imbalances in the system.  A more advanced study allows high school students to consider the impacts of land use changes on stream flow and the effects of urban and agricultural development on water quality.  Unlike many other GLOBE projects, the emphasis of this award is on data analysis and interpretation, rather than data collection.  New interfaces and visualization tools, including GIS techniques, are being customized to provide non-scientists with easy, seamless access to the CUAHSI and GLOBE databases, allowing students to conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis within the \"Learning-for-Use educational context.  Both browser-based and desktop environment strategies (based on My World) are being developed, to accommodate the variable technological capabilities that exist at individual schools.  New learning activities that help students master the scientific content needed to conduct the open-ended investigations are also being created.  Hydrologic scientists at several institutions are providing content expertise during the design of these resources, which are being field-tested by a cohort of teachers before widespread dissemination.  Three types of professional development workshops (basic and advanced for teachers; outreach for CUAHSI personnel) will provide training on the use of these learning activities and watershed investigations during the dissemination phase of the award.  \r\n",
