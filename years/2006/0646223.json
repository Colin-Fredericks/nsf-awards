 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hamilton College seeks funding for fifty faculty from minority/female undergraduate institutions to attend the Federated Conference on Research in Computing (FCRC) in 2007. FCRC is an assembly of affiliated research conferences and workshops in a week long coordinated meeting held at a common time in a common place. It both retains the advantages of the smaller conferences, while at the same time, facilitates communication among researchers in different fields in computer science and engineering.  This award will enable faculty who deal primarily with the education of women and minority students who might otherwise not have the necessary funding to attend.  In attending, these faculty will be exposed to current research across a range of topics, making them better able to convey the excitement of the field when engaging students.",
