The first project aims to define the Gromov-Witten\r\ninvariants of a symplectic manifold relative a singular subspace\r\n(with mild singularities, e.g.  normal crossings) and to use\r\nthose invariants to prove a generalized symplectic sum\r\nformula. The project uses both geometric and analytical methods\r\nto investigate what happens to the moduli spaces of holomorphic\r\nmaps during certain kinds of natural degenerations, revealing\r\nsurprising new features but also new challenges and\r\ncomplications. There are several interesting applications of this\r\nwork, one of them presented as a separate project, which involves\r\nthe idea of using a Donaldson divisor to give a simple geometric\r\ndefinition of the virtual fundamental cycle.  The third project\r\nis motivated by a conjecture made by two string theorists,\r\nR. Gopakumar and C. Vafa. The PI has been working with Thomas\r\nParker on a structure theorem for Gromov invariants in 6\r\ndimensions; this would have many of the same consequences as the\r\nGopakumar-Vafa Conjecture, and it ties in nicely with C. Taubes\r\ndeep work on the relation between Seiberg-Witten and Gromov\r\ninvariants in 4 dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work lies at the intersection of string theory and\r\nsymplectic topology.  String theory developed as a potential\r\ncandidate for unifying general relativity and particle physics.\r\nThe details of this theory have turned out to be extraordinarily\r\nrich, and have inspired many remarkable results in\r\nmathematics. But results in mathematics have also guided and\r\ninspired many new discoveries in string theory.  It is hoped that\r\nthis project will have the broader impact of adding momentum to\r\nthe growing interaction between mathematicians and theoretical\r\nphysicists.  In particular, one of the themes running through all\r\nthe projects in this proposal is that symplectic topology can\r\ncontribute insights into string theory. The research and other\r\nactivities of the PI also have impact on the education of next\r\ngeneration of mathematicians.  One of the proposed projects will\r\ninvolve graduate students, engaging them in cutting-edge research\r\nearly in their graduate career.  The PI has also been active in\r\nencouraging and guiding women graduate students and will continue\r\nto strongly support young women entering mathematics.\r\n\r\n",
