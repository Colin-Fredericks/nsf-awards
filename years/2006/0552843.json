 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Physics REU and RET programs at the University aim to provide realistic research experience to undergraduate students and high school physics teachers. The participants will work with a faculty mentor on a specific research project and will be exposed to physics research in other areas via weekly seminars, workshops, interactions with other participants, and field trips to nearby national laboratories. They will prepare a research report at the end of the program and make oral presentations at an REU-RET Symposium. They will also maintain a daily research log book and will have opportunity to participate in short courses in computer programming, electronics, machine shop, and radiation safety. A workshop will be held on Applying to Graduate Schools and Preparing for GRE's. A series of up to four workshops will be held as part of the \"Ethics\" component.  The participants will be able to experience, and be part of, forefront research in the areas of Astronomy, Astrophysics, Biophysics, Condensed Matter Physics, High-Energy Particle Physics, and Nuclear Physics. The goal of the program is to increase, via mentoring and training, the participants's capacity to understand and do physics, and foster their potential to lead, inspire, and teach others. For most of the REU students, this will be their first exposure to how exciting physics research is, and will help them decide whether graduate education in physics is the right option for them. The primary impact is in training of the next generation of physicists who will be essential for the continued well being of our society and economy. The RET component aims at creating enthusiastic high school teachers who, in turn, will convey the excitement of physics to their students, the future physicists. This award is co-funded by the Divisions of Physics and Materials Research and by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n",
