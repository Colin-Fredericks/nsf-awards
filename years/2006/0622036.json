In addition, an innovative charge-balanced transduction method will be developed, which monitors charge-balance between the interdigitated nanoelectrodes and an internal nano-capacitor for detecting biomolecules on the nanobiosensors. These interdigitated nanoelectrode-based biosensors are based on the reversible redox-cycling mechanism, which insures an ultra-high electrochemical self-amplification that is believed to be essential for the detection of extremely low concentration of biomolecules.  The detection of ultra-low concentrations of biomolecules has become an increasingly important issue in the fields of medicine and homeland security.\r\n\tThe high throughput nano manufacturing technology using nano injection-molding techniques to be developed in this research is an innovative approach for mass production of disposable interdigitated nanoelectrode biosensors.  The new transduction mechanism changes the interdigitated nanoelectrode biosensor from a current-output device to a voltage-output device while sustaining the reversible redox-cycling mechanism, thus providing a rapid and ultra sensitive detection capability. \r\n\tThis research will strongly impact over the wide range of electrochemical biosensors at the nano scale, including development of low-cost nanofabrication technology and characterization of biomolecular transportation and reaction on nano-electrodes.  The technologies to be developed in this research hold great promise in the mass production of nanoelectrode-based biosensors and bioelectronics in a disposable platform for clinical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and screening for biochemical threat agents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
