Since its inception in 1983 this now biennial conference has brought together investigators from different fields and disciplines (cell biology, genetics, biochemistry, biophysics, plant physiology,and genomics) from around the world (North America, Asia, Europe and Australia) to discuss a variety of new research projects, techniques, and ideas focused on this organism.  Chlamydomonas has been a favorite organism for studying a variety of topics in cell and molecular biology. Much of what is known about the eukaryotic flagellum and basal bodies, for example, comes from studies of wild-type and aflagellate mutants of Chlamydomonas, as does much of what is known about photosynthesis and nuclear/chloroplast genetic interactions. The funding from this award will be used to help students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty from the U.S. scientific community attend the meeting.\r\n",
