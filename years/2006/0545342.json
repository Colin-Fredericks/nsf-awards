 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overarching goal of EarthScope is to elucidate the dynamics and evolution of the North\r\nAmerican continent. To reach this goal, focused studies of the continental seismic structure, the\r\nstrength of the lithosphere and modes of deformation, the patterns of stresses and strain and the\r\nmanner in which the lithosphere responds to excitation during earthquakes are all a high priority.\r\nThe common factor linking these EarthScope objectives is the thermal state of the lithosphere.\r\nHeat flow observations provide the strongest observational constraint on the thermal state of the\r\nlithosphere. Given the relevance of subsurface thermal conditions to the physical processes\r\ngoverning the spatial and temporal variations of lithospheric deformation, a greater knowledge of\r\nthe subsurface thermal regime will contribute greatly to the overall objectives of EarthScope\r\ngenerally, and the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) experiment specifically. We will collaborate (Oregon State University, University of\r\nUtah and U.S. Geological Survey) in a thermal investigation of the active plate boundary between the Pacific and North American plates in the western United States. Thermal measurements will be\r\ncollected in PBO boreholes currently scheduled for drilling. The field component consists of\r\nthermal logging and the determination of thermal physical rock properties. Holes will be logged\r\nbetween the end of drilling and the beginning of strainmeter installation so as to not disrupt PBO\r\noperations. Thermal physical rock properties will be measured using modern laboratory\r\ntechniques. For both logistical and economic reasons we limit this proposal to boreholes drilled\r\nin California which includes important EarthScope targets such as the San Andreas Fault System\r\n(SAFS), Long Valley, and Mt. Shasta/Medicine Lake areas. However we will make every effort\r\nto log strainmeter boreholes scheduled for drilling in the Pacific Northwest.\r\nThe importance of thermal processes for EarthScope was highlighted in\r\ntwo workshops, \"Complementary Geophysics\", and \"Thermal Processes in the Context of\r\nEarthScope\". Additionally, the PBO steering committee has recommended that temperatures be\r\nlogged in strain meter boreholes in the 2004 PBOSC Annual Review. We propose to collect and\r\ndisseminate these important data. Broad societal areas of this research include a better\r\nunderstanding of faulting especially the San Andreas, and anthropogenic climate change.\r\nFurther this proposal fosters collaborations between the academic Earth science community and\r\nthe USGS. The proposal will be used to educate and train a graduate student. Results from this\r\nproposal will be disseminated through the EarthScope web site, national and international\r\nmeetings, and peer reviewed literature.",
