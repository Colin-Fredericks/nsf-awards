 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cottontail rabbits are among the least studied mammal groups in the \r\nAmericas, falling in the crack between game and non-game species. \r\nAccordingly, little remains known regarding even such fundamental \r\nquestions as: what species are present in particular areas, what are the \r\nbiological limits of cottontail species, etc.  This can be encapsulated by \r\npointing out that a new species was described in 1992 from right outside \r\nWashington DC!  The investigators therefore propose to conduct genetic analyses \r\nof cottontails in order to address their hypothesis that the biological \r\nspecies diversity in cottontails is greater than what our current \r\nunderstanding suggests.\r\n\r\nThe work is important in biological control.  Myxoma virus, used to \r\ncontrol European rabbit populations, is naturally found in South American \r\ncottontails, the focus of this proposal.  We do not know, however, exactly \r\nfrom what species of South American cottontail the virus was originally \r\nfound.  Research into species limits may determine this in conjunction \r\nwith viral sequencing.  In addition, the investigators are proposing to \r\ninvolve students and investigators from the Latin American countries where \r\nthey will undertake the research.  The outreach component will therefore \r\nyield long-term productive research benefits to the United States and Latin America.  \r\n",
