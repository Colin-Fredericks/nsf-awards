 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) was established at the University of California at Santa Barbara to promote interactions between scientists and facilitate the use of existing information to address important ecological questions. This award will renew NCEAS in Santa Barbara for an additional five years. \r\n\r\nNCEAS has six goals: (1) To develop opportunities that accelerate and initiate paradigms shifts, (2) To provide a facility where scientists analyze and synthesize existing ecological information using creative approaches, (3) To maintain an international character and broad perspective in all of its activities, (4) To enable and enhance the delivery of well-documented, digital information and scientific results to environmental scientists, natural resource managers, and policy makers, (5) To provide an environment that fosters intellectual exchange and collaboration, and (6) To develop and implement a more comprehensive strategy for education and outreach. An emphasis on broadening participation will focus the strengths of the center on a more active recruitment of underrepresented groups into all NCEAS activities. \r\n\r\nNCEAS addresses its goals through three primary modes: Working Groups, Postdoctoral Associates, and Sabbatical Fellows.  Students are supported directly, as well as through participation in Distributed (virtual) Graduate Seminars. The NCEAS model for collaboration has been particularly successful promoting interdisciplinary syntheses that bring together people who have not collaborated before to focus on novel questions and approaches.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of NCEAS include making more potential users aware of opportunities at NCEAS, informing the general public about its activities and results, engaging the local student community and maintaining a bilingual \"Kids Do Ecology\" website as part of NCEAS's K-12 education program, expanding training in the use of emerging ecological informatics tools, emphasizing graduate student involvement in all its functions, and more fully engaging social scientists.\r\n\r\nNCEAS is a national center for ecological informatics, utilizing core support primarily to provide premier computational support to its Postdoctoral Associates, Sabbatical Fellows, and Working Groups.  It has been highly successful leveraging support for developing technology to massively increase capabilities to discover, access, integrate, analyze, synthesize and preserve existing data by building new capabilities in ecology and allied disciplines that advance the general community-wide information technology capabilities over the longer-term. \r\n",
