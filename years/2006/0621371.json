As a result of the drought that began in 2000 and reservoir operations that provided a\r\nconstant water supply to the lower Colorado River basin states, Lake Powell is currently at only\r\n46% capacity. Under these conditions, the river inflows cut through sediments previously\r\ndeposited in the Colorado River Delta. We hypothesize that the consequent resuspension of\r\nsediments may result in enhanced phosphorus release and metal redox cycling. In recent years, it\r\nhas been observed that anoxia develops in bottom water intersecting the delta sediments, which\r\ncould also result in P release due to reductive dissolution of iron oxide carrier phases in the\r\nsediments.\r\nPrimary production in Lake Powell is phosphorus limited and changes in phosphorus\r\navailability could have significant ecological consequences. Suspended sediment transported by\r\nthe Colorado River is the principal source of phosphorus to Lake Powell; much of this sediment\r\nload is deposited as the Colorado River flows in to the lake (i.e., the river-lake boundary). Thus\r\npreviously-deposited delta sediments represent a substantial reservoir of phosphorus.\r\nIntellectual Merit. The proposed project will examine the coupling of biogeochemical and\r\nphysical processes and their impacts on phosphorus and trace metal dynamics. Speciation of\r\nphosphorus in solid phases (specifically the suspended sediment and delta sediments) will be\r\ndetermined and related to the conditions under which phosphorus may be released from the\r\nsediments. The role of reductive dissolution of metal (e.g., iron) oxides in phosphorus release\r\nwill also be examined.\r\nBroader Impact. Phosphorus dynamics exert a key control on primary production in\r\nLake Powell. We anticipate that our results will show whether phosphorus and trace metal\r\ndynamics are altered under the current conditions where Colorado Rived inflows cut through\r\npreviously-deposited delta sediments. If phosphorus dynamics are affected, patterns of primary\r\nproduction and the development of bottom water anoxia during the recovery from drought\r\nconditions may be significantly different from historical patterns.\r\nThis SGER project will also support the graduate training of Mr. Richard Wildman, a\r\nthird year graduate student in Environmental Science & Engineering at Caltech. In addition to\r\nhis academic studies, Mr. Wildman has been actively engaged in outreach and curriculum\r\ndevelopment at the Environmental Charter High School in Lawndale, CA, a public school\r\nlocated in an underserved area of Los Angeles County.\r\nSGER Justification. Because of the current low lake level, there is a unique opportunity to\r\nexamine the effects of sediment reworking on nutrient dynamics, specifically phosphorus release\r\nfrom sediments. Currently, previously-deposited sediments are exposed to river inflows. As the\r\nlake levels rise, these sediments will be resubmerged. Since the extreme drawdown in the 2000-\r\n2004 drought and the above-average inflows of the 2005 run-off are creating unprecedented\r\nphysical conditions in the sediment delta, we are requesting SGER funding to examine the\r\nphosphorus and trace metal dynamics in this changing system. This work is also timed to\r\ncoincide with planned field sampling by the Bureau of Reclamation, which will provide\r\nlogistical support for sampling.\r\n\r\n",
