 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe proposed project will help states generate science and technology (S&T) reports that are better aligned with technology-based economic development (TBED) strategies and that reflect the state's industrial structure, talent pool and resource mix. Specifically, the research aims to:\r\n(1)\tdetermine the extent to which S&T reports track indicators aligned with state economic development strategies;\r\n(2)\tcompare and contrast reporting methodologies;\r\n(3)\tassess similarities and differences in the data used and their interpretation;\r\n(4)\texplore the processes underlying development of these reports; and\r\n(5)\texamine how the effects of reporting are monitored.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is a revised version of one submitted to the NSF in April 2005, incorporating reviewer suggestions from the earlier proposal.\r\n\r\nThe research will be conducted in three stages: (1) review of content and methodology of all S&T reports issued by states in 2005 (2004 if the publication is on a two-year cycle); (2) detailed assessment of media and historical trends in S&T reporting of 10-12 states representing a range of economic and industrial scenarios; and (3) in-depth study of six states, including on-site interviews and analysis of the organizational and political contexts within which their S&T reports are produced. In all, approximately 50- 65 reports (issued since 1995) will be analyzed, and about 40 interviews conducted. The life-cycle framework will be used to provide an overall perspective on TBED strategies and S&T reports.\r\n",
