 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how the mind emerges from brain activity is arguably one of the greatest scientific quests of all time. Exciting new work in the domains of neuroscience and cognition is now beginning to bridge areas and methods to ask not just how a particular cognitive process works in isolation, but how it connects to and interacts with other cognitive processes, and  not just how a process works at a computational/algorithmic level, but how it is implemented neurally.\r\n\r\nThe National Science Foundation has long supported fundamental work on neuroscience and cognition and has recognized the central importance of research in this area. With funding from the NSF Dr. Sheila Blumstein of Brown University and her collaborators will hold a workshop on \"Mind and Brain: Strategies and Directions for Future Research\" at the NSF July 18-19,2006. This workshop will bring together leaders from a broad range of fields at the intersection of neuroscience and cognition to discuss critical emerging issues at this juncture. The strategic goal of the workshop will be to develop new ideas and new directions for research that will help set the agenda for funding future research into cognition and neuroscience.",
