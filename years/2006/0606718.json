The 2006 meeting extends and enhances the results of the pre-ICADI 2003 Planning Workshop (June 2003; Royal Academy of Engineering, UK) and the main 2003 ICADI meeting in Washington, DC (December 2003), supported by BES-0332819 (jointly funded by the ENG/RAPD and CISE/Universal Access Programs). The link to the 2003 conference report: http://icadi.phhp.ufl.edu/2003/proceedings.php?track=Transportation. Support is being provided for travel costs of the leaders of the 7 Program Tracks who will make keynote presentations about the state of science and technology in their respective fields. \r\n \r\nThe 2006 ICADI conference objectives cover the important issues of concern to our nations rapidly growing population of aging individuals:\r\n\r\n1. Understanding the use of compensatory strategies such as assistive devices, smart technology, robotics, and home modifications, in promoting functional independence among frail elders.\r\n2. Recognizing the importance of a functional independence perspective relative to older persons with impairments.\r\n3. Gaining knowledge of the latest technology advances applied to the functional needs of frail elders.\r\n4. Understanding new distance-based approaches to health care: telehealth.\r\n5. Recognizing how technology can be applied to injury prevention, including falls, fire safety, poisons, pedestrian safety.\r\n6. Contrasting approaches used in other countries relative to frail elder independence needs with US approaches\r\n7. Understanding consumer perspectives on applications of technology for aging, disability and independence.\r\n\r\nPrinted and CD copies of The Proceedings of the 2006 International Conference on Aging, Disability and Independence, (ISBN Number. 0-9754784-0-3) will be distributed at the conference. And, IOS Press is to publish the full paper submissions in book form (Proceedings of the 2006 International Conference on Aging, Disability and Independence: Scientific Papers (ISBN Number 0-9754785-0-3)) that will be distributed at ICADI 2006, and also sold after the conference.",
