 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Brazil award provides support for a workshop organized by Dr. Paul F. Uhlir, National Academies of Science, to be held in Brasilia, Brazil in March of 2007.  This activity will focus on strategies for permanent access to scientific information in Latin America, focusing on health and environmental information for sustainable development.  It will take an interdisciplinary perspective and explore various scientific, legal and policy, institutional and economic, and management and technical aspects that need to be addressed to successfully implement accessible archives of digital scientific information resources relating to health and sustainable development in Latin America.\r\n\r\nThe permanent access policies and practices promoted in the Latin American region are expected to improve the availability of data and information resources in future cooperative activities between U.S researchers and those in Latin American countries.  It is hoped that this activity will stimulate openness and better stewardship of digital information resources in the region benefiting researchers in both hemispheres.  Support is from the Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Information And Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.\r\n",
