 "awd_abstract_narration": "The construction of reliable software poses one of the most significant scientific and\r\nengineering challenges of the 21st century. Professor Tony Hoare has proposed the\r\ncreation of a program verifier as a grand challenge for computer science. He has\r\noutlined an international program of research combining many disciplines such as\r\nthe theory and implementation of programming languages, formal methods, program\r\nanalysis, and automated theorem proving. In order to take on Hoares grand\r\nchallenge, an IFIP Working Conference was held over five days during Fall 2005\r\nin Zurich, Switzerland. The focus of the conference was on identifying practical\r\nsteps toward the realization of a successful program verifier. Topics discussed at\r\nthe working conference included advances in program specification, verification and\r\nrefinement tools and techniques, program analysis, tool integration, metrics, milestones,\r\nand benchmark suites. Following the working conference, panels were formed to draw up a detailed road map for research in the area of verified software.\r\nThis award, supported by the NITRD High Confidence Software and Systems interagency coordinating group, enables a series of mini-workshops to expedite the activities of these panels in drafting a comprehensive road map.\r\n",
