 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to study properties of B-mesons with the aim of extracting \r\nfundamental parameters from precision data obtained at B-factories and other \r\naccelerators. He will perform detailed calculations of B-Bbar mixing and \r\ndevelop factorization theorems for the two-body decays of B-mesons into a \r\ncharmonium state plus a light meson. In this way he plans to separate the \r\neffects of strong interaction matrix elements from those of fundamental \r\nparameters such as CKM matrix elements. \r\n\r\nIn the broader aspects of the proposal, the PI plans an active program of \r\noutreach to African-American students and other under-represented groups in \r\nDetroit schools. In particular he will establish a network of computers in \r\nthe schools which will be used to train students during the school day and \r\nto perform particle physics calculations at other times. He will also be involved in the local REU and RET programs and develop courses on the ?History of the Universe? to instruct high school teachers and students about particle physics and astrophysics and cosmology.\r\n",
