 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award furnishes travel support for participants in the Conference on Frontiers in Applied and Computational Mathematics, held in May 2006 at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.  Significant funding is allocated to support participation of students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe emphasis of this meeting is mathematical fluid dynamics.  The conference brings together mathematicians and engineers whose research interests are in the focused areas of moving boundary problems, geophysical fluid dynamics, nanofluidics, biofluid dynamics, numerical and multiscale methods, and dynamical systems.  Invited speakers include theoreticians (specialists in both modeling and analysis), scientific computation researchers, and experimentalists.  The objective is to create an environment that enables an open interchange of ideas between groups of mathematicians and scientists who would usually not be brought together in a focused fluid dynamics conference. \r\n \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis meeting provides an opportunity for interaction between leading experts and junior researchers in an important area of applied mathematics.  The conference will provide a valuable opportunity for postdocs and students to broaden their understanding and to learn about open problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nConference web page:\r\nhttp://m.njit.edu/Events/FACM06/\r\n",
