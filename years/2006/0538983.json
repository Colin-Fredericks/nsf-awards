 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will determine the performance and operating specifications for a new laser spectrometer suitable for detection of multiple trace atmospheric species. The rugged, compact sensor head will be slightly larger than a can of soda and provide below parts-per-billion (ppb) sensitivity in a few seconds, for multiple species. Sensitivity for formaldehyde, CO and acetylene will be demonstrated in Phase I. The price point with volume production will be competitive with present trace gas sensors that only detect a single species. The fully developed rugged prototypes will be suitable for detection of trace species in both ground-based and airborne atmospheric measurement applications. The selectivity and multiple species sensitivity of the spectrometer at a competitive price point will enable climate researchers to deploy a single sensor in applications where multiple sensors would previously be required. This project will result in sensors that are smaller, less expensive, and more rugged than competing technologies.\r\n\r\nToxic trace atmospheric species contaminate the environment and greenhouse gases affect global climate change. This project will have broader impacts on society by providing measurements that illuminate the trends in global climate change. Other impacts will be found in occupational safety and insuring regulatory compliance. The basic technology shall extend to other trace gas detection applications including biomedical breath diagnosis. \r\n",
