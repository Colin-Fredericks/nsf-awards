The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will support an eighteen-month research fellowship by Dr. Erin Kraal to work with Drs. Poppe de Boer, George Postma and Maarten Kleinhans, at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThe climate history of Mars is extremely uncertain; \"paleoclimate indicators\" on the Martian surface, such as valley networks, outflow channels, and lake beds, indicate a climate system capable of significant transgressions from the current cold, dry climate.  In order to understand Martian climate history, we must have a detailed understanding of water on Mars.  Alluvial fans are one Martian surface feature that can lend particular insight into the history and action of water on Mars.  Alluvial fan systems have discrete erosional and depositional areas and are \"closed\", thus allowing for detailed analysis of sediment transport dynamics.  However, current understanding of alluvial fan sediment transport does not account for the gravity scaling necessitated by the different planetary gravity on Mars.  Therefore, an accurate assessment of water and sediment fluxes in Martian fan systems is not possible.  In collaboration with Dr. M. Kleinhans, the PI is using data from her previously compiled alluvial fan data set to constrain bulk water and sediment transport for Martian alluvial fans.  In order to understand the complex timing of the system, such as interweaving regolith production with discharge to form the observed fans, the PI is working with Prof. de Boer on developing a Martian alluvial fan model.  Finally, complimenting the above theoretical work, the PI and Prof. Postma will use the Eurotank to conduct gravity and sediment scaling experiments to verify the application of the terrestrially developed sediment transport equations to other planetary systems. Using this combination of theoretical, computational modeling, and experimental experts at Utrecht University, they are integrating cutting edge terrestrial research into a new planetary data set.  The combination of planetary and terrestrial expertise will permit accurate assessment of the water volume and time scale necessary to produce Martian alluvial fans and, thus, provide important constraints on the history of water on Mars.\r\n",
