 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seven years ago, the Division of Mathematical Sciences at the National Science Foundation established the Vertical Integration of Research and Education in the Mathematical Sciences (VIGRE) to help increase the number of well-prepared U.S. citizens, nationals, and permanent residents who pursue careers in the mathematical sciences.  It is now time to report on the successes experienced through awards made by this program and to share these successes for potential adaptation by the mathematical sciences community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis project will develop two books. The first one, for faculty and administrators in departments of mathematical sciences, describes interesting successful techniques and aspects of VIGRE projects funded over the last seven years, which can be used as models and adapted for use at other colleges and universities.  A second shorter pamphlet, designed for a general audience of legislators, the National Academy of Sciences, and other NSF constituents, describes the critical issues in the development of the mathematical sciences workforce and some of the positive outcomes produced by the various VIGRE projects.\r\n",
