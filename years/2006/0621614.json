 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of the South Bay Geo-Diversity Project - Phase II are to    1) Enhance participation in the geosciences by students at National Hispanic University (NHU) and San Jose City College (SJCC) by engaging them in active learning experiences and raising their awareness of educational and career opportunities,  (2) Team with San Jose State University's MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, Science  Achievement) Program and the Latino College Preparatory Academy at NHU to provide  underrepresented middle- and high-school students with field-based enrichment activities in  the geosciences,   (3) Establish a Geologist-In-Residence program that pairs SJSU geology students with  teachers and students in local middle and high schools,   (4) Increase the quantity and quality of geoscience taught by teachers of middle and high school  by enhancing their content background and confidence level in geoscience, and by  supporting their teaching of geoscience with appropriate materials. The project contributes to geoscience education by investing in the recruitment and training of future geoscientists from underrepresented groups. It also will exploit  a unique opportunity to influence nascent curricula and programs at National Hispanic  University, an expanding Hispanic-serving institution.  The project will disseminate a model for the collaboration of a broad spectrum of community partners to improve access to the geosciences for underrepresented students. The project will increase the quantity and quality of geoscience taught by both pre-service teachers and the permanent instructors at partner schools.",
