The main aims of the Symposium are to survey the state of the art in focused areas of dispersed systems and to provide an opportunity for significant interchange between the growing Mexican fluid mechanics community and international researchers.  The Symposium will bring together leading experts in the areas of rheology, complex fluids, and finite concentration effects.  The general theme of the Symposium is built around the basic mechanics of dispersed phases systems, including drops, bubbles and particles. Such systems are of importance in a variety of technologies, ranging from very large scale processing, such as crude oil conveying and emulsion technology for waste disposal, to the relatively new areas of MEMS and microfluidics important in sophisticated high-technologies such as processing of biological materials, coatings for high-fidelity information storage applications, and the engineering of new, complex fluids with prescribed and desirable properties. The symposium has strong international representation. NSF funds will be used to facilitate participation in the Symposium by researchers from the US in the form of partial travel support.  Junior researchers will have the highest priority. The results will be broadly disseminated in the form of a special issue of the Physics of Fluids. This issue will contain both an authoritative report on the entire meeting and selected papers from the meeting.\r\n",
