The PIs will explore several different and nearly independent methods for obtaining the surface fluxes.  In one method, they will utilize an atmospheric single-column or limited-area model, both linked to a snow and ice model and driven with remote-sensing data to provide the surface stress and the surface sensible heat, latent heat, radiative, and conductive fluxes.  Surface radiative fluxes are also available from satellite data; consequently, implementation of a Bowen-ratio-energy-budget method will be explored as another route for obtaining the surface sensible and latent heat fluxes.  Finally, they will verify/update available geostrophic drag relationships with data from Ice Station Weddell, the experiment to study the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean Experiment.  Combining these relations with surface pressure fields and information on the temperature structure of the lower troposphere from TOVS will allow calculations of the surface stress.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide the polar community with improved methodologies for estimating surface stress and components of the surface energy budget from satellite measurements.  This will allow spatially extensive and temporally intensive observation of these quantities - a major contribution to an observing network.\r\n",
