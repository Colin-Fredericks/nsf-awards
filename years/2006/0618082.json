 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the Midwest Topology Seminar, a regional topology conference that has met approximately three times a year for almost forty years.  This conference series brings together topologists from across the midwest and across the various subfields of topology, providing a forum for new results and trends in topology. Sites for past and future meetings include Indiana University, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis, Northern Illinois University, Northwestern University, Ohio State University, Purdue University, Purdue University Calumet,  University of Chicago, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Kentucky, University of Michigan,  University of Minnesota, University of Notre Dame, University of Wisconsin, Wayne State University, and Western Michigan University. More information on past meetings can be found at http://www.math.wayne.edu/~rrb/MTS\r\n\r\nTopology is a core subject in mathematics with important applications to the rest of mathematics and to other sciences. This award will primarily support travel expenses for graduate students, recent PhDs, and other active research mathematicians with limited means of support.  In addition, it will allow the conference to bring in speakers from outside the geographic area to interact\r\nwith the midwest topologists and to speak about the latest developments in the field in other regions.\r\n",
