 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Shouzhong Zou of Miami University Ohio.  The study of Prof. Zou will focus on improving fuel cell technology. Prof. Zou and his students will use a new approach to fabricate model nanoparticle catalysts and study their electrocatalytic activities toward dioxygen (O2) reduction, as well as methanol and carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation, reactions that are of importance to the direct methanol fuel cell.  The new fabrication method will result in well organized uniform nanoparticle arrays, and their size, composition, as well as interparticle distance will be well controlled. This could potentially improve the electrocatalytic activity and overall performance of fuel cells. The study will provide excellent training opportunities to undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in a cutting edge interdisciplinary research field, which is of great importance to the US economy. \r\n",
