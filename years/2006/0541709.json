 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Departmental Multiuser Instrument Acquisition (CRIF:MU) Program, the Department of Chemistry the University of Minnesota will acquire a high-resolution liquid chromatograph/mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS). Research projects that will benefit from this instrumentation include studies on a) pharmaceutical pollutants in the environment; b) subcellular localization; c) mechanisms of oxygen activation by nonheme iron enzymes; d) protein prenylation; e) design of reaction catalysts using fatty acid binding proteins; e) synthesis of bioactive natural products; and f) protein-nucleic acid interactions in biological systems.\r\n\r\nLiquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation and analysis of complex mixtures. This acquisition will increase access to mass spectrometry instrumentation both to researchers and to graduate and undergraduate students by incorporation of LC/MS/MS techniques into both research and teaching, as well as providing access to several primarily undergraduate institutions.  These studies will have a solid impact in a number of areas, ranging from synthetic organic, natural products and bioinorganic chemistry to biological and environmental analyses.  \r\n\r\n",
