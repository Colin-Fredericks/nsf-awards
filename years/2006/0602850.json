This\r\ncoalition works in collaboration with federal, state, local government agencies, funded programs and\r\nprofessional and community based organizations. The Alliance is broken up into five regions located\r\nthroughout New York State: Albany, Binghamton, Buffalo, Hudson Valley and Long Island. Other\r\nparticipating campuses are: Broome, Ulster, Dutchess, Orange, Tompkins Cortland, Schenectady,\r\nNassau, Suffolk community colleges, Buffalo State, Old Westbury, and Farmingdale four year colleges.\r\nOther alliance partners are SUNY Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate and Brookhaven\r\nNational Laboratory.\r\nBuilding on our successes in Phase I and II, in Phase III we plan to continue to develop the\r\nprocesses and infrastructures that will build student achievement and advancement from\r\nundergraduate to graduate study. We plan on accomplishing this by focusing on lessons learned and\r\ncharting the future. We have learned that advancement happens through interventions at critical transition\r\npoints, provision of comprehensive longitudinal services, and support of activities that lead to academic\r\nexcellence such as achieving excellence in introductory gatekeeper courses and a developmental series\r\nof research experiences.\r\nSUNY LSAMP students are academically strong students who receive a comprehensive network\r\nof support services and who are majoring in STEM disciplines with a future goal of engineering or\r\nscientific research. Students are receiving financial support for participation in key program components\r\nwith a priority for students that are engaged in research and internship placements. Each campus also\r\nhas many outreach and educational activities that are open to all STEM students.\r\nThe goals of SUNY LSAMP Phase III are:\r\n1. To continue to build and improve the processes that increase student achievement and advancement\r\nin order to significantly increase the completion of underrepresented minority (UREP) science,\r\ntechnology, engineering and mathematics ( STEM )bachelors degrees and progression to graduate study\r\nby:\r\nContinuing to improve retention and performance of UREP students in STEM majors by providing\r\ncomprehensive academic and support services to between 400-500 students a year.\r\nProviding support at critical transition points: high school to college, lower division to upper division, 2\r\nyear to 4 year, bachelors to graduate school and graduation to workforce.\r\nBuilding on existing efforts to put together a comprehensive series of interventions that increase\r\naggregate student progression of UREP students into graduate school in STEM disciplines.\r\n2. To take a leadership role in the infrastructure changes that will institutionalize LSAMP goals on the\r\nlocal, state and national level by:\r\nContinuing to increase direct financial support for SUNY LSAMP to reach program self-sufficiency.\r\nBuilding capacity in STEM research through local and national efforts to increase research and\r\nscholarship about UREP STEM issues and export the results of research to promote national best\r\npractices.\r\nWorking as an agent of change in STEM curriculum and pedagogy.\r\nIntellectual Merit In Phase III, SUNY LSAMP will undertake a major project that will build research\r\ncapacity in STEM with a research project that will have two main foci: 1.It will examine the barriers and\r\nsupport needed to implement key support activities in order to provide a model for the delivery and\r\nadministration of support services and 2. It will identify the various factors, attitudes and experiences that\r\nlead UREP STEM students to graduate school and on to the professoriate in order to integrate those\r\npractices that help increase the number of students entering the pathway to graduate school\r\nBroader Impact The projects mission is to disseminate best practices from the program evaluation and\r\nthe research project on the state and national level through the National Center for Inclusive Education\r\nhoused at Stony Brook, the program web site and through the production of scholarly articles and\r\npresentations at relevant conferences about UREP STEM recruitment and retention issues. The\r\nemphasis on the success of under-represented groups will help to produce an inclusive high technology\r\nworkforce crucial to this country.",

Phase III of the project started in 2006 and was completed in 2011. \n\nEnrollment and Degree Production\n\nIn Phase III, and since its inception in 1996, SUNY LSAMP has made great strides in enrollment and degree production. UREP STEM   undergraduate enrollment increased 87.5% from the baseline in Phase III and 451% from project inception. UREP STEM bachelor\u00c6s degrees have increased 42.2 % from the Phase III baseline and 138% since project inception. Since 1997, 5468 UREP STEM students have received Bachelor\u00c6s Degrees, with 2170 received during Phase III. Since 1997, 745 UREP STEM students have received Master\u00c6s Degree. Since 1997, 183 UREP STEM students have received Doctoral Degrees\n\nProgram Components\n\nSUNY LSAMP has developed a comprehensive program to recruit, retain and prepare SUNY LSAMP students for graduate school by providing academic, social and professional support and helping students make effective transitions from high school to college, two year to four year college and undergraduate to graduate school. Some key examples of these services include Bridge Summer Programs for pre-freshmen and transfer students, peer and professional mentoring and tutoring, workshops in STEM gatekeeper courses, preparation for and placement in cutting edge research and assistance helping students gain admission to STEM graduate programs.\n\n\n\n\nResearch on the Effectiveness of Student Support Services \n\nNSF awarded SUNY LSAMP a grant to undergo research about the effectiveness of student support services and issues that affect student choice of graduate study. Project results have been disseminated through scholarly articles and presentations at conferences. The project has worked towards creating models of best practices in UREP STEM education in these areas: \n\n-  Organizational structures that promote program efficiency and effectiveness; \n\n-  The importance of undergraduate research;\n\n-  Analysis of factors that create effective tutoring and course-related workshops;  \n\n-  The importance of process workshops and freshman success courses; \n\n-  The role of community building, advising and social support; \n\n-  Key factors that build interest in and future success in Graduate School\n\nContinuation to STEM Graduate School\n\nDuring Phase III, 35.3% of graduating SUNY LSAMP Level 1 students continued on to STEM graduate study and twenty six SUNY LSAMP graduates have received doctorates.\n\nBridge to the Doctorate Activity\n\nDuring Phase III, SUNY LSAMP has received five grants for the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate Activity. The programs have been fully enrolled with 136 applicants for 60 spots. The programs had a 96.6% retention rate and students had an average GPA of 3.25. Seven students ** have completed STEM doctorates. Thirty students have completed masters, a completion rate of 89.2% (with the balance scheduled to complete in 2012). Thirty one students are currently in or have completed doctoral programs (53.3%) (** Since the first BD cohorts started in 2006, students are just beginning to complete doctorates).\n\nEconomic Impact\n\nSUNY LSAMP has gained support from state, corporate, and federal sources. These funds have provided funding for program staff, space and materials to run programs and for student stipends. In Phase III for example we have received campus funding of over $ 7 million, funding from collaborative grants that work directly with SUNY LSAMP of over $ 4 million and corporate funding of over $50 thousand. \n\nSocietal Impact\n\nSUNY LSAMP graduates have been leaders in STEM education, research and in the high technology workplace- setting policy, performing cutting edge research, inven..."
