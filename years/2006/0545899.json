 "awd_abstract_narration": "The resource constraints of mobile devices put strict limits on the utility and quality of wireless applications in an increasingly nomadic world. While there has been an abundance of previous work on resource management, there has been a dearth of research to address the complex problem of resource interdependencies for mobile systems. For example, most modern mobile devices employ multiple techniques to reduce their energy requirements, however, these techniques focus on individual resources and are unaware of the effects their deployment may have on other resources and application performance. Further, in distributed systems, devices typically are selfish in the sense that they manage their own resources without considering the consequences for resources and applications on remote devices. This NSF CAREER research project is developing both, an experimental framework for investigating these interdependencies and design issues, and new service concepts to provide resource management solutions that enable the efficient integration of multiple constraints, resources, and devices. The new approach, dubbed judicious resource management, moves away from traditional, isolated resource management solutions and focuses on the prevention of unanticipated side effects of interdependent resource adaptations.  The broader impacts of this project include an experimental setting that should serve as catalyst for future research on distributed resource management, paving the way for new classes of protocols, management techniques, and approaches to integrate them. This work closely integrates research and education activities, using a single experimental test bed for research, education, and outreach efforts.\r\n\r\n",

However, if wireless infrastructure (such as cell towers or base stations) fails, these mobile devices are often rendered useless. In this project, the goal was to develop the tools required to establish direct device-to-device communication when wireless infrastructure is unavailable, destroyed, or of poor quality (e.g., after a disaster).\n\nThe resulting SPIRIT framework allows mobile devices to discover and connect to other mobile devices in their proximity, reliably propagate data between SPIRIT peers, even over multiple hops. Using these \"multi-hop\" communications, it is possible for devices to share data even if they are not in direct reach. The key outcomes of the SPIRIT framework are its robustness and resource efficiency features.\n\nRobustness. SPIRIT peers can maintain communications even when all devices are mobile. It does so by employing a robust publish-subscribe approach, where a publisher (a data source) and its subscribers (one or more data sinks) maintain connectivity over multiple hops using frequent location updates exchanged between each other.
