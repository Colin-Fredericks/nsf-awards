 "awd_abstract_narration": "Karst aquifiers represent a very significant source of water for  \r\npublic and private use. A Karst aquifer, in addition to a porous  \r\nlimestone matrix, typically has large cavernous conduits that are  \r\nknown to largely control groundwater flow and contaminant transport  \r\nwithin the aquifer. We will develop a new modeling approach for water  \r\nflow and contaminant transport in conduit/matrix systems. The flow in  \r\nthe conduits will be described by the Navier-Stokes equations and  \r\nthat in the matrix by Darcy's law. Convection-diffusion equations are  \r\nused to describe the solute transport in the two regions. The  \r\nconditions applied at the conduit/matrix interface are novel. We will  \r\nsubject the new Navier-Stokes/Darcy model to rigorous mathematical  \r\nanalyses, studying such issues as existence of solutions and  \r\ncontinuous dependence on data. This represents the first such study  \r\nof this kind. Analyses will also be used to take advantage of the  \r\nmultiscale character of flows in Karst aquifiers to derive fully  \r\njustified model simplifications that will result in less costly  \r\ncomputational algorithms. We will also develop mixed Galerkin and  \r\nleast-squares finite element methods for the coupled Navier-Stokes/ \r\nDarcy model along with a coupled convection-diffusion model for the  \r\ntransport of contaminants.  Experiments will be a crucial aspect of  \r\nthe proposed project. They will be used to obtain information about  \r\nflows and contaminant migration in conduit/matrix systems that can  \r\nnot only be useful to water resource managers and policy makers, but  \r\nalso for the development and validation of mathematical models and  \r\ncomputational algorithms.\r\n\r\nCertainly, advances in our quantitative knowledge of Karst aquifers  \r\nwill greatly help in their administration, including the delineation  \r\nof source-water protection areas for public water supplies and the  \r\ndesign of monitoring programs to evaluate the residence and fate of  \r\ncontaminant plumes. More generally, the methodologies we will produce  \r\ncan also impact other underground fluid flow problems including some  \r\narising in the petroleum industry. The proposed project will provide  \r\na vehicle for the bona fide interdisciplinary training of students  \r\nand postdoctoral researchers. They will gain the ability to make  \r\naccurate quantitative assessments of aquifiers and thus can provide  \r\nindustrial administrators and governmental officials with the  \r\ninformation they need to make sound policy decisions.\r\n",
