 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been award to Dr. Melanie Stiassny and Robert Schelly of the American Museum of Natural History in collaboration with Dr. Daniel Graf of the Academy of Natural Sciences to study the diversity of aquatic organisms, particularly the fishes and freshwater mussels, of the Lower Congo River in west-Central Africa. The spectacular and poorly known location of the Lower Congo River and the biological richness it harbors, combined with the growing threats to the region make this a compelling focus for scientific exploration and inventory in Africa. In the study region the Lower Congo River is punctuated by some of the most spectacular rapids on Earth and the extraordinary hydrology of the river represents a model system for exploring underlying patterns of aquatic species richness and endemism. With large collections of specimens and tissues gathered in this study it will be possible for the first time to use molecular techniques combined with the latest developments in remote sensing technology to address some of the pressing questions concerning the evolutionary history and ecological interactions of aquatic organisms in the Lower Congo rapids as well as providing critical biodiversity data for conservation planning and global freshwater biodiversity assessments. \r\n\r\n           For millions of Congolese living along the Lower Congo the health of these freshwater systems, and of the diverse communities of organisms that reside in them are of major importance. Increasing urbanization and agricultural activities have resulted in significant habitat destruction, yet the impacts of these factors on the region's freshwater fishes has not previously been studied or documented. In addition to basic survey and inventory a central component of the collaboration between the American Museum of Natural History and Academy of Natural Sciences is educational outreach and student training; not only of American students and public, but also of Congolese researchers and students. The project represents a synergistic collaboration between US and Congolese scientists with potential to build lasting infrastructure and capacity support in Congo, and advancing training opportunities for US students in African biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThis award is cofunded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n",
