The IMSE program begins with multiple proven bridge and support activities provided by Focus: HOPE including a remedial math and reading program; an industry-certified training programs in network administration, network installation, and desktop and server administration; professionaldevelopment workshops; a student loan program; a community food bank; and an on-site child-care program. The second part of the IMSE program combines a Bachelor of Arts in Information Systems and Technology offered by Wayne State University WSU) with a coordinated support program. The coordinated support plan at WSU includes tutoring and mentoring programs, culturally sensitive advising, emerging scholars sections of introductory programming courses, social networking, and participation in industry internships and academic research.\r\n",

It has led to better integration and coordination of efforts to reach minority students across the campus and will serve as a model that can be copied by other departments.  Moreover, the IMSE program, together with Focus: HOPE expertise has led to a greater \"recipe of best practices\" that has been expanded to support pre-engineering bridge training at Focus: HOPE.
