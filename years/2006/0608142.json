 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Gregory H. Robinson, Chemistry Department, University of Georgia, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for the synthesis and study of gallenpins. Gallenpins are seven member cyclic compounds related to tropylium ions by the replacement of one ring carbon by a gallium.  These species will contain 6 pi-electrons and be neutral aromatic compounds. Ring closure reactions will be used to prepare a variety of gallepin molecules, including simple gallepins, benzogallepins, dibenzogallepins, non-aromatic annelated gallepins, and fuzed ring gallepins.  The reaction chemistry of these molecules will be examined in order to determine if it is possible to stabilize a Ga-Ga bond between two gallepins, if the metalloaromatic character of gallepin rings affects such Ga-Ga bonds, if there is a correlation between metalloaromatic character of the gallepin ring and the chemistry of\r\ngallium-transition metal bonds, and if it is possible to synthesize bis(gallepin)-transition metal sandwich compounds.\r\n \r\nAromaticity is one of the most important concepts in explaining the chemistry of cyclic organic compounds that contain delocalized pi electrons. This project aims at preparing aromatic compounds that contain the main group metal, gallium, and to extend the concept of aromaticity beyond the confines of carbon to a region where metals play a more prominent role. Undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students will be engaged in this project. They will develop skills in a wide range of synthetic and physical methods. These students will include members of underrepresented groups.\r\n",
