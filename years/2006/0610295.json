 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of the neural basis of behavior typically use time-varying stimuli and produce time-varying neuronal responses. Statistically, the setting involves both continuous multiple time series and inhomogeneous point processes, sometimes dozens or hundreds of them observed simultaneously. There are many challenging analytical issues, including that of combining information obtained from multiple modalities (EEG, fMRI, MEG, and extracellular recordings). The third workshop Statistical Analysis of Neuronal Data will be devoted to discussion of these issues.\r\n\r\nThe Statistical Analysis of Neuronal Data (SAND) workshops are held in even years in Pittsburgh, PA. The third workshop is planned for May 11--13, 2006. SAND3 will bring together neurophysiologists, statisticians, physicists, and computer scientists who are interested in quantitative analysis of neuronal data. In addition to four scientific sessions, we will run a pair of half-day short courses to provide relevant background on neurophysiological data, for statisticians, and in state-of-the-art statistics for experimentalists.  This workshop series aims to define important problems in neuronal data analysis and useful strategies for attacking them; foster communication between experimental neuroscientists and those trained in statistical and computational methods encourage young researchers, including graduate students, to present their work; expose young researchers to important challenges and opportunities in this interdisciplinary domain, while providing a small meeting atmosphere to facilitate the interaction of young researchers with senior colleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
