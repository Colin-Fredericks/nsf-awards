 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a meeting to discuss scientific results from the recent Megacities Initiative: Local and Global Research Observations (MILAGRO) campaign.  MILAGRO was a large set of complementary and coordinated experiments sponsored by NSF, NASA, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and Mexican government agencies that took place in March 2006.  It was conducted by a collaboration of investigators from 49 universities and other institutions to study the atmosphere in and around Mexico City and examine the evolution of gas phase species, aerosols, and radiative properties from local to regional and hemispheric scales.  This meeting is for presentations and discussions of the data and to determine future actions including publications and other meetings.  The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research/Joint Office for Science Support (UCAR/JOSS) will provide hotel contracting, meeting planning, online registration, meeting document preparation and printing, website development and support, and onsite support staff for a 2.5 day science workshop at the Millennium Harvest House in Boulder, CO from October 23 - 25, 2006 with an estimated 200 attendees.  This award will cover expenses related to the workshop including registration, catering, AV rental, meeting room, poster board rental, reception, breaks, CD preparation, and internet access.",
