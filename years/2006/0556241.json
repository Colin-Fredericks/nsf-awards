 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports research to measure the weak charge of the proton and then use that\r\nmeasurement to investigate new aspects of the Standard Model of fundamental matter and\r\ninteractions. The Standard Model describes three of the four forces of nature in an elegant\r\nmanner; those three forces are the electromagnetic interaction, the weak interaction, and\r\nthe strong interaction. The weak charge of the proton is a basic property, like its electric\r\ncharge and mass, which determines the proton's response to the weak interaction. It is also\r\nrelated to how the weak and electromagnetic interactions mix with each other. Because\r\nthe Standard Model makes well dened predictions of how that mixing varies with the\r\namount of momentum that is exchanged in an interaction, with only one set of very precise\r\nmeasurements existing at very high values of momentum transfer, a precise measurement\r\nof the proton's weak charge at a low value of momentum transfer is a rigorous test of the\r\nStandard Model. Additionally, it is sensitive to physics not yet included in the Standard\r\nModel.\r\nThe Qweak experiment at JLab will carry out this precise measurement by scattering\r\npolarized electrons from protons and measuring the rate at which they scatter. Extracting\r\nthe weak charge of the proton from this scattering will require delicate calibrations with\r\nspecialized equipment. The research group supported by this grant is developing a detector\r\nthat will trigger all the other detectors of the calibration phase, as well as integrating all\r\ncomponents of the calibration phase. Both hardware and software issues will be addressed in\r\nthis project so the students and postdoctoral researchers will gain a wide range of valuable\r\nskills.\r\n",
