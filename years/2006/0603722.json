 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will study the long time behavior of solutions of \r\ndispersive partial differential equations under time dependent \r\nperturbations. The focus will be on the Linear and Nonlinear Schroedinger \r\nEquation in the regimes in which it supports bound states (periodic \r\nin time, localized in space solutions). The perturbation is expected to \r\nredistribute the energy among the bound state and transfer part of it to \r\nradiation. A rigorous description of this process will be sought. For this \r\npurpose the PI will develop novel mathematical techniques for studying the \r\nevolution of both the radiation field and the bound states. The tools are \r\nexpected to generalize to other dispersive equations like Klein-Gordon, \r\nSine-Gordon and Korteweg - de Vries.\r\n\r\nThe Schroedinger Equation is a well established model for a variety of \r\nphysical phenomena and engineering processes. For example, dispersion \r\nmanaged optical fibers used in high bit rate telecommunications consist of \r\nconcatenated pieces of fiber with different material properties. As the \r\nlight pulses pass through them they suffer two main transformations. On \r\none hand they are kept from spreading out which is desirable. On the other \r\nhand they loose energy to radiation. Striking the right balance between \r\nthe two effects is a design problem to which the PI plans to contribute. \r\nThe second example is related to the new ideas on generating matter waves \r\nout of particles in a special phase (Bose-Einstein Condensates) by \r\ncontrolled variation of their environment. The stability and long time \r\nbehavior of these waves is not well understood and will be investigated in \r\nthe project. The third example concerns radar detection through \r\nfluctuating media. On one hand, due to the random fluctuations, the signal \r\nreflected by the target that reaches the detector tends to contain more \r\ninformation compared to a signal that propagates through a stationary \r\nmedium. On the other hand, the same fluctuations tend to radiate out of \r\nthe environment both the direct and reflected signal. A better qualitative \r\nand quantitative understanding of the second phenomena is one of the goals \r\nof this project.",
