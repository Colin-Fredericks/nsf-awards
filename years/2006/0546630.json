 "awd_abstract_narration": "With increasing demand for real-time multimedia services such as TV channel broadcasting, and fast download requirements by applications such as P2P, video-on-demand, and software downloads, the access network design needs to treat point-to-multipoint and multipoint-to-point traffic as first class citizens for efficient operation.  The high level objective of this project is to design networking protocols over realistic time-varying channels for supporting data dissemination in wireless mesh-networks.  These networks are characterized by wireless backbones as opposed to the dominant wired backbones connecting today's wireless access-points.  This research is based on the novel paradigm of on-the-fly computation, where recent data-driven channel measurements are used to exploit time-variance of channels for enhanced performance.  This research will enable support for emerging media-rich applications that will result in the wide-scale deployment of mesh-networks to provide ubiquitous multi-media enriched services.  It will make tangible impacts to several active research areas including mesh-networks, wireless local area networks, and ad-hoc networks.  To promote education, training and learning, this effort will actively involve undergraduates, women and minority students.",
