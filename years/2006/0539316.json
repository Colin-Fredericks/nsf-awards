 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new\r\npassivation technique, derived from a recent discovery that semiconductors can be\r\nreadily hydrogenated by simultaneous exposure to hydrogen gas and ultra-violet light.\r\nThe technique has a number of advantages over conventional glow discharge\r\nhydrogenation, is immediately applicable to processes requiring selective area\r\npassivation, and does not require contact masks. The company  has teamed with Raytheon Vision Systems (RVS) to develop the technique for fabrication of high performance near-infrared (NIR)- HgCdTe avalanche-photodiode arrays (APD) on large area silicon wafers, heretofore not feasible due to the threading dislocations that arise from the large lattice mismatch between HgCdTe and Si. Such defects in HgCdTe can be passivated by hydrogenation but the process through which RVS grows the integrated diode structures necessitates that hydrogenation be performed on fully processed diode arrays, presenting an ideal application for both the development and demonstration of this technology. Phase I therefore, will provide a definitive demonstration of the technology, an immediate solution to the realization of low cost HgCdTe APD's on Si, and a clearly\r\nidentified roll-out customer at the end of Phase II to license the technology.\r\n\r\nCommercially, the selective area defect passivation technology developed here\r\nhas the potential to fundamentally change the way NIR APD arrays are produced (and\r\nused) and could enable RVS to realize monolithic HgCdTe APDs on Si.\r\nHgCdTe APDs and APD arrays offer unique advantages for high-performance\r\neyesafe LADAR sensors. These include: operation at room temperature, low-excess\r\nnoise, high gain, high-quantum efficiency at eyesafe wavelengths, GHz bandwidth, and\r\nhigh-packing density. The ability to grow on Si will significantly reduce the cost of these\r\nsystems, and make them more generally available for civil transport, aviation, and robotic\r\nvision systems.\r\n",
