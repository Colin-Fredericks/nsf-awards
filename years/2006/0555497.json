 "awd_abstract_narration": "The probe afforded by a beam of linearly-polarized photons allows \r\none to gain access to several observables in photonucleon reactions, \r\nwhich otherwise would not be measureable.  This polarization axis \r\nof the photon beam breaks the azimuthal symmetry of the reaction, \r\nthereby introducing an azimuthal dependence in the differential \r\ncross section.   This additional information on the angular dependence \r\nopens the door to the measurement of a host of observables which are \r\naccessible only with a beam of linearly-polarized photons; consequently \r\nit provides important constraints on the nature of the photon-nucleon \r\nreaction.   Such polarization observables are necessary for extracting \r\nthe spin/parity of the broadly overlapping baryon resonances.  Two PhD \r\nstudents at Idaho State University will analyze the g8b data set from \r\nHall B of JLab.  Their thesis topics will primarily focus on the search \r\nfor baryon resonances (N*s) that decay though either the rho meson or \r\nhyperon channel, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PI has been very active in coordinating research efforts with nuclear \r\nphysicists in Latin America.  Over the past six years, he has been awarded \r\nfive NSF grants, which serve to promote dialog among faculty members and \r\nstudents of North American and South American institutions.  Through these \r\nefforts, he seeks to strengthen existing links and forge new ones within \r\nthe broad scope of the international nuclear physics community.  Such \r\nacademic relationships, moreover, will further serve to strengthen the \r\nscientific research program between our respective continents.  The PI \r\nexpects to use this NSF award as a platform towards attracting additional \r\ngrant money for these broader impact activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
