Silicon defects are a pressing problem for hardware parts, mainly because of the shrinking of transistors sizes down to a few tens of nanometers. The proposal attacks this goal from a few angles: first it develops a framework for the analysis of the impact and exposure risks associated with a range of silicon failures. In this context, the types of failures analyzed are:  1) soft-errors, that is, transient faults due to energy particles present in the atmosphere, which are estimated to be relevant for silicon technologies in the next few years;  2) manufacturing defects due to the imprecision of  manufacturing small scale transistor parts; and 3) wear-out failures, due to  the weakening of transistors as they approach nanometer sizes. The second goal of the proposal develops software to support the analysis and evaluation of a range of potential future scenarios, which include these types of failures. \r\n\r\nFinally, the third goal of this proposal develops two experimental microprocessor designs which explore two solutions points in the resilient systems design space: one design can sustain a medium to high level of defects, while the other can sustain only the first failure but with a minimum cost and performance impacts.\r\n",
