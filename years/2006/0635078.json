 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract of project: Efficient algorithms and data structures via geometric realizations\r\nAssaf Naor\r\nWhen one needs to perform an algorithmic task on a large data set it is often the case that the best\r\nway to fathom the massive amount of information contained in the data is to visualize it geometrically. By\r\nrepresenting the input as a geometric object one can observe certain helpful features, such as clusters or\r\nlow-dimensional structures within the data, and harness this structural information to solve the algorithmic\r\nproblem at hand. In recent years the geometric approach to the design of algorithms has been greatly enhanced\r\nby the use of powerful methods from modern mathematics. This research project is at the frontier\r\nboth for mathematics and computer science. Using ideas from analysis and geometry, combined with modern\r\nalgorithmic methods and intuitions, the investigator's study will lead to advances on central algorithmic\r\nprimitives for a wide variety of tasks ranging from combinatorial optimization and machine learning to\r\ninformation retrieval and bioinformatics.\r\nThe goal of this research is to embed data into a well understood geometric object (such as Euclidean\r\nspace), so that certain essential features of it are preserved. This makes it possible to harness intuitions and\r\nmethods that were not available before the embedding was performed. The investigator will develop new\r\nmathematical tools for the study of algorithms for partitioning and clustering large networks, techniques for\r\ndimensionality reduction, constructions of compact representations of data, and methods for fast similarity\r\nsearch and classification. The proposed research will be of interest to computational scientists in a broad\r\nrange of areas. The connection between mathematics and computer science will be deepened in order to\r\ndisseminate powerful new ideas for algorithm design.\r\n1",
