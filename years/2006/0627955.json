 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support the travel and expenses of several students that will attend the \"Granulites and Granulites 2006\" conference in Brasilia, Brazil, July 10-12, 2006.  This international meeting will have participants from more than 25 countries outside of Brazil and it is dedicated to a review of the metamorphic evolution and tectonics, and significance in crustal evolution of granulites. The conference in Brasilia will include invited presentations across the spectrum of issues that relate to lower crustal processes, as well as contributed talks and posters that will provide up-to-date summaries of significant advances from granulites facies terranes worldwide. \r\n\r\nThis conference support will provide the opportunity for young scientists to interact in the conference and in the field with senior scientists from many countries that otherwise would not be possible.  Students will also undertake fieldwork in a region of high-pressure granulites (the Andrelandia sequence, Minas Gerais) and a region of ultrahigh temperature granulites (Barro-Alto and Anapolis-Itaucu Complexes, Goias). Finally, they will have the opportunity to take a state-of-the-art short course in the use of THERMOCALC in metamorphic petrology prior to the pre-conference field trip. Students from a number of different research groups across the US will be given this opportunity and will benefit intellectually and socially from the opportunity to participate in the conference and associated activities. \r\n",
