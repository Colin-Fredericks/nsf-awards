 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs (NSF/OPP) has determined a requirement for systems engineering and technical assistance (SETA) to support the technical, operational, and program management of the United States Antarctic Program.  NSF has determined that these requirements can be satisfied via sources obtainable via the Small Business Administration 8(a) set-aside program for small minority-owned businesses.\r\n\r\nNSF has obtained the services of LJT & Associates, Inc. of Huntsville, AL (Columbia, MD office) for these services.  The company's engineering subject matter expertise and prior experience systems engineering under a prior award for similar services is a key consideration in recommending this new set-aside award.  The follow-on contract represents a continuation of specific task orders initially awarded under the prior set-aside contract with LJT.  A total of 8 task orders were bid in response to the NSF contract solicitation and are under evaluation for full or partial award at a later date.\r\n\r\nThis award is intended to initialize the contract and formalize the award.  Subsequent task orders will be issued against the contract for specific scopes of work.  \r\n\r\nAn initial award value of  $1 is recommended to inaugurate the contract. \r\n",
