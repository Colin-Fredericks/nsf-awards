 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract :\r\n\r\nPreventing progressive collapse in structures is a gravely important problem for society, particularly in light of recent terror attacks. This Career proposal presents an integrated research and education plan for analysis of progressive collapse of structures. Progressive collapse is a system-level phenomenon where the spread of an initial local failure results in the collapse of an entire structure, or a disproportionately large part of it. Progressive collapse resistant engineering requires knowledge of system-level behavior, but there is very little actual data because system-level tests are prohibitively expensive. This Career project will utilize innovative and low-cost methods to collect, use, and analyze field data from full-scale structures slated for demolition by implosion. Specifically, the PI will instrument and monitor the performance of five RC structures to be demolished by implosion during the grant period. A wealth of new data will be collected and form the basis of a framework for mitigating progressive collapse. Such an effort will be a major step forward for collapse resistance engineering and toward providing society with a physical infrastructure that is safe and robust.\r\n\r\nData collected from full-scale experiments will be used to develop new knowledge in the following areas of system-level collapse behavior:1) Capacity: Failure criteria for reinforced concrete (RC) components and systems will be expanded to account for extreme deformations, system effects, and rate dependence; 2) Demand: Analytical techniques and tools for predicting post-failure response will be evaluated, verified, and improved; 3) Performance: Current practice for progressive collapse prevention will be evaluated and more reliable procedures will be developed; 4) Multihazard risk: Procedures will be developed to relate potential progressive collapse of structures subjected to man-made hazards and the design levels for natural hazards. The project will incorporate its research products into a comprehensive education plan targeting university students, practitioners of engineering and architecture, as well as high school teachers and students. The system-level nature of progressive collapse makes it imperative to include multiple disciplines, as well as multiple levels of understanding. The plan will address not only quantitative engineering tools but also qualitative conceptual reasoning. To enhance both types of understanding, the project will build on the user-friendly computer program Arcade. The extended program will be capable of three-dimensional analysis and visualization of response of structures up to collapse.  A better understanding and assessment of the mechanisms used to arrest progressive collapse of structures, improving the design of new buildings and prioritizing buildings for rehabilitation may save numerous lives and money. University students will participate in an innovative annual competition for predicting collapse of small-scale RC models and learn about progressive collapse of structures by utilizing a new computer program. The program will also be used to train architects about the impact of architectural decisions on structural safety and collapse behavior. Workshops targeted to engineers and architects will be developed in collaboration with an advisory committee. An interactive website will be developed to report research outcomes and educational materials. In collaboration with CESAME and the Northeastern RET program, the website and related educational material will be introduced to high schools. This project will:  1) Conduct annual competitions for students to evaluate collapse of physical models of RC systems; 2)Provide engineers with the required understanding and tools for collapse analysis of structures; 3)Help architects learn about building characteristics affecting resistance to progressive collapse; 4) Develop modules and a mini-unit course to be taught in universities and high schools.\r\n.\r\n\r\n",
