 "awd_abstract_narration": "This pilot project establishes and implements a professional development model with teachers of Native American students by creating a culturally relevant science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) teacher in-service model for 30 grade 4-6 teachers from schools from two nations in Utah.  The in-service program relies on community advisory panels, current standards and best practices in science, mathematics and technology education, by implementing engineering and technology education activities as a means of teaching science and mathematics.  The goal is to improve teacher preparation in science and mathematics for Native Americans by creating culturally relevant curriculum materials with the help of community advisory panels and providing each teacher participant with at least 100 hours of structured professional development.  The long-range goal is to develop an in-service model that can be transported to other Native American nations and schools.  STEM and education faculty, community teachers, parents and leaders, as well as, tribal elders are to work together to assure the professional development model and materials are developed in a culturally inclusive manner.  The evidence-based outcome of this project is that Native American students effectively learn mathematics and science with the longer-term influence being improvement in student achievement.",
