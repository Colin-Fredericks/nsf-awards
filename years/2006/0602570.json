 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Materials World Network award to University of Wisconsin-Madison is a joint research and education program between Professor Nicholas Abbott at University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA and Professor Frank Caruso at University of Melbourne, Australia.  This award is co-funded by the Solid State Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, and the East Asia and Pacific Program in the Office of International Science and Engineering. The research builds from prior observations made by the US scientist that cooperative ordering transitions in liquid crystals can be coupled to the assembly of surfactants, lipids, and proteins at interfaces between thermotropic liquid crystals and immiscible aqueous phases, thus providing a novel means by which to dynamically amplify these interfacial events into optical signals. The scientific goals of the research are motivated by the proposition that multilayer films of polyelectrolytes (PEMS) offer a general and facile method to control the nanometer-scale structure and chemical functionality of aqueous-liquid crystals interfaces.  Fundamental questions regarding the interfacial properties of liquid crystals and polymers will be investigated, including questions regarding their dynamic properties and the coupling of order between these materials.  In addition, this award will facilitate exchanges of graduate students and young researchers between University of Wisconsin and University of Melbourne. As both campuses host substantial research on nanoscale science and engineering, this project also provides a bridge between two international communities of researchers working in the field of nanoscale science and engineering. \r\n\r\nThe topic proposed in this grant application lies at the natural intersection of the expertise of the US team in characterizing the ordering of liquid crystals near interfaces and the Australian research teams deep and detailed knowledge of methods used to prepare and characterize polyelectrolyte multilayers.  With this award, significant advances would be made in understanding the permeability of multilayer polyelectrolytes films that are essential for the rational development of technologies requiring selective transport of molecules in sensors, separations or drug delivery systems. The research described in this proposal will provide outstanding educational opportunities for US graduate students and the broader academic community at US. Through these exchanges, they will also have the unusual opportunity to experience scientific cultures and practices outside of the United States.\r\n",
