 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on new paradigms and techniques for designing secure authentication protocols \r\r\nwith an emphasis on settings when existing methods are simply unsuitable or inapplicable.\r\r\nAs examples, research of the PI supported by this grant addresses the authentication of human subjects using passwords or \r\r\nbiometric data; the design of highly-efficient cryptographic primitives suitable for use by severely resource-constrained devices;\r\r\nand the use of bandwidth-limited authenticated channels for secure key establishment.\r\r\n\r\r\nThis research is intended both to establish firm theoretical foundations for these problems, as well\r\r\nas to develop provably-secure and practical protocols based on what is learned.\r\r\nThe results of this research are expected to be applicable to a wide range of problems, including the authentication of\r\r\n\"cheap\" RFID tags or sensors, authentication of human users via biometric features, and improved security for wireless home networks and \r\r\nmobile wireless devices.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe educational component of this proposal centers on introducing students to the principles of modern cryptography and \r\r\ncomputer security. This is accomplished, in part, via curriculum development, broad dissemination of course materials \r\r\nincluding detailed lecture notes, and involvement of students --- at both the undergraduate and graduate levels --- in \r\r\nresearch projects related to this work.\r\r\n\r\r\n",
