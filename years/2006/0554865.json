 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will model the relationships of critical infrastructure in a community, and in particular the cascading effects of loss of key components in the system. The effort will focus on the Hurricane Katrina experience to provide a test bed for the examination of key factors and linkages in the effects of cascading failures as a result of a disaster. The research design will utilize three essential techniques: Key informant interviews, Case study, and Probabilistic modeling.  Upon conclusion of the work, the research should provide a clearer understanding of the interrelatedness of key urban infrastructure systems during crisis events.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the research will have a direct effect on three specific areas: 1) creating a better understanding of the interrelated vulnerability of infrastructure systems; 2) creating a more robust picture of the \"ripple\" effects that occurs in key infrastructure systems; and 3) increasing our ability to model \"resiliency\" in a community by identifying critical inputs in the development of fragility curves across systems.\r\n\r\nThe results will have implications for hazards mitigation planning and research with respect to natural and technologically-induced disaster events, as well as direct implications for Homeland Security efforts. In both cases, a clearer understanding of the vulnerability and potential resiliency of a community's infrastructure will provide insight into the best allocation of resources to improve capacity and preparedness.\r\n",
