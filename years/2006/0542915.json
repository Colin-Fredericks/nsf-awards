 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this research is to provide a clearer view of metabolic networks in living organisms. The research will be focused on the metabolism of quinic acid in the bread mold Neurospora crassa.  The mold's metabolic behavior will be examined during a change from sucrose, which is a favorable nutrient, to quinic acid, a less desirable nutrient. The metabolic response of the mold will be monitored by measuring the organism's messenger ribonucleic acid levels by using molecular and computational biology methods.  Altogether, the information produced in this research will provide the basis for the identification of currently described metabolic networks and reveal new interacting networks in living organisms.\r\n\r\nThere are many unanswered questions about the regulation of an organism's metabolic network.  In addition, the connection between a specific network and the entire metabolic network in living things is not firmly established.  The approach in this project will expand the knowledge of metabolic regulation in the bread mold N. crassa to include many organisms.  The information revealed in this research will provide more knowledge of what makes a living thing function and establish a foundation for future investigations on the metabolic behavior of life.  The impact on the education of underrepresented students is clear as this project will provide excellent training and mentoring for young scientists and assist them in making career choices in the field of biology and other scientific disciplines.",
