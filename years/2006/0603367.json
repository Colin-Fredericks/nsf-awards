 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is to address the critical workforce shortages in advanced manufacturing technology through the recruitment and retention of students from middle school to high school and post secondary levels through a) marketing, b) recruitment, c) mentoring, and d) updating manufacturing curriculum. The target audience for this proposal is students that study advanced manufacturing technology at the middle school, high school, and community college levels. Female and minority students receive special outreach and mentoring. \r\n\r\nThe National Coalition for Advanced Manufacturing recommended in a 2003 report \"Manufacturing Skills Crisis: Solutions for this National Challenge\" outreach efforts to children at an earlier age. The report emphasizes that middle school students should be exposed to career pathways as a first step into career decision making and that delaying may preclude students from the required academic courses and allows time for the outdated stereotypes to take hold, thus eliminating manufacturing as a career choice option. The project is also enlightening parents and teachers as to the current realities of manufacturing utilizing a grassroots, personal approach. \r\n\r\n",
