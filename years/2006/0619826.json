 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nPacific Lutheran University will acquire a new atomic force microscope (AFM). The instrument will consist of a control station, a multi-mode scanning probe microscope, and two probe scanners to allow various modes of acquisition with vertical sample engagement. This state-of-the-art AFM will be used in multiple undergraduate research programs to address a wide range of scientific questions at the nanoscale, including: the investigation of various copolymer additives used in polymer blend thin films where measurements of the surface topology and roughness will aid in the understanding of compatibilization in polymer blends; the study of lipid membrane-bound amphipathic cationic antimicrobial peptides called piscidins resulting in a better understanding of the mechanism of action used by piscidins against pathogens; the characterization of aggregated gold nanoparticles to correlate morphology with surface enhancement factors for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The microscope will be integrated into our undergraduate curriculum and include exposure to nanoscience by first year through fourth year undergraduate students. Lastly, the microscope will also be incorporated into outreach workshops in our department for underrepresented high school students in the MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement) program.\r\n\r\nLay Abstract\r\n\r\nThe atomic force microscope has become a very important instrument in science and engineering by providing a method to visualize scientific samples on surfaces at the nanoscale. Many current products as well as progress in the development of new materials are directly related to our understanding of the relation between the properties of objects on the human scale compared to structures on the nanoscale. Objects that are on the nanoscale are about 1,000 times smaller than the diameter of a hair.  The atomic force microscope is one of the important instruments for this work since it can measure nanoscale features.  The microscope will bring the first nanoscience instrument to the chemistry program at Pacific Lutheran University and allow undergraduate students hands-on use of this important instrument. The new atomic force microscope will greatly enhance our students' experiences in their undergraduate research projects as well as in their coursework.  The microscope will also be incorporated into outreach workshops that already take place in our laboratories for underrepresented high school students in the Tacoma MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement) program. Lastly, examples of research programs using the new instrument include studies leading to: better ability to design high performance plastics; better antimicrobial peptides for the fight against a broad range of pathogens; methods of developing nanoparticles for eventual use in low level detection of compounds.\r\n",
