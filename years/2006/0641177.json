 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nThe trusted processor model is a promising model for designing highly secure systems. However there are several drawbacks that limit its application as a highly trusted computing base.This CAREER project will address these drawbacks in a compilation and language framework to fill the gap between a secure application developer and the secure processor for the provision of a programming environment with high efficiency, usability and security. The successful development of the proposed research will greatly impact the design and implementation of system level security protection\r\n\r\nBroader Imapct\r\nThe educational component of this proposal will be integrated in institutional efforts of curriculum development, and will have an extendeded  impact nationwide on education in system security. Eventually,\twide adoption of the trusted process model for developing high performance secure applications will hopefully take effect.\r\n",
