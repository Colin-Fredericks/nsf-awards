 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of a program focused on the discovery and the development of new efficient methodologies for chemical synthesis, a series of metal catalyzed cycloisomerization reactions for the synthesis of azaheterocycles will be developed. Efficient conversion of N-vinyl and N-aryl amides to pyridine derivatives will be effected under mild reaction conditions. New cycloisomerization reactions of azadieneynes in addition to intramolecular cycloaddition reactions of azadienes will be explored. Mechanistic studies will provide insight into the role of the catalysts and broaden our fundamental understanding of substrate activation in these and related transformations. The research program will serve a host laboratory for a high school outreach program sponsored by MIT and the Center for Educational Excellence. An experimental web-based discussion section for an undergraduate chemistry course will be developed.\r\n\r\nWith the support of this CAREER award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Mohammed Movassaghi, of the Department of Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is exploring new methods for the synthesis of complex cyclic organic molecules containing nitrogen. Such molecules, known as alkaloids, frequently display intriguing and important biological and physiological activity. Development of efficient methods for their preparation is essential for the continued development of fundamental understanding of such activity and for the production of next-generation pharmaceutical products. Professor Movassaghi actively involves high school students in this research effort, enhancing the numbers of students entering undergraduate chemistry programs. In addition, he is designing an experimental web-based discussion section for an undergraduate chemistry course as a model for increasing student understanding and retention.",
