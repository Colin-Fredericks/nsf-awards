 "awd_abstract_narration": "An Integrated PHY-MAC approach to secure Open-Access Wireless Networks\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThis collaborative project proposes an integrated research and educational\r\nplan for addressing many important serious security challenges, especially\r\nat the lower layers of Open-Access Wireless Networks (OAWNs).\r\nThe goal of this project is to addres wireless security vulnerabilities in OAWNs\r\nby defining an ubiquitous infrastructure for security and control that maintains\r\nits open access nature for regular clients while appropriately detecting,\r\nlocalizing, and isolating malicious behavior and mitigating their impact.\r\nA unique aspect and key contribution of this project will be its focus on \r\nprotecting the lower (PHY and MAC) layers through an integrated approach that \r\nhas received scant prior attention in the context of OAWNs.\r\nThis is particularly important since the lower layers are the weakest \r\nlinks of any open wireless system.\r\n\r\nTo do this, the PIs will design protocol mechanisms that, first, prevent or at\r\nleast render MAC-layer attacks difficult. If an attacker would instead try to\r\nattack the PHY layer, it would have to expend significantly higher amounts of\r\nenergy, which in turn simplifies attack detection.  In addition, to combat such\r\nPHY layer attacks, the PIs propose to use sophisticated signaling and coding \r\ntechniques as well as PHY-MAC cryptographic and spatio-temporal scheduling strategies.\r\nFinally, to facilitate some of these security mechanisms, the PIs will also design\r\ndistributed PHY-MAC strategies that perform continuous monitoring of the wireless\r\nenvironment and help isolate anomalous behavior.\r\nAn important part of this project will be evaluating the tradeoffs between degree\r\nof interoperability of proposed mechanisms with the corresponding level of security \r\nguarantees achievable. \r\n",
