 "awd_abstract_narration": "Suslin proposes to investigate topics in motivic cohomology theory. These \r\ntopics are of principal importance for the development of the cohomology \r\ntheory of schemes and each has seen progress during the recent years in \r\nthe works of Suslin and his collaborators. Firstly Suslin plans to eliminate the perfectness \r\nassumption in the basic requirements of motivic cohomology theory and to \r\ndefine the corresponding tensor triangulated category of motivic complexes over \r\narbitrary fields. The second topic is an attempt to get a new and clearer \r\nproof of the main duality theorem which would work for schemes over \r\narbitrary fields (and not only over fields of characteristic zero as the current proof \r\ndoes). Next Suslin plans jointly with A. Merkurjev to generalize the previous \r\ncomputation of the motivic cohomology of Severi-Brauer varieties to the case of generic \r\nsplitting fields of higher symbols. Probably the most interesting and \r\nimportant part of the grant proposal is an attempt to compare the \r\nalgebraic cobordism theory developed by Morel and Levin with the algebraic \r\npart of the cohomology theory constructed by Voevodsky. Here the plan is \r\nto use the machinery of framed sheaves developed by Voevodsky.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of mathematics is to provide an accurate picture to the \r\nphysical world or at least an appropriate approximation of that picture.\r\nFrom this point of view algebraic varieties are of principal importance,\r\nfirst they are relatively easy to understand since they are just defined \r\nby polynomial equations, next they usually give a rather accurate \r\napproximation to other shapes, most importantly they do appear naturally in quite a lot \r\nof subjects from theoretical physics to coding theory. That's why \r\nalgebraic geometry - the theory of algebraic varieties is so important for \r\nthe development and applications of mathematics. This project is devoted \r\nto the study of certain fundamental problems of motivic cohomology theory \r\n- a relatively new and very quickly developing branch of algebraic \r\ngeometry. Geometry is blended with algebra and topology in this part of \r\nmathematics, ideas and methods to be used come equally from all these \r\ndirections. As part of the broader impact of this grant proposal let me \r\npoint out that I intend to involve graduate students into the work over \r\nsome parts of this grant proposal thus allowing them to get into a fast \r\ndeveloping and quite important field of mathematics.",
