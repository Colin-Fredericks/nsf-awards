 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this GOALI project is to explore the use of a nano mechanical indenter as a stamping tool to direct the self-assembly of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) grown quantum dots for the nano-manufacturability of novel 2-D and 3-D quantum structures. The proposed approach seeks to understand and control surface effects, such as isotropic and anisotropic strain fields, for the directed self-assembly of nanostructures. A nanoindenter will be used to investigate the ability to mechanically stamp precise nanopatterns of surface strain on which quantum dot nucleation, positioning, and functionality will be studied. The research program will support and enhance the educational activities at both the undergraduate and graduate level on the Virginia Commonwealth University and University of Arkansas campuses. Planned outreach to local high school students and teachers through on-going lectures and demonstrations will allow for immersion to the world of nanoscience and technology, and aims to promote early interest of underrepresented students into science and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the proposed research will allow for the advancement of the science and technology of emerging quantum dot-based devices, as well as enhance existing technologies by providing a means for integrating novel nanodevices with existing semiconductor devices to create multifunctional nano-integrated micro systems. The transition of nanoindentation as a science and the instrument platform from an analytical instrument to a nano-manufacturing tool would be a vital breakthrough in the nanomechanical instrumentation industry. Furthermore, the use of a nanoindenter as a stamping tool should be applicable to patterning not only epitaxially self-assembled quantum dots but also chemically synthesized quantum dots, self-assembled quantum wires, as well as biological nanostructure patterning. Opening up the possibility for the fabrication of novel nanostructure architectures for electronic, optoelectronic and biological devices, molecular sensors, and interconnections. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
