 "awd_abstract_narration": "This funding supports a workshop on the Social Transitions of the North (STN) project to be held at the Alaskan Anthropological Association Meetings, March 2006, Kodiak, Alaska.  The STN was an NSF funded project cut tragically short by the deaths of the four lead scientists, including the PI Steven McNAbb, in a boating accident off the Chukotkan coast of Russia during the 1994 field season.  The invited workshop participants are the original surviving scientists, including scholars from Russia and Canada, and Arctic indigenous scholars, new scholars interested in utilizing the data from the original project, community and family members of the researchers that perished, and researchers that are currently doing research based on the legacy of STN project.    It is anticipated that the workshop, which takes place during the 10th year anniversary of the tragedy, will stimulate new interest in social change research in the Arctic and the use of the original STN data now archived at the University of Alaska.",
