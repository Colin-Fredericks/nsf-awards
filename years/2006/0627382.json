The large volume of data coupled with the fact\r\nthat the data are spread across the entire network creates a\r\ndemand for efficient data dissemination/access techniques to find\r\nthe relevant data from within the network. This demand has led to\r\nthe development of data centric sensor (DCS) networks, where\r\nsensor data rather than sensor nodes are named based on attributes\r\nsuch as event type or geographic location. However, saving data in\r\nthe network also creates critical security problems, which have\r\nnot been addressed by previous work.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to design secure DCS systems\r\nwhich provide two fundamental security services: data\r\nconfidentiality and location privacy. Three types of attack models\r\nwith increasing attacker capabilities are considered, including\r\nlocal passive attacks, sensor-assisted passive attacks, and\r\ncompromise-based active attacks. Techniques based on the principle\r\nof least privilege, dummy traffic and filtering, location privacy\r\nand query optimization are designed to defend against the attacks.\r\n\r\nThe success of this research will have a much broader impact on\r\nmaking sensor networks more affordable and amenable to commercial,\r\ncivilian, and military applications. It has the potential to\r\nfoster new research in the privacy perspective of sensor networks.\r\nThe results from this research will be disseminated widely through\r\nhigh quality publications and talks. The proposed research will\r\nalso be integrated with the education curricula at Penn State.\r\n",
