 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis proposal requests funds to support the attendance of young scholars at the 2006 Gordon Research\r\nConference on the Chemistry and Physics of Nanostructure Fabrication that will be held\r\non July 16 - 21, 2006 at the Tilton College in Tilton, NH. The technical program is being organized\r\nby Prof. Theresa S. Mayer, Penn State University (Chair) and Prof. Dawn Bonnell, University\r\nof Pennsylvania (Chair-Elect) and will emphasize ground breaking research at the intersection\r\nbetween nanostructure synthesis and the devices and systems that are enabled using these\r\nadvanced fabrication techniques.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The topics that will be discussed at this meeting are vital not only to today's\r\ninformation revolution but to the fields of imaging and manipulation of chemical and biological\r\nstructures. The organization and atmosphere of Gordon Research Conferences stimulates open\r\ndiscussion among leading researchers of recent results and new techniques, which is particularly\r\nimportant in the rapidly growing and changing field of nanoscience and technology. In addition,\r\nthe highly interdisciplinary nature of the research discussed at this conference provides and excellent\r\nopportunity for cross fertilization of research ideas and methods. The topics that will be\r\nhighlighted at this conference include nanostructure synthesis and self assembly, nano-patterning\r\nand printing, nano-electronics, -biosystems, -optics, -mechanics, and -fluidics.\r\nBroader Impact: The conference format  a week of continuous interaction with experts in interrelated\r\nfields in a casual setting  provides a particularly rewarding opportunity for young\r\nscholars including graduate students, post-doctoral research associates, and assistant professors\r\nto exchange ideas with and to learn from this gathering of leading researchers. The availability\r\nof this travel support will also assist in our efforts to maintain a high level of diversity among\r\nconference attendees.",
