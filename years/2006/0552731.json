Magee\r\n\r\nThis REU award for a Site builds upon a pilot program operated in the summers of 2004-2005 and more than 12 years of experience with NISTs highly successful Professional Research Experience Program.  It provides an opportunity for the Boulder Laboratories of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Science Foundation (NSF) to offer an intensive training program through summer undergraduate research fellowships (SURF).\r\nIt will engage 20 students each year for three years.  The students will be matched with suitable mentors to participate in a wide range of individual research projects in the fields of electromagnetics, materials reliability, optoelectronics, quantum electrical metrology, physical and chemical properties, quantum physics, statistical modeling and analysis, time and frequency, and mathematical and computational sciences.  Students will be exposed to multidisciplinary research at the intersections of different disciplines, which will instill a cooperative approach to sharing information and impart a greater understanding of the methodologies, language, culture and paradigms of different disciplines.\r\nThe principal goal of the SURF program is to motivate students to pursue PhD programs in preparation for careers in research and development.  The directors will create a cooperative learning environment with weekly seminars for students, frequent social outings, and field trips to nearby laboratories.   The program will culminate with students making presentations at a research symposium.  The program directors will conduct ongoing reporting and evaluation to assure both continuous improvement of SURF program quality and documentation of the positive effects on participants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
