 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project bridges the gap between modern research practices and student education in an area of growing national interest - urban meteorology. The main objectives are (i) to fully utilize modern observation techniques in boundary-layer research, (ii) to gain new knowledge of boundary-layer dynamics and turbulence structure over terrain with large roughness elements, (iii) to advance urban surface-layer parameterization schemes and (iv) to create synergistic and integrated learning experiences to better educate future scientists and professionals about urban environmental impacts. \r\n\r\nThe novelty of the Laboratory for Research and Education in Urban Meteorology (ILREUM) originates from the integrated design of a laboratory that fully utilizes new technologies in meteorological studies. In-situ and remote-sensing instrumentation, as well as fieldwork and wind tunnel simulations are combined in an innovative and complementary way. Three observational sites representative for different land use types are being designed to obtain high-resolution and long-term data of flow and turbulence within the lowest hundreds of meters of the urban boundary layer. These data, in combination with data available from a number of recent urban field and laboratory campaigns, will provide new insights into (i) boundary-layer development from rural through sub-urban to urban terrain, (ii) the interaction between thermally and mechanically produced turbulence in urban areas, (iii) the properties of flow and turbulence inside the urban roughness sublayer, and (iv) the exchange of momentum, heat, and pollutants between the urban canopy layer and the above roof level flow. All these questions are still not fully understood and of crucial importance for the development and improvement of modeling systems that serve as tools to solve current and future environmental challenges of cities Because of the ongoing trend of urbanization, atmospheric processes in urban areas are of great concern and directly affect the majority of the world's population. ILREUM aims at a broader knowledge in urban meteorology and improvement of parameterization schemes for atmospheric models.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The expected results are of great relevance for a wide range of applications including (i) weather prediction and climate models for urban and regional scales, (ii) modeling systems for urban air quality management, and (iii) emergency response tools in the event of unexpected releases of air toxics in an urban environment. As part of ILREUM, interactive and hands-on teaching modules will be developed and disseminated through digital libraries, which will assist in closing the gap between research and education and promote lasting knowledge of scientific principles in this challenging field beyond the OU campus. The International Association of Urban Climatology (IAUC) has recognized the need for improved teaching resources in urban meteorology: the ILREUM materials will be announced in the IAUC newsletter in response to this call. The education plan includes also an international exchange program, which will further assure that future graduates are better prepared for challenges and opportunities arising from ongoing urbanization and the related global, regional and local environmental problems. Research and travel fellowships will be awarded to undergraduate students participating in the exchange programs and special efforts will be undertaken to attract underrepresented groups in these fellowships. In collaboration with existing outreach programs of the Oklahoma Climatological Survey, the obtained data and results will also be prepared in a format targeting K-12 education and training of first responders.",
