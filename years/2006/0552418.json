 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF-REU Program in Extremal Graph Theory and Dynamical Systems at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) will engage students in eight weeks of intensive research. Eight students will be chosen in each of three summers. The program's goals are to: (i) involve undergraduates, including women and minorities, in mathematical and computer science research, (ii) assist students in the dissemination of their research through conference presentations and refereed publications, (iii) encourage students to pursue graduate studies in the mathematical sciences, and (iv) provide a well-rounded research experience that includes feedback from outside researchers, mentoring in public speaking, scientific writing, and professional ethics. The students will work directly with RIT faculty and receive additional feedback on their projects from outside experts. The students will also participate in additional educational activities, including seminars given by outside speakers, and the preparation of a student travel grant proposal. \r\n\r\nThe program will have a significant research component. Research results in discrete mathematics and computer science have experienced a dramatic increase in interest in recent years. Many open mathematical problems have been solved by new algorithmic methods derived from computer science. Our interest lies on the imprecisely defined boundary between computer science and mathematics. We will take advantage of methods from mathematics and computer science and expect results in both areas.\r\n\r\nThe investigators and senior personnel for the project include Darren Narayan, Stanislaw Radziszowski, William Basener, and Tamas Wiandt.\r\n\r\nThe site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n",
