 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project seeks to use infrasound in conjunction with other established technologies at Kilauea and Mount St. Helens volcanoes to (1) identify and characterize different eruption processes, (2) recognize changes in lava composition, mass flux, or magma conduit geometry, and (3) refine or develop models of the observed eruption processes. This will facilitate the integration of state-of-the-art infrasound techniques into the existing geophysical tools used for studying volcanic source processes. Also the researchers will use unique, unpublished data sets of active volcanoes in the US and likely discover new types of signals and interdisciplinary connections during the project. The results of the project will include the development of new numerical models, enhanced understanding of infrasonic wave generation in magmas of low viscosity (basalt) and high viscosity (andesite), and improved insights and models of dome collapses, shallow long period events, tremor, and explosions. \r\n\r\nThis work can influence hazard management and mitigation schemes at the research volcanoes and at similar volcanoes worldwide. By speeding up, pitch shifting, or modulating infrasonic recordings, the researchers can make audible the \"silent\" signals from these volcanoes. Signals, such as the drumbeats and tremor, will be transposed into the audible range and placed on a web site dedicated to the project. They will also work with the USGS in the construction of informational posters and soundscapes that may be placed at the visitor centers of the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument.\r\n",
