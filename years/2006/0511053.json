 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Description\r\n\r\nCosmogenic isotopes such as 10Be and 26Al are widely used to determine the age and\r\nexposure histories of landscape features. Such information is critical to understanding\r\nthe timing and rate of geologic processes such as active fault ruptures, glacial advances,\r\nsoil formation and erosion of mountain belts. However, the utility of these isotopes is\r\nlimited by the high cost and intense labor associated with producing a single\r\nmeasurement. This project proposes development of cosmogenic 3He as a dating tool in\r\ncommon accessory mineral phases such as apatite, sphene and zircon. If successful, this\r\ntechnique will be unique in several respects. First, it will allow rapid and inexpensive\r\ncosmogenic dating of a wide range of rock types, thus increasing the number of samples\r\nthat can be dated in a single study. Second, because 3He is stable and has a very high\r\nproduction rate, it may prove useful in combination with other cosmogenic nuclides to\r\naddress problems such as paleoaltimetry, ancient exposure and burial histories (100 my\r\ntime scales), and dating of archaeological sites and artifacts.\r\n\r\nSeveral technical challenges need to be overcome before 3He in apatite, sphene and\r\nzircon can be used as a cosmogenic dating tool. First, it is necessary to develop\r\nanalytical procedures such that the measurement of small amounts of 3He in the presence\r\nof large quantities of radiogenic 4He is not hampered by the \"tailing\" of low energy 4He\r\nions onto the 3He peak, or by space charge effects at high 4He pressures. The former is\r\nlikely not a problem based on the demonstrated abundance sensitivity at mass 3, and the\r\nlatter will be addressed using a \"spike\" of standard gas inlet during the measurement of\r\nan unknown to calibrate the instrument at that He pressure. A second challenge is to\r\nverify the production rate of 3He, which will be done using samples of known exposure\r\nage from glacial moraines in the Sierra Nevada and Nepal Himalaya. Implicit in this task\r\nis identifying and correcting for non-cosmogenic sources of 3He such as inheritance from\r\nfluid inclusions and production via 6Li(n, alpha) + time -> 3He.\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Explanation\r\n\r\nDetermining when rocks first appear at the Earth's surface is an important question in\r\nmany Earth Science disciplines. For example, the boulders deposited when a glacier\r\nretreats provide an important record of past climate change. The \"surface exposure age\"\r\nof these boulders, the time when they were first deposited, can be determined by\r\nmeasuring the buildup of unusual isotopes produced by cosmic rays interacting with the\r\nelements of the uppermost tens of centimeters of the rock. This proposal seeks to improve\r\nexisting methods of \"surface exposure dating\", using the appearance of a rare isotope of\r\nhelium in several common minerals. The overarching goal is to develop a technique that\r\nis broadly applicable and inexpensive and which may lead to improved understanding of\r\nthe timing and rates of processes that modify Earth's surface.",
