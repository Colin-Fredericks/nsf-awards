 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of techniques and tools for developing fast,\r\ncorrect distributed applications.  Two aspects are novel.  First,\r\napplication modules developed with these techniques are statically\r\nanalyzed for potential conflicts when executed in parallel.  Modules\r\nthat may conflict are serialized to avoid errors.  Second,\r\napplications are transparently monitored at run-time to show where\r\nconservative serialization has unduly slowed the application.\r\n\r\nThe traditional approach to building concurrent systems is to write\r\nthe serial version of a module and then consider how concurrent\r\nexecutions might cause errors. Each potential problem must be\r\nsynchronized appropriately before the application may be executed\r\nsafely on concurrent requests.  This project analyzes code to\r\nconservatively preclude dangerous interactions and run it safely in a\r\nconcurrent environment. The resulting safe application can be made\r\nfaster using the same techniques that developers use today to ensure\r\nsafety.  For example, locks can be employed to make two segments of\r\ncode safe for concurrent execution.  Although static analysis allows\r\ndevelopers to learn where modules may conflict, the second piece of\r\nthis project, transparent monitoring of concurrent applications, helps\r\ndevelopers focus their attention on areas of contention that occur in\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nThis project's techniques will allow large, concurrent applications to\r\nbe developed without the bugs normally introduced by parallel\r\ncomputation.  As more of the software we use runs on central sites,\r\nmultiplexed for thousands of users, these concerns are growing.  Our\r\ntechniques will be disseminated as papers at systems and languages\r\nconferences, and as software artifacts that demonstrate their utility.\r\n",
