 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are many fascinating conjectures relating arithmetic and special\r\nvalues of zeta functions. The first project (with Milne) is the\r\nconstruction of a triangulated category of integral motives over a finite\r\nfield with applications to the Lichtenbaum-Milne conjecture on special\r\nvalues. The second project is to prove formulas for special values at\r\nhalf-integers of zeta functions; this is a completely unexplored area.\r\nRecent work of the PI has led to a formula for the special value at half\r\nusing supersingular elliptic curves. The third project involves specific\r\nquestions about the Weil-group of number fields and class field theory.\r\n\r\nThe study of special values of zeta functions was pioneered by Euler; it\r\nis a subject of very high contemporary interest and research. It involves\r\ngeometry, algebra and arithmetic in a very sophisticated way. It\r\nleads to beautiful identities between discrete (integers) and\r\ncontinuous (transcendental numbers like pi). These arise even in the\r\nstudy of Feynman diagrams in quantum field theory. There are\r\nmany applications in coding theory, physics, and cryptography. There are\r\nmany challenging problems for undergraduate and graduate students. The\r\ninterdisciplinary nature will help broad dissemination and enhance\r\nscientific and technological understanding.\r\n",
