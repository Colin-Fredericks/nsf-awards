 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding and implementation of active, directed assembly of metallic nanoparticles is crucial for the future of nanotechnology. Nanosized metallic particles have unique optical and electronic properties that make them highly desirable building blocks for applications in bio-chemical sensing, communications, medicine, and electronics. This research effort exploits the unique optical and thermal properties of metallic nanostructures to selectively direct their assembly into active nanodevices.  This represents the first step toward a general-purpose nanoassembly technology while also exploring fundamental issues in nanoscale electromagnetics and thermodynamics. \r\n\r\nAs their principle aim, the investigators are developing a method to selectively and locally fuse nanoscale particles into coherent structures using an atomic force microscopy probe and surface-plasmon excitation.  The surfaces of metallic nanoparticles melt at temperatures dramatically lower than the bulk melting temperature and permit particle fusion using optical excitation. The nature of the surface plasmon resonances allows the particles to be selectively excited based on size, material, and local microscopic environment, opening the door for an integrated process that permits multiple materials to be assembled during the same time frame. The investigation of nanoparticle-nanoprobe systems will have a far reaching impact on the understanding of nanoscale electromagnetics and thermodynamics.  In addition, a framework for a new nanoscale assembly technique will enable new active nanodevices and make nanoassembly technology more widely available. The project draws students and researchers from the University of Kentuckys two Nanotechnology Programs: the Nanoscale Engineering Certificate Program (NECP) and the Umbrella Program for Nanotechnology (UPoN).  In addition, the students involved in this research effort receive interdisciplinary training with investigators in Electrical, Mechanical, and Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering.  \r\n",
