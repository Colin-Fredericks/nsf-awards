 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research being done by Professors Daniel Carman and Kenneth Hicks \r\nof the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Ohio University is conducted \r\nin the area of intersection between nuclear and particle physics.  One goal \r\nis to study the production of subatomic particles having at least one \r\n\"strange\" quark in their makeup.  The strange quark is heavier than the \r\nconventional \"up\" or \"down\" quarks that make up common particles found in \r\nthe nucleus, like the proton and the neutron.  Interestingly, studies \r\ninvolving particles with \"strangeness\" represent a new way to investigate \r\nthe dynamics and structure of matter composed of non-strange quarks.  This\r\nis accomplished by understanding how particles without strangeness decay into\r\nparticles containing these strange quarks.  These experimental studies provide \r\nmore information and constraints for the underlying theory of the quark structure \r\nof particles and their excited states known as quantum chromodynamics (QCD).  \r\nOne possible extension to the known set of subatomic particles would be the \r\ndiscovery of \"exotic\" particles which are allowed by the rules of QCD, but not \r\nyet seen experimentally.  In particular, the glue which binds quarks can itself \r\ncarry a portion of the spin quantum numbers of a particle, and these particles \r\nare predicted to exist.  Understanding the nature of this glue is one of the most\r\nimportant unanswered question in the field of nuclear physics.  Experiments at \r\nthe Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) in Newport \r\nNews, VA, where Carman and Hicks do their research, are searching for signs of \r\nexotic particles, which (if found) will extend our knowledge of the strong \r\nforce that binds quarks together into subatomic particles and into the very \r\nstructure of the matter around us.\r\n\r\n",
