This Track 2 Project STEP-a partnership of UC faculty and 5 graduate Fellows, 5 strategically chosen high schools, and community and industrial partners-strives to further improve STEM interest and skills of high school students using engineering as a context for authentic learning through an overarching project. The vision is to develop a seamless community of UC and K-12 learners sharing STEM knowledge.  The primary goals of this project are: 1) to train, energize and sustain graduate engineering, math and science Fellows to effectively teach STEM skills to secondary school students; 2) to develop hierarchical and expandable STEM lesson plans that explicitly connect key concepts at different grade levels; and 3) to plant the seeds of systemic change at UC and K-12 schools through synergistic partnerships that ensure the sustainability of the program beyond NSF funding.  \r\n\r\nPartners: University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati Public Schools: Hughes Teaching and Technology High School, Hughes CAMAS High School, Western Hills Design Technology High School, Western Hills University High School, and Shroder Paidea High School. \r\n\r\n",

Each Fellow created and implemented five STEM lessons (in conjunction with high school teachers) in urban high schools around Cincinnati throughout the academic school year. After implementing their first lesson, in the fall, the Fellows presented a showcase of their work to all the STEP teachers and the community at UC. Each year the Fellows created and presented the UC Technology Workshop to the regional K-12 teaching community.
