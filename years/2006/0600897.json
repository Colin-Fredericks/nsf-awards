 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonlinear Dynamics is an interdisciplinary field. It is relevant to our understanding of topics as diverse as the mixing of fluids, turbulence, weather forecasting, predicting the outbreak of epidemics, the behavior of financial markets, pattern formation and cardiac behavior. An interdisciplinary workshop: Dynamics Days 2006, will be held on Jan. 4 - 7, 2006, in Bethesda, MD. The 2006 workshop will include a range of topics, but will have a focus on the interface with soft condensed matter and biology. The workshop will attract students, post docs, and senior researchers from fields in applied mathematics, physics, and biology. In addition, the location of the meeting near the National Institutes of Health is expected to attract a large number of NIH researchers and students. The wide range of backgrounds of both students and senior researchers will offer a unique opportunity for advancing research at the interface of soft condensed matter physics and biology. This award will help enable young scientists to attend the workshop and to present their research results. Thus, their work will have exposure to both the physics and biology perspective. The young scientists' attendance at the workshop will broaden their education in the fields using nonlinear dynamics.",
