 "awd_abstract_narration": "Goriely\r\nDMS-0605029\r\n\r\n     The general theme of the project is the study of growth,\r\nstructure, and function in physical and biological systems\r\nthrough the use, and development of, nonlinear elasticity theory\r\nand the associated methods of applied mathematics.  The project\r\nis divided into three main lines of interconnected research: (i)\r\nthe analysis and modeling of elastic growth in soft materials,\r\nsuch as biological tissue; (ii) the biomechanics of microbial\r\nsystems including the study of force-driven penetration\r\nmechanisms, such as those arising in fungi that destroy crops;\r\nand (iii) the dynamics and stability of various elastic rods,\r\ncables, and pipes having important engineering applications.  For\r\nthe first theme, the investigators and their students study the\r\nmechanical consequences of growth and its potential to either\r\ngenerate instabilities through changes in geometry and stresses,\r\nor to act as a mechanism to stabilize and regulate physical\r\nproperties.  The goal of these studies is to gain insight into\r\nthe fundamental coupling between growth and stress in many\r\nbiological systems.  The second theme of microbial biomechanics\r\ninvolves the mathematical modeling of both bacterial and fungal\r\nsystems.  The investigators formulate and analyze mechanical\r\nmodels of growing micro-organisms in order to understand their\r\noverall structure (e.g. the formation of appressoria in the\r\nrice-blast fungus) and their ability to invade host tissues by\r\npenetration (as found in many fungi), as well as the growth and\r\nstructural changes exhibited by filamentary bacteria, such as\r\nthose that are a natural source of antibiotics.  The description\r\nof these organisms combines a general formulation of membrane\r\ngrowth (based on the first research theme), the elastic modeling\r\nof cell walls undergoing large deformations, and the use of\r\nplasticity and fracture theory to describe penetration processes. \r\nThe third theme of elastic rod dynamics involves the study of\r\nelastic tubes conveying fluids, and the dynamics of rods with\r\nconstitutive coupling between twist and tension (hemitropic rods)\r\n-- a functionality that is relevant to the design of crane cable\r\nand other braided structures.  The analysis of filament\r\ninstabilities is carried out through the use and extension of the\r\nnonlinear analysis techniques developed by the investigators in\r\ntheir previous work. \r\n\r\n     The project concerns the dynamics of filamentary structures\r\nsuch as pipes and rods and the physical analysis of growth\r\nmechanisms and invasion appearing in biological systems.  It is\r\nhighly interdisciplinary in nature, cutting across the fields of\r\napplied mathematics, mechanical engineering, microbiology, and\r\nbiomechanics, and addresses questions of both practical\r\nimportance and mathematical interest.  The themes have a broad\r\nrange of applicability in biology (morphogenesis), in biomedical\r\nengineering (analysis of soft tissues, their mechanical\r\nregulation and function), in understanding fundamental processes\r\nin biological invasion such as fungal penetration of tissues, and\r\nin classical engineering problems (pipes conveying fluids,\r\ninstabilities in drilling).  The project also provides many\r\nattractive training experiences at different levels suitable for\r\ngraduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. \r\nThese include opportunities to synthesize mathematical modeling\r\nwith hands-on experimentation through the use of the Applied\r\nMathematics Program's unique experimental facilities.",
