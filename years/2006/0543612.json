 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecosystem Consequences Of Dynamic Geomorphology:  An Experimental Approach\r\n\r\nThis study uses Fossil Creek, Arizona as a model system for studying how restoration of flow and removal of non-native fish affects the physical and biological structure of streams.  For the last century the majority of water was diverted from Fossil Creek for hydropower production.  Water was returned in 2005 as part of a river restoration program that included removing non-native fish. Fossil Creek was targeted for restoration because it retains native fish and has unique travertine dams creating steep waterfalls and deep pools.  This study will test how increased flow affects travertine formation, river productivity and biodiversity. The integration of geomorphology and ecology will advance our understanding of the interplay of physical and biological process in structuring stream ecosystems.\r\nFossil Creek will serve as a national case study in river restoration by testing whether restoration goals are met.  Fossil Creek is a living laboratory where hundreds of high school, undergraduate and graduate students are learning to conduct basic and applied research. This project will train a new generation of students skilled at communicating their science to managers and the public.  Public outreach includes a PBS video, an article in Scientific American and outreach materials for visitors to Fossil Creek. Together these materials will educate the public about the importance of science in river restoration. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSummary:  This project capitalized on a large river restoration project in Fossil Creek, Arizona as part of the decommissioning of a century old hydropower dam.  We studied multiple aspects of the river before and after restoration of flow and removal of non-native fish.  Although millions of dollars are spent each year on river restoration few studies actually document the effects of restoration actions on ecosystems. This research establishes Fossil Creek as a national case study in river restoration. \n\nIntellectual Merit- Through this research we demonstrated for the first time the relative importance of flow restoration versus exotic fish removal to the recovery of native fish.  Results show that in southwestern streams dominated by exotic bass and sunfish &ndash; exotic removal is essential to recovery of native fish.  Flow restoration also increases native fish populations but only where exotic fish are absent.  Thus habitat restoration alone is not sufficient to recover native fish in ecosystems dominated by non-native predators.  Our results showed that aquatic invertebrates recovered quickly from chemical treatment of the river indicating that these treatments will not reduce the food base for fish or threaten endangered invertebrates.   We also showed the utility of hydrogen isotopes for tracing energy flow through aquatic food webs.  Through a series of field and laboratory studies we demonstrated that isotopes of hydrogen are more powerful than isotopes of carbon for delineating the importance of algae versus leaf litter in streams.  This is a novel tool for studying river food webs.  Stable isotope studies were also used to show that native fish resumed their role as top predators in the food and that there was a shift to a more algal based ecosystem.  Finally we showed that increased flow caused a dramatic increase in travertine deposition changing the geomorphology of the stream.  These habitat changes caused a predicted increase in stream productivity and nutrient retention.\n\nBroader Impacts &ndash; We trained five graduate and twelve undergraduate students with strong representation from under served groups.  Students learned both basic science and how to communicate science to managers and community groups.  We developed a PBS documentary highlighting the political cooperation and scientific issues involved in restoring rivers.  We worked with high school students and teachers giving them hands on experience monitoring rivers and designing and implementing experiments.  We established a Fossil Creek Stakeholders group designed to bring rigor to the adaptive management process and ensure that multiple voices are heard in developing management plans\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/10/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jane C Marks"
