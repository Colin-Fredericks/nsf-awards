 "awd_abstract_narration": "This MPS Internships in Public Science Education (MPS-IPSE) award to Penn State University, University Park is to develop innovative museum materials and home-based science projects focused on nanotechnology and thereby increase appreciation and understanding of the materials science. This project, a renewal of an earlier one (# 0324780), is supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS and will be carried out through partnership of the Penn State MRSEC program with the Franklin Institute, Cornell Center for Materials Research and Ithaca Sciencenter.  With this award, research scientists, graduate students and exhibit development personnel from partner institutions will develop 60-minutes cart-based interactive shows 'Material Discovery Projects' that will explore the micromechanisms for the macro behavior of materials.  The project is expected to advance the understanding of material science through the development of innovative museum shows and at-home activities. The interactive shows that are being developed will strengthen the connections between the partner institutions, and likely lead to additional future collaborations. Faculty and researchers in the partner institutions will have the opportunity to take their research ideas from the laboratory and deliver them to the general public.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This program provides interns with experiences that improve their understanding of the process of science and the experience of communicating cutting edge research ideas to the public. These graduate students (mostly pre-service K-12 teachers) work closely with scientists and professionals in public science education and gain skills that they can later use in their classrooms. The interns' efforts and products will affect hundreds of thousands of individuals each year through museum programs at the Franklin Institute and Ithaca Sciencenter, K-12 workshops, public events, the project website and the presentations of museum shows nationwide.\r\n\r\n",
