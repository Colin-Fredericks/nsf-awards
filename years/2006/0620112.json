 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a faculty alliance that seeks to best utilize the diverse labor force of New Mexico for the 21st century by expanding participation in academic careers in the sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) at three Ph.D. granting institutions:  New Mexico State (NMSU), New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (NMT), and University of New Mexico (UNM).  In addition, a training pipeline for students and post-doctoral fellows, targeting AGEP students, will be provided by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) as a non-funded participant.  \r\n \r\nNMSU is a successful ADVANCE-IT institution (2002-2006).  By focusing on improving standard practice for recruitment, retention and promotion, the percentage of women hired into STEM faculty positions doubled. Using best practices developed through the ADVANCE grant, NMSU will disseminate to alliance members the materials and practices that have been effective at increasing representation and participation to enhance competitiveness in academic science.  Mechanisms for dissemination include off-site workshops, distance delivery and face-to-face meetings, \r\n\r\nThe overall goals are to:\t\r\n\tDevelop and retain a representative faculty in science and technology careers, through the use of mentoring and Promotion & Tenure programs, and developing department heads as effective leaders among alliance participants;\r\n\tCreate a sustainable grass-roots committee structure at each institution to carry forward the initiatives of the proposal, institutionalizing faculty development and department head training in concert with upper Administration support; and\r\n\tProvide a pipeline for students into the professoriate and post-doctorate training via the NM-Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NM-AGEP).\r\n\r\nThe principal- and co-investigators are sensitive to the issues at each institution and poised to motivate faculty and department heads.  They are fully supported by the Provost/Division leader at their institutes, as evidenced by letters of support.  Each NM institution will adapt those practices that are viewed as useful by the local committee, and continue to share new effective practices. \r\n\r\nDepartment heads play a critical role in bringing about institutional change within academia.  Leaders at this level translate the broad goals and objectives of the institution framed by higher administration into concrete outcomes by developing strategies to encourage faculty members to behave in accordance with those goals and objectives.  It is also crucial that faculty 'buy in' to these initiatives which will be accomplished by the proposed alliance structure as currently used at NMSU.  The proposal emphasizes consensus building among administrators and senior faculty about how to broaden participation in STEM, especially among the professoriate.\r\n\r\nThis PAID award seeks to bring about changes within the participating institutions as well as poise their students for success in the professoriate.  The learning process that will be experienced by key mid-level administrators and faculty from each participating institution will enable change at these four institutions.  The program will be rigorously evaluated so that the products of this process can be presented, demonstrating successful approaches to enhance recruitment and retention of women and minorities in science and engineering at all levels of academia.  The diverse institutions in New Mexico can serve as the model for the nation.\r\n",
