The Partnership Institute for Science and Math Reform (PISMR) will be charged with implementing ALGEBRA CUBED to rural middle and high schools.  This proposal has several goals.  The first goal is to increase the algebraic content knowledge of the middle and high school teachers and enrich their view of the applications of mathematics. The second goal is to add conceptual depth to the mathematical knowledge of middle and high school students, thus increasing the level of their fluency in the procedural aspects of algebra. In this process, fellows will partner with teachers individually or in small groups to help teachers deepen their understanding of math content and applications.  As partners, they will model inquiry based learning and teaching.  The third goal is to enrich teacher understanding of standards and Core Content. The close relationship of activities to Core Content and standards will serve as a professional development vehicle for teachers.  The fourth goal is to introduce graduate and undergraduate students in STEM disciplines to issues of middle and high school education in mathematics, to have fellows recognize the contribution that their discipline can make to the learning of algebra, and to provide a platform for fellows to remain connected and contribute to the K-12 education process throughout their careers.  The fifth goal is to establish a professional community among the teachers, university faculty, graduate, and undergraduate fellows in order to prepare for other joint efforts in STEM  focused ventures in K-12. The sixth goal is to increase the performance of students in the middle school and high school on the algebra portion of standardized math exams in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The seventh goal is to improve the attitude of high school and middle school students towards mathematics.  The eighth goal is to add breadth to the experience of the fellows by creating productive working relationships with teachers.  The ninth goal is to disseminate and sustain a model and begin it s transportability.  The tenth and final goal is to provide a source for sustainability both financially and culturally at the University of Kentucky.\r\n",
