 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides support for the APS Conference on \"Comparative Physiology 2006: Integrating Diversity,\" scheduled for October 8-11, 2006 in Virginia Beach, VA. The conference brings together senior and junior researchers interested in using the diversity of organisms as a framework for studying physiological processes. The comparative approach explicitly recognizes that unifying principles can be derived from studies of animals from diverse environments and evolutionary histories. In pursuit of these objectives, cutting edge research is being conducted with \"non-standard,\" often nonmammalian, organisms. Thus, the famous dictum of August Krogh (the \"Krogh Principle\") states that for any problem in physiology, there exists some organism in which the problem is most fruitfully studied. The conference exemplifies the breadth of approaches and applications used to study physiology. The conference will also stimulate, educate and encourage young investigators who are still in training to enter this field of investigation. The conference provides a forum for these young investigators to interact with more established investigators. To this end, many travel awards will be made available for scientists-in-training and special poster-discussion sessions will be held where they can present their work.\r\n\r\nThe specific aims of this proposal include:\r\n1) convening an internationally recognized and interdisciplinary group of investigators to an APS Conference focusing on the use of a diversity of organisms to study physiological processes and to outline the directions that future work should take;\r\n2) promoting the wide-spread participation of young scientists in this Conference, with an emphasis on women and underrepresented minorities, through the establishment of a travel award program; and\r\n3) interesting new investigators and students in pursuing research opportunities focusing on the use of comparative approaches to recognize the unifying principles that can be derived from the study of animals from diverse environments and evolutionary histories.\r\n \r\n",
