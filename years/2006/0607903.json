 "awd_abstract_narration": "Across all branches of engineering, computational methods share the need for reliable results. Reliability can be achieved only if all sources of errors, approximations, and uncertainty are accounted for. This workshop, organized by the Center for Reliable Engineering Computing (REC) at Georgia Tech, will bring participants from various engineering fields as well as mathematics and computer science to share methods for ensuring reliability of engineering models. The workshop will be held in Savannah, Georgia in February 1006. The focus will be on research methods to integrate the treatment of modeling errors and uncertainty in engineering computations. Reliable engineering computing, as we understand it, requires that analysis and design procedures accommodate several sources of uncertainty. The objective of the workshop is to promote cross-disciplinary research in the area of treatment of modeling errors and parameter uncertainty and their mitigation in engineering software. Such a common forum will provide a foundation for continuing cross-disciplinary advisements in reliable engineering computations. Presenting reliability of computations as a part of an engineering analysis/design will change the way practicing engineers and engineering students design by continuously reinforcing the importance of approximations, uncertainty and reliability.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: In addition to the intellectual contribution cited above, the results of this workshop will have a broader impact on society. Reliable and dependable analysis and design are crucial for the health and safety of the U.S. population. More reliable structural systems will contribute into the reduction of life threatening failures and disasters. The ability to construct robust and dependable systems will aid the continuing economic development of the United States. The results of this workshop will contribute to the enhancement of the infrastructure for research and education in the US.\r\n",
