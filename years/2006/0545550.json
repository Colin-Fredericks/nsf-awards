 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER proposal is for an investigation by the Southeastern Universities Research Association (SURA) into the creation of a regional grid infrastructure called SURAgrid.  Activities funded by this SGER focus on an application survey, evaluation, and prioritization, as well as implementation plans and a first stage deployment depending on earlier results and progress.  Documentation of the process and a web site are part of the reporting promised.  The proposal is mainly focused on application research with an understanding that the vision of a SURAgrid can only be realized in enabling a set of research applications and associated projects.  The investigation into candidate applications to map onto SURAgrid includes 3 stages of work ranging from initial member surveys to application analysis and prioritization according deployment and usage feasibility.  Later stages, if they occur, will take 4-6 applications and develop specific implementation and deployment plans for them, with a final goal of demonstrations and early stage deployment.\r\n\r\n",
