 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nThis research will help to address the challenging and pressing issue\r\nof designing compiler-friendly multi-core architectures and developing effective compiler\r\nsupport for automatically parallelizing single-threaded programs to fully utilize the\r\npotential of multi-core processors. This research will also increase our understanding of\r\nthe interactions between VLIW core(s) and superscalar core(s) on a single chip for\r\ncollaboratively exploiting multi-grained parallelisms with different behaviors. The\r\ndeveloped simulator/compiler framework will also be made publicly available, which can\r\nfacilitate a number of stimulating follow-on researches, such as energy efficiency\r\nevaluation of the hybrid multi-core, or studying the integration of the hybrid compiler and\r\nO.S in multi-programming environments, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe success of this project will open the door to a number of possible\r\nfollow-on research projects to create practical hybrid multi-core processors and the\r\nrelated software systems, which will smoothen and accelerate the transition to the multicore\r\nprocessor-based systems and thus greatly benefit the microprocessor industry, as the\r\nsingle-thread performance can be continuously improved without fundamentally\r\nchanging the programming paradigm. The proposed hybrid multi-core architecture can\r\nalso be potentially customized for a great variety of embedded applications that demand\r\nboth high performance and energy efficiency. Moreover, since future high-performance\r\ncomputing systems are very likely to utilize the multi-core processors as the basic nodes,\r\nthe transparent single-thread performance enhancement achieved by this project will also\r\nhelp to advance the power of computing into the next generation for meeting the toughest\r\ncomputational challenges. Additionally, this project will attract and train graduate\r\nstudents in multi-core architecture and advanced compiler design, and the research results\r\nwill also be incorporated into the graduate level computer architecture course, i.e., ECE\r\n532, to better prepare the students for this rapidly developing field.",
