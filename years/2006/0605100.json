The stable homotopy groups exhibit\r\nchromatic layers of periodic behavior.  The PI will continue his work\r\nstudying how the moduli space of elliptic curves, and the theory of\r\nmodular forms, detects the second chromatic layer.  The PI, with his\r\ncollaborators, will investigate generalizations that relate the higher\r\nchromatic layers to Shimura varieties, and their automorphic forms. \r\nThe unstable homotopy groups of spheres will be investigated within a\r\nsimilar algebro-geometric framework using the Goodwillie tower.  The\r\nPI will study the relationships between ramification phenomena in\r\nnumber theory and unstable phenomena in homotopy theory that arise.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PI's work studies higher dimensional geometry using the theory of\r\nnumbers.  The spaces of elliptic curves and their generalizations that\r\nthe PI is studying are central objects in number theory, playing a\r\npivotal role both in Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem and in\r\nHarris and Taylor's proof of the local Langlands correspondence. \r\nGeometry in higher dimensions occurs in economics and physics.  The\r\nstudy of number theory gives rise to the encryption systems that allow\r\nfor the secure transmission of data, such as those used by secure web\r\npages.  The links between the seemingly disparate fields of geometry\r\nand number theory that the PI proposes to investigate will encourage\r\ndialog that breeds new science, produce problems suitable for engaging\r\nstudents in research activities, and stir public interest in the\r\nmathematical sciences.\r\n\r\n",
