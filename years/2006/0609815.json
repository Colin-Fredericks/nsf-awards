 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleagues develop novel diffusion-like PDE\r\nmodels and computational methods for image restoration and segmentation\r\nof medical imagery acquired from ultrasound, magnetic resonance (MR),\r\ncomputed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and single\r\nphoton emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanners.\r\nFor restoration, the project investigates various PDE models and related\r\nnumerical procedures that can effectively preserve and restore important\r\nimage features, not only fine structures but also slow transitions,\r\nfor various medical images in 2D and 3D.\r\nGiven basic models derived from variational approaches, non-variational\r\nvariants will be developed in order to optimize their performances\r\nin image restoration, by integrating noise characteristics and by\r\nincorporating appropriate diffusion modulators and dynamic constraint\r\nterms.\r\nConventional level set formulations of the Mumford-Shah functional in\r\nsegmentation work well for essentially binary images; however, they may\r\nfail to detect desired edges for general images, due to ambiguity in the\r\ncomputation of the complementary function (the piecewise cartoon image)\r\nand the ability to detect smooth boundaries.\r\nIn order to overcome the difficulty, the project will develop various\r\nmathematical and numerical techniques.\r\nThe innovative models and computational algorithms will broadly impact\r\nvarious other fields, while enhanced knowledge on medical images will\r\ninstitute advancements on medical scanner design.\r\n\r\nThe project develops state-of-the-art algorithms in image restoration\r\nand segmentation for medical imagery in both planar and volumetric formats.\r\nAlthough there have been remarkable advancements in medical scanner design,\r\nmedical images can easily incorporate certain noise and various artifacts.\r\nIt is extremely important to suppress such artifacts for an accurate\r\nmedical diagnosis.\r\nOn the other hand, in various modern medical diagnoses and operations,\r\ncomputer algorithms are being utilized to detect-and-measure body parts\r\nautomatically; however, these algorithms are yet to be improved for more\r\naccurate feature detection.\r\nThe investigator and his colleagues study various mathematical and\r\ncomputational algorithms in order to enhance the image quality and\r\nsegment important image features effectively.\r\nBesides, the project will advance imaging techniques for the reduction\r\nof radiation exposure to the patient at X-ray computed tomography (CT).\r\nHere the goal is to keep patient radiation exposures from CT as low as\r\npossible while achieving the required image quality and medical benefit.\r\nThe planned research will have an important impact on improved\r\nunderstanding of the current mathematical image processing techniques,\r\nadvance knowledge on medical images, and institute advancements on\r\nmedical scanner design.\r\nThe research project will support a graduate student and accelerate\r\nactivities in a research group at Mississippi State University, called\r\nthe IMage Processing And Computational Techniques (IMPACT) which is\r\norganized by the investigator.\r\nAll developed software will be freely shared with the community.\r\n\r\n",
