 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tSince the initial FEMP grant award in FY2004, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has been working with the National Science Foundation (NSF) and its logistics contractor, VECO Polar Resources (VPR), and several Summit researchers to address EERE issues at Summit Station in Greenland.   In 2004, Otto Van Geet, a senior NREL Engineer, conducted a site visit to Summit Station and authored a white paper, Technical and Economic Feasibility of a Renewable Energy System at Summit Station, Greenland, which was released to the NSF and the research community.  Several of the suggestions for improving efficiency and reducing electrical consumption included in the paper have already been acted upon, but more improvements need to be made.  Namely, NSF would like technical assistance from NREL to integrate inputs into their new power grid.  NSF has received additional FEMP TA funding for FY2006.  This will provide matching funds to the FEMP funds and allow NREL to provide support as described within.",
