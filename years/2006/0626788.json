In conventional stacks, protocol layers are differentiated by the distinct services each provides. RNA allows protocol stacks to adjust at runtime, which allows more dynamic composition of services, both within stacks and in the way stacks of individual hops form an overall network architecture.\r\n\r\n\tRNA extends the Multi-Domain Communication Model (MCDM) that emerged from the DARPA/NSF X-Bone research. RNA's approach recognizes the value of services between endpoints at a variety of scopes and layers, the similarity of service primitives at different layers, the similarity between 'real' and 'virtual' service layers, and that protocols are defined as much by the location of their endpoints as their services.\r\n\r\n\tDuring the first year, the RNA project will focus on the design of the structure of the metaprotocol and develop a subset of its services and a preliminary stack manager. RNA will explore how a single network stack can support diverse environments, and may impact the design of more flexible stacks with more useful interlayer coordination. Results will be presented at meetings and in publications, and the code will be made available on-line.\r\n",
