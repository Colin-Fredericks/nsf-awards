Reporting on observed phenomena and presenting critical measured experimental data, making links between compatible modeling techniques and predicting behavior are vital ingredients to a successful totally integrated material/structure design methodology.  Built into physical models will be those essential processing variables that lead to new and innovative fabrication methods.\r\n \r\nBringing together key academicians with partners in the aerospace and related industries, for example, will significantly improve the basis for testing, evaluation and certification methodologies, thereby unlocking the timely opportunities in scientific achievement and new product introduction in aerospace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
