 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal supports work on compact stars as sources of gravitational waves and on searches for the waves with LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory).  The work follows up on previous results showing that neutron stars could be detectable by initial LIGO (the\r\nconfiguration running now) rather than waiting several years for advanced LIGO, especially if such stars are made of things stranger than neutrons. Strange matter models are explored and their effect on detectability of gravitational waves by initial LIGO is evaluated.  The work also includes\r\nparticipation in ongoing and new LIGO searches for gravitational waves from compact stars, especially the Einstein@Home project which uses computing time donated by members of the general public all over the world.  LIGO contributions include code to run the searches and astrophysical guidance on where to look.\r\nDetection of such signals by LIGO would provide evidence for strange matter in neutron stars, yielding new information on matter at high densities which will complement and enhance the insights gained from photon astronomy and laboratory nuclear physics.  Students will be trained in gravitational wave astronomy just as the field is preparing to blossom.  The principal investigator will continue and expand his public outreach activities with Einstein@Home.\r\n",
