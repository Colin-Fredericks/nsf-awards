 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed research and education is to search for dark matter particles \r\nin the halo of our galaxy, and to increase the number of female physics students at the \r\nUniversity of Florida (UF). The motivation for the search for dark matter comes from our \r\ncurrent understanding of the universe. Over the last ten years, a variety of cosmological \r\nobservations have led to the construction of a concordance model of cosmology. In this very \r\nsuccessful model, the universe is made of 4% baryons, which constitute the ordinary matter, \r\n23% nonbaryonic dark matter, which formed all the structures observed today, and 73% \r\ndark energy, a smooth component revealed by its effect on the geometry of the universe. \r\nUnderstanding the nature of the dark matter and dark energy are the most important \r\nchallenges to cosmology. The dark matter could be made of so-called Weakly Interacting \r\nMassive Particles (WIMPs), which could have been produced in a very early phase of the \r\nuniverse. These Big Bang relics are particularly interesting because they are also predicted \r\nin particle physics theories going beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. They \r\ncan be detected in the laboratory by searching for nuclear recoils produced when WIMPs \r\nscatter off nuclei in a target detector. Because the predicted event rates are very low \r\n(smaller than one event per kg detector material and day), and the deposited energies \r\nare tiny, massive, ultra-low background experiments are needed in order to detect these \r\nhypothetical particles. Liquid xenon has many advantages as a dark matter detector. The \r\nhigh-density and high atomic number allow to build a compact and self-shielded detector, \r\nwhile the simultaneous measurement of the charge and light signal after a WIMP scatters \r\noff a Xe-nucleus provides an efficient method to discriminate against background noise from \r\nnatural radioactivity and cosmic ray interactions. The proposed research has the ultimate \r\ngoal of building a large liquid Xe dark matter experiment in an underground laboratory. \r\nA first, 10 kg liquid Xe dark matter prototype has been approved and will be installed at \r\nthe Gran Sasso Laboratory in 2006. At the University of Florida, we have built a smaller, \r\n3 kg prototype, with the goal of calibrating the light and charge output of the detector and \r\nestablishing its discrimination power at low energies by using a neutron beam at the UF \r\ntandem accelerator. \r\n\r\nThe main focus of the educational part of the proposal is to mentor female students in \r\nbridging the transition from high school to college and from college to a PhD program on \r\nphysics. A series of talks will be given at local high schools with the goal of recruiting female \r\nstudents to UF and to a yearly 7 week summer program in which they are actively involved \r\nin research in a physics lab. A mentoring program for female undergraduate and graduate \r\nstudents at UF will be established. It will be organized both as small-group tutoring, by \r\npairing one undergraduate and one graduate student and having them meet regularly, as \r\nwell as in large group activities, such as monthly meetings with a female professor from \r\nUF or abroad, and social events. Such meetings, along with office hours for female physics \r\nstudents have been offered since fall 2004, and so far were very well attended. The ultimate \r\ngoal of the educational component will be to increase the number of women who obtain an \r\nadvanced degree in physics, and who will continue to have a successful career in science.\r\n\r\n",
