 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tDiversity in floral morphology is astounding, yet very little is known about how changes in developmental genetic patterning give rise to differences in floral form.  Floral diversification can occur rapidly and this is likely due to selective pressures imposed through plant-pollinator interactions.  Therefore, investigating the evolution of developmental genetic pathways among closely related plant species that exhibit differences in floral form will be highly productive in determining how changes in gene expression, protein function and genetic interactions give rise to morphological differences between species. In the model plant species snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus), a set of genes and genetic interactions have been identified that are necessary for the proper establishment of bilateral flower symmetry.  The proposed research will utilize both gene expression assays and analyses of protein function, through gene silencing strategies, to specifically addresses how the genetic network establishing bilateral flower symmetry has diversified among closely related species of snapdragon.  In addition, the proposed research will provide insight into how genetic changes in this developmental network have contributed to the evolution of novel floral morphologies observed among species closely related to snapdragon.  These studies will help elucidate the underlying genetic changes that are responsible for the evolution of plant form.  Such findings can have important agronomic implications, such as the development of improved crop species, as well as a significant impact on our general understanding of how morphological diversity arises over evolutionary time.  The proposed research is highly inter-disciplinary, and will therefore offer an exceptional opportunity for training a postdoctoral researcher, graduate students and undergraduate students at the interface of traditional plant morphology, plant molecular developmental genetics and molecular evolution. In addition, this project will enhance the quality of research at the University of Kansas and will include the participation of under-represented groups.",
