 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nWith a program on multiscale order and functionality in multiblock copolymer assemblies and nanoparticle co-assemblies the PI proposes to develop a modular bottom-up approach towards multifunctional materials through a combination of linear amphiphilic ABC triblock copolymers (designer soft materials) with various sol and metal nanoparticles (hard components). The aims are to understand the fundamental principles that govern the co-assemblies, to simultaneously control order on multiple length scales up to the macroscopic level, and to demonstrate that combinations of dissimilar materials with control of multiscale order phenomena lead to unique, anisotropic property profiles often resulting from synergistic effects. Emerging from these considerations is a vision that, in analogy to the biological protein machinery, the monomer (block) sequence information of synthetic, non-natural macromolecules can be used to encode information about molecular level structure and functionality of co-assemblies with dissimilar materials like ceramics, and metals. This will lead to the design of entirely new classes of materials with properties that have no analogue in the natural world. The proposed research includes synthesis of all necessary organic/polymer and inorganic components, characterization of assembly structures using various scattering and electron microscopy techniques, as well as the study of specific properties including charge transport phenomena and anisotropic mechanical properties. Interdisciplinarity will be a central feature of the effort. At Cornell, the PI is uniquely positioned to make advances in this highly interdisciplinary field; the program will make effective use of facilities such as the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) as well as facilities of the Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR).\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nUnderstanding the fundamental principles governing the co-assembly of dissimilar materials will have profound impact in a broad range of areas such as power generation and storage (electrocatalysis, fuel cells, and photovoltaics) or microelectronics (low-cost alternatives for lithography and magnetic storage media). A particular strength of this proposal derives from the continuation of very fruitful interactions with several individuals at Cornell and abroad (Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz, Germany) who have outstanding reputations in their fields. The proposed research program is situated at the interface between traditionally separated scientific disciplines thus promoting an interdisciplinary way of teaching, training, and learning and a unique educational experience for graduate and undergraduate students. It will also involve other components of training and development of human resources, including the participation of underrepresented groups, enhancement of the infrastructure for research and education, and industrial outreach. In particular, because of the large multiplication effect, the PI will work with local high school teachers to promote issues related to materials science and engineering.  He will establish a collaboration on hybrid materials with Norfolk State University, VA, a Historically Black College/University (HBCU) with a large participation of underrepresented minorities, (NSF PREM program). \r\n",
