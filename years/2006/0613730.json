 "awd_abstract_narration": "Following 80 years of absence, wolves were reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park (YNP) in 1995.  The basic approach to studying YNP wolves has entailed ground and aerial tracking of radio-collared wolves.  For the past ten years, all wolf packs on Yellowstone's Northern Range have been monitored intensively for 30-day periods beginning 15 November and 1 March.  During these two periods abundance, pack size dynamics, kill rates, vital rates, and aspects of intra- and interspecific behavior have been determined.  These observations contribute to a better understanding of wolf population dynamics and of how wolf populations affect and are affected by elk populations.  The current project represents a continuation of what has already been a 10-year study.\r\n\r\nThe topic of this research - predation - is one of the fundamental ecological relationships.  The subject of the study - wolves and their predation on elk - is of great interest to the general public and managers.  Because it links an important scientific concept with a popular pair of species, this research is directly associated with broad public educational outreach that takes many forms, from field classes and books to major TV documentaries.  In recent years, this research has also been closely linked to that of over a dozen scientific collaborators and has provided research foci for 12 graduate students.  It has also provided full-time, season-long opportunities to participate in field research to ~50 volunteers (40% female), most of whom are expecting to pursue a career in science.\r\n",
