 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal consists of five important steps. First, the\r\ninvestigator develops new dependence measures (quotient correlation)\r\nand analyze the resulting test statistics. It is important to\r\ndevelop test statistics for tail independence based as much as\r\npossible on appropriate tail observations and less on observations\r\nfrom the center which may bias the analysis. Clearly, the decision\r\non \"where does appropriate\" stands has to be carefully analyzed.\r\nSecond, a new measure for extreme co-movement is introduced. This\r\nmeasure allows one to calculate probabilities of occurrences of\r\ncertain extreme events in the future given the past history of the\r\nextreme movement of underlying variables. Third, the proposal\r\nincludes the development of statistical estimation methods for\r\nmax-stable processes. This allows one to efficiently study clustered\r\nspatial-temporal extreme observations. Fourth, procedures of how to\r\ncalculate portfolio risk measures -- such as unconditional or\r\nconditional Value at Risk -- are also introduced using combined\r\nMarkov process and max-stable process models. Fifth, the statistical\r\nanalysis of extreme co-movements is of considerable importance in\r\npractice. For example, the notion of spillover in global financial\r\nmarkets and credit loss data can be thought of as one area of\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposal in a first instance stems\r\nfrom a precise testing procedure for extremal dependence. As all\r\ndefinitions used depend on some limit procedures and often concern\r\nstatistical testing for parameters at the edge of a specific\r\nparametric space (hence possibly testing is a non-regular estimation\r\nproblem), great care has to be taken to obtain tests with sufficient\r\npower. The proposal is exactly aiming at finding a solution for\r\nthis. Several procedures for tackling this problem have been\r\npublished, however, up to now, no clear winning approach seems to\r\nexist. The investigator will carefully compare and contrast new\r\napproaches with existing ones using simulated as well as real data.\r\nThe real data will come from areas as diverse as insurance, finance,\r\ntelecommunications, climatology, seismology, medicine, etc. Beyond\r\nthese methodological merits and specific applications, the proposal\r\nalso has a considerable broad impact. Throughout applications in\r\ndiverse fields (like above), extreme risks play an important\r\nscientific, societal as well as (possibly) political role. The\r\ndissemination of new statistical tools leading to a better\r\nunderstanding of the occurrence of joint extremes is of great\r\nimportance. This can be very well achieved at the level of new\r\ngraduate courses, publications in journals aimed at a broaden\r\naudience and in discussion with scientists from other fields.\r\n",
