The physical problems under investigation are large\r\nPrandtl number or small Ekman number regimes in Rayleigh-Benard\r\nconvection, large Prandtl-Darcy number or small Darcy number\r\nregimes in convection in fluid saturated porous media, and\r\nstochastically forced quasi-geostrophic systems with random\r\nnoise.  Model reduction in the parameter regimes for the\r\nconvection problems leads to singular limit problems involving\r\nmultiple time and spatial scales.  One of the goals here is to\r\ninvestigate what kind of statistical properties can be\r\napproximated using the statistical properties of the simplified\r\nmodels derived via singular limits.  In the case of systems with\r\nrandom noise, which are modeled by stochastic partial\r\ndifferential equations, the investigator and his colleagues\r\ninvestigate possible noise-induced statistical stabilities, i.e.,\r\nstability of statistical properties with respect to initial\r\ncondition and parameters. \r\n\r\n     There are abundant uncertainties in nature.  For instance,\r\nprediction of the path of a hurricane is influenced by\r\n(imperfect) information about the initial distribution of\r\natmospheric and sea surface temperatures, wind, and the\r\natmospheric jet stream, as well as by the imperfect model itself. \r\nThe climate (long-time behavior) of the earth may be influenced\r\nby the ozone layer, concentrations of carbon dioxide, and other\r\nfactors.  Transport of contaminants in ground water is influenced\r\nby porosity and permeability of the media, which are random. \r\nStudying the influence of various uncertainties on the\r\ngeophysical flows considered here helps us better understand the\r\nbehavior of the flows. \r\n",
