 "awd_abstract_narration": "WGBH is requesting funds to produce a four-hour NOVA television special with accompanying Web and outreach activities about the pervasive role of materials in our lives.  The overarching goals of the project are to:  1) enhance public engagement in and understanding of materials science, including appreciation of its effects on society; 2) promote collaboration among educators, scientists and community-based organizations to reach a broad audience; and 3) create effective methods of expanding informal science learning that can be evaluated for their lasting impact on the field.  The mini-series, \"STUFF:  The Materials that Shape our World,\" will offer an appreciation of the human and scientific factors that drive innovation in materials science, from ancient breakthroughs to today's explosion of biological and nanomaterials.  The four episodes, themed around \"Stronger,\" \"Smaller,\" \"Smarter\" and \"Cleaner\" will provide a clear focus on the interdisciplinary nature of materials science and showcase dramatic stories of past inventions and exciting new discoveries.  The NOVA team in association with the Materials Research Society (MRS) will produce the series.  The \"STUFF\" series is anticipated to be broadcast on PBS in the fall of 2008.  WGBH and MRS will work with local PBS stations to train local scientists in public outreach.  Multimedia Research will conduct formative evaluation of the project components, and Goodman Research Group will conduct summative evaluation of both the series and the outreach efforts.\r\n\r\n",
