 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project proposes to design and build a miniature, 1 cm3, hyperspectral, imaging module that is so small and light weight that it is easily incorporated into a hand held image capture device with display, head mounted display, or even eyewear. It would be capable of operation over the visible spectrum, into the NIR, possibly in the UV, with 10nm resolution while capturing images at speeds suitable for real-time visualizing of images. The first part of the effort will be to develop a tunable filter module that is suitable for integration into a miniature hyperspectral imaging module. Following demonstration of a satisfactory tunable filter module, it would then be integrated with the image capture optics, sensor, and support electronics into the mini-hyperspectral imaging module which would be capable of capturing images and storing them in memory of a standard PC platform.\r\n\r\nIf successful the outcome of this project will provide a much needed visualization and analytical tool by a diverse array of markets. The proposed miniature, low-cost hyperspectral imaging module would enable an enhanced real-time visualization and analytical tool that delivers improved situational information for informed decision-making in areas such as defense and medicine.\r\n",
