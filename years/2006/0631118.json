 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit: The scholarship project is attracting high academic ability students to Carroll College to study Chemistry, Biochemistry, or Molecular Biology.  Five to ten scholarships of $3,000 to $7,000 each are being given to eligible students each year, with all scholarships renewable for up to four years. The objectives being realized by the STaR scholarships include: the attraction of high ability students to the college's chemistry, biochemistry and biology programs, improvements in student retention from first to second year, promotion of academic excellence for the cohort group receiving scholarships, and the provision of clear bridges to professional careers.   All STaR Scholars enroll in the same core curriculum for the first year to establish a strong bond within the cohort group. This includes a year of introductory chemistry and biology, and a specially designed First Year Seminar and Writing Seminar. These latter two courses, required of all Carroll College students, focus on natural sciences, science literacy and technical writing. All students also enroll in Biological Ethics as a cohort. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The program promises to produce a number of well prepared professionals in their field by providing multiple opportunities for academic and career development including peer mentoring, industrial visits, internships, on and off-campus research, national meeting presentations, career panels and social opportunities.  These program elements are encouraging and enabling academically talented but financially needy students to pursue degrees and careers in chemistry, bio-chemistry and molecular biology.\r\n",
