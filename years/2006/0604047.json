The investigators\r\nexplores these connections through modeling, analysis, numerical\r\nsimulation and experiments.  They study multidimensional\r\nnonlinear systems of partial differential equations of avalanche\r\nmodels, and the connection to experiments, to gain new insights\r\ninto fundamental aspects of granular and avalanche mechanics.  In\r\nrelated studies, the investigators formulate and analyze systems\r\nof partial differential equations for thin liquid films driven by\r\nsurfactants or controlled by temperature.  These equations give\r\nrise to mathematical theory addressing new wave structures\r\nobserved in experiments and simulations. \r\n\r\n     The investigators explore strong connections between the\r\nscience and mathematics of thin liquid films and the flow of thin\r\nlayers of granular materials.  Thin films are important in\r\nmedical applications such as surfactant replacement therapy, and\r\nin microscopic coating flows that arise in industry and\r\nmanufacturing.  Granular materials occur over a large range of\r\nlength scales, from pharmaceuticals and agricultural grains to\r\nrocks and gravel in landslides.  The results of this project\r\nfurther the understanding of issues of both specialized\r\nscientific interest and of broad significance to society, such as\r\nthe identification of mechanisms of wave propagation and patterns\r\nin surfactant transport in human lungs, and the separation by\r\nsize of rocks and other particles in avalanches.  This project\r\nincorporates training of mathematics and physics graduate and\r\nundergraduate students in mathematics, simulation, and\r\nexperimental physics in a multidisciplinary research program. \r\nThe participation of under-represented groups builds on recent\r\nsuccesses.  Results from this project are disseminated through\r\njournal publications, special sessions and lectures at\r\ninternational conferences, articles in popular science\r\npublications, and through a project web page. \r\n",
