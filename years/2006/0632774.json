The Talkeetna and Ladakh-Kohistan arcs provide exposures of relatively complete sections from Moho depth (30 to 40 km in both cases), to volcanic rocks and volcaniclastic sediments. Both have been the subject of large, multi-disciplinary Continental Dynamics Program (CD) projects over the past decade, and provide depth sections and temporal progressions that are not accessible in active oceanic arcs. \r\nIntensive, recent investigations of arc plutonic suites elsewhere complement these projects. New data from the US MARGINS Initiative, Sierra Nevada Continental Dynamics Projects, Aleutian studies, and similar international initiatives provide constraints on crustal thickness and volcanic fluxes in active arcs. Advances in the study of melt inclusions have dramatically improved understanding of volatiles in primitive arc magmas. Studies of ultra-high pressure metamorphic rocks and new experimental methods have yielded insights into mantle wedge melt generation, and subduction zone dehydration and anatexis. This conference will provide an opportunity to synthesize these results, with a focus on using direct observations of arc crustal sections, from the uppermost mantle to the volcanics, to constrain arc processes and their role in the genesis and evolution of continental crust. \r\nThe enthusiastic response of keynote speakers, only one out of twenty-four declined the request for letters of commitment, indicates that the time is right for this conference, and that it will attract an excellent group of well informed participants with much to discuss.  To complement research presentations, the Conference will include at least two field trips, to accessible outcrops of volcanic and the Moho sections of the Talkeetna arc. \r\n\r\n",
