 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT \r\nThis proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 05-610, category NER.  The objective of this research is synthesis and characterization of 2 and 3-dimensional nanoporous frameworks that could be used as biomimetic growth templates, synthetic cytoskeletons and molecularly resolved lithography guides. The approach is to use a modular combination of both natural proteins and synthetic modules that will allow precise definition the chemical function and dimension of scaffold features as well as ready modulation of the physical parameters of the framework by synthetic chemistry. This synthetic route will employ molecular rods that terminate with the ligands for commercially available proteins; protein-ligand recognition then can be used to crosslink the rods to create a non-covalent matrix. \r\nThis project implements complex biomolecular recognition in surface engineering applications for the first time and thus represents a genuine advancement to the field of nanoscale assembly. As electronic device configuration has developed to a point where molecular (nanoscale) organization is relevant, molecular self-assembly accordingly has emerged as a clear strategy in engineering. The multidisciplinary nature of this project involves chemical, biological, engineering and analytical methods, thus providing a broad educational experience for graduate students and undergraduates working on the project. \r\n \r\n",
