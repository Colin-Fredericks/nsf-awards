Two classes of materials result from this process: 1) composites having anisotropic electrical conductivity and thermal transport properties and 2) structures with embedded microvasculature. The feasibility of this process to form embedded nanowire composites will be established and parametric studies will be performed to evaluate the effect of electric field strength and geometry, nanoparticle size and polarization, complex fluid permittivity and elasticity, and matrix solidification on rate of formation and final nanowire structures. Using thermoreversible gels, such nanocomposites may be formed for temporary use and then dissolved and redispersed for re-use. Using dissolution of nanowires grown linearly or fractally along local electric field lines as a template for vasculature, it should be possible to dictate the structure and connectivity of microfluidic networks.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nThe ability to directly form nanowire composites in adhesives has the potential to streamline and simplify the processing of various electronic devices. Self assembly of connections between components and substrates without the need for precision alignment may have significant impact on sensor and display production technologies. Creation of microvasculature using the proposed nanoparticle self assembly method could allow point-of-use fabrication of microchemical processes in situations of limited resources such as on the battlefield or in space. This program will directly educate a graduate student and the results generated will be disseminated in courses, in journal publications, at conferences, and any images of an aesthetically pleasing quality will be integrated into a Lehigh Valley Art/Nano project currently under development. The results of the proposed research will significantly impact both the hierarchical nanomanufacturing and nanoscale devices and system architecture areas of the Active Nanostructures and Nanosystems Program.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
