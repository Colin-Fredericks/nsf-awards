 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PIF project explores novel approaches to implementing quantum information processing (QIP) by linear optics. The general goal is to learn how to create single-photon wave packets in known pure states, to propagate them through linear-optical systems that transform their spatial and polarization states in controlled ways, and to use conditional measurement of a subset of the photons to drive probabilistic quantum logic gate operations. The project will address a progression of topics: (1) Controlled photonic qubit generation; (2) Transverse orbital photon states for single-qubit encoding; (3) Orbital cluster states and orbital fusion gates for photons; (4) Orbital states and qubit gates for photons in optical fiber. The research will have broader impact beyond the field of quantum information. The project brings together quantum opticians with optical device scientists. This collaboration has already yielded new results in device research?electrically poled silica waveguides, which may provide a powerful platform for classical as well as quantum information processing. The present project is collaborative with researchers in the United Kingdom, providing the opportunity for U.S. PhD students to spend time at Oxford and Southampton universities, carrying out research and benefiting from their facilities and expertise. NSF International Programs has contributed to making this possible.",
