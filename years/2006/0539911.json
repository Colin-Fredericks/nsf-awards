 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will develop a novel removable ultra high capacity micro optical storage device. The technology is based on a small form factor optical storage (SFFO) achieving 0.5 GB/disc using 32mm molded disc technology leveraged from DVD infrastructure. We propose a 11 to 22 times increase using Near Field Recording (NFR) employing a high index micro Solid Immersion Lens (microSIL). Information storage density is critically dependant on the smallest mark that can be reliably read with a focused spot (size~?/n?sin?) where n is the index of refraction, ? is the wavelength and ? describes the cone angle of the focused beam. A microSIL of GaP with n=3.3 at ?=650 nm shrinks the linear spot size by 3.3X yielding an areal density increase of 3.32 or ~11X. Increasing sin? from 0.60 to 0.85 gives another factor of two for 22X overall or 11GB/disc. Electron beam media mastering, MEMS semiconductor grayscale microSIL etching processes plus this novel front surface micro optical system technologies makes this system conceivable. We propose to integrate a GaP microSIL into our dynamic spin stand tester incorporating all the necessary read and write optics and electronics to develop sufficient understanding to make concrete commercialization plans.\r\n\r\nThe commercial applications for a 10+ GB capacity low cost removable optical cartridge in the portable electronic device market are growing at an unprecedented pace as applications once reserved for desktops and workstations find their way onto portable platforms. This digital convergence is driving the mobile market arena. It provides major\r\nnew opportunities for storage and delivery of entertainment, educational content, movies, music, still photography and individual medical records. Today content is provided almost exclusively on large-format optical discs (CD/DVD), a new small form factor optical standard is positioned to capitalize on the existing infrastructure and existing\r\nconsumer habits. Still photo and video mobile phone cameras alone are estimated at 300 million units in 2006.\r\n",
