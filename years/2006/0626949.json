 "awd_abstract_narration": "Network-layer innovation has proven surprisingly difficult, for various reasons:  existing protocols ignore competing economic interests; also, a few protocols dominate, enabling layer violations that lead to further entrenchment of technologies.  Many shortcomings of today's internetwork layer result from its inflexibility with respect to the policies of the stakeholders, namely users and service providers.  The consequences of these failings are well-known: various hacks, layering violations, and overloadings are introduced to enforce policies and attempt to get the upper hand in various \"tussles\".  The result is a network that is increasingly brittle, hostile to innovation, vulnerable to attack, and insensitive to concerns about accountability and privacy.  The goal of the Postmodern Internetwork Architecture project is to design, implement, and, through daily use, evaluate a minimalist internetwork layer and accompanying auxiliary functionality that anticipates tussles and allows them to be played out in policy space, as opposed to in the packet-forwarding path.  The overarching goal of the project is to make a larger portion of the network design space accessible without sacrificing the economy of scale offered by the unified Internet.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA key objective of the overall PoMo project across the collaborating institutions is separation of concerns &ndash; disentangling mechanism from policy so that users and providers can tussle over policy without being constrained by the underlying mechanisms, and explicit support for heterogeneous networking technologies and mechanisms that are becoming increasingly important and for which IP is inappropriate, including MANETSs (mobile ad hoc networks), DTNs (disruption-tolerant networks), and WSNs (wireless sensor networks).  Therefore, we aim to understand how to realize this objective with a new PostModern Internet architecture (PoMo) that provides a new lightweight internetworking layer above, and interconnecting current layer-3 network architectures, protocols, and mechanisms (including IP).  A PoMo internetwork consists of a set of realms that are defined by mechanism, policy, and trust boundaries. KUs emphases in this project are on the support for heterogeneous subnetwork realms and on end-to-end resilient communication using cross-layering between realm internals, the PoMo thin internetwork layer, and the end-to-end transport protocol.\n\nTherefore, the KU-specific objective is to understand how to apply these ideas and understand the ways in which new end-to-end inter-realm diverse multipath transport, cross-layered with the realm and network levels, can provide for a more flexible and robust Future Internet.  Furthermore, a key objective of this project is to design and analyze protocols and mechanisms that achieve the previous objective.  Finally, an objective is to develop tools that are not only useful to our project, but to the larger research community.  Two major areas of investigation were in the benefits of path diversity, and in resilient end-to-end transport over heterogeneous realms.\n\nPath Diversity:  The Path Diversification method is a heuristic algorithm designed to select multiple diverse paths between two nodes in a network, and can be applied to realm selection as well as node selection within a realm.  It yields several derived metrics reflecting some of the characteristics of the selected paths, as well as the network as a whole.  We have shown that one of these,  compensated total graph diversity (cTGD), is an excellent predictor of the flow robustness of a network topology, defined as the fraction of node pairs that remain connected after a challenge.\n\nResilient End-to-End Transport over Heterogeneous Realms:  This project completed the initial design and analysis of a cross-layered resilient transport protocol ResTP.  First, we developed a formal model for cross-layering and the design of the PoMo cross-layering mechanisms, using the knob and dial fields of the PoMo header, and incorporated them into the PoMo and ResTP simulation models.  ResTP uses a flexible multipath protocol architecture that uses the path diversity information passed from lower layers to inform path selection decisions. The ResTP protocol is designed with adaptive resilience mechanisms in order to support various application requirements and network operating conditions. The ResTP header is designed to support cross-layer parameters and passes the fields used to indicate the service parameters required to the lower network layers.  Based on the application requirements, there are a number of services classes with differing protocol operation and overhead..\n\nIn addition to a number of publications presenting the results of these two areas, we developed three tools for use in the project and to benefit the larger research community: KU-LoCGen (The University of Kansas Location and Cost Constrained Topology Generator) that permits the construction of realistic complex network topologies, KU-TopView (The University of Kansas Topology Viewer) that permits the display and manipulation of actual and synthetic network topologies, and KU-CSM that permits us to evaluate the impact of various challenges on PostModern inter- and intra-r..."
