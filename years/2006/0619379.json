 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, acquiring audio visual equipment to create a laboratory environment to carry out usability studies on humans and their interactions with user-interfaces, emphasizes people with disabilities, both permanent and situational, including instances when the person is too busy and cannot interact with the computer (e.g., a person whose phone/PDA is ringing while driving). The faculty (9 involved) conduct controlled experiments of human performance and satisfaction, investigations of how technology functions with respect to human capabilities, and field studies use in context. The research involves\r\n\r\n-Lab-based 1-on-1 classical testing, Focus groups, Field-based testing, \r\n-Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) ; and\r\n-Distance Learning, and CMC-Assisted Learning\r\n\r\nBy investigating the design, implementation, and evaluation of interactive information technologies (IT), the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) work aims at producing theoretical contributions. This research focuses primarily on the challenges involved in supporting groups working together to address a common goal, information seeking activities, and personalized/adaptive interfaces. The Universal Access (UA) research addresses the difficulties individuals experience interacting with IT as a result of either health-related or situational-induced impairments and disabilities. Stemming from investigation of the IT difficulties experienced by individuals with high-level spinal cord injuries, this research has expanded to address a broad range of interaction issues, with an emphasis on physical disabilities.\r\n\r\n",
