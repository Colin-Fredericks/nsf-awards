Our research consists of four broad activities:\r\n\r\nMeasurement:  Using a combination of passive network monitoring\r\nand active Web crawling, we are gathering quantitative evidence\r\nabout the nature of spyware and its lifecycle.\r\n\r\nEarly detection: We are exploring schemes to detect new spyware\r\nthreats before they have had the opportunity to cause widespread\r\ninfection.  For example, we are developing techniques for examining\r\nsoftware found while Web crawling to automatically identify\r\n\"spyware-like\" behavior, or to statically analyze software to look for\r\ncode fragments in common with previously detected spyware.\r\n\r\nPrevention: To prevent spyware from reaching a computer, we are\r\naugmenting firewall and proxy systems to detect and block spyware\r\nbefore it reaches its victims.  As well, to prevent new code from\r\ngaining a foothold on a PC, we are exploring ways of \"locking down\"\r\nwhat code is permitted to execute.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure development: To conduct our research, we are developing\r\nnew spyware testing infrastructure and workload repositories; our virtual\r\n\"spyware laboratory\" uses clusters and virtual machine monitors to\r\nenable high-throughput, scalable sandboxing and observation of\r\nmalicious code.  As well, we are amassing a large collection of\r\nknown spyware programs to enable additional analysis.\r\n",
