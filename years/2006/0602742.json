At\r\neach level the goal is to create\r\nempowerment and excitement around\r\nengineering and science. We have doubled the Alliance\r\nwide Indigenous STEM graduation rate from 46 students in\r\n2000 to 95 during the last academic year. Enrollments of\r\nIndigenous students in STEM disciplines have climbed from\r\n344 students during the 2001- 2002 academic year to 795\r\nduring 2004-2005. We have leveraged $3.2 million in NSF\r\nfunding with contributions of approximately $11 million\r\ndollars from our many partners.\r\nBroader Impact: Our students are among the poorest people\r\nin the nation. The parents of some of our Alaska Native\r\nstudents were raised on the tundra as nomads and are the\r\nfirst generation of people in their families to ever use money.\r\nIndigenous students have historically come to our\r\nUniversities under-prepared in math and science. We\r\nwould do years of remedial work at the University before\r\nthese students were able to successfully complete a\r\nUniversity level course. In many of the high schools with\r\nhigh populations of Native students, coursework was not\r\navailable that would foster success in STEM degree\r\nprograms. We are now bringing Indigenous people who are\r\nprepared in math and science to Alliance Universities in\r\nnumbers that are unprecedented at our institutions. They are\r\ngraduating and moving on to graduate schools. At UAA, the\r\nUniversity is in construction phase for a 12,000 square foot\r\nbuilding to house the Pacific Alliance and the Indigenous\r\nPeoples Institute for Engineering and Science Education.\r\nThe new Institute will be a focal point as our programs are\r\nreplicated across the nation. We are having a profound and\r\npositive impact on the students, their families, and their\r\ncommunities that will endure for generations.",
