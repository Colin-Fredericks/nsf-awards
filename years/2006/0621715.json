 "awd_abstract_narration": "High Density Three-Dimensional Optical Data Storage: High Fidelity Two-Photon Polymeric Photochromic WORM\r\n\r\nKevin D. Belfield\r\nDepartment of Chemistry and CREOL, College of Optics and Photonics\r\nUniversity of Central Florida\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: The vast number of advantages associated with multiphoton absorption-induced processes is fast propelling multiphoton absorbing materials and processes to the forefront of several important fields, and provide compelling rationale for extensive research and educational training in this field.  However, the potential of two-photon absorption (2PA) for optical data storage has yet to overcome some serious materials limitations, and it has been recognized that the 2PA and properties need to be increased in order for practical multiphoton absorption-based 3D optical data storage and processing media to be realized.  The proposed research will develop new, highly stable and sensitive two-photon absorbing photochromic materials and a non-destructive readout method for 3D optical data storage.  With knowledge gained in this research, the development of high fidelity photochromic 3D optical data storage materials and processes will result.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts:  The approach taken in this program involves a multi-disciplinary laboratory in which undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers receive cross-disciplinary training in photonic materials synthesis and characterization, photophysics, absorption and luminescence spectroscopy, laser systems, and optical science.  It is believed that such an approach will afford a fundamental understanding of two-photon absorption-based photochromic processes and provide the tenets for developing materials for applications for the important field of 3D optical data storage.  Broad influence on society may result by increasing storage density, impacting essentially all aspects of today's economy  spanning from data storage and computer networks to display technology.  Students will be engaged in interdisciplinary research training that will position them to make significant scientific and technical contributions in the photonic materials fields. This project will provide research and educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral researchers, including those from traditionally underrepresented groups, facilitating the preparation of a highly skilled and diverse workforce.\r\n\r\n",
