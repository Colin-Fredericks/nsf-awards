 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY\r\nThis CAREER proposal describes an integrated research and education program that will build a\r\nfoundation for achieving the PIs career goals: to deliver smaller and smarter systems by developing\r\nnovel modeling and control methodologies, and to train tomorrows control engineers with crossdisciplinary\r\nperspectives. In particular, the proposed research aims to fully realize the potential of\r\nIonic Polymer-Metal Composites (IPMCs), informally known as artificial muscles, in manipulation of\r\ndelicate, microscale objects (e.g., capture and transport of single biological cells and assembly of 3D\r\nMEMS structures), by developing modeling, sensing, and control strategies to address time-varying,\r\nnonlinear behaviors of IPMCs in actuation and sensing. The research will have four core thrusts:\r\n1. Development of a control-oriented model capturing essential dynamics and nonlinearities in\r\nIPMCs, including both hysteresis and nonlinear feedback coupling from the bending curvature\r\nof an IPMC actuator to its electrical behavior.\r\n2. Investigation of two original sensing approaches for IPMCs: one exploiting IPMCs built-in\r\nsensory capability using nonlinear compensation, the other utilizing the curvature-to-electrical\r\nbehavior coupling observed by the PIs group.\r\n3. Development of control schemes targeting the major nonlinearities in IPMC actuators, including\r\nadaptive inverse control methods for hysteretic, dynamical systems to accommodate possible\r\nvariation of IPMC behaviors.\r\n4. Design and fabrication of a biomimetic micromanipulator with IPMCs functioning simultaneously\r\nas structures, actuators, and sensors, and validation of the proposed modeling, sensing,\r\ncontrol methods through manipulation of microbeads and biological cells (in collaboration with\r\na biomedical engineer at Michigan State).\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe proposed research will enable fast, precision control of IPMC actuators throughout their full\r\nactuation ranges by identifying and accommodating major nonlinearities in the control design. The\r\ndeveloped sensing schemes can potentially eliminate the need for external sensors, resulting in smaller\r\nsystems. Theoretical and experimental investigation of scaling laws will help understand the capabilities\r\nand limitations of micro IPMC actuators and sensors, and offer insight into design of active\r\ndithering schemes to overcome adhesion, a critical problem in micromanipulation. The proposed\r\nproject will thus promote the development of compact, dexterous IPMC-based micromanipulation\r\nsystems while motivating formulations and solutions of new problems in modeling and control.\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe proposed research will provide an innovative approach to manipulation of biological cells and micro\r\ndevices, facilitating advances in biological studies, biotechnology, and microtechnology. Through\r\ncollaboration with Environmental Robots Inc., the developed control and sensing schemes will be\r\napplied to a number of IPMC-based biomedical applications (e.g., implantable micropumps for drug\r\ndelivery), with potential impacts on health care. Integrating with the research program, the PI will\r\nestablish an interdisciplinary curriculum on Smart Materials and Systems including a senior design\r\nprogram involving industrial partners (the PI has secured seed funding from SPIE) and a graduate\r\ncourse Smart Sensors and Actuators in Micro and Nanosystems. As a faculty advisor to the undergraduate\r\nresearch program hosted by the Diversity Programs Office at Michigan State, the PI\r\nwill involve women and minority students in developing biomimetic microrobots incorporating smart\r\nsensors and actuators, and further use these microrobots as appealing, hands-on educational kits to\r\ninspire the interest of K-12 students in science and engineering.\r\n  \r\n",
