Yet theoretical models of the physical conditions and\r\ndetails of the emission mechanism have gone largely unchallenged because of the\r\ndifficulty testing them against traditional pulsar observations. However, because models\r\ndiverge in their predictions for short timescales, the PIs have been pursuing high time\r\nresolution observations of the Crab Nebula pulsar. New data acquisition systems\r\ndeveloped for this purpose have detected nanosecond long radio bursts from the Crab's\r\nMain Pulse region and the fundamental entities creating the coherent radio emission. The\r\ntime and frequency characteristics of these \"nanoshots\" are consistent with a strong\r\nplasma turbulence model. However, subsequent observations of a second emitting region,\r\nthe Interpulse, revealed dramatically different time and frequency signatures indicating\r\nsubstantially different physical conditions which are difficult to explain.\r\nAs the Crab pulsar is unusual because of its young age, a similar study of a small set\r\n(five) of bright pulsars will be undertaken. These pulsars have been chosen to represent\r\nthe range of likely conditions in other pulsars and the observations will reveal whether\r\nthe type of emission from the Crab is typical of the general pulsar population. For the\r\nCrab itself, intensity and polarization fluctuations on microsecond timescales, as well as\r\ntime averaged polarization signatures, will be connected to the physical conditions in the\r\nemission region by additional theoretical modeling performed by the PIs. Theoretical\r\nmodels of the Interpulse emission will also be critically studied to determine which, if\r\nany, existing model can explain these observations.\r\nGraduate and undergraduate students will be directly involved in all aspects of this work\r\n- from constructing and maintaining the data collection systems to developing the\r\nnumerical codes for modeling and analysis. Beyond the laboratory, some of the research\r\ntools used here will be made available for teaching in local classes and the scientific\r\nresults incorporated into web-based teaching materials (in addition to dissemination in\r\nthe professional literature). The state-of-the-art acquisition systems, which will be\r\nimproved as part of this work, will be made available to the radio astronomy community\r\non a collaborative basis. The data acquisition and control software developed by the PIs\r\nis directly applicable to, and available for use in lightning research by the Atmospheric\r\nPhysics group at New Mexico Tech.",
