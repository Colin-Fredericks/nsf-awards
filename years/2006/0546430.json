 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nMultiple point contact is common in many manipulation tasks.  Examples\r\ninclude arrays for distributed or micro manipulation, vehicles, and\r\ntraditional robotic grasping.  Although all of these applications have\r\nreceived a great deal of attention, no previous works have provided an\r\nanalytical approach capable of dealing with the inherent uncertainties in\r\nthe contact state--the state that represents whether a given contact is\r\nsticking, slipping, or is out of contact. These nonsmooth transitions\r\nbetween contact states have a dramatic impact on the dynamics; hence, it\r\nis important to systematically mitigate the negative performance these\r\nnonsmooth effects induce.  Moreover, these systems are often overactuated,\r\nso that each contact interface is independently articulated.  This leads\r\nto mechanisms that are nominally kinematically overconstrained--that is,\r\nthe kinematic relationships between all the point contacts cannot be\r\nsimultaneously satisfied.  Which constraint is broken is sensitive to\r\ndetails of friction and normal force modeling, so it is necessary to\r\nestimate the current contact state and incorporate the contact state into\r\nthe motion planning and control.  The goal of this research is to\r\nproduce hybrid estimators, motion planning algorithms, and control\r\nstrategies that will work in concert to guarantee performance and\r\nstability in the face of multiple contact interfaces in an unstructured\r\nenvironment.  An overconstrained multiple point manipulator prototype will\r\nbe developed and planning and control methods will be applied to this\r\nsystem to demonstrate manipulation that is not sensitive to the\r\nparticulars of the frictional interfaces.\r\n\r\nManufacturing often involves the need to reposition and reorient objects\r\nfor purposes of assembly.  To accomplish this, multiple actuators are\r\noften used, and these actuators experience stick and slip contact with the\r\nobject due to frictional interactions.  The physics of the actuators and,\r\nin particular, their interaction with the object are notoriously difficult\r\nto model accurately. Hence, there is a strong need for manipulation\r\nstrategies that are not sensitive to these low-level details.  Moreover,\r\nmany vehicles, such as the original Mars rover, have a mechanical design\r\nthat guarantees that some of the wheels must slip during operation.\r\nHowever, which wheels slip is dependent on unknown environmental conditions.  Hence, in this situation as well there is a need to develop motion planning strategies that are guaranteed to work even in the presence of substantial uncertainty arising from the environment.  This project will contribute to these needs by developing\r\nstrategies that have guaranteed performance in the face of inherent\r\nuncertainty. In the short term this project will contribute to macro-scale\r\nmanufacturing and vehicle control, and in the long-term will likely impact\r\nmicro-scale manufacturing.\r\n",
