 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER proposal includes problems related to algebraic and enumerative\r\ncombinatorics and its applications to geometry of polytopes, representation\r\ntheory, inverse boundary problems, and algebraic geometry.  The proposal\r\ndiscusses permutohedra and their generalizations, which are certain convex\r\npolytopes related to Coxeter arrangements.  The PI suggests three different\r\napproaches to calculation of volumes and Ehrhart polynomials of such polytopes.\r\nHe introduces new mixed Eulerian numbers with remarkable combinatorial\r\nproperties.  Various generalizations of permutohedra include Stasheff's\r\nassociahedra, Pitman-Stanley polytopes, polytopes related to wonderful\r\ncompactifications of De Concini-Procesi, etc. There are intriguing parallels\r\nbetween these polytopes and generalized associahedra related to\r\nFomin-Zelevinsky's theory of cluster algebras.  The next part of the proposal\r\nis related to Schur positivity.  The PI with collaborators have recently\r\nresolved several open Schur positivity problems that attracted a lot of\r\nattention, including Fomin-Fulton-Li-Poon's conjecture and Okounkov's\r\nconjecture.  They plan to apply their techniques to prove several other\r\nprominent conjectures.  The proposal mentions a general Schur positivity\r\nconjecture involving a mysterious polytope, which might have relations with the\r\nKlyachko cone and lead to new interesting combinatorics.  The proposal\r\ndiscusses the inverse boundary problem for networks and its relations with\r\ntotal positivity.  Networks parametrize the totally positive cells on the\r\nGrassmannian.  This construction has links with Fomin-Zelevinsky's results on\r\ndouble Bruhat cells and with their theory of cluster algebras.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER proposal describes new initiatives in research and education in the\r\narea of combinatorics.  Combinatorial techniques play an increasingly important\r\nrole in other fields such as algebra, geometry, computer science, probability\r\ntheory, physics, biology, cryptography, etc. Both the research and the\r\neducational components of the proposal aim on applications of combinatorics.\r\nThe proposal discusses several important combinatorial problems on the\r\nfrontiers of modern mathematical research.  These problems involve counting or\r\nenumerating various discrete mathematical objects, say, vertices of a polytope\r\nor pieces in a decomposition of a complicated geometrical object into simpler\r\nobjects.  These problems would help to understand, clarify, and simplify\r\nnontrivial mathematical concepts and constructions.  The proposed research\r\nproject would have impact in several fields, including algebraic geometry\r\n(which studies geometrical objects using algebra), representation theory (which\r\nstudies symmetries), theory of convex polytopes, and theoretical physics.  The\r\neducational part of the proposal includes plans for a new course on modern\r\napplications of combinatorics.  The PI is planning to encourage graduate and\r\nundergraduate research.  Combinatorial problems are appealing for undergraduate\r\nstudents because these problems are intuitive and easy to formulate but yet\r\nquite challenging.  The proposal describes plans for using interactive visual\r\ntools and demos, applets, and animations in teaching future combinatorics\r\ncourses.  \r\n",
