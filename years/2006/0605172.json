 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Principal Investigators will further develop and use their recent  \r\nresults in orbifold cohomology, orbifold K-theory and the orbifold Chern\r\ncharacter. They will expand their work on the obstruction bundle to  \r\ninclude orbifold Gromov-Witten theory which will have implications not only for\r\ncalculations, but also important theoretical significance. Secondly,  \r\nthey will generalize their constructions of stringy and orbifold K-theory and\r\ncohomology from the case of a finite group to the case of a non-Abelian,\r\ninfinite group with possibly infinite stabilizers. Third, they will  \r\nstudy invariants arising from their stringy and orbifold Chern characters.  In\r\nparticular, they will investigate the Chern classes and similar  \r\nstructures in the stringy and orbifold settings.  Finally, they will examine the  \r\nrelation of these invariants to their counterparts on various hyper-Kaehler and\r\ncrepant resolutions of the underlying singular spaces.\r\n\r\nInvariants of spaces are fundamental tools in topology and geometry.   \r\nThe development of new invariants is of great importance to these fields,  \r\nas it provides new tools to identify and describe essential properties of  \r\ngeometric and topological spaces.  Invariants also appear in theoretical physics\r\nas observables in topological quantum field theories, for example. In  \r\nmany physical and mathematical settings, the spaces of greatest importance also have\r\nsymmetries, and it is important to understand how those symmetries  \r\ninteract with the geometric and topological properties of the space.   \r\nRecently, the PIs have developed new invariants of spaces with symmetries (stringy\r\nK-theory) and have also made important progress in describing  \r\nconnections between their new invariants and previously known invariants, such as\r\norbifold cohomology.  They have also used their newly developed tools to\r\nrefine and simplify many aspects of those previously known  \r\ninvariants.  With the support of this grant, the PIs will use their theory of stringy K- \r\ntheory as well as their improvements on orbifold cohomology to study spaces  \r\nwith symmetries.   They will also further develop these tools to extend their\r\napplicability to more types of spaces, including spaces with continuous\r\nsymmetries, which are common throughout mathematics and physics.\r\nThey will also develop new invariants of such spaces, including\r\nenhancements of well-known classical invariants such as Chern classes,\r\nbut accounting for symmetries.  Such invariants are suggested by\r\ntopological string theory and will provide powerful tools for  \r\nunderstanding these spaces.\r\n",
