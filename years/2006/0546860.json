 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: The generalized view of multiuser communication with side information resulting from the proposed activity will be a significant contribution to network information theory. It will set in place powerful tools and techniques that will be pivotal in estimating the capacity limits of complex wireless networks. Genie based capacity bounds will establish fundamental limits of how useful side information can be in a wireless network. The proposed activity brings together diverse areas like networking, optimization theory, and numerical algorithms. The PI has a successful record of previous research characterizing single and multiuser capacity with partial channel knowledge.\r\nBroader Impact: Understanding the capabilities of wireless networks is essential for the industry, the academia,the government agencies and the society in general to have realistic expectations from the wireless networks of the future. The results of this research will be disseminated broadly through traditional scholarly venues to the entire research community, the government and the industry. The research will help government agencies direct their resources into enabling the applications that are shown to be within the capacity limits of wireless networks. The guidelines for designing wireless networks will be useful for the industry. Society as a whole will benefit from the increased array of applications of wireless networks driven by the optimal design principles. The results of the proposed activity will be integrated into coursework and educational research initiatives. The fundamental nature of these contributions will allow simple abstractions that can be readily understood by undergraduates, inspiring them to seek careers in research and education. As a minority institution, UC Irvine allows many opportunities for the vision of future wireless networks emerging out of this research to be presented to minorities, women and disadvantaged sections of society.\r\n",
