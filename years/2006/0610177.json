 "awd_abstract_narration": "Philip Weyman, University of Missouri, St. Louis, is a Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellow for the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 academic years.  Weyman's research examines cyanobacterial hydrogen production via the nitrogenase enzyme which also functions as a hydrogenase.  He proposes a molecular biology approach of random and site-directed mutagenesis to block or clear a substrate transport channel in the nitrogenase and to measure the impact on hydrogen production vs. nitrogen reduction.  Weyman pairs this research with an existing GK-12 program based at UMSL by developing four new curricular units exploring global warming, hydrogen, and fuel cells.  The units will be designed to reinforce scientific inquiry in high school chemistry, biology, and environmental science classrooms. High school teachers will also be invited to learn molecular and biochemical techniques during summer internships at UMSL.  \r\n\r\nThis Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the GK-12 Program in the Division of Graduate Education. The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.",
