 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jackson State Community College (JSCC) is developing a hands-on Natural Resource\r\nTechnology (NRT) Program for support of, and in conjunction with, the Precision Agriculture Technology's (PAT) innovative and successful curriculum. This project strengthens the existing Precision Agricultural Program by adapting the extensive capital investment of the PAT program with a new Natural Resource Technology A.A.S. degree program. This goal of this program is to produce multi-disciplinary precision agricultural and natural resource technicians with the knowledge, comprehension, and skills to support the need for trained technicians who understand important farming and environmental issues and management challenges of the future. An important aspect of the program is the recruitment of area high school students. The project enables stakeholder groups to participate in collaborative scientific studies in the fields of agronomic science, wildlife and fisheries management, forest management and environmental science.  This project also creates versatile technologically-trained individuals who understand the interconnectedness of the science of agronomy, wildlife, water and forest management and the natural environment at a level to meet industry and research needs; increases employment opportunities for students through service-learning relationships with wildlife, water and forest management agencies, area farm producers and agribusinesses; and enhances connections between the community college and the natural resources community by creating opportunities for collaboration on mutual research projects.\r\n",
