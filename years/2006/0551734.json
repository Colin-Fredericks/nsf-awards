 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, developing a series of sensor networking testbeds in New Mexico, focuses on the use of wireless sensor networks in the following applications:\r\n\r\n-Tracking, controlling, and behavioral monitoring of livestock on rangeland, \r\n-Micro-monitoring of weather and climate on an ecological research site, \r\n-Protecting contextual privacy of distributed sensing tasks, \r\n-Developing component-based middleware engineering for embedded sensor nodes and gateways, \r\n-Creating an integrated sensor net design environment and testbed, and \r\n-Developing a real-time collaborative virtual environment for smart office design and distance learning.\r\n\r\nEstablishing infrastructure, core capabilities, and expertise in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Distributed Sensor Information Technology, the project services three specific research projects:\r\n\r\n-Privacy protection issues in distributed sensing,\r\n-Component-based middleware engineering for WSN, and\r\n-Integrated sensor net design environment and testbed.\r\n\r\nThe equipment requested includes different types of embedded processor-radio modules (motes), compatible sensor data acquisition modules, serial and Ethernet programming and interface boards, and embedded specialized gateway computers. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  Newly developed courses on sensor networks service students at many levels, strengthening the education at this minority serving university. Furthermore, the research projects offer benefit to society directly and indirectly. Improved methods for integrating distance learning with main-campus learning attracts and engages more students in higher education; improved understanding of rangeland usage and livestock behavior helps improve land utilization and food production for society; and improved understanding of sensor network privacy security issues and of software engineering for sensors helps further the deployability mission-critical areas. \r\n",
