It shows the strongest influence of a hotspot (Iceland) of any mid-ocean ridge and is the type example of an obliquely spreading ridge.  This project will test two hypotheses for the origin of the V-shaped ridges; pulsing of the Iceland plume versus ridge jumps.  The goal is to provide a seamless history of the plate boundary geometry both at sea and on land during the past 18 Ma.  Marine geophysical data will be collected in the area from the Iceland margin to the northern boundary of the existing data at 62 degrees north.\r\n\r\nThe study involves the training of a graduate student and Icelandic scientists will participate in the expedition and receive training in various aspects of data gathering. They will also provide a critical link to the land data.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
