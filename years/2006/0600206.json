 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's will investigate several problems in stochastic analysis\r\nof pure and applied nature. Competing particle systems appear in\r\nvarious scientific models including biology and theory of\r\ncombustion. The PI's will study various aspects of such models,\r\nincluding hydrodynamic limits, tagged particle behavior and\r\nproperties of the associated partial differential equations. Long\r\nterm behavior of reflected Brownian motions driven by the same\r\nnoise will be examined. Geometric properties of Neumann\r\neigenfunctions will be investigated. Uniqueness of solutions to\r\nsome stochastic differential equations will be proved. Boundary\r\nbehavior of harmonic functions and local and global behavior of\r\nheat kernel associated with jump processes will be examined.\r\nBrownian motion on a fractal set will be investigated. Inverse\r\nproblem is a mathematical model arising naturally in applied\r\nsciences from geophysics to medicine and physics. The PI's will\r\nstudy the foundational questions related to this model, such as\r\nexistence and uniqueness of the solutions to the corresponding\r\nequations. Other models and processes will be the subject of\r\nseparate but related studies; they include Markov processes\r\nconditioned on a small time scale, a change of variable formula\r\nfor processes with 4-th order scaling properties and non-local\r\noperators of variable order.\r\n\r\nBrownian motion and Markov processes are models for a wide range\r\nof natural phenomena, such as weather and climate, various\r\nfunctions of living organisms and financial markets. One of the\r\nscientific goals is to make accurate predictions based on\r\navailable data. Mathematical methods have to be developed to make\r\nsuch predictions possible and reliable. The PI's will work on both\r\ntheoretical questions leading to general results and on specific\r\nmodels that can serve as testbeds for the general methods. The\r\nresults of theoretical research are often used to make\r\nquantitative predictions in well undrstood models and to make\r\nqualitative predictions related to complex systems. The research\r\nof PI's will be mostly focused on processes that display no or\r\nlittle long time memory. Such systems are popular models for\r\ninanimate matter and man-made systems, but also for many\r\nbiological systems.\r\n",
