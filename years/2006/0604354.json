 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe project has three components, all concerning new interactions\r\nbetween algebra and topology.  In the first component, the\r\ninvestigator will explore the role of orthogonal Grassmannians in\r\nmotivic homotopy theory.  The focus will be on their relationship with\r\nHermitian K-theory and on their motivic cohomology, the latter being\r\nrelated to motivic characteristic classes for quadratic bundles.  One\r\ngoal will be to geometrically construct such classes and to\r\ninvestigate their basic properties.  In the second part of the project\r\nthe investigator will explore (with D. Biss and D. Isaksen) spaces of\r\nzero-divisors in Cayley-Dickson algebras, in an attempt to completely\r\nclassify these.  This may eventually have applications to the Kervaire\r\ninvariant one problem, and this will be explored.  Finally, the\r\nresearcher will continue joint work with B. Shipley which studies the\r\nrelationship between differential graded algebras and ring spectra.\r\n\r\nThe last ten years have seen the discovery of many new, surprising\r\nways in which topology and algebra interact.  Historically, algebra\r\nhas always been used to give information about topology; but what is\r\namazing about recent developments is that they often use topology to\r\ngive information about algebra.  This project focuses on three\r\ninstances of this.  The main component of the research involves\r\nmotivic cohomology, which is a very exciting area that is growing\r\nquickly.  At its core, it involves the application of topological\r\ntechniques to the study of systems of polynomial equations.  The\r\nobjective of the project is to study the motivic cohomology of certain\r\nbasic objects which are well-understood from a topological viewpoint,\r\nand to investigate how the algebra and topology interact in these\r\nimportant examples.  The results should be very important for the\r\nfurther development of the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
