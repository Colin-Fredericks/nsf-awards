 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research program is to develop a novel ultrafast laser processing technique to fabricate high-quality and low-cost lightwave circuits and electro-optic devices in silica glasses. By taking advantage of multi-photon processes driven by femtosecond laser pulses, novel three-dimensional photonic devices will be fabricated in silica glasses with feature sizes below the diffraction limit. \r\nTechnical Merit: This project will first develop a novel laser processing technique using variable high repetition rate (> 250 kHz) ultrafast pulse trains. Using bulk heating to modify refractive indice in transparent materials, collateral damages induced by high peak laser intensities can be completely eliminated. The three-dimensional micro-manufacturing capability offered by the ultrafast laser will be exploited by on-chip chiral optical waveguide fabrication. Entire new classes of laser-written chiral waveguide devices will be developed in silica glasses to control the circular polarization of the guided waves. In conjunction with our material research to synthesize novel glass waveguides with large third-order optical nonlinearity, comprehensive ultrafast-laser poling studies will be carried out towards the fabrication of silica-based electro-optical devices. \r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed research work, if successful, will yield commercially viable, low-loss, photonic components for novel three-dimensional photonic architectures, which are not attainable by any other fabrication method. The unique combination of the novel glass material synthesis and ultrafast laser poling studies has the potential to produce low-cost silica waveguide electro-optical modulators for the fiber-optical communication industry. Teaming up with local industry, faculty members from mechanical engineering and material science, we will provide an interdisciplinary training program for our undergraduate students. Undergraduate students will work on integrated laser manufacturing and product innovation through senior design projects. The PI will also work with the University of Pittsburgh undergraduate Robotics Club to support undergraduates and K-12 students in their participation in extracurricular activities. Through undergraduate training and extracurricular activities, this program will encourage more undergraduate students to further their careers by attending graduate school in science, engineering,, and medicine. Through outreach activities, we will attract more female and under-represented minority high-school students to study engineering in colleges and universities\r\n\r\n",
