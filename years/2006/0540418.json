 "awd_abstract_narration": "KQED is requesting funds to produce weekly radio science news reports, a weekly television magazine program, a dynamic online website that supports and extends the broadcast  material and to create and maintain an active consortium of 13 participating STEM organizations.  The project's working title is \"Quest:  Exploring Our Natural World.\"  Quest's goals are to raise the profile of STEM issues that affect or occur throughout the Northern California region and activate citizens to discuss and investigate STEM issues.   STEM content will include research fields that include Physical Sciences, Life Sciences and Earth Sciences.  Most of the stories will include content about the technology and engineering used to support scientific endeavors.  The KQED Educational Network EdNet will administer the community and educational outreach initiatives, including creating viewer/listener guides, developing and delivering workshops, and providing information built around Quest media.  The project design involves innovative use of multiple platforms and collaborative partnerships with local informal educational institutions.  The project's collaborators include the Bay Institute, California Academy of Sciences, Chabot Space and Science Center, East Bay Regional Park District, Exploratorium, Girl Scouts, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Lawrence Hall of Science, Oakland Zoo and The Tech Museum of Innovation.  Rockman Et Al will conduct the evaluation of the Quest initiative.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
