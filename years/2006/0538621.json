 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most compelling and contemporary polar aeronomy directions is the investigation of dynamical coupling of the stratosphere and the upper regions of the atmosphere, such as the mesosphere. The South Pole wintertime mesospheric kinetic temperature measurements, preceding the springtime major stratospheric sudden warming of 2002, have clearly shown experimentally the presence of this dynamical coupling in the Southern Hemisphere - the wintertime mesospheric temperature measurements showed a strong correlation with the ozone hole area. These results indicate that the dynamical processes leading to the stratospheric warming were already in place during the austral winter and, that, this early mesospheric signal leads to the potential ability to estimate the springtime ozone hole area. Further observations on these phenomena are needed to understand better the underlying processes. These recent results indicate the intrinsic value of long-term mesospheric measurements at South Pole, as they do provide a window of knowledge into the dynamics of the atmosphere and their effects on Global Climate Change, as well as its societal implications. Austral polar cap neutral upper atmosphere measurements are also relevant in order to gain a basic understanding on the global-scale dynamics and thermodynamics of this atmospheric region. McMurdo Station is within the polar cap most of the day, making it the highest geomagnetic latitude station at Antarctica. Combined measurements from McMurdo and South Pole Stations are beginning to address the special problem of the existence of persistent and predictable thermospheric vertical neutral winds at high geomagnetic latitudes, first reported from South Pole. The existence of these vertical winds has profound effects on the energetics of this region of the atmosphere. These investigations, simultaneous with the observations of the international Antarctic Aeronomy Consortium colleagues, will enhance the present understanding of this polar atmospheric dynamics problem and its effect on global circulation. In addition to the scientific interest, there are broad social implications dependent on maintaining mesospheric/thermospheric aeronomy measurements through the first decade after maximum of the stratospheric ozone hole area. This research also contributes to the training and education of for both graduate and undergraduate students, including underrepresented groups.",
