 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to make progress on parts of the\r\nclassification of noncommutative projective surfaces.  This is an\r\nimportant problem, because many interesting new phenomena occur for\r\nsurfaces that are absent for curves; thus understanding the surface\r\ncase better will advance our understanding of noncommutative\r\ngeometry in general.  First, the PI plans to complete the\r\nclassification of birationally commutative surfaces---which are\r\nnoncommutative surfaces with a commutative function field of\r\ntranscendence degree 2---in terms of the process of naive\r\nnoncommutative blowing up.  Next, one wants to study noncommutative\r\nsurfaces containing a commutative curve of points---we will start by\r\nexamining a class of subalgebras of elliptic regular algebras of\r\ndimension 3, which may be related to M. Van den Bergh's different\r\nnotion of noncommutative blowing up. The PI plans to study fat point\r\nmodules, about which there are many foundational questions.\r\nFinally, one should study the generalization of naive blowing up to\r\nhigher dimensional noncommutative varieties.\r\n\r\nNoncommutative projective geometry is a relatively new subject,\r\nwhich attempts to use some of the same intuition and techniques\r\nunderlying commutative algebraic geometry, but in the noncommutative\r\nsetting.  Modern physics tells us the importance of considering\r\noperations that may not commute with each other, which means it\r\nmatters which order you perform them.  For example, one\r\ninterpretation of the celebrated Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is\r\nthat position and momentum do not commute.  There are many other\r\nconnections between noncommutative algebra and physics.  This\r\nproject hopes to gain a better abstract understanding of certain\r\nkinds of structures in algebra (noncommutative graded rings of low\r\ndimension) which include among them some famous examples, such as\r\nthe Sklyanin algebras, which are related to the study of the\r\nphysical world.\r\n",
