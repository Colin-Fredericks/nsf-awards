Rundensteiner <rundenst@cs.wpi.edu>\r\nWorcester Polytechnic Institute\r\n\r\nSGER: Research Experience for K12 (REK)\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to inspire young people to consider advanced\r\ndegrees and skilled professions in computer science.  The approach\r\ntaken towards outreach is unique.  One, students are targeted at an\r\nearly stage, namely, in K12.  Two, these K12 students are given the\r\nopportunity to first-hand engage in an active research project --\r\nworking side by side with scientists (REU students, graduate students,\r\nand faculty) in the computer science department at Worcester\r\nPolytechnic Institute.  The two-tier involvement of participants\r\nconsists of stage 1: smaller projects throughout the academic school\r\nyear, and and stage 2: in-depth projects during the subsequent summer.\r\nThis project takes place under the umbrella of on-going NSF-projects\r\nresearch projects in stream monitoring technology and its\r\napplications.  Stream monitoring is a novel paradigm for processing\r\nqueries over data streams (instead of in a static database only),\r\nsupporting applications such as sensor stream monitoring, fire spread\r\nprediction, and network intrusion detection.  The effectiveness of\r\nthis outreach project is assessed based on standard pre- and post-\r\nsurveys.  As broader impact, participants are recruited from the\r\n(highly diverse) public school system of the City of Worcester.  This\r\nexploratory project is to inspire the K12 participants to consider\r\nfuture careers in computer science, thus contributing to a much needed\r\nskilled workforce in this increasingly digital world.  It may also\r\nprovide new insights into models of how to inspire our youth to consider\r\ncareers in computer science, and possibly other sciences or engineering.\r\nThe project results will be disseminated via the project Web site:\r\n(http://davis.wpi.edu/~dsrg/PROJECTS/REK-NSF/).\r\n",
