 "awd_abstract_narration": "This scholarship project is recruiting and funding need-based scholarships for academically talented first-year students in Computer, Physical, and Biological Sciences, Engineering, and Mathematics with an eye toward broadening participation in STEM careers of underrepresented groups (women, minorities, and disabled individuals) and meeting the demand for an adequately prepared scientific and engineering workforce. Complementing the S-STEM funds are institution funds that are supporting upper-division scholarships for students who make appropriate academic progress. Selection of scholarship recipients relies on a combination of factors including financial need and a standard of excellence in course grades and ACT scores. Students are also asked to define academic and career goals and complete an interview with faculty and non-college S-STEM professionals. The project is establishing special cohort study groups to promote collaborative learning,  and weekly advisor and counseling sessions with S-STEM faculty,  in addition to engaging upper-division majors as mentors.  An external industry advisory board is evaluating, advising, and helping to promote the program.",
