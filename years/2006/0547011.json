 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use two complementary techniques to investigate chemical reactions in aerosols: Aerosol Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry (Aerosol CIMS) and Single-Particle Mass Spectrometry (SPMS).  A \"probe\" reaction between gas-phase ozone and unsaturated organics in various model particles will be studied to determine how different types of particles can influence reaction rates.  These model particles, consisting of organic, humic, soot and inorganic components, will be used to represent different types of aerosols found in the atmosphere.  The morphology of these particles will be studied using a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), to seek correlations between the physical features (e.g. fractal nature, porosity, etc.) and the reactivity of the particles.  The goals are to help reduce the complexity of ambient particles by elucidating how particle morphology and the underlying particle substrate influence reactivity.\r\n\r\nEducational and outreach activities will be developed in conjunction with teachers and staff at the Fernbank Science Center in Atlanta in order to help educate students of all ages about specific atmospheric chemistry and air quality issues.  The activities include the introduction of an Atmospheric Chemistry component into the curriculum of a science magnet program at the Fernbank Science Center in Atlanta, development of an Atmospheric Sciences exhibit at the Science Center on issues such as global warming or smog formation, and creation of Teacher Resource Kits designed as stand-alone resources for teachers, with each kit focusing on a particular topic related to atmospheric chemistry or air pollution.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSummary:\n\nThis work has aided our understanding of what factors control the reactivity of organic aerosol particles in the atmosphere.  In particular, it has highlighted the importance of knowing particle morphology in addition to composition and phase.  We have discovered that radical-initiated oxidation of organic aerosol does not appear to be a significant source of volatile products.  We have extended this work to compare the potential for such volatilization to a direct comparison of liquid and solid particles.  We have investigated radical-initiated oxidation in the presence of NOx and find a significant yield of organic nitrates which could alter the chemical and physical properties of the particles.  Our findings are helping to guide the community's understanding of how organic aerosols are oxidized and how this chemical evolution can influence their impact on climate.  Our measurements of rates of radical reactions in specific model aerosols have helped to underscore the importance of knowing these rates when using specific molecular markers as tracer compounds in aerosol source apportionment studies.  Additionally, education and outreach activities were carried out with cooperation of the Athens-Clarke County school system in which high-school students were engaged in detecting atmospheric ozone.\n\n \n\nSelected highlights:\n\n1.  Influence of O3 adsorption on OH uptake.\n\nWe have found that OH reactive uptake coefficients on organic aerosols vary by up to a factor of two with the concentration of the O3 precursor used to make OH radicals.  The implication of this work is that O3 adsorbs even to liquid particles thereby inhibiting OH reaction with the underlying particle.  Such an effect is not expected with the much smaller O3 concentrations found in the atmosphere, but it does explain the range of OH uptake coefficients measured by various laboratories and will help guide future laboratory uptake studies.\n\n2.  NO3 uptake to unsaturated fatty acid particles. \n\nWe have been studying the reactive uptake of NO3 to organic particles by measuring the rate of loss of the organic species.  No previous studies have studied NO3 uptake to particles, and only a few have measured NO3 loss to films on coated flowtubes.  Additionally, there is a substantial disagreement between those studies.  So far we have measured the NO3 uptake coefficient to unsaturated fatty acid particles and found that the rate of reaction is very efficient implying that NO3 reaction during the nighttime could be competitive with OH and O3 reaction during the daytime.  These measurements could also have implications for source apportionment of aerosols which uses certain molecular tracers as indicators of particle sources.\n\n3.  Development of \"virtual injector\" approach for measuring gas and particle kinetics.\n\nWe have also developed a novel method for measuring gas-phase and aerosol uptake kinetics using a flowtube.  In this approach, the gas flow is used to vary the reaction time continuously in analogy to a moveable injector flowtube.  The advantages of this approach are that kinetics are not studied by changing reactant concentration, data collection is fast (~ few minutes) and reactions of gas-phase and particle species can be studied simultaneously.  And, the rate of loss of individual particle species can be measured with implications for source apportionment studies.\n\n4.  NO3 + VOCs \n\nWe have studied the kinetics of NO3 with several series of unsaturated VOCs, including dienes, cycloalkenes, alkenols, alkenals and 1-alkenes.  For many of these species, there is poor agreement between published studies or very few studies in the literature.  The rate constants measured here will help to reduce the uncertainties on many of these.  Furthermore, these data will help in refining a recently-developed structure activity relationship for NO3 reactions with gas-phase organic species [Kerdouci, J. et al., ChemPhysChem, 11, 3909&ndash;3920 (2010)].\n\n5.
