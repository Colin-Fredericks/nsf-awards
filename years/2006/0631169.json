Recruitment efforts are leveraging the activities of an existing program geared toward recruitment and retention of American Indian students in engineering, which includes visits to all seven Montana reservation communities.  Also being utilized is the Providing Resources for Engineering Preparedness program which seeks to strengthen connections between Montana's tribal and community colleges.  Selected students will receive scholarships based on their financial need and their interest and dedication to STEM studies.  Students are participating in a bridge program prior to their first semester, helping them to begin feeling at home in the College and to connect as a cohort.  During the academic year, students are participating in study groups and monthly mentoring and networking events.",
