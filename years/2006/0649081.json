Employing a bottom-up methodology, model systems consisting of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-grafted silica nanospheres in PDMS solutions and melts will be used to regulate the interactions between the well-characterized nanoparticles. This regulation will be achieved by systematically controlling a variety of parameters such as the grafting density of PDMS on the particle surface and the chain length of the free polymer in the solution or melt. Detailed measurements will be made to connect the phase diagrams to the flow behaviors of the polymer-grafted nanoparticles and these behaviors will be contrasted against predictions from self-consistent mean-field models to compare experiment to theory. These results will be used to determine a rational basis for optimizing the end-use properties of advanced materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACT:\r\n\r\nThe PI will utilize the Research Experience for Undergraduates program to establish a pipeline of underrepresented students for engineering graduate study at the University of Virginia. By targeting these programs to specific geographic areas and populations, the PI hopes to increase the number of woman and minority PhDs in chemical engineering.",
