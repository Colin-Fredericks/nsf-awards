 "awd_abstract_narration": "Career: In-situ Monitoring of Opto-electro-mechanical Responses of Single Cells to External Stimuli using MEMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to investigate how individual biological cells react to mechanical (coupled normal and shear forces) and bio-chemical (pH level and epsilon toxin) stimuli. The approach is to monitor their mechanical, electrical and bio-chemical responses, in-situ, by combining fluorescence/confocal microscopy with novel micro-electro-mechanical testing devices. The simultaneously qualitative (direct visualization) and quantitative (real-time measurement of force, displacement and bio-impedance) data on the mechanical and chemical assays will enable research in two unexplored areas: (i) cellular structural and adhesion mechanics under more realistic, combined normal and shear loading and (ii) relationship between cell health and its electrical impedance.\r\nIntellectual merit: This proposal will provide fundamental understanding of multi-physics of cellular stimuli coupling and transduction. Relating cell health to its electrical impedance will result in automated and label-less electrical detection (electrical pathology) that may replace conventional manual labeling and microscopy-based schemes for faster diagnostics and drug discovery applications. \r\nBroader impacts: The proposed research will impact the society by integrating multi-disciplinary research with education at all levels while promoting diversity. The accompanying educational plan is to (a) provide research experience to undergraduates in collaboration with the Penn State Multicultural Engineering Program (b) bring electron microscopy in local elementary, middle and high-school students through an outreach program . Microscopy for K-12 and (c) conduct summer workshop for local school K-12 teachers. Schools throughout the nation will be benefited from the outreach website with the streaming videos of these outreach sessions and associated multi-media materials.\r\n",
