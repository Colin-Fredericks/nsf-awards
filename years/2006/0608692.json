 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental tests of theories of gravity are expected to play an increasingly important role in constraining possible extensions of our understanding of the fundamental nature of space, time and matter.  Over the past few decades a number of experiments have searched for violations of Newton's and Einstein's complementary formulations of gravitation.  Significant deviations from either have yet to be found in their respective realms of application, but the theoretical literature abounds with subtle effects that might be detected with more sensitive experiments.\r\nTo meet this challenge, specialized instrumentation has been designed and constructed to search with unprecedented sensitivity for some of these faint clues to new physics.  This project's approach exploits new techniques for the reduction of systematic measurement errors and improved measurement precision using cryogenic methods.  A new laboratory facility has been established to provide an ultra-low-vibration environment to make possible such sensitive measurements in an otherwise noisy world. A program of gravitation experiments using this new apparatus in this new lab is now ready to begin.  This research activity involves young scientists, post-docs, graduate and undergraduate students learning the art of precision measurements and developing careers in physical science.  The corporate partner Boeing Airplane Company, the laboratory facility host Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, the home institution the University of Washington, along with NSF, all join in an effort to extend educational outreach based on this research program as broadly as possible.\r\n",
