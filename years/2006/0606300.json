However, in exceptional\r\nsituations, exact relations exist that are\r\nmicrostructure-independent.  These express fundamental\r\ninvariances in a given physical setting.  Exact relations have\r\nbeen extensively studied, but the classical approach has been\r\nheavily dependent on the physical context.  In the late 1990's,\r\nan abstract theory of exact relations was originated by Grabovsky\r\nand greatly extended by Grabovsky, Milton, and the investigator. \r\nIt has proved to be enormously powerful.  Indeed, by reducing the\r\nsearch for exact relations to a purely algebraic problem\r\ninvolving group representation theory, it has led to complete\r\nlists of all rotationally invariant exact relations for\r\nthree-dimensional thermopiezoelectric composites, which include\r\nall exact relations for elasticity, thermoelasticity, and\r\npiezoelectricity as special cases.  This new approach has been\r\nresponsible for a great leap forward in this area of material\r\nscience.  However, the theory is by no means complete.  The\r\npurpose of this project is to complete the theory of exact\r\nrelations by addressing the three remaining major open questions. \r\nFirst, previous work has given complete lists of exact relations\r\nonly in relatively simple physical contexts.  The investigator\r\nstudies highly coupled problems with the ultimate goal of finding\r\nan explicit parameterization of exact relations for the physical\r\nproblem with any number of temperature, electric, and elastic\r\nfields.  The second project is the exploration of the\r\nrelationship between lamination and homogenization for exact\r\nrelations.  The basic question is whether there exist exact\r\nrelations that are stable under lamination, but not under\r\nhomogenization.  Third, the investigator undertakes a detailed\r\nstudy of the algebraic structures associated with exact\r\nrelations.  In particular, questions about exact relations may be\r\nreformulated in terms of algebraic objects called Jordan\r\nalgebras.  This approach seems very promising, and it is\r\nconsidered to be crucial for progress on the two problems\r\ndescribed previously.\r\n\r\n     Composite materials are everywhere in the modern world. \r\nThey are used in the manufacture of products ranging from skis to\r\nairplanes and from tennis rackets to cell phones.  It is\r\naccordingly of great technological importance to understand how\r\nphysical properties (such as conductivity and elasticity) of a\r\ncomposite are related to the properties of its constituents. \r\nThis is difficult in general because the way in which the\r\nconstituents are put together strongly influences the end result. \r\nFor example, take two materials, one soft and one hard.  If the\r\nhard material is embedded in the soft substance, the composite\r\nwill be compressible.  On the other hand, if the soft material\r\nlies in a matrix of the hard material, the composite will be\r\nrigid.  However, in certain situations, this typical variability\r\nis greatly reduced.  The goal of this project is to understand\r\nand classify these situations.  From a practical point of view,\r\nthe project establishes \"impossibility theorems\" in engineering,\r\ni.e. results showing that a composite with desired properties\r\ncannot be constructed from a given set of starting materials. \r\nThe proposal thus has significant implications for industrial\r\nresearch and development.\r\n",
