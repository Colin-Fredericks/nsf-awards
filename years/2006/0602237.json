 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning project establishes A Midwest Nanotechnology Education Program. The project creates a workforce system throughout the Midwest that builds upon the early successes with A.A.S. degree programs in nanoscale science and technology. The planning project is forming partnerships with several colleges throughout the Midwest who wish to replicate ongoing work in nanoscience technology education, capstone experiences, nano-classes for high school students, and nanotechnology workshops for faculty. The project is also formalizing the leadership structure, identifying industry niches throughout the region, identifying strategies to recruit students interested in science and technology with an emphasis on underrepresented students, identifying strategies for faculty development, and completing a DACUM analysis that will identify the skills and education needed for nano-science technicians. Additional planning identifies potential capstone resources and facilities, and identifies opportunities for remote access to laboratory experiences across the region. New nano-science programs impact the economic competitiveness and future job growth across many industries, including biotechnology, medical devices, agriculture, materials, and electronics.  The educational preparation of nanotechnologists addresses the needs of industry in this growing field of science.\r\n",
