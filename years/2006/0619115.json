 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of the project is to gain a fundamental understanding of a novel microfabrication and manufacture scheme for SiC-based, high-temperature MEMS pressure sensors. The approach consists of utilizing short-pulsed lasers to bulk micromachine 3C-SiC pressure sensor chips with an integrated piezoresistive strain gauge and temperature compensation.  In addition, prototype sensors will be built by integrating the sensor chips with novel high temperature contact, bond pad and packaging materials, and electrical interconnect technology suitable for direct use in the temperature range 600C to 800C and in the pressure range 20 psi to 1000 psi. Research will create unique pressure sensors by forming diaphragms with precisely controlled thickness over large areas; developing sensing elements and pads with high reproducibility; robust packaging; and high-volume production. \r\n\r\nThe success of this project will accelerate the understanding and applications of single crystalline 3C-SiC, an important semiconductor for both MEMS and microelectronic devices in hostile and harsh environments. The societal contributions of the project will include improved energy efficiency and green environment.  The industrial benefits are lower power consumption and cost in monitoring and controlling systems for utility power plants, industrial process controls, automotive power train control, energy exploration in oil and gas drilling, and fuel cells. The program will have impact in engineering education by promoting multidisciplinary teaching and research training of participants and enhancing the infrastructure at the university by contributing towards two world-class Iowa State University centers in micro-manufacturing. The program will engage the participation of women, and minority students and high-school teachers; improve mechanical, materials and electrical engineering curricula; and disseminate the research results to the scientific community through journals and conferences.",
