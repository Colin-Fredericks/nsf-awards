Current challenges in managing and trouble-shooting Internet-scale routing systems demonstrate that manageability cannot be an \"after-thought\" second to other design criteria.  This project addresses fundamental questions on building manageability into routing systems for future Internet architectures. \r\n\r\nThe approach taken in the project is two-fold: i) develop a framework for specifying, understanding, and evaluating what features should/could be \"designed-in\" into routing systems in support of manageability; and ii) evaluate design choices and trade-offs thereof in terms of performance and manageability.  The framework is based on experiences derived from case studies of existing routing systems and new network architectures.  It specifies core tenets for manageability of routing systems, and lays out a \"strawman\" for building manageable routing systems. This framework is then applied to designing and analyzing routing systems from a manageability standpoint.  \r\n\r\nA sound design process for managing routing systems is vital to future Internet development. A more manageable routing infrastructure will not only help lower the cost of network operations and management, but also reduce service disruptions that could adversely affect society at large. \r\n\r\nThe project will deliver results identifying key manageability features that must be incorporated into future routing architectures, and demonstrate their benefits through development and evaluation of actual systems.  Project outcomes will be disseminated through research publications, software prototypes and PIs' active participation in the community efforts towards development of GENI and future Internet architectures.\r\n\t\r\n",
