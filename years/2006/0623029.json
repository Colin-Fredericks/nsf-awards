 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are to investigate the properties of novel peptide\r\ndefense signals discovered in tomato and Arabidopsis plants that have important roles\r\nin amplifying the defense systems of the plants to strengthen the resistances against\r\npathogens and insect pests. Until the discovery of the defense peptide called systemin\r\nin tomato leaves in 1991 by Ryan and colleagues, no peptide signals were known to be\r\ncomponents of plant signaling. Over 20 peptide signals are now known that regulate\r\nboth defense and development. A novel, rapid, and simple assay has been developed\r\nin the Ryan laboratory that can identify new peptide signals in plant extracts. This\r\nassay has allowed the discovery of several new peptide signals for both plant defense\r\nand development including a peptide called AtPep1 that enhances the innate immune\r\nresponses of the plants against pathogens. The gene encoding the peptide is a\r\nmember of a gene family that is found in species throughout the plant kingdom.\r\nBiochemical, molecular, and genetic approaches will be carried out to understand the\r\nrole of peptide signals using tomato and Arabidopsis plants as model systems. The\r\nlocalization of the peptides and their precursor genes in plants will be studied, and how\r\nthe peptides are produced from precursor proteins and perceived by plant cells to\r\nactivate defensive genes in response to herbivores and/or pathogen attacks will be\r\ninvestigated. The peptides that enhance plant defense responses have provided new\r\ninsights toward an understanding of innate immunity in plants, which are the earliest\r\nresponses of plants in response to most attacking organisms. The knowledge gained\r\nwill contribute to the framework of the basic principles that govern peptide signaling in\r\nthe plant kingdom. Such information will contribute to an understanding of defense\r\npeptide signaling in both plants and animals, and will be especially useful in breeding\r\nand biotechnological approaches to enhance yields in major agricultural crops. A major\r\ncomponent of this grant is to train undergraduate and graduate students as well as\r\npostdoctoral fellows and visiting scientists in fundamentals research that can be applied\r\nto agriculture and human health.  The PI's successful ongoing efforts to bring women and minorities into my laboratory will continue through the tenure of this project.\r\n\r\n",
