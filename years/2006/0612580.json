Rodger Harvey\t\tProposal Number: 0612580\r\n\r\nThe focus of this work is on the carbon cycle whose linkage to climate variability is reflected in the balance of organic sources which arrive at sediments, and are ultimately preserved together with the isotopic signature and age structure of the sediment horizons. The work is based on the hypothesis that the western Arctic Ocean has undergone cyclical changes in primary productivity and delivery of terrestrial carbon over the Holocene, which are reflected in the organic carbon structure present and with their isotopic signatures preserved. Sample exchange and analysis with German colleagues will allow comparisons with the Eurasian Arctic for a pan-Arctic perspective of carbon age and preservation. The study will provide important information on the inputs and preservation of carbon over the Holocene Arctic Ocean, a central need for understanding the modern carbon cycle and forecasting the role of the Arctic sedimentary basin in carbon sequestration under variable climate scenarios. The focus will be on the western Arctic, which allows linkages to the hydrologic system through riverine input and takes advantage of recent collections of important Holocene sequences. Included are sample exchange and comparative measures through international collaborations to provide a pan-Arctic perspective on the transfer and preservation of carbon over the Arctic Basin. The researchers participating in this proposal will take part in undergraduate and graduate student training and education, which includes outreach activities for undergraduates and teachers. This project also includes a real-time, interactive teleducation program at a local university, as well as interdisciplinary training of doctoral students, and participation of undergraduates through summer intern programs. Public outreach will be accomplished via broadly disseminated (Web) and locally focused initiatives at the researchers' universities.\r\n",
