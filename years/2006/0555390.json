 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louisiana Tech Particle Physics Group (PPG) has a two part experimental nuclear physics research program with the main thrust being parity violating electron scattering studies and a companion educational Outreach Program designed to involve undergraduate students, science teachers, and high school students in forefront physics research projects.  The groups efforts at present are centered two parity violating electron asymmetry programs at Jefferson Lab, the G0 (E04-115) and Qweak (E05-008) experiments which represent parity violation measurements at relatively high and very low momentum transfers.  The group has its own approved experiment (E04-101) utilizing the G0 apparatus in the backward angle mode to measure the parity violating asymmetry in the channel.  These three programs will investigate ground state nucleon structure properties, investigate the dynamics of QCD symmetry breaking, and provide a precision test of the Standard Model.  The Louisiana Tech group is responsible for the CED-FPD electronics for G0 and the Region 1 GEM based tracking system for Qweak, both critical systems for the experiments.  The group will be responsible for the data taking and the analysis for transition measurement.\r\n\r\n\r\nLouisiana Tech is a rural university with not much opportunity for exposure to fundamental state-of-the-art basic research.  The funding thus far received from the NSF has allowed the group to develop a vigorous research program and exceptionally equipped laboratories.  With these facilities the group has been able to develop an education outreach program with a two part thrust.  The first part involves the undergraduate and the high school students in our labs in a capacity much like that of a graduate student.  They have responsibility for a project appropriate to their abilities which allows them to gain valuable knowledge of how to conduct research which is not taught in a classroom.  The other part is designed to involve high school teachers in our research projects allowing for them to get a better understanding of the sciences and mathematics which can then be translated into learning modules for them to take back to their classrooms.  Funding of this proposal will allow the Louisiana Tech group to continue to make major contributions to physics research, and enhance the educational opportunities for undergraduate students, local high school students and teachers, providing an excellent avenue for recruiting students into scientific disciplines.\r\n\r\n",
