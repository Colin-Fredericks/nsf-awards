Building\r\nupon this previous work in which the precession and nonlinear saturation of the r-mode\r\ninstability of neutron stars was examined, Dr. Wasserman and collaborators/students will\r\nundertake two major computational projects. The first is a numerical study of vortex lines\r\nand magnetic flux tubes in neutron star interiors. The work is motivated by the need to\r\nunderstand the precession of pulsar PSR B1828-11 and whether its slow period\r\ncontradicts a conventional neutron superfluid/proton Type II superconductor core model.\r\nCritical to this is the strength of drag forces between superfluid vortices and\r\nsuperconducting flux tubes, which will be addressed here (if the mutual drag force\r\nbetween superfluid vortices and superconducting flux tubes is too strong, long period\r\nprecession would not be possible). Second will be a study of how the nonlinear\r\ndevelopment and saturation of the r-mode instability affects the spin evolution of new\r\nand old accreting neutron stars. Recent work by Dr. Wasserman's group (supported by\r\nthe NSF previous award) has shown that the r-mode instability tends to saturate at lower\r\namplitudes than originally thought but the implications of this result on the subsequent\r\nspin evolution of neutron stars remains unexplored.\r\nThrough this work, graduate students at Cornell will be trained in advanced and\r\nmultidisciplinary (astrophysics, gravitational physics, condensed matter) theoretical\r\nresearch. Dr. Wasserman participates in the Harlow Shapley Lectureship program and\r\nwill continue to lecture regularly on forefront topics in astrophysics (including this\r\nproject) to diverse audiences, which include members of the public and high school\r\nstudents in addition to faculty and students at the host colleges.",
