 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division and the NSF EPSCoR Office, Professor Nesterov, of the Chemistry Department at Louisiana State University & Agricultural and Mechanical College, will explore a project designed to synthesize templated polymers that allow the study of 3-dimensional energy transfer and the development of new chemical sensing methods. The idea is to use rigid rod-like conjugated oligomers that have one end capped with a chromaphore, which contains necessary functionality for binding of an analyte. The success of these sensory materials is based on the fact that the exciton migration will be affected from polymer to the chromophore and vice versa upon binding of the analyte. The second goal of the proposal is to synthesize cross-linked three-dimensional conjugated polymeric networks with internal cavities that can be utilized for the sensing applications. The results of this research will enhance fundamental understanding of energy transfer and provide new ways to control and use this phenomenon. \r\n\r\nWith the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Nesterov will pursue research that brings together new methodology, theory, and applications, and create an interdisciplinary program that will attract students of all levels and backgrounds. Demonstrations of basic materials science applications for the public and outreach to elementary and middle schools are planned. These demonstrations are crucial for students in rural areas and students who are underrepresented in science to really feel that science is a viable career pathway.\r\n",
