 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mande Holford, University of Utah, is a Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellow for the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 academic years.  Holford plans to investigate the chemical toxins and molecular systematics of marine invertebrates- cone snails and turrids.  She will work with an international team of experts to identify new snails and their toxins.  The peptide-based toxins will be chemically tethered in proximity to an ion channel to explore the mechanism of function.  Holford will also collaborate with the Utah Museum of Natural History to develop educational programs and exhibition pieces on cone snail and turrid biodiversity and the chemical biology of their toxins.  \r\n\r\nThis Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry, the Office of International Science and Engineering, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows. This award is managed jointly with the International Research Fellowship Program.",
