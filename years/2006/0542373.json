Problem: The green lacewing family (Chrysopidae) is a geographically widespread, biologically fascinating, and economically important group of predaceous insects. Nevertheless, its classification is in a very poor state. It is difficult (often impossible) to identify species of green lacewings accurately; many are not described or named; as a result, potentially valuable evolutionary, ecological and applied research with the group is hindered.\r\n\r\n      B. Goals & Scope of Research: The project's goal is to revise the classification and provide a phylogenetic (evolutionary) analysis of the largest tribe of green lacewings (Leucochrysini, ~200 species). This tribe is native to the New World; it ranges from the United States through most of South America. And, its classification is in the poorest state of any group of chrysopids.\r\n\r\n   C. Methods: The proposed study will be the first to apply modern (cladistic) methods of classification to the green lacewings. It will create and analyze a large dataset that includes previously unused characters from larval and adult morphology as well as comparative biology. The outcome of the work will be (a) descriptions, illustrations, and keys for identifying species and (b) a classification of the tribe that reflects evolutionary relationships among the included species. It is anticipated that the project's methodology and analysis will provide a useful and efficient template for chrysopid systematists worldwide.\r\n\r\nII. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE & SOCIETAL BENEFITS\r\nThe project's evolutionary classification of the tribe Leucochrysini will enable the identification and investigation of a large proportion (>50%) of neotropical green lacewing species. Potential benefits from the classification fall into several categories:\r\n\r\n        A. Systematics & Evolution: First, the project will provide crucial new information for defining the evolutionary relationships among the diverse taxa in the poorly known insect family Chrysopidae. The information will also help elucidate how Chrysopidae is related to the other families in the order Neuroptera.\r\n\r\n        B. Biological Control & Applied Ecology: Green lacewings are among the most important predators that feed on insect pests of agricultural and horticultural crops. The project will enable the identification, study and use of neotropical lacewings as native biological control agents in pest management. Its comparative biological and evolutionary approach is especially important to biological control because it provides a predictive insight into the biological characteristics of species that are under consideration for use in specific agro-ecological situations.\r\n\r\n   C. Biodiversity & Conservation: Chrysopids have significant potential as quantifiable (third-trophic-level) bio-indicators in biodiversity assessments and in conservation projects. The project will supply systematic information that is essential to such applications.\r\n\r\n        D. Student Training. The project's synergistic collaboration with Latin American colleagues and students will stimulate and nurture additional studies on the systematics and diversity of neotropical insects. The PIs will encourage qualified students to pursue advanced taxonomic training at universities in the USA.\r\n\r\n",
