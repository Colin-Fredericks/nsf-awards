 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with problems from commutative\r\nalgebra and its interactions with computational algebra and\r\nalgebraic geometry. The focus of the proposal is on the theory of\r\nblowup algebras. These algebras appear naturally in many\r\nconstructions both in algebra and geometry. For example they arise\r\nin the process of resolution of singularities. An essential tool in\r\ntheir study is the concept of reduction of an ideal. Several key\r\ninvariants emerge in this context such as the reduction number,\r\nwhich among other things controls the Cohen-Macaulay property of\r\nblowup algebras. To study all reductions at once one considers the\r\ncore of an ideal, defined as the intersection of these reductions.\r\nThis object, related to coefficient, adjoint and multiplier ideals,\r\nplays a crucial role in Brian\\c{c}on-Skoda type theorems. A main\r\nthrust of this proposal is to give a combinatorial description of\r\nthe core of monomials ideals, to clarify the connection of the core\r\nwith the reduction number, the first coefficient ideal and the\r\nadjoint or multiplier ideal, to investigate the core in arbitrary\r\ncharacteristic and to establish formulas that were previously known\r\nonly in characteristic zero. In addition, the project also studies\r\nother areas such as integral closures of ideals. The concepts of\r\nintegral extensions and integral closures of rings and ideals are\r\ncentral to much of commutative algebra. One of the goals of the\r\nproject is to find a priori measures for the complexity of computing\r\nintegral closures.\r\n\r\nOften real life problems involve many unknown parameters that are\r\nrelated by equations which are impossible to solve exactly.\r\nNevertheless, using commutative algebra methods, much valuable\r\ndescriptive information can be gained about the potential sets of\r\nsolutions, if not the exact solutions themselves. Commutative\r\nalgebra has seen a great deal of activity and success over the past\r\ntwo decades with the solution of important conjectures, its\r\napplication to diverse fields such as computer science,\r\ncryptography, coding theory, robotics, pattern recognition and\r\ntheoretical physics, and the discovery of unexpected connections to\r\nother parts of mathematics, ranging from topology to combinatorics\r\nand from computer algebra to statistics.\r\n",
