The U.S. PI is Dr. Sheldon Tan, Assistant Professor in Electrical Engineering at UCR.  The counterpart investigator is Dr. Hong, Xianlong Professor and Director of Tsinghua University's Design Automation Lab in Beijing, China. \r\n\r\nThe IRES collaborative research projects to be conducted will focus on the efficient compact modeling and fast simulation of high-speed circuits taking into account manufacturing and operational variations in nanometer silicon systems.  With joint faculty oversight, U.S. and Chinese students will work in teams to co-develop new terminal and model order reduction techniques and statistical simulation and modeling methods for numerical modeling and statistical spectral analysis applied to power grid design. \r\n\r\nThe IRES educational and research activities provide unique training, mentoring and intellectual development opportunities for U.S. students.  Students, early in their careers, will benefit from exposure to internationally recognized leaders in this field which will make them more competent scientists and engineers in the future.  The discoveries from the joint research to be undertaken will also inform the development of curriculum and fill a gap in current textbook coverage of numerical modeling as a scholarly discipline.  \r\n",
