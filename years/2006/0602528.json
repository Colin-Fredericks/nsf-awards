 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this work is on chemical design and characterization of novel responsive nanostructured materials, namely ultrathin films made of mixed polymer brushes, with controlled and variable hydrophilic/hydrophobic/ steric/inonic interactions.  To accomplish the objectives of the project a US-German team of specialists possessing complementary expertise in the area has been assembled. The team includes: I. Luzinov (Clemson University, synthesis of (mixed) polymer brushes); S. Minko (Clarkson University, properties/applications of mixed polymer brushes); M. Stamm (Dresden Technical University and Leibniz-Institute for Polymer Research Dresden, protein adsorption onto the mixed polymer brushes); M. Mller (University of Gttingen, theoretical modeling of the mixed brushes); K. Hinrichs/N. Esser and K.-J. Eichhorn (Institute for Analytical Sciences in Berlin, study of the brushes with spectroscopic ellipsometry). Based on a creative combination of polymer physics, chemical synthesis, and self-assembly, the investigators propose a novel route for the fabrication of smart responsive materials with the ability to switch interactions and to adapt their interfacial chemical composition upon external signals such as pH, ionic strength, temperature, and electrical potential in aqueous environment.  The thin polymer films with smart properties will be especially designed from functional polymers with different chemical architecture and size.  This work will examine the critical question of how to tailor surface of synthetic materials which can (1) easily and effectively establish a desired level of interactions with colloidal/nano particles as well as biological systems (proteins and cells) in aqueous environment; (2) change the interaction over a broad range upon an external signal.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of this proposed research will have broad impact on materials science, since the composition and behavior of surfaces and interfaces plays a pivotal role in dictating the overall efficiency of most materials and devices.  Another priority of the proposed project is involvement of the brightest high-school, undergraduate and graduate students in modern surface science and nanotechnology research.  The project will result in the training of students in the area of surface modification and characterization of nanostructured materials.  Students also will greatly benefit from collaboration between US and German research institutions, as they will be actively involved in international research collaborations planned within the framework of the project. \r\n",
