 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is to support coordination activities, including meetings, a workshop, a website, and sharing of resources for a network of researchers studying all aspects of nitrification by microorganisms.  Nitrification is a bacterial process that involves the transformation of ammonia to nitrate. Along with nitrogen fixation and denitrification, nitrification is one of the major processes contributing to the global nitrogen cycle.  Ammonia is formed in soils and surface waters when organic matter is degraded and it is also produced industrially as a fertilizer for crops.  The bacteria that carry out nitrification extract energy for growth from ammonia and the byproducts of its degradation.  The nitrate that is formed can easily be leached into ground water, thereby making it unfit for human consumption.  By influencing the availability of nitrogen for plants, nitrification also influences the carbon cycle.  Global warming (through release of nitric and nitrous oxides), water quality, food and fiber production, wastewater treatment and bioremediation are all influenced by nitrification.  The genomics revolution is having a tremendous impact on the study of nitrification, while simultaneously creating a need for greater coordination of research efforts in this field.  Genome sequences are available for five nitrifiers and three more are in progress.  The goal of this Research Coordination Network is to coordinate the next generation of research in this important field.  Of paramount importance is linking the physiology, biochemistry and genomics of these bacteria to the processes that they carry out in the environment.  This linkage will provide the basis for controlling and exploiting these bacteria in various environments.  The work is of significance to crop production, wastewater treatment, bioremediation, and global warming.  The participating laboratories will provide active training opportunities for research scientists at all stages in their careers, and will incorporate members of underrepresented groups in science.  Materials will be developed to educate K-12 students and teachers about the global nitrogen cycle in general and about nitrification in particular.",
