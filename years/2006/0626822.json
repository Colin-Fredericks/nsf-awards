However, a basic problem is the vulnerability to attacks, whose effect can extend to a larger set of data unit, which will be exacerbated when data units are network coded. The objective of this project is to develop tools, infrastructure, and methodologies to support secure and resilient network coding and cooperative relaying for wireless sensor networks. In addition, based on the developed techniques, as an exemplar application, they design efficient group key re-distribution schemes with revocation capability that make use of secure and reliable network coding and cooperative relaying schemes. The outcomes from the proposed research will enhance the ability of securing network coding and cooperative relaying to increase the effective network throughput while not increasing hardware complexity and energy consumption. Thus, the research outlined in this project is critical to the success of network coding and cooperative relaying: It will further the current understanding of secure and resilient network coding and cooperative relaying and their applications to various problems and fundamental services in sensor networks, while, at the same time strengthening sensor network security education at various levels.\r\n",
