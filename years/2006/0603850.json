By comparison, local harmonic analysis uses only local\r\nanalysis on small balls. As an example of the impact of global\r\ngeometry, ergodicity of the geodesic flow implies the uniform\r\ndistribution of eigenfunctions in the unit cotangent bundle. A\r\nnew result in this direction is part of the proposal: ergodicity\r\nof the geodesic flow can be used to determine the asymptotics of\r\nthe complex nodal hypersurface of eigenfunctions.  In another\r\ndirection, sup norms of eigenfunctions are related to existence\r\nof focal points for the geodesic flow and to the first return map\r\non geodesic directions at the focal point (a joint project with\r\nC. Sogge and J. Toth). Asymptotic geometry aims to apply similar\r\nmethods to study problems in complex geometry, in particular to\r\nthe program of Yau, Tian, and Donaldson to study approximation of\r\nall hermitian metrics on a positive line bundle by Bergman\r\nmetrics. A joint project with J. Song is to use asymptotics of\r\nBergman kernels on toric varieties to study a problem of\r\nPhong-Sturm on how the geometry of the symmetric space of Bergman\r\nmetrics of height N approaches the Monge-Ampere geodesic geometry\r\nof the full infinite dimensional space of hermitian metrics. In\r\nanother direction, an ongoing joint project with B. Shiffman is\r\nto study statistical algebraic geometry of high degree varieties\r\nas the degree tends to infinity. This has applications in string\r\ntheory (joint work with M. Douglas).\r\n\r\nBoth topics involve the application of ideas and methods\r\nregarding the relation of classical and quantum mechanics to\r\ngeometry and analysis. In each area there is a small \"Planck's\r\nconstant\" which tends to zero. In the global analysis of\r\neigenfunctions, it is one over the eigenvalue; in geometry it is\r\nthe degree of a polynomial. As the \"Planck constant\" tends to\r\nzero, analytic objects (quantum mechanical) such as\r\neigenfunctions or Bergman kernels tend to geometric objects\r\n(classical mechanics), which are much easier to\r\nunderstand. Physicists, engineers and mathematicians have been\r\nstudying the relations between classical and quantum mechanics\r\nfor almost a hundred years now, but the relations are so\r\ndifficult that fundamental problems remain. To take a venerable\r\nexample, Chladnyi first demonstrated two hundred years ago that,\r\nif one puts sand on a vibrating drum, the sand will move to the\r\n\"nodal line\".  Despite the two hundred years, no one knows how\r\nnodal lines snake around on general drums. One project above is\r\nto determine the \"complex\" nodal line when billiards played on\r\nthe drum move in a chaotic way. Thus if one \"thickens\" the nodal\r\nline in complex directions, one can understand how it snakes\r\naround on chaotic drum heads.\r\n",
