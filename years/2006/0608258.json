 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of biological diversity has immense scientific and social \r\nvalue, especially today as biodiversity is under serious threat. This \r\ndissertation project deals with the investigation of a group of insects \r\nthat, with approximately 7,000 described species world-wide, is one of \r\nthe most species-rich families of true flies. Robber flies (Asilidae) \r\nare easily recognized and play an important role as insect predators. \r\nAlthough many scientific publications deal with these flies, \r\nevolutionary relationships of the species remain obscure. This study \r\nfocuses on species of the subfamily Leptogastrinae, currently known \r\nfrom 462 species. This group is distinct due to peculiar morphological \r\ncharacteristics associated with a narrow body that are most probably \r\nadaptations to a life among grasses. Many other robber-fly species \r\ninhabit prairies and grasslands as well, but lack such a distinctive \r\nsuite of similar morphological features. This project enhances the \r\nknowledge about robber flies by (1) presenting well-corroborated \r\nhypotheses of the evolutionary relationships of species of robber \r\nflies, (2) providing species descriptions and identification keys for \r\nspecies of the subfamily Leptogastrinae, and (3) analyzing the \r\ndistribution and species richness of species of Leptogastrinae with \r\nrespect to biodiversity hotspots sensu Conservation International. The \r\nfindings will allow a discussion of character evolution with respect to \r\nhabitat preferences of all robber flies, emphasizing grass-inhabiting \r\nspecies and comparing them to species of Leptogastrinae using both \r\nmorphological characters of the adult flies and DNA sequences. \r\nFieldwork is conducted in South east Asia in order to collect species \r\nof robber flies for the analyses, as this region hosts the least-known \r\nand sampled fauna. Two major natural history museums housing specimens \r\nof Asilidae from South east Asia - London, UK, and Amsterdam, The \r\nNetherlands - are visited to examine historical specimens of \r\noutstanding importance for identification of freshly collected \r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nAmong many target groups used for studies addressing the biodiversity \r\ncrisis, insects are always under represented. This dissertation project \r\nincorporates one of the most species-rich fly groups into analyses of \r\nbiological diversity. The dissemination of scientific knowledge to all \r\nparts of the world is of immense importance. The species descriptions \r\nand identification keys assembled in this project are being published \r\nin required printed format in scientific journals as well as on the \r\nworld wide web as integrative biodiversity databases, therefore making \r\nthis knowledge available for world-wide audiences including \r\nentomologists and conservation biologists. An undergraduate student is \r\ntrained in revisionary taxonomy during a summer internship under the \r\nNSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates program in order to \r\neducate a future scientist in methods of identifying, describing, and \r\nillustrating species and publishing the results. The extensive \r\nNSF-funded research project Assembling the Tree of Life - True Flies \r\nwill directly benefit from the proposed study of the evolutionary \r\nrelationships of Asilidae.\r\n",
