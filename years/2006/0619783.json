 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation award supports the acquisition and development of state-of-the art instrumentation for aerosol research. It will enable simultaneous characterization of the chemistry occurring in the gas and condensed phases as secondary aerosol forms and evolves in a laboratory setting. A benchtop instrument for gas chromatography - time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) will be purchased to provide rapid chemical analysis of hydrocarbons and oxygenated volatile organic compounds. A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer will be coupled to an ion chemical ionization front end (TSQ-SICIMS) for real-time analysis of short-lived, reactive compounds. A preparative capillary gas-liquid chromatography (PCGC) instrument will be used to isolate larger quantities of volatile organic compounds for subsequent analysis with a broad array of instruments. Finally, an aerosol trap / concentrator will be developed for use as a front end to the mass spectrometers for rapid analysis of the chemical composition of aerosol.\r\n\r\nStudies using these new instruments will provide improved constraints on the mechanisms responsible for production of organic aerosol in Earth's atmosphere. This instrumentation, in combination with the aerosol instrumentation currently available on the Caltech environmental chamber, will enable significant progress in addressing questions such as: \r\n-  How important is the formation of low volatility oxidation products in the gas phase to the budget of organic aerosol and how does this chemistry influence the physical properties and environmental effects of atmospheric aerosols?\r\n- How important are aerosol-phase reactions relative to gas-phase oxidation followed by gas-to-particle uptake for determining the chemical composition of the aerosol?\r\n- What are the molecular mechanisms and kinetics of the processes involved in aerosol production?\r\n- What are the most important chemicals leading to aerosol formation (organic acids, oligomers/polymers, etc.) and what are their physicochemical properties (functional groups, molecular mass, stability, volatility, solubility, hygroscopicity, optical absorption, etc.)?\r\n- How do the gas phase and the aerosol composition evolve in the presence of atmospheric oxidants?\r\n\r\nAccurate characterization of the chemistry leading to the formation of aerosol in Earth's atmosphere is essential for understanding the interactions of the biosphere and climate as well as for designing appropriate air quality improvement strategies. This aerosol plays a major role in the environment through its deleterious influence on human and animal health and through its impact on visibility in both urban and regional areas. The chemical and physical nature of atmospheric aerosol also determines its light scattering and absorption properties that, in part, control the Earth's radiation field and climate. Finally, the hygroscopicity of the aerosol plays an important role in controlling how efficient an aerosol particle will be for formation of cloud droplets. The instrumentation acquired through this award will provide substantially improved understanding of the nature of the organic chemistry that controls the chemical makeup of atmospheric organic aerosol. The new instrumentation will enhance new and interdisciplinary collaborations of graduate and undergraduate chemists, geochemists, and physicists and their faculty mentors.",
