 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nThe Pacific region has a rich treasury of people from diverse backgrounds who are\r\nunfortunately underrepresented in the sciences, but who have great potential to contribute\r\nto society in STEM areas if the barriers and obstacles that exist are ameliorated and\r\nappropriate opportunities are provided to encourage students success. Special barriers\r\ninclude isolation, often inadequate resources for secondary level science education,\r\ninsufficient ability for remediation of science and mathematics skills in colleges, and a\r\nresulting \"leaky pipeline\" of students from underrepresented groups who graduate in the\r\nSTEM disciplines. We propose establishment of an Islands of Opportunity Alliance\r\nwithin the Louis Stokes-Alliances for Minority Participation Program of NSF to help\r\nstaunch the leaks in the pipeline through fulfilling four specific objectives.\r\nOur first objective is to set up Alliance activities that will improve recruitment of\r\nunderrepresented students into STEM majors at Alliance schools through the\r\nestablishment of bridge programs, improved articulation agreements for science courses\r\namong Alliance campuses, and creation of targeted recruitment activities. Our second\r\nobjective is to provide research and/or internship experiences for these undergraduate\r\nstudents in STEM fields. Our third objective is to improve retention of underrepresented\r\nstudents through graduation with a baccalaureate degree in STEM fields through\r\nimproved advising, mentorship programs, peer tutoring, academic skills workshops,\r\nestablishment of an annual Alliance conference for students and faculty, and creation of\r\ncommunication outlets for Alliance members, including a newsletter and web site. Our\r\nfourth objective is to improve instruction in STEM fields through faculty development\r\nincluding cultural awareness workshops, summer research opportunities, bown bag\r\nseminars and new faculty orientation workshops.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe Islands of Opportunity Alliance builds upon the successes of past and current LSAMP\r\nPrograms throughout the country, utilizing practices that have been shown to best\r\naccomplish the primary goal of increasing graduation rates of underrepresented students\r\nin STEM fields. The Alliance has adapted these best practices to the unique cultural and\r\ngeographic setting of the Pacific region, utilizing the extensive scholarship on crosscultural\r\ncommunication and on learning styles of islander peoples, and administrative\r\nstructures that have succeeded in spanning the vast distances between islands.\r\nBroader Impact\r\nHawaii and the Pacific region in general spans a large proportion of the globe, having\r\ngreat strategic, economic, and cultural significance for the nation. The people of the\r\nPacific are an important resource for the U.S. who can provide greater contributions to\r\neconomic, intellectual and scientific growth at local and national levels. The Pacific\r\npeoples have used native scientific principles to navigate over thousands of miles of\r\nocean in what may be considered one of the wonders of human achievement. They have\r\nmuch more to offer the world in the coming century.",

In its short history it has begun to make an impact on both the students and the economy of Hawaii and the Pacific region.  The IOA learned from its senior brethren among the highly successful Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation, adapting lessons learned and best practices pioneered by these senior alliances.  Many of those practices are geared toward the long term goals of increasing recruitment and retention of students in STEM fields, and increasing the diversity of the STEM workforce.\n\nOne of the greatest STEM resources of the region is the indigenous peoples and cultures of the islands.  Polynesian and Micronesian navigators carried out one of the greatest achievements in human history: performing unparalleled feats of navigation across vast spans of ocean in small canoes, through use of sophisticated understanding of astronomy, ocean currents, wind, and weather.  Islanders also devised complex methods of agricultural and aquacultural intensification, and erected large scale, monumental architectural structures for both religious and practical purposes. The IOA integrates indigenous science into studies of STEM fields, providing a new generation of Pacific Islander scientists and engineers with both cultural and scientific continuity in their pursuit of new knowledge.\n\nThe overarching goal of this Alliance is to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) students graduating with baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields from Alliance institutions.\n\nThe IOA achieved success in reaching its objectives.  The first objective of creating or expanding partnership activities in the Alliance to recruit community college students into four-year college STEM programs was met through the establishment of the Alliance, which consists of five baccalaureate institutions and thirteen community colleges.  The 18 member IOA covers a geographic area greater than that of the continental United States, stretching from Palau in the west to Hilo in the east, from Honolulu in the north to American Samoa in the south.  Community college students were provided with summer bridge programs, relevant and rigorous research experiences, tutoring, and other academic support.  The annual student conference enabled connections between community college students and both faculty and staff at the universities.\n\nThe IOA\u00c6s second objective of providing research experiences for its students was met by institutions in the Alliance providing research experiences, or sending their students to other institutions in the IOA or to other summer research programs.  The annual IOA student conference allowed students throughout the IOA to present the results of their research to fellow students, and to share in the excitement of actually carrying out STEM research.  The IOA leveraged ongoing research and training projects at the partner institutions to provide students with internships and research assistantships. \n\nThe Alliance\u00c6s third objective of creating scholarly learning communities to help retain STEM students was met by providing workrooms and other spaces for LSAMP supported students to study in groups, engage in peer tutoring, and receive other support services.  The institutions provided various means of forming learning communities, from offering informal pizza parties to more focused science-based excursions. Such activities allowed students to form supportive peer groups with others who seek STEM careers. \n\nTo meet the IOA\u00c6s fourth objective of improving instruction in STEM courses, several institutions in the Alliance provided faculty with professional development to improve teaching methods and/or enhance sensitivity to culturally-based diversity in student learning styles.  Great emphasis was placed on improving instruction in the crucial gateway STEM courses. At..."
