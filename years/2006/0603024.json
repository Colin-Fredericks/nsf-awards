 "awd_abstract_narration": "This staff development project in automotive hybrid vehicle technology ensures that automotive technicians have the skills and knowledge required for the rapidly expanding hybrid technology automotive industry. Community college faculty in Midwest states participate in a weeklong summer institute learning about cutting edge advanced hybrid vehicle technology and nickel hydride batteries from leaders in the industry. These leaders are professionals employed by Toyota Motors Corporation, American Honda Motor Company, Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation. Participating faculty use the concepts and new knowledge in their classrooms to enhance classroom and laboratory components. The project has extensive academic year follow-up activities. The workshops include advanced discovery and understanding, creative and original concepts, extensive resources, participation of underserved populations, and dissemination of technological understanding.",
