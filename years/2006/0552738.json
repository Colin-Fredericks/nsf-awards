Dillard\r\n\r\n\r\nThis REU award for a Site on materials and processes for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells supports 12 engineering and science students each year for three years in a 12-week research experience at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.  The primary goal of this REU site is to nurture a diverse group of talented undergraduate students to develop an appreciation for research and scholarship, a broader base of knowledge, a better understanding of the research process, and a desire to contribute to advances in science and engineering through graduate research and professional careers.\r\n\r\nStudents will be involved in research projects related to new fuel cell materials development; new methods for materials processing that yield high performance fuel cell assemblies; new techniques and theories for materials characterization; and new approaches for performance modeling that reveal the impact of materials and design on system performance.  This program will build on Virginia Techs existing strengths in each of these research focus areas and their long history of successful REU programs which have engaged a large and diverse student population. The study of materials and processes for PEM fuel cells will offer an exceptional vehicle for introducing students to independent research, while exposing them to an important and rapidly developing technical field.  \r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n",
