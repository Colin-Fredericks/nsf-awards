 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Americas Program award will support the participation of a group of fifteen U.S. researchers in a four-day international workshop on optimization and applications that will be held in Oaxaca, Mexico, January 2007.  The workshop, organized by Dr. Jorge Nocedal of Northwestern University and Dr. Katya Scheinberg from the IBM Watson Research Center, together with Drs. Jose Luis Morales and Zeferino Parada of the Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico, in Mexico City, Mexico, will include junior and senior scientists and researchers, as well as advanced US graduate students.\r\n\r\nOptimization is a field with impact on many different areas, such as numerical analysis, algorithms, software design, financial engineering, image processing, and wireless communications. This workshop will focus on non-linear optimization and on applications, and should produce new insights on problems that do not satisfy constraint qualifications, that involve uncertainty, and that are of very large dimension. The meeting offers an excellent opportunity for junior and senior scientists from the US and Mexico to explore potential areas of application, future research visits, student exchanges, and joint collaborations. \r\n",
