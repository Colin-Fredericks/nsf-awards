 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes problems in several areas of probability,\r\ninvolving stochastic geometry, Markov chains, and stochastic games.\r\nDeterminantal point processes arise naturally in several settings,\r\nincluding eigenvalues of random matrices.  One goal of the proposal is\r\nto develop robust methods to recognize determinantal processes that do\r\nnot require calculating correlation functions of all orders.  Two\r\nmethods of allocating equal volumes to the points of a point process,\r\none based on the Gale-Shapley stable matching algorithm, the other on\r\ngravitational potentials, will be compared. In the area of Markov\r\nchain mixing, the ``cutoff phenomenon'' where distance to stationarity\r\ndecreases rapidly from near 1 to near zero is believed to hold in most\r\nnatural chains but is established for very few.  A robust and easily\r\ncheckable possible criterion for cutoff will be investigated.\r\nRecently, the classical connection between random walks and harmonic\r\nfunctions has been extended to nonlinear potential theory using ideas\r\nfrom game theory and optimal control. A major aim of the proposal is to\r\ndevelop and study stochastic games whose value functions, in the\r\nscaling limit, solve other important PDE.\r\n\r\nRandom scatters (Point processes) that exhibit clumping have effective\r\nmodels in statistics, but random scatters that exhibit repulsion are\r\nless well understood.  The proposed project aims to develop a better\r\nunderstanding of such processes which should enable wider use for them\r\nin statistical modeling. Given a random scatter, different algorithms\r\nfor allocating equal areas to the points of the scatter will be\r\ninvestigated.  Markov chains are a widely used tool in simulation and\r\nrandomized algorithms.  Basic features of convergence to equilibrium\r\nin these chains will be studied. These should have an impact on the\r\nanalysis of algorithms. The project has a substantial educational\r\ncomponent, in mentoring of graduate students and preparation of\r\neducational materials at the undergraduate level on Markov chains and\r\ngame theory.\r\n",
