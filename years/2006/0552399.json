 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe focus of this project is to expand the functional capabilities of ordered, nanoporous polymers based on polymerizable lyotropic (i.e., amphiphilic) liquid crystals (LLCs).  Prior work in our group has shown that LLC networks containing ordered, cylindrical nanochannels (the HII phase) can be used as catalytic organic analogs to molecular sieves, and as molecular size-selective filtration media.  Two new research directions will be explored for extending the functional capabilities of these LLC networks, and for increasing our understanding of how to design such materials. The first new direction is focused on exploring whether structurally more diverse headgroups with capabilities other than catalytic activity can be incorporated into these polymeric materials.  Specifically, the design of LLC networks containing moieties in the nanopores that can reversibly change their pore dimensions, structure, or chemical character in response to specific stimuli, will be explored (i.e., responsive gated transport). The ability to actively and selectively control the transport properties of LLC resins would greatly add to the molecular size-exclusion and catalytic capabilities already demonstrated in these nanoporous polymers. The second new direction is focused on the design of new functional LLC networks with more sophisticated pore architectures, which will allow better performance in areas related to transport and access. Specifically, the design of cross-linked bicontinuous cubic (Q) LLC assemblies containing three-dimensional interconnected nanopores, will be investigated.  The goal of this work is the design of more accessible nanoporous polymer materials that can incorporate the same level of functional capabilities as our initial HII systems.  Collectively, this project will provide new insights into how to design new functional groups/capabilities into cross-linked LLC assemblies, and generate new nanoporous polymers with unprecedented combinations of functional properties. This research will also serve as a platform for training students in polymer chemistry and applied nanoscience.\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nMethods for incorporating new functional capabilities into surfactant liquid crystal (LC) polymers that have uniform pores in the 1 to 2 nanometer range, will be explored.  Such materials have previously been shown to be useful as enhanced solid-state catalysts, and as new filtration materials that can separate molecules based on their size. In this project, the design of nanoporous polymers that can reversibly change their pore size, structure, or chemical character in response to specific stimuli will be explored.  The ability to actively gate the molecular transport properties of these materials would greatly increase their utility.  In addition, the design of new LC polymers with more sophisticated nanopore structures will be explored, as a means of improving transport and internal access properties.  Collectively, this research may lead to new functional porous polymers that can be applied to a number of beneficial applications, such as highly selective, adaptive membranes for environmental and personal chemical protection applications; superior high-throughput polymer-supported catalysts for process chemistry; etc.  This research project will also serve as a platform for cross-training students in polymer chemistry and the emerging area of applied nanoscience.\r\n",
