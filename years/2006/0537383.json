In order to protect and manage this resource, hydrogeologists have to understand the fundamental fluid flow and associated heat and mass transfer processes within karstic aquifers.  Currently, there is a lack of understanding of these fundamental processes.  Therefore, the goal of the project is to build a community of scientists who will test the foundations of karst hydrology through collective thinking and thoughtful use of first-stage numerical models.  These first-stage models are the C-Q models (phase-plane plots), a single-reservoir linear-systems model, and a pipe-flow model that incorporates calcite dissolution.  By thoughtful use of these first-stage models, the community will be able to establish the processes govern fluid flow and associated mass and heat transfer in karstic aquifers.  This framework will be used in subsequent proposal development.  The approach will be to use a graduate-level karst hydrology course as a community of scientists.\r\n \r\nManagement to sustain the availability of water in suitable amounts and quality in karst aquifers requires better models to predict flow and transport.  This project will continue development of this goal, while providing training opportunities for future science teachers.  The community of graduate students will work together to resolve the fundamental fluid flow problems in karstic aquifers.  The involvement of graduate students in field work, modeling, and analysis in karst hydrology will provide important training.  These educational activities will teach graduate students through the exercise of model implementation and that the experience of trying and testing modeling options would lay important groundwork for future research by the entire karst community.\r\n",
