The computing infrastructure will be based on a campus-wide computational and data Grid, an ongoing effort begun in 2004. They will continue development of general-purpose middleware support for secure transfer of sensitive data over computing infrastructure. The educational programs associated with the Health-Grid Initiatives include the development of new and re-development of current courses to incorporate inventions coming out of the research, a new cross-disciplinary e-Health minor, as well as new degree tasks emphasizing the application of information technology to different disciplines of life science. In addition, an annual scientific meeting, the international BioGrid Workshop, will be held in conjunction with the research and education enterprise.\r\n\r\n",
