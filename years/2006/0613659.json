 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program of experiments focuses on the observation and control of novel states of matter and phase transitions in ultracold charge samples. Created by photo-ionizing laser cooled atoms, this type of system has recently been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical activity. An innovative apparatus enables new studies on a rich array of behavior in both free and confined ultracold charge samples, making connections to atomic, plasma, and condensed matter physics. Initial measurements will elucidate the early, up to 100 nanoseconds, free plasma dynamics, a regime in which many theoretical predictions have been made, so far without experimental confirmation. The early behavior is expected to include the release of correlation energy, collisional atomic recombination, and associated plasma heating. Later work will focus on applying a magnetic field and standing optical electric field to restrict effective electron mobility in the sample.  This project has been propelled by the intense involvement of six Rowan undergraduates, who have received training in many aspects of experiment and theory. Due to the novel interdisciplinary nature of this project, students continue to make meaningful connections between atomic, plasma, and condensed matter physics. They will be encouraged to accompany the PI to conferences in these subfields, and will also participate in writing reports for publication.",
