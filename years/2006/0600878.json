 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0600878\r\nRobert L. Benedetto\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project concerns several problems from the relatively new field\r\nof number theoretic dynamics.  One central question, formalized in the\r\nUniform Boundedness Conjecture of Morton and Silverman, asks about the\r\nnumber of preperiodic points of a given dynamical system that happen\r\nto be rational numbers.  While simple to pose, the question quickly\r\nleads to deep and subtle arithmetic problems.  Over the past decade or\r\nso, there has been great progress on such questions, and a substantial\r\namount of technical machinery, some due to the investigator, has been\r\ndeveloped to help answer them.  In particular, several recent advances\r\nin dynamics over local fields, in the capacity theory of filled Julia\r\nsets, and in the study of so-called local canonical heights and\r\ndynamical Green's functions, have opened new avenues for considering\r\nquestions of arithmetic dynamics.  The resulting theory has parallels\r\nboth to the analytic study of complex dynamics and to the arithmetic\r\nstudy of rational points on elliptic curves and other algebraic\r\nvarieties; indeed, it has drawn interest from specialists in both\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the goal of the project is to study a type of classical\r\nDiophantine problem: the computation of the set of rational number\r\nsolutions to a naturally arising set of polynomial equations.  Such\r\nproblems, together with the study of primes, have driven the study of\r\nnumber theory from Diophantus and the ancient Greeks through Fermat\r\nand into the present day.  Besides the intrinsic beauty of such\r\nproblems, they have since found applications in coding theory and\r\ncryptography.  In addition, certain aspects arithmetic dynamics are\r\naccessible to undergraduates; the project includes REU summer research\r\nprojects for undergraduates to aid in their mathematical training.\r\nIntense computer computations, especially of canonical heights and\r\npreperiodic points, are also planned, with any relevant data generated\r\nto be published or posted on a website, for the benefit of the larger\r\nresearch community.\r\n",
