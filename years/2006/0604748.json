 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0604748\r\nTian-Jun Li\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes  to develop new techniques and apply existing methods in gauge theory,  pseudo-holomorphic curve theory\r\n  and equivariant stable homotopy theory to gain some fundamental understanding of the general\r\nshape of closed symplectic manifolds. Four avenues of investigation\r\nare addressed. 1) The PI, joint with M. Furuta, is developing a\r\ncomprehensive treatment of a refined invariant associated with a\r\nproper non-linear Fredholm map, which involves a twisted\r\nPontrjagin-Thom construction. 2) Such a construction applied to the\r\nSeiberg-Witten map turns out to be particular useful in the\r\nclassification of symplectic 4--manifolds with torsion symplectic\r\ncanonical classes. The PI has made progress bounding their Betti\r\nnumbers and is hoping to fully determine their homoeomorphism types. 3)\r\nThe PI searches for a simple characterization of the symplectic cone\r\nof a K\\\"ahler surface. The case of geometric genus 0 has been completely  settled by the PI and A. Liu. Joint with M. Usher, promising progress in the case of positive geometric genus has been made, and more is expected by exploring the\r\nsomewhat surprising interplay between symplectic forms and embedded\r\nsymplectic surfaces with negative self-intersections. 4) Joint\r\nmainly with Y. Ruan, the PI is  investigating the properties of\r\nuniruled symplectic manifolds in  dimension 6 and above, using\r\nrelative invariants, their gluing formula, and localization techniques. We also search for the criterion such that symplectic\r\nblow-downs can be performed in dimension 6.\r\nThis project belongs to the relatively new and increasingly important \r\nsubject the PI has pursued a successful line of research. The proposed\r\nactivity raises several fundamental questions in this field and lays\r\nout plans to answer them. It also creates original concepts in this\r\nfield and  reveals  connections with other fields.\r\n  This proposed activity will advance knowledge\r\nin symplectic topology as well as other areas including differential\r\ntopology, mathematical physics and algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn n manifold is a space that locally looks like the Euclidean space of dimension n. For example, the space-time universe we live in is a 4--manifold. A symplectic structure is a very basic structure that underlies almost all the equations of classical and quantum physics. A manifold equipped with a symplectic structure is called a symplectic\r\nmanifold. Studies of  symplectic manifolds, such as proposed here,\r\nwill thus enhance our understandings of mathematics, physics, and\r\nscience in general.\r\n",
