The proposed device is integrated in a microfluidic system to achieve high-throughput multi-analyte detection in flow-through microsphere-based fluoroimmunoassay with simple optics and with less computational requirements. The approach is based on the new polymer-silicon hybrid microelectromechanical systems technology. It allows imprinting of nanoscale features on the surface of the three-dimensional polymer microstructure. The spectrum acquisition speed of the system is expected to exceed 100 nm/ms and to allow real-time spectroscopy in a microfluidic system. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit:The innovative nano photonic technology developed in this research will guide future advancements of wavelength-discriminating detection for the identification and quantification of multiple chemical and biological species. Integrated with microfluidic cell culture and immunoassay systems, the device leads to development of a non-existing scientific instrument that permits in-situ monitoring of time variations of cellular parameters in a microfluidic channel. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:The developed microfluidic fluoroimmunoassay system may find new commercial markets because of its cost-effectiveness and utility in life sciences research and development.  The proposed project will promote an excellent opportunity to train a new generation of engineers and scientists who will cross the boundaries of traditional research fields and create new avenues of research.\r\n",
