The superconducting rock magnetocmeter (SRM) to be acquired is a new design that utilizes a pulse tube cryocooler technology and does not require liquid Helium for the attainment of cyrogenic temperatures.  The small sample access bore (6 mm) is much smaller than that of existing systems, including the existing superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) at Rochester.   The new SRM is expected to have a factor of five greater sensitivity.  The new SRM will support research on the Earth's earliest magnetic field as recorded in single crystals of refractory silicate minerals that have possibly escaped metamorphic resetting of their magnetic signatures acquired during original crystallization.  Studies of the relationships between geomagnetic field reversal frequency and field strength, morphology, and secular variation will be facilitated.  Research facilitated by the new SRM would be of interest to a broad range of scientists interested in the development of the early Earth and inner core, and those involved in numerical and experimental simulations of planetary dynamos. The work will also contribute to scientific infrastructure, and paleomagnetic techniques. The new small bore SRM will be open to national and international external visitors and will play a central role in education at the University of Rochester. \r\n\r\n***\r\n",
