 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Acquisition Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Portland will acquire a Fourier Transform Infrared/ Fourier Transform Raman Spectrometer (FT-IR/FT-Raman).  The instrument will be used to investigate interactions between solutes and solvents in supercritical fluids.  One system to be studied will be Rhodamine B dissolved in the co-solvent system of acetonitrile and supercritical carbon dioxide.  Study of other solvent systems and dyes is planned.\r\n\r\nInfrared and Raman spectroscopy measure the vibrational frequencies of molecules.  These frequencies are characteristic of the atoms and how they are connected in a molecule.  This analytical tool is a sensitive probe of the structure of the molecules and how the surrounding environment influences them.  This can help to better understand how to more efficiently extract dissolved substances, process fuels and chemicals, and improve manufacturing processes using chemicals.  The instrument will enhance teaching and research of undergraduates at the University of Portland.  \r\n",
