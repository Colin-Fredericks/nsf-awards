 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports travel to the International WYP 2005 Physics Young Ambassador Symposium in Taipei from December 31, 2005 to January 4, 2006. As part of the World Year of Physics 2005 (WYP 2005), thousands of pre-college students in at least 20 countries on five continents participated in the Physics Talent Search. The major goal of the Talent Search is to create enthusiasm, interest, and participation in physics among young people (and their families). Students between the ages of 10 and 18 engaged in numerous activities involving physics, its applications, or its societal interface. Most of the activities emphasize student creativity, curiosity, and initiative. In most countries, a large cadre of volunteer physicists interacted with the students, providing encouragement and evaluating their efforts In each country in each age group, the top girl(s) and boy(s) (in equal numbers) are being selected as \"International WYP2005 Physics Young Ambassadors.\" Each country participating in the Physics Talent Search has been invited to identify and send six Young Ambassadors (three girls and three boys) and one adult leader to participate in this international science conference. The Symposium's timing symbolically \"rings out\" WYP 2005 and its celebration of a century of physics. Nobel Laureates and other leading scientists with diverse national, racial, and gender demographics are being invited to participate as speakers, inspirational mentors, and role models for the students. Broad dissemination is planned beyond the physics and education communities. This award is funded by the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences' Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and Divisions of Physics and Materials Research and by the Office of International Science and Engineering.",
