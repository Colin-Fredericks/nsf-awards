 "awd_abstract_narration": "Women of color in STEM are rarely independent subjects of study. As a result, there is relatively little known about how they become interested in science, their systems of support or factors that could make careers in science more attractive to them. This project would synthesize existing research, evaluation and narrative literature concerning factors that facilitate or impede the entry of under-represented minority women into STEM professions.  The work would separate effects at the college level, the graduate level, and the professional level.  The project will help to illuminate factors that influence initial career choices and subsequent decisions over the course of professional life. The literature is fragmented and currently exists in multiple formats. The meta-analysis and synthesis of knowledge will enhance our understanding of the challenges that women of color encounter in pursuing scientific careers, the strategies they employ to overcome them and the contextual and organizational factors that support their professional development. The results will indicate what is known, what initial findings need to be replicated, and what research gaps need to be identified. The study will stimulate further studies by building a research agenda for scholars and graduate students.  \r\n\r\n",
