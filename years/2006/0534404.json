It is based on Hilda, a new high-level language that addresses some significant shortcomings of current Web application technologies. Hilda provides a uniform data model for the presentation, application and data layers; clear separation of application and presentation logic; support for structured programming driven by the logical structure of the application; and support for application-level conflict resolution.\r\n\r\nThe project produces a Hilda compiler with advanced optimizations, client-server code partitioning, and data caching.  It also provides tools to support application integration, testing and schema migration. Using these tools, the project develops several reference Hilda applications including CMS, a new course-management system that will replace a similar conventionally-built system currently being used by several thousand students.\r\n\r\nAmong the broader impacts of this project will be open-source release of the optimizing Hilda compiler and tools, together with a number of substantial applications implemented in Hilda.  One of these applications will be CMS; another will be an application to make data collected by the Arecibo radio telescope (http://www.naic.edu) accessible to members of Physics research community and the general public.  The development of these Hilda applications will be done primarily by undergraduates, and by high-school students as part of the Ithaca Learning Web program. Project publications, software and results will be made available at http://www.cs.cornell.edu/database/hilda.\r\n",
