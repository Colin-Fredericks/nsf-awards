 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shelton State Community College, a two year institution in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, consists of the C.A. Fredd State campus (which is designated as a Historically Black College and University) and the Martin campus.  Shelton State will implement a comprehensive analysis of the C.A. Fredd State campus' Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) educational programs as part of a planning process to develop a five-year Implementation Project proposal to HBCU-UP. \r\n\r\nThe planning grant will use a straight forward, sequential strategy using the basic scientific method: Hypothesize, Collect Data, Analyze Data, Identify Problems, Develop Solutions, and Create Plan of Action. The planning grant objectives include the: 1) Assessment of the present needs in STEM Courses by careful compilation and analysis of historic data; 2) Professional development of faculty to enhance their  knowledge of model STEM enhancement programs and their expertise in developing solutions for enhancing STEM programs at their campus; 3) Creation of plans to strengthen STEM resources including laboratories and technology; 4) Development of a curricula redesign and restructuring plan that will improve participation by minorities and close gaps from high schools to the community college and four year institutions; and 5) Development of a strategy that will enable the college to identify, recruit, and retain minority students in STEM majors and careers.  The planning grant will allow the institution to develop and enhance partnerships within the community to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the College in order to move towards growth and improvements in each STEM area.\r\n",
