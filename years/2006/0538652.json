The proposed program, 'Culturally Relevant Engineering Applications in Mathematics (CREAM),' will bridge engineering applications and mathematics. The program will involve two engineering, three educational and one mathematics faculty member; and engage them with four engineering and four mathematics Graduate Fellows (Fellows). These Washington State University faculty (WSU) members will work with the Fellows bridging their activities with three school districts: one Hispanic, one Native American, and one local to the university community. The grade levels will span initially the senior high and progressively move into the middle school years.  The project proposes several goals.  The first goal is to greatly increase learning of mathematics and valuing of engineering careers among traditional and underrepresented student populations. The second is to create in mathematics and engineering graduate students the desire to pursue careers as university educators who also engage in outreach and serve as mentors to diverse pre-college students. The third goal is to establish long-term relationships among geographically separated K-12 teachers and university faculty to support effective teaching of mathematics and promotion of engineering careers at the K-12 and university levels.\r\n\r\n",
