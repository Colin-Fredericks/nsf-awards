 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research that integrates across disciplines is critical to understanding the complex relationships among elements of linked social and ecological systems.  Through an interdisciplinary analysis of marine reserves in the Caribbean, this research project will identify factors critical to successful governance of coupled social and ecological systems, explore relationships among these factors, and examine how factors that operate at different spatial and temporal scales affect the performance of marine reserves.  In this study, an integrated team consisting of a marine policy scientist, an ecologist, and an anthropologist will work with several research assistants to conduct a systematic survey of governance factors at marine reserves across the Caribbean.  The investigators will employ research techniques developed in the fields of cultural anthropology and marine ecology to examine relationships among formal and informal governing arrangements linking humans and natural resources, such as capacity, stakeholder involvement, compliance, adaptive management, participatory monitoring, and alternative income projects.  They also will examine the social and ecological context within which these arrangements are embedded, such as the level of tourism in community, ocean currents, and habitat quality, and the impacts of these arrangements, including the performance of the marine reserves.  The investigators will generate empirical data sets of marine reserve governance factors, test relationships among dependent and independent governance variables, and develop predictive models of marine reserve performance.  This research will enhance basic knowledge regarding several key factors related to marine ecosystem governance and will improve understanding of the relationships among components of linked social and ecological systems.\r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary study will help to cultivate sustainable relationships among scientists in traditionally distinct disciplines and will enhance their interdisciplinary research skills.  The next generation of researchers will be trained in how to operate in a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary environment.  The investigators will coordinate their work with Caribbean marine reserve professionals throughout the study and will share results of this comprehensive evaluation through a project web site, project updates, and workshops conducted in the Caribbean.  The research team includes women researchers and will encourage student participation by groups underrepresented in the sciences.  An award resulting from the FY 2005 NSF-wide competition on Human and Social Dynamics (HSD) supports this project.  All NSF directorates and offices are involved in the coordinated management of the HSD competition and the portfolio of HSD awards.\r\n\r\n",
