 "awd_abstract_narration": "The No Core Shell Model for Nuclear Structure\r\n\r\n Over the last 15 years our research group has been developing a first\r\nprinciples approach for calculating the properties of atomic nuclei,\r\nstarting from the fundamental interactions among the protons and neutrons,\r\nboth pairwise and in terms of triplets.  The key to the successes of this \r\napproach is the treatment of all the protons and neutrons in the nucleus \r\nas being active, instead of holding some of them static, that is, as an\r\ninert core.  Hence, the name of our approach, the No Core Shell Model.  By\r\ntreating all particles active, we are able to calculate exactly the\r\nmedium-modified interaction among particles inside the nucleus and,\r\nthereby, the details of the nuclear structure produced by these \r\ninteractions.\r\n\r\n Besides giving us microscopic results for the theoretical properties of \r\natomic nuclei, our formalism allows us to analyze different theoretical \r\nmodels for the interactions among three particles, the so-called three\r\nnucleon interaction.  Understanding the nature of the three-nucleon\r\ninteraction is one of the most fundamental problems in theoretical nuclear\r\nphysics at this time.  This formalism can also be used for investigating\r\nthree-particle interactions in other physical systems.  In order to \r\nperform our large-scale no-core shell-model calculations, we have \r\ndeveloped several new shell-model computer codes, which can handle up to\r\none-billion single-particle basis states.  Again such computer codes have\r\napplications to the solving of important, outstanding problems in other \r\nfields of research, such as in condensed matter physics and in chemistry.\r\nOur research problem has also played a significant role in educating and\r\ntraining a new generation of young nuclear-structure theorists.  During \r\nthe course of our current research program on the no-core shell model, we\r\nhave educated five new PhD nuclear theorists and trained and mentored six\r\npostdoctoral research associates at the University of Arizona.  Several\r\nmore graduate students and postdoctoral research associates have been \r\ninvolved our collaborations with other nuclear-theory groups in the USA, \r\nEurope, Australia, and Tunisia.\r\n",
