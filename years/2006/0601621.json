 "awd_abstract_narration": "A result of Cayley implies that every group has a faithful\r\nrepresentations as a transitive permutation group. Many have primitive\r\nfaithful representations, for instance, all finite simple\r\ngroups. Indeed the classical simple groups act primitively on the\r\npoints of a projective or polar space.  However many groups have no\r\nprimitive faithful permutation representation, so imprimitive faithful\r\nrepresentations must be considered.  In this project Hall studies\r\nfinite imprimitive groups that act as automorphism groups of\r\ngeometries.  He also considers the converse---description and\r\ncharacterization of geometries that come provided with a natural and\r\nnontrivial equivalence relation.  Of particular interest are\r\nequivalence relations whose classes are the orbits of some nontrivial\r\nnormal subgroup, the group then naturally embedded in the\r\ncorresponding wreath product.  The geometries studied and\r\ncharacterized are highly homogeneous partial linear spaces,\r\nparticularly those associated with isometry groups of forms, where\r\nimprimitivity for the group can come from degeneracy of the form.  For\r\nforms of degree greater than two, this leads to questions about\r\npossible generalizations of Witt's theorem on bilinear and related\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nGroup theory is often described as the mathematics of symmetry.  That\r\nis, many groups are best described as collections of symmetries of\r\ngeometric objects. Conversely many geometries are best characterized\r\nby their associated groups, a point of view that goes back to Hilbert.\r\nFinite groups appear prominently via symmetry in many fields other\r\nthan mathematics, for example, physics, chemistry, and computer\r\nscience.  The building blocks of finite symmetry groups are the finite\r\nsimple groups and are realized as primitive permutation\r\ngroups---permutation groups that in an appropriate sense are\r\nefficient. A general finite group is then glued together from simple\r\ngroups, and its symmetry realization is imprimitive---constructed from\r\nvarious primitive constituents.  There has been great success recently\r\nin the description of simple groups and their primitive permuation\r\nrepresentations.  Understanding of and facility with imprimitive\r\ngroups is the important next step.  The project is aimed at giving\r\nelementary geometric descriptions of certain imprimitive groups and\r\nconversely characterizing and recognizing geometries starting from\r\nproperties of an imprimitive symmetry group.\r\n",
