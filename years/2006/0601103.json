 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RUI proposal requests continued support for a program of research on CP violation in B-Meson decays and the search for physics beyond the standard model (BSM). CP violation is believed to play an important role in baryogenesis and the observed matter-anti-matter asymmetry in the universe, but the currently known source of CP violation in the standard model is not large enough to account for our matter-dominated universe. Thus it is very plausible that new and much larger sources of CP violation must occur in physics beyond the standard model. B-decays are an excellent play to search for such effects because B-factories and the Tevatron are producing vast amounts of data, and eventually LHC will do likewise. In addition, the two- and three-body decays of B-mesons provide numerous correlations which may violate CP. The PI will develop signatures for particular models of BSM physics, especially the \"little Higgs\" models. \r\n\r\nThe PI, a professor at an undergraduate university in central Indiana, has a long term interest in weak interations in neutrino physics as well as B-decays,subjects which are well suited as introductions to research at the frontiers of particle physics. He is very active in involving undergraduates in his research and, in fact, he has an impressive record of sending students to graduate school. He also has an active collaborations with experts in the field such as Prof. A. Petrov, Wayne State, and Dr. A. Soni, Brookhaven National Laboratory.",
