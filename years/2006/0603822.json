 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will study topics in the broad area of enumerative\r\ngeometry.  Quiver varieties form a general type of degeneracy locus,\r\nwhich includes many important varieties such as determinantal\r\nvarieties and Schubert varieties.  The investigator will attempt to\r\ngeneralize known geometric and combinatorial formulas and\r\nconstructions concerning equioriented quiver varieties of type A to\r\nwork for more general quiver varieties of Dynkin type.  He will also\r\nstudy various cohomology theories of generalized flag manifolds with\r\nan emphasis on the multiplication of Schubert classes.  In particular,\r\nhe will attempt to understand the quantum cohomology of isotropic\r\nGrassmannians (with A. Kresch and H. Tamvakis).  He also hopes to\r\ndetermine if the Gromov-Witten invariants on Grassmannians and other\r\nhomogeneous spaces are determined by positivity properties.  As a\r\nseparate goal in his research, the investigator will develop computer\r\nprograms for computing the studied formulas and invariants.\r\n\r\nMuch development in algebraic geometry has been motivated by\r\nenumerative geometric problems, that is, problems that ask for the\r\nnumber of geometric objects of a specified type that satisfy certain\r\nconditions.  For example, quantum cohomology is a theory for counting\r\nthe number of curves of given degree in a variety that meet a number\r\nof fixed subvarieties.  The invention of quantum cohomology was\r\nmotivated by physics, where the ability to count curves has\r\napplications to mirror symmetry.  In general, enumerative problems can\r\nbe attacked by constructing a moduli space that has one point for each\r\ngeometric object that could be counted, such that the conditions on\r\nthe objects correspond to subvarieties of the moduli space.  This\r\nreduces an enumerative problem to understanding the intersection of\r\nsubvarieties of a larger space.  The relevant subvarieties can often\r\nbe constructed as special cases of quiver varieties, so this type of\r\nvarieties provide a powerful tool in enumerative geometry.  In\r\naddition, the study of quiver varieties has given rise to many new\r\nrelations between algebraic geometry and combinatorics, as well as\r\npowerful methods and constructions in both fields.",
