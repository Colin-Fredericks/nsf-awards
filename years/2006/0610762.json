 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project describes innovative synthetic approaches utilizing  perfluorocyclobutyl (PFCB) polymer platform technology to create commercially attractive membrane materials for removal of CO2 from natural gas. These new to the gas membrane art polymer structures will be differentiated from current commercial products through excellent CO2/methane separation performance combined with the ability to resist the plasticization and/or intersegmental packing by hydrocarbons during operation. Our proprietary research objectives involve synthesizing new PFCB structures having unique rigid backbones, new functionalities, application of crosslinking, nanocomposites, and increasing fluorine content. \r\n\r\nStrong societal and commercial impact comes from the fact that natural gas currently provides more than one-fifth of all primary energy used in the United States and 17% of all domestic raw natural gas must be treated to remove carbon dioxide before transportation. The membrane market itself is now over $200 million, and since competing processes largely involve expensive energy intensive phase changes and membranes do not, this market is expected to grow in the coming years. Successful results will be readily transferable to other high value hydrocarbon separations, such as propane/propylene  \r\n",
