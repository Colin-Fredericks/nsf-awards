 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nImproved performance of biomaterials whose purpose is to closely mimic the biological functions of natural bone can be achieved by gaining a deeper understanding of the correlation between the microarchitecture of these materials and their resultant mechanical properties. The aim of this work is to determine the correlation between the elastic modulus and hardness of electrospun compositionally modified hydroxyapatite bioceramic nanoparticle/ collagen nanofiber composites, and their morphology and composition.  We will (a)  prepare Mg2+ and CO32- ion substituted hydroxyapatite  nanoparticles of various sizes and morphology (b) prepare nanoparticle-loaded collagen fibrous constructs with differing morphologies by using electrospinning, (c) conduct a nanoindentation study of the prepared fibrous constructs, including single fibers (d)  determine how the mechanical properties evolve as a result of changes in the structural properties of the composites. The proposed research is part of an interdisciplinary collaboration between the UAB Departments of Physics, Biomedical Engineering, Materials Engineering, and School of Dentistry encompassing nanostructured, compositionally graded, and multiphase ceramic and polymeric materials for use in biomedical applications, and will have a large impact on the new UAB \"Center for Nanoscale Biomaterials and Biosensors\". This research will support one physics PhD graduate student, partially support one postdoc, and will provide undergraduate research opportunities for physics and biomedical engineering students through the UAB REU and RET programs, enrollment in laboratory courses and several established UAB honors programs.\r\n",
