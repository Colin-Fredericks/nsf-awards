 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis is a proposal requesting funds from the National Science Foundation to help convene a research symposium, \"Systematics, genetic diversity and conservation of raptors.\"  The objectives of this symposium are as follows. (1) Bring together leading scientists and students from the international community having active research programs concerning the genetics and conservation of birds of prey (hawks and eagles; raptors) for a one-day symposium.  This will be held in conjunction with the North American Ornithological Conference in October 2006 in Veracruz, Mexico.  Topics for discussion and presentations will include: (i) resolving taxonomic uncertainties (species recognition), (ii) determining which species are most in need of conservation efforts, and (iii) development of molecular markers and analytical methods for use in raptor conservation and biodiversity research.  (2) Promote communication and sharing of knowledge and resources among the international community and foster the interests and careers of junior scientists.  (3) Promote the development and curation of a shared raptor genetic resource collection housed at the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology.\r\n\r\nThere is a clear need for baseline data regarding levels of genetic diversity in a variety of raptor taxa, including those differing in their life histories, breeding population sizes, and susceptibility to human impacts. The proposed symposium will help to fill such basic gaps in our understanding of the taxonomy and phylogeny for various raptor groups.  The current list of 20 invitees includes six women and five graduate students as well as multiple investigators from under-represented groups.  A book based on the symposium presentations is planned. This will provide a synthesis for conservation genetics of raptors covering topics such as: the nature of conservation units; adequate sampling, assumptions and applications for genetic diversity estimates; use of museum specimens in research; and assessment of historical changes in genetic diversity within species.  Understanding and conservation of environmentally sensitive and ecologically important groups such as raptors benefits society by promoting healthy ecosystems. This symposium has been funded in conjunction with the Population and Evolutionary Processes cluster at the Division of Environmental Biology, and by the Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n",
