 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on the development of fundamentally new synthetic methodology based on the intermediacy of novel metal-coordinated biradicals.  Mechanistic and computational studies are to be employed in order to understand recently discovered metal-catalyzed Bergman cycloaromatization reactions.  A single metal center will be employed to induce the formation of biradicals, transmit stereochemical information to remote bond-forming locations, and activate adjacent aromatic rings for subsequent stereoselective functionalization.   Studies will also include the development of metal-triggered hetero-Bergman cycloaromatization reactions for the formation of heterocyclic compounds of synthetic importance. \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Joseph M. O'Connor of the Department of Chemistry at University of California-San Diego.  Professor O'Connor's research efforts revolve around the development of new synthetic methodology based on novel metal-coordinated biradicals.   Such metal-coordinated biradicals offer promise for efficient approaches for the synthesis of complex organic molecules as well as the preparation of molecules that are virtually inaccessible in the absence of such radicals.",
