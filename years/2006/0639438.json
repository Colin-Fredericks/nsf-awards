 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will investigate the potential of a new method for \r\nconstructing finite element solvers of optimal speed.  For a class \r\nof bounded monotone  elliptic systems, the method solves the finite element \r\nmodel in a discrete quotient space, whose complexity depends mainly on the \r\nkernel of the discritized finite element operator, and is linearly \r\nproportional to the number of unknowns in the system.  The investigator \r\nwill demonstrate that the method has many advantageous features, \r\nand seek for  extending it to to more challenging problems such as\r\nconvection-dominated diffusion.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research resides at the heart of high performance scientific \r\ncomputation, having repeatedly been identified as  a critical mission by  \r\nNational Sciences Foundation over the last several decades.  In 2003, \r\nthe U.S. Department of Energy publicized a two-volume report  \r\ntitled \"A Science-based Case for Large Scale Simulation\", prepared with\r\ndirect input from more than 300 of the nation's leading computational \r\nscientists, in which discovering efficient solver algorithms for large \r\nscale simulation is recognized as important as building supper computers.\r\nThe investigator directly answer to the call with a strong promise to \r\nadvance that mission.  \r\n",
