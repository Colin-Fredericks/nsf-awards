The annual meeting will continue the consistent commitment of\r\nSCAS to interconnections between academia and industry, government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and advocacy groups, with regard to scientific approaches to local environmental issues. The meeting also provides a low-key, informal setting for students presenting their original research, often for the first time as a professional. Funds from the National Science Foundation will assist SCAS in meeting our goals by: supporting student participation, reducing registration fees, supporting dissemination of the presented papers beyond meeting itself, providing a higher profile for outreach to potential new members and those from under-represented groups.\r\n",
