 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a workshop on New Research Directions in High Confidence Soft-ware Infrastructure for future Distributed Real-time and Embedded (DRE) systems. The workshop is co-located with the Object Management Groups Workshop on Distributed Object Computing for Real-time and Embedded Systems on July 10-13, 2006. This workshop contributes to a study by the National Coordination Office (NCO) for Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD), and its High Confidence Software and Systems (HCSS) Coordinating Group, and is co-funded by the NSF and HCSS agencies. The workshop focuses on High Confidence Software Infrastructure for assured, networked/distributed, real-time, embedded systems. The purpose of the workshop is to bring together key representatives from academia, industry, and government to identify research needed for the development of a next-generation real-time technology base, one that can address the growing needs for highly-automated and dynamically-configured networked embedded sensing and control systems of the future. \r\n",
