A novel molecule-based diagnostic technique will be developed to simultaneously measure flow velocity and temperature distributions inside microchannels. The proposed molecule-based diagnostic technique will be applied to elucidate the underlying physics of Joule heating and micro-scale heat transfer process in electrokinetically-driven microfluidics. A greater understanding of Joule heating and micro-scale heat transfer gained through the proposed research can be used to minimize the detrimental effects of Joule heating and optimize thermal management for improved performances and extended capacities of various microfluidic systems.\r\nThe integrated educational and outreach activities include: 1) Creation of web-based, visualization-enhanced thermal-fluid courseware to augment concepts introduced in undergraduate classes; 2) Development of new graduate courses to make engineering education better reflect the state-of-the-art in engineering practice; 3) Recruitment of female and minority students to work on the proposed project to promote the participation of under represented minorities in science and engineering; 4) Development of summer seminars and flow visualization demonstration experiments to impart K-12 teachers and students, and by extension, the public at large, a greater awareness of thermal-fluid science and technology and their importance to our daily lives.  The proposed project will bring university professors, K-12 teachers, and graduate, undergraduate and K-12 students together in a multi-level learning experience infused with the excitement of discovery.\r\n",
