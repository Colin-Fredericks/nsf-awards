This will lead to an era of spectrum efficient cognitive radios that will enable the deployment of radically different radio architectures, algorithms, and protocols over the next decade.  This project is studying the design of a new programmable media access control (MAC) layer for this new environment.  The MAC must regulate how future programmable radio devices can efficiently interact with each other using spectrum-aware communication algorithms.  In our study, we model the MAC design as decision problems using tools from decision sciences such as stochastic control, optimization, graph theory and estimation theory.  We validate the design of the MAC through an experimental implementation consisting of programmable radios.  The expected results from the research include the design of a programmable MAC system that can enable a class of new applications, including enhanced reliability communications and spectrum-efficient group communications.  The resulting implementation of the proposed programmable MAC platform and its software will enable the development of new intelligent spectrum-aware algorithms and applications.  The results of the research will provide a set of foundation algorithms that can be used by the community developing new spectrum-aware radio systems.  The research facilitates several life-critical activities e.g., search and rescue missions and disaster relief operations.  The research will also enrich the education curriculum of the participating institutions and foster the participation of under-represented groups in engineering.\r\n\r\n",
