 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to realize a magnetoresistive sense head suitable for magnetic recording using a nanowire sensing element. This approach is based on a Current Perpendicular to Plane geometry and the element is sufficiently small that it can fit in the small volume between the shields that will likely be available at Terrabit/inch2 densities. \r\n\r\nThe intectual merit is in the theory and fabrication of the sensor, which is designed to address the five most significant issues to magnetic recording.  These include: adequate change in resistance R as a function of magnetic field, an optimal resistance R of approximately 40, adequate magnetoresistive ratio R/R, adequate heat dissipation, and resistance to noise induced by thermal fluctuations. The proposed research addresses these issues by a combination of experiment, primarily electrochemistry, and theory, primarily model conductivity calculations and micromagnetics. \r\n\r\nThe broad impact of this research involves: people who want to learn about research (undergraduate and high school), graduate students who are beginning their research careers, and fellow researchers with particular emphasis towards industry. Undergraduates and high school teachers/students will participate in Research Experience for Undergraduates programs.  Graduate students will benefit from interdisciplinary centers and extensive contact with industry. And, a visit to multiple U.S. recording companies is proposed, in addition to interactions with this GOALI's partner. Finally, although this proposal is worded towards the needs of the magnetic recording industry, other applications such as spintronics and sensor arrays could also benefit from the very small sensors proposed in this research. \r\n",
