First, the nanoscale structure, namely multi-quantum-well, will be optimized to obtain the maximum desired optical property enhancement while interacting with a controlled laser beam. Subsequently, this new material structure will be integrated into the optoelectronic device as a coherently controlled photonic band gap. In the device-level modeling and simulation, the operations and performances of this kind of integrated device will be demonstrated. As a final step, the possible fabrication issues/recipes will be considered. The project will greatly enhance the basic physics understanding of coherently controlled quantum interference effects in various semiconductor realizations. Furthermore these interesting phenomena will be creatively applied to the engineering applications in the optoelectronic device design.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts: The research will not only contribute to scientific understanding on nanophotonics, but also have some near-term engineering impacts on the industry product development. In addition, through this research the undergraduate research assistants will get in-depth training on advanced topics such as nanotechnology, photonics and computer aided design/engineering. It will enhance the undergraduate engineering curriculum and benefit the planned MEM/Nanotechnology program directly at University of Wisconsin-Platteville. The project will also help nurture an exciting research environment in the institution. \r\n\r\n",
