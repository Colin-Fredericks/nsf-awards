If successful, the work will reduce columncapacity loss due to contaminating protein adsorption, and reduce the complexity of protein elution protocols.  The work involves defining the low background region of the IMAC elution profile of E.coli proteins using both pH and alternately imidazole gradients, identifying these proteins using a combination of 2D gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and database analysis, deleting the genes encoding proteins if they are unnecessary for growth under laboratory\r\nconditions, (or altering them via specific mutation such that they no longer elute in the low protein background region of the host elution profile), and  developing highly efficient metal binding peptides to direct elution towards the low background region.\r\n\r\nThe methodology used to develop improvements for IMAC is broadly applicable to all affinity systems employing affinity tails. Therefore, the proposed work will catalyze a general improvement strategy for bioseparation.  In addition, the students working on this project will become broadly trained in the tools of biochemical engineering as well as molecular biology thus contributing to a generation of interdisciplinary engineers and scientists capable of biotechnology leadership.\r\n \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCollaborative Research: Efficient Bioseparation by Intertwining Strain, Chromatography, and Affinity Tail Design\n\nConsider the following hypothetical circumstance: a parking lot is filled with cars of similar model but different color.  There is no supervision as the cars leave the parking lot after their motors are started.  How does one permit all of the green automobiles to exit the parking lot as a single group?  Moreover, without any supervision, can one minimize the chance of a non-green automobile leaving with the green automobiles?\n\nThis scenario is how Professor Beitle recently described the collaborative work, supported by NSF, to improve process chromatography.  The parking lot represents column chromatography, a method used to purify proteins like biopharmaceuticals (eg. insulin), food processing enzymes (eg. pectinase), and other recombinant DNA products made by cloning a gene into a bacteria.  Each color represents a different type of protein, with the green and non-green denoting the desired product and spectrum of possible contaminants, respectively.  The answer to the hypothetical problem is simple: eliminate all non-green automobiles from the planet in the first place.  And the answer to the real problem that we are solving in the lab is just as intuitive: stop the host cell from making some of the contaminants in the first place as they grow and reproduce in the fermentation tank whilst they produce the desired protein and all of the rest of the \"junk\" needed for growth and reproduction.\n\nAs such, the intellectual merit of the completed work focused on the characterization of several chromatography methods used to isolate recombinant DNA products.  The principle method investigated, Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC), is a popular affinity technique used to isolate a particular protein from a mixture.  We set about a characterization of the host cell proteins of Escherichia coli, a common bacterium used to produce proteins recombinantly, to identify what potentially contaminating proteins bind under what conditions, with the hope that one could actually delete or modify the gene(s) that give rise to these proteins.  We found a set that once deleted from the chromosome, would improve the purity of a model product, namely His-tagged Green Fluorescent Protein.  We also investigated methods by which metabolically important host cell proteins could be modified in a fashion that abolishes IMAC adsorption and lets the protein function as E. coli grows and produces product.  Our group, consisting of researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Arkansas, also began to look at how complicated it would be to extend the theory to other non-affinity chromatography methods (they would be harder because they are less selective and presumably bind more host cell proteins) and have made strides towards improving these methods.\n\nThe broader impact of the work can be summarized both in terms of knowledge creation and training.  The information we have collected and will continue to collect on host cell proteins will allow us to design a series of chromatography-friendly bacterial strains that would allow for efficient purification of a biologic or industrial enzyme.  The people trained by working on the project have moved on to gainful employment in the biotechnology-sector, with one in particular poised to start an IP-based company to deliver these strains to industry and academia.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/27/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert R Beitle"
