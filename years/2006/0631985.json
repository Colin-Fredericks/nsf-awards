US PI Vinod Menon of CUNY Queens College will collaborate with Professor Shailaja Mahamuni of the University of Pune.  Their collaborative effort will focus on developing efficient photon sources based on ZnO quantum dots in microcavities and exploring polariton emission under the strong coupling regime.  \r\n\r\nThe collaboration brings together a unique combination of expertise, namely Professor Menon's quantum microcavity structures group at Queens College with Professor Mahamuni's group in Pune, which is highly experienced in synthesizing efficient ultra-violet (UV) emitting zinc oxides (ZnO).  The PIs expect to lay the ground work for a long term collaboration to develop highly efficient classical and quantum emitters using the ZnO material system.  \r\n\r\nThis research will initiate international collaboration that can lead to developing efficient light emitters in the ultra-violet wavelength range.  The research program will involve undergraduate, graduate, post-doctorate students in both countries and lay the basis for a larger multi-year effort that includes the exchange of students and research scholars.  Results will be disseminated broadly through presentations and publications.  The proposal for the multi-year effort will be submitted by each investigator to the NSF/DST joint program.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
