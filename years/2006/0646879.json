 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\n2006 Gilbert Club meeting\r\nIntellectual merit\r\nThe Gilbert Club has met every year in Berkeley after the Fall American\r\nGeophysical Union since 1983. It has grown from the original 7 participants to, in 2005,\r\nnearly 278, and has become a forum for new ideas, community initiatives, sustained\r\ncommunication, and the building of collegiality. Geomorphology has expanded rapidly\r\nin this 23-year period, and the Gilbert Club has contributed to that evolution. The\r\nmeeting consists typically of three speakers followed at the end of the day with \"pop-ups\"\r\nof short reports by any attendee. Last year NSF partially supported the meeting, reducing\r\nthe cost to participants significantly, and that caused the attendance to jump by 40% over\r\nthe previous year. This year we propose that NSF cover full participation costs.\r\nThe meeting is run entirely on volunteer efforts of Berkeley graduate students, so\r\nthat the request here is just for room and vehicle rentals, food and beverages. Our size\r\nnow requires that we meet in a larger setting than the PI's house in the evening, and\r\nrental for a facility has been added to the request. The participants pay for their own\r\ntravel and lodging, so the financial commitment by the participants is still substantial.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nUnder-represented individuals have been invited in the past and are particularly\r\nsought among the new and emerging group of geomorphologists. We actively seek\r\nnames and track progress of individuals in order to make speaker invitations when the\r\nindividual is ready to give a substantial presentation. Gilbert Club is openly advertised\r\nand anyone is welcome to participate.\r\n",
