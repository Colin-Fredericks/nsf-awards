 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carrier-Assisted Routing in Mobile Networks\r\n\r\nIn terms of handling node mobility in various mobile networks, two schools exist. The traditional connection-based model is built on the premise that the underlying network is connected, and views node mobility as undesirable. The mobility-assisted model considers mobility as a desirable feature, where routing is based on the store-carry-forward paradigm with random or controlled movement of mobile nodes. This research uses node mobility to enhance routing capability in a mobile network. A dual control planes model is presented, which includes the traditional S (stationary)-plane for routing among stationary nodes using connection-based message routing. In addition, a new control plane, M (mobile)-plane, is used for trajectory control of mobile nodes. The focus is on loosely controlled movement of mobile nodes to assist routing. The five goals of this work are the following: (1) Propose a generic framework for routing. (2) Offer flexible trajectory control of mobile nodes to balance several global objectives. (3) Explore the use of unicasting as a basic building block to support collective communication, including multicast, broadcast, anycast, gather, and gossip. (4) Extend the current model in the 2-D Euclidian space to the high-dimensional and non-Euclidian space. (5) Integrate different components in dual control planes and fine tune the system through an empirical study based on a set of well-defined quantitative performance\r\nmetrics. This work is the first to integrate two schools of handling node mobility. The PI envisions that results generated from this research will provide guidelines for efficient routing in a wide range of applications, including the GENI project.\r\n",
