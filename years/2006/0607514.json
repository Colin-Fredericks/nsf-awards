 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST-0607514\r\nLewis\r\n\r\nDr.  Lewis is currently involved in the simulation of various aspects of the Saturnian ring system and is working on a general data analysis and visualization tool.  The results of these simulations will aid in interpreting Cassini observations and providing a general understanding of the Saturnian ring system.  These simulations will include the regions around the Encke gap, the Keeler gap, the F ring, and various density waves. The dynamics of these systems are complex because of the interactions with nearby moons. Having a solid base of well indexed simulations to pull data from will significantly increase our understanding of these systems. This award will be used to involve two students in numerical investigations of planetary ring dynamics and the enhancements of codes used for these investigations. \r\n\r\nThe results of the project will have a number of broader impacts on the field of planetary science. It will boost the number of high resolution numerical simulations of planetary ring systems that can be analyzed, resulting in a better understanding of the dynamics of the system. It will improve the quality of the tools available to the planetary science community as a whole and improve distribution of simulation data in that community.  This award is made under the auspices of the Research at Undergraduate Institutions program at the NSF.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
