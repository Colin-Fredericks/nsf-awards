 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop a new class of numerical methods based on \r\nefficient nonlinear approximations of kernels of operators as well as the solutions of\r\nintegral and differential equations. The approach will be used to solve the\r\nthree-dimensional Lippmann-Schwinger equation of scattering theory. We \r\nintend to demonstrate flexibility and generality of numerical methods based on\r\nmultiresolution structure and nonlinear approximations.\r\n\r\nThe development of many modern technologies requires accurate simulation of\r\nphysical processes leading to computationally difficult multidimensional\r\nproblems. For example, a number of difficult problems arise in condensed \r\nmatter physics and materials science and are critical to the design of new \r\nmaterials. Mathematical tools developed by the investigators, and their recent, \r\nsuccessful use in quantum chemistry, point to a new class of numerical algorithms for\r\nproblems in high dimensions. These algorithms have very desirable \r\nfeatures: they are fast, they provide guaranteed (user-controllable) precision, and \r\nthey are flexible enough to be applicable in many different problem domains. This \r\nproject intends to have broad impact in computational mathematics and applied \r\nfields, and to open a way for tackling a number of problems which are currently\r\ninaccessible. An integral part of this proposal is training of graduate \r\nstudents and postdoctoral researchers in these newly developed analytic and numerical\r\ntechniques, and a broad dissemination of the results.\r\n",
