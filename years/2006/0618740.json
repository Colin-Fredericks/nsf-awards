 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Instrument Development (CRIF:ID) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh will develop under the direction of David W. Pratt two chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave (CP-FTMW) spectrometers for applications in biomolecule electronic spectroscopy. This work will be done in collaboration with Brooks H. Pate in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Virginia, Main Campus.  The development work will involve studies using laser ablation sources to evaporate involatile molecules, construction of a CP-FTMW 11GHz spectrometer with a coaxial geometry optimized for rotational spectroscopy of biomolecules, and development of a cost-effective CP-FTMW spectrometer with a reduced bandwidth operation of 200MHz. The spectrometers will be compatible with laser sources to undertake UV laser-microwave double resonance spectroscopy. \r\n\r\nThese instruments will be used to determine the structural and dynamical properties of relatively large molecules in the gas phase from their fully resolved pure rotational spectra. Conformationally flexible molecules of biological interest will be particularly investigated. The 11GHz spectrometer will be made available to a network of scientists and students from national laboratories, industry, other universities, including principally undergraduate institutions (PUI). The cost effective 200 MHz spectrometer will allow researchers to fully exploit results from the main spectrometer with experiments performed in their own laboratories. By increasing the accessibility of suchspectrometers, collaborative research with PUI institutions will be enhanced.",
