 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program aims to study the mechanisms of ultra-short pulsed laser-induced processing of dielectric materials. The research will have an impact on the fundamental study of ultra-short pulsed laser-induced processing of dielectrics. Important applications in micromachining and fabrication of microfluidic/optical diagnostic devices will be advanced. \r\n\r\nThe research has four main objectives: 1) to investigate the mechanisms of surface and volumetric damage in femtosecond-laser interactions with dielectric materials such as glasses; 2) to investigate generation and subsequent temporal evolution of ultra-short laser pulse-induced plasmas inside glasses as compared to liquid media; 3) to thoroughly investigate the mechanisms of femtosecond laser drilling of dielectrics, including demonstration of efficient, high-aspect ratio drilling in dielectrics with good wall quality; and 4) to fabricate and test a hybrid 3-D device micromachined in glass that combines optical detection via waveguides and microfluidic manifolds.\r\n\r\nThe laser-materials interaction will be analyzed by resolving the laser energy deposition into the transparent material, the nonlinear propagation of the ultra-fast laser pulse, the generation of excited carriers, the defect formation, damage, plasma formation and ablation. This will be achieved by experimental work utilizing advanced time-resolved diagnostics in coordination with detailed computational modeling. \r\n\r\n\tEducation constitutes an integral part of this project. Two graduate students will be trained in advanced materials processing, experimentation and theoretical modeling. Underrepresented minority students will be hired to work on the project through the UC Berkeley GrAD and SUPERB programs. The research results will be integrated into a web of educational activities aiming to achieve broad dissemination to undergraduate and graduate students and professionals through demonstrations and animations developed through the research programs experimental and theoretical work. The results of this research will also be integrated into a regularly offered graduate course on Laser Processing and Diagnostics.\r\n",
