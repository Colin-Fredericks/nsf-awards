 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project summary\r\nThe rate of job-to-job transitions, moves of workers between employers without an intervening unemployment\r\nspell, are twice as large as the rate at which workers move from employment to unemployment. Moreover,\r\nthe relative importance of these job-to-job transitions has increased dramatically in recent decades.\r\nThis means that job-to-job transitions are now at least as important a means of reallocating labor towards\r\nits more productive uses as are the transitions of workers through unemployment. Despite their quantitative\r\nsignificance, job-to-job transitions are rarely given an important role, or even included, in equilibrium\r\nsearch models, which have been for the past two decades the primary and most successful tool used to\r\nanalyze worker reallocation and the phenomenon of unemployment. Moreover, the search models that do\r\nincorporate job-to-job transitions adopt the so-called basic job-ladder model of these transitions. My recent\r\nwork has demonstrated some serious and previously unrecognized quantitative shortcomings of the basic\r\njob-ladder model with respect to recently documented stylized facts. In fact, the proposal shows that there\r\nexists no theoretical model of job-to-job transitions that can quantitatively match their salient features.\r\nThe intellectual merit of this study will be to remedy this significant gap in the literature by developing\r\na new theoretical model of job-to-job transitions that is able to match observed salient features of these\r\ntransitions, both in terms of their magnitude and of their variation across groups of workers and across\r\nstages of the business cycle.\r\nThe broader impact of the study will involve the efficiency properties of the proposed model and the resulting\r\ndevelopment of policy implications of theories of frictional labor markets that incorporate an empirically\r\ngrounded model of job-to-job transitions. Any successful labor-market policy should aim to achieve the reallocation\r\nof labor to its most productive uses with the least social cost. Equilibrium search models portray\r\nunemployment as a social cost that is necessary to achieve this reallocation. In fact, they predict that, under\r\ncertain conditions, the unemployment observed in decentralized markets is equal to its socially optimal level.\r\nThe introduction of job-to-job transitions, in which the reallocation of labor towards its more productive uses\r\ntakes place without workers having to bear the burden of unemployment, can be expected to challenge these\r\nconclusions. It will provide novel insights about the optimality of the observed level of unemployment and\r\nof patterns of worker turnover in general. These new insights can then guide policy-makers to adopt new\r\napproaches to the long-standing policy concern of unemployment.",
