The synergy that will result from these\r\ninstitutional interactions to increase minority Ph.D.s will transform the instructional,\r\nresearch and administrative aspects of cooperation among these institutions in ways never\r\nbefore envisioned. The requested support for continuation of the LSMAMP to Phase IV will\r\naccelerate this process and contribute to increasing the numbers of minority students\r\nentering the Ph.D. pipeline. The funding of the Phase IV program will continue to\r\nstrengthen the foundation for institutionalization of the program in the state of\r\nMississippi.\r\nThe MAMP Bridge to the Doctorate program, coordinated by JSU for the alliance and\r\nsupported by NSF, provides the resources to support 24 minority students to pursue\r\ngraduate STEM degrees (MS) and then bridge to doctoral programs at MAMP institutions or\r\nother doctoral institutions across the nation. The MAMP Bridge to the Doctorate program\r\nwas distinguished as being only one of two in the nation to place 100% of their Cohort I\r\nBridge to the Doctorate students into doctoral programs. The program developed for Cohort\r\nI students will be shared with all MAMP institutions as a model to be replicated on each\r\nMAMP campus to leverage the NSF funding and increase the total number of undergraduate\r\nMAMP students targeting doctoral studies. Students? having undergraduate research\r\nexperiences is fundamental to the success of the Bridge to the Doctorate program.\r\nUndergraduate research will be a major focus of the Phase IV MAMP program. Each MAMP sites\r\nwill provide undergraduate research experiences for their students. MAMP sites will place\r\nstudents in research internship positions at MAMP institutions or at partner institution\r\nsites. MAMP students will present their research at the annual MAMP research symposium.\r\nStudents will also be encouraged to present the results of their research projects at\r\nstate and national conferences and meetings such as the Mississippi Academy of Sciences\r\n(MAS), the National Council on Undergraduate Research, the NSF JAM Conference, ABRCMS, and\r\nother professional conferences in their disciplines. The large number of minority students\r\nattending the MAS conference each year, and the steadily increasing number presenting\r\npapers, has benefited the students and has made an indelible impression on the Academy,\r\nfostering a climate of increasing diversity in the scientific environment of the state and\r\nregion.\r\nThe Phase IV MAMP will include a fresh approach to tracking students after they complete\r\ntheir BS. A robust website incorporating web-portal technology will be developed to\r\nsupport communications, networking and student tracking across the MAMP community.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The goal of the LSMAMP program is to establish a secure pathway for\r\nunderrepresented minority students to obtain BS, MS and PhD degrees in science,\r\ntechnology, engineering and mathematics. This proposed project will build upon existing\r\nrelationships between MAMP institutions, and partnering institutions, e.g. University of\r\nCalifornia campuses, LBL, LLNL, AGEM and MRC to increase the number of minority students\r\nenrolling and matriculating in MS and Ph.D. STEM graduate programs within and outside of\r\nthe state of Mississippi. Broader Impacts: The LSMAMP program will increase the number of\r\nPh.D. degrees in STEM areas awarded to minorities, especially African-Americans. We will\r\nPROJECT SUMMARY\r\nPage A\r\nprovide well-qualified and diverse faculty members for U S universities and colleges, as\r\nwell as impact the number of scientists and engineers holding the doctorate for employment\r\nin the STEM workforce.",
