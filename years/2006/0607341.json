 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is motivated by the need to better understand the role of dust in\r\nastrophysical environments. Dust is a vital ingredient in the star formation process as\r\nwell as in planet forming disks. It is a source of mass loss from evolved stars (through\r\nradiation pressure on dust grains) and intimately links the radiation field to the\r\ncircumstellar material. Dust also contributes to several aspects of interstellar processes\r\nsuch as gas heating and the formation of molecules. \r\n\r\nThe work to be undertaken here is specifically centered on characterizing the precise nature of dust grains around cool carbon stars as these are the source of the bulk of the Galaxy's carbon-rich dust. By\r\nknowing the initial state of the dust from such stars, the effects of the dust in the\r\ninterstellar medium can be more accurately quantified. Moreover, the relatively benign\r\nenvironment surrounding such stars simplifies the chemistry, which in turn facilitates the\r\nunderstanding of the various processes in operation. The properties of the grains are also\r\ntied to the evolution of the star itself, thus the precise nature of the dust must be assessed\r\nin order to understand this evolution. Finally, recent Spitzer Space Telescope\r\nobservations of carbon stars in the Magellanic Clouds suggest a different dust\r\ncondensation sequence compared to Galactic carbon stars which may well permit the\r\neffects of metallicity on dust formation to be investigated.\r\n\r\nThe tools to be applied here include infrared spectroscopy and imaging, radiative transfer\r\nmodeling, laboratory spectroscopy, and archival data mining. They will be used to test\r\ncurrent theories of dust formation in carbon star environments and how these\r\ncondensation sequences are effected by the initial mass and metallicity of the parent stars.\r\nFurthermore, the imaging and radiative transfer studies should provide insight into the\r\ncauses of axisymmetric structures seen in planetary and protoplanetary nebulae.\r\nThis project includes the participation and training of a doctoral student who will be an\r\nintegral part of the research program. The student will be expected to present results at\r\nboth conferences and public talks thereby combining training with public outreach.",
