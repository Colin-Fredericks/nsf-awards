 "awd_abstract_narration": "0627312\r\nKostarelos\r\nThis proposal seeks funding to develop \"design and synthesis\" poro-selective membranes for application as coatings to optical fibers. Using such specialty cladding materials, the light radiating within the fiber will interact with the outside environment and transduce the presence and concentration of target species (chlorinated hydrocarbons, heavy metals, PAHs, etc.). The results of our proposal are the first steps toward our long-term objective: to introduce chemo-optical spectroscopy as a tool for real-time, remote monitoring of transport processes within the subsurface environment. In addition, several other geo- environmental applications that focus on waste containment and site remediation issues can be exploited by the technology being developed under this grant. In telecommunications, optical fibers are produced so that light inside the fiber does not interact with the external environment. However for chemical sensing, specialty porous cladding materials may be employed to serve as a zone of interaction, where light is modulated by the media it encounters. The electromagnetic field is termed as the evanescent field. Evanescent field spectroscopy has been known to scientists for many years; however, lack of focused activity on the production of effective coating materials has been an obstacle to the commercial availability of waveguide chemical sensor devices.",
