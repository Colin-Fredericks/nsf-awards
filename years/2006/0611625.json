 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computing Research Association (CRA), the Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research (CRA-W), and the Coalition to Diversify Computing (CDC) have been awarded a Special Projects grant to organize a series of annual career mentoring workshops that are designed to provide early career faculty members and advanced graduate students in computing disciplines with critical information and useful tools to build successful academic and research careers. Established professionals provide practical information, advice, and mentoring support to their younger colleagues. The workshops include speakers and panels on topics such as planning a research career, preparing for the tenure process, and dealing with time management and family issues. In addition, informal discussion time and social events are included so that the participants have an opportunity to meet and network with the speakers and other participants.",
