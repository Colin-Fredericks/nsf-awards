 "awd_abstract_narration": "The UMB Scholars program will provide stipend and research support for 12 students (6 from Biology and 6 from Math/Statistics) to work collaboratively on advanced problems in Computational Neuroscience and Bioinformatics under the mentorship of established investigators. To facilitate this collaborative research, UMB Scholars majoring in biology will be required to add a minor in math/statistics; those majoring in math/statistics will be required to add a minor in biology. This approach offers the best way to ensure that all students are exposed to a coherent, logical and systematic series of foundational and more advanced courses in both fields. From a broader perspective, the UMB Scholars program will showcase to the much larger university community the importance and value of quantitative thinking and approaches in modern biological science. Successes of UMB Scholars following their graduation from UTSA will underscore the message that adding an academic minor in biology, math or statistics to their course of study is the best way for a student to prepare for a future in biological research. The UMB Program will serve as a catalyst for a comprehensive, coordinated and integrated restructuring the of current undergraduate curricula in biology, math, statistics and computer science to eliminate deficiencies and constraints that limit quantitative approaches in undergraduate education at this institution .The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) is a public institution serving San Antonio and South Texas. Students targeted for this UMB program are the University's large Hispanic population. Currently, UTSA ranks first in the nation in the number of baccalaureate degrees awarded to Hispanics in biology and ninth in the number awarded in mathematics.\r\n",
