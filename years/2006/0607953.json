Understanding the properties of these models is a\r\nfundamental challenge both in mathematics and science.  The\r\nregularity and stability of solutions are issues strongly related\r\nto nontrivial physical phenomena like turbulence and phase\r\ntransitions that are complex multiscale problems.  Analyzing\r\nmathematical models of these phenomena often requires the\r\ndevelopment of novel tools encompassing techniques from analysis,\r\napplied mathematics, and stochastics.  This project, which\r\naddresses both theoretical and applied issues, spans from\r\nconservation laws to Navier-Stokes equations, kinetic equations,\r\nand motion of particles in fluids.  It requires tools from the\r\ntheories of nonlinear partial differential equations, asymptotic\r\nanalysis, probability, and stochastics. \r\n\r\n     The discovery of mathematical structure in physical models\r\nis of great importance for a deeper understanding of the physical\r\nphenomena themselves.  It gives also some hints of the range of\r\nvalidity of the models.  In this project, the investigator\r\ndevelops and studies new models involving couplings between fluid\r\nmechanics and physics far from equilibrium.  This field has\r\nimportant applications in science and engineering.  For example,\r\nit models pollutants in a river or combustion of gasoline in an\r\nengine.  The applied and mathematical challenges stem from the\r\ncomplexity of the phenomena.",
