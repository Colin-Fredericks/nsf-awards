 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past 40 years great progress have been made in understanding the functional\r\nbasis of anatomical diversity of organisms. More recently, researchers have begun to\r\nunravel the genetic and developmental basis of anatomical structures. To understand\r\nevolutionary transformations, one needs to analyze changes at genetic, developmental, and\r\nphenotypic levels, as well as the integration between these levels. This requires the\r\nconstruction of genetic, developmental and functional/selectional scenarios. Current\r\ninterest focuses on genetic and functional/selectional scenarios. Developmental scenarios\r\nthat convincingly link genetic and functional/selectional scenarios are scarce, but see\r\nBeldade et al. 2002 for an example). It is essential to include knowledge of developmental\r\nprocesses for a continued integration of developmental genetics and morphology. Most\r\nmorphological structures develop under the influence of many genes. Therefore, to\r\ncomprehend the evolution of the development of these structures, an understanding is\r\nneeded of how the involved genes interact, directly or epigenetically, in steering\r\nmorphogenetic patterning. The symposium and accompanying contributed paper and poster\r\nsessions will provide a strong stimulus for integrative studies that link developmental\r\nbiology, genetics and functional morphology.\r\nIntellectual Merits: There is a wide gap between what is known about the activity of genes\r\nand their role in morphogenesis. Therefore, we perceive an urgent need to facilitate\r\ncommunication among geneticists, developmental biologists and morphologists. The symposium\r\nand associated activities (contributed paper and poster sessions) will provide important\r\nopportunities for scientists with these two approaches to learn how their different\r\nperspectives and methodologies can be used to broaden interpretations and generate more\r\nrobust and testable hypotheses that will shed light on the evolution of vertebrate\r\nstructure.\r\nBroader Impacts: The symposium and associated activities (contributed paper and poster\r\nsessions) will be held at the annual meeting of the Society for Integrative and\r\nComparative Biology, a well-established international meeting that attracts a broad\r\nspectrum of biologists who are interested in interdisciplinary approaches. Symposium\r\npapers will be published in Integrative and Comparative Biology.",
