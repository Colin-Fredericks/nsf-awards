 "awd_abstract_narration": "Massive quantities of new data are rapidly becoming available to researchers in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences, as more and more transactions are implemented and recorded in electronic form.  Through the development of novel statistical models and inference techniques, this project addresses the resultant urgent need for new, and principled, methods for exploratory data analysis and data mining specifically tailored to these emerging network economies.  In particular, robust techniques for identifying user preferences and behavior are key to the design and analysis of electronic marketplaces.  The adoption of a rigorous model-based approach to preference identification and behavior permits both uncertainty quantification as well as robustness to prior assumptions, and has the further advantage of making such assumptions explicit.  Indeed, the models to be developed in the course of this project will be motivated by, and tested on, three large-scale economic data sets: those for an online grocery store, an online video store, and an online auction marketplace.  The Bayesian paradigm for inference will in turn provide a natural approach to questions of model selection and parameter estimation by way of posterior sampling, typically realized by stochastic computation schemes.  Together these developments will form the basis for solving clustering and community detection problems arising from the study of important contemporary e-commerce data sets, of relevance both to the identification of substitutes and complements amongst a complex and multiattribute marketplace, as well as to classifying participants based on behavior.\r\n\r\nAs technology enables the collection of increasingly vast and diverse data sets relating to US economic and consumer infrastructure, automated methods of exploratory data analysis continue to grow in importance. Nowhere is this more readily apparent than in modern-day e-commerce networks, as more and more transactions are implemented and recorded in electronic form.  In such contexts, a quantitative understanding of consumer behavior and preferences is key to the analysis of electronic marketplaces.  Even more important, a better understanding of the aggregate structural properties of such e-commerce networks is essential in order to design better economic systems, for instance to streamline the user experience or improve pricing protocols and contract types in light of aggregate consumer information.  However, the mathematical and statistical models and methodologies presently available to address these issues lag significantly behind; existing techniques do not allow researchers or policy makers to ask and answer the new scientific and operational questions engendered by these diverse and novel data types.  The goal of this project is hence to develop a rigorous, unifying framework for the statistical modeling of data from network economies. Its focus is on the two critical questions of identifying common structure across user preferences and user behaviors, and the subsequent leverage of this knowledge in order to better design electronic market infrastructure.  In turn, the models to be developed will be motivated by, and tested on, three large-scale economic data sets reflecting some of the most important contemporary electronic markets in the United\r\nStates: those for a leading online grocery store, a popular online video store, and a well-known online auction marketplace.  In order to maximize the broader impact of this program, reproducibility of research results will be assured through the development of publicly available computer code for data analysis, and published work will be disseminated broadly across disciplines to researchers in computer science, mathematics, and the social, behavioral, and economic sciences.\r\n\r\n",
