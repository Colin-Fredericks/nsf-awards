 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is increasing the high technology workforce by providing opportunities for study to economically disadvantaged students. The project builds on successful activities of two Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship (CSEMS) grants. It provides twenty-five $4000 scholarships annually for up to four years starting in the 2007-2008 academic year. Recruiting efforts focus on students from a ten county mountain region surrounding the university, with an added emphasis on developing relationships with the growing Hispanic population. Incoming freshmen are recruited with assistance from the admissions office, high school counselors, and program scholars. Current students are recruited by faculty. Selection criteria are based on financial need and measures of academic potential like SAT scores and GPA. In addition, applicants submit letters of recommendation, a short essay describing career goals, and participate in a personal interview on campus. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: S-STEM scholars participate in activities designed to help them succeed including student organizations, study groups, departmental receptions, tutoring, internships, research, and conference participation. These opportunities prepare students to pursue graduate education. Weekly S-STEM seminar group and mentoring activities enhance the exchange of ideas and pursuit of knowledge by faculty and S-STEM scholars. Scholars participate in research with faculty and make presentations at conferences.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: Students participate in topical study groups, mentor relationships, and research with faculty and peers. The college is providing increased student support services for all computer science and math students. With support from the Computer Science Industry Advisory Board and Appalachian Career Development Center, scholars are positioned to take advantage of a variety of employment opportunities in the high technology workforce. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
