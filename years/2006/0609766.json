 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the development, analysis and \r\nimplementation of numerical methods for balance laws. The focus is\r\non systems which arise by averaging the multidimensional Euler\r\nequations of fluid dynamics. The averaging process produces\r\nsource terms that are inherently in nonconservation form, whose \r\npresence has major consequences for the theory as well as for\r\ncomputations of solutions. Computational difficulties include \r\nnonuniqueness of solutions, loss of strict hyperbolicity, lack of \r\nguiding principles in discretizing nonconservative products and  \r\ndifficulties to compute accurately near steady-state solutions. \r\nThe aim of this project is to understand, from a numerical view \r\npoint, how these various characteristics are interconnected, \r\nto identify numerical features that need to be respected\r\nand provide design principles which lead to simple and efficient\r\nnumerical schemes. This research program will be carried out by studying\r\na series of nonconservative models, and offer numerical frameworks within \r\nwhich the computational difficulties may be addressed:  (i) a \r\nrelaxation approach addressing the loss of hyperbolicity, and \r\ninaccessibility of eigenstructure; (ii) discrete averaging models, \r\ngiving accurate estimates on closure terms and providing unambiguous \r\napproximations for nonconservative products; (iii) hybrid algorithms \r\nfor two phase flows, which preserves the correct jump conditions across \r\ndiscontinuities in coefficients. As an application, the methods will be \r\nused to study two layer exchange flow between reservoirs, and extended\r\nto multilayer shallow water flows through a channel contraction. \r\nAnalytical predictions are available and will be used for validation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical equations of the type considered in this project are used to \r\nmodel a wide range of fluid flows. They are used to model large scale \r\natmospheric and oceanic flows over terrains, and to describe ground flows \r\nin porous media. They model river and coastal flows, dam breaks \r\nand flooding, such as the flow in the Rigolets strait connecting \r\nthe Gulf of Mexico and Lake Ponchartrain near New Orleans. They are used \r\nin hydraulics, to describe and control exchange flow between reservoirs. \r\nIn multiphase flows, they model the dynamics of droplet suspensions such \r\nas sprays in environmental applications, or cloud dynamics, which may be \r\nimportant in visibility military applications. Alongside experiments\r\nand theory, numerical simulations constitute a major tool of study in \r\nthese applications areas, and the issues addressed in this project are \r\nfundamental to their development. To date, numerical methods for balance \r\nlaws are still facing major challenges, and provide incomplete and \r\nunsatisfactory answers. The directions outlined in this project address \r\nthese challenges, they are original, they are new and they emphasize \r\ngeneral design principles that can be exported to other systems of \r\nsimilar structure. The completion of the proposed project is expected \r\nto have a significant impact on computational practices in these \r\ncommunities.\r\n",
