 "awd_abstract_narration": "12-13-07\r\n\r\nThis Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award supports the development of a novel nanomanufacturing technique, nanomilling, for creating three-dimensional shapes at the nano scale. The specific objectives of the project are (1) to develop the nanomilling technique and associated testbed, and (2) to assess the size, shape, and material capability of the technique by conducting experiments under varying operational conditions. The nanomilling technique is mechanical in nature, where the shape generation will be achieved by removing unwanted material. Nanomilling equipment will be designed and constructed, and nano-scale atomic force microscope probe tips will be used as tooling. The tip motion will be controlled with high precision to selectively remove the workpiece material to create various convex and concave shapes, such as slots, walls, and pockets. The educational objectives include involving graduate and undergraduate students in nanomanufacturing research and transferring the research findings to classroom by incorporating them into the PI?s new course titled ?micro/nano-manufacturing.?  The existing infrastructure of Carnegie Mellon University and Pittsburgh public schools will be utilized to attract high-school students and teachers to nanomanufacturing research. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the research will advance the field of nanotechnology by expanding current capabilities of nano-scale shape generation. The technique has po\u00adtential to overcome current limitations, and dramatically advancing current nanomanufacturing capa\u00adbility. Benefits of the nanomilling technique will include capability of creating arbitrary three-dimensional shapes, application to a diverse selection of materials, simplicity in design to nanomanufacturing, and capacity to be integrated into existing micro and nanomanufacturing techniques. Integration of the nanomilling process with other nanomanufacturing processes may also make it possible to find the best trade-off between the throughput and geometric capability. Furthermore, its low cost and simplicity will allow volumetric scale-up via parallel operation. The project will also contribute to the understanding of material characteristics and mechanics behavior at the nano scale. The developed technique will have an important impact on emerging fields of nano-fluidics, nano-electronics, nano-medicine, nano-electromechanical systems, and nano-robotics, thereby positively impacting the competitiveness of the U.S. in nanomanufacturing.",
