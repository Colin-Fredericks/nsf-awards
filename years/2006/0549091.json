 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award renews support for maintenance of a collection of prosimian primates housed at the Duke University Primate Center (DUPC). Study of the biology and behavior of Prosimians continues to be of the most active and exciting fields of primatology. The DUPC houses the largest and most diverse collection of prosimian primates in the world, including representative species from 6 of 7 extant families.  The approximately 250 animals include lemurs (of several types), sifakas, loris, bushbabys and aye-ayes.  These primates represent a major branch of primate evolution that diverged from the anthropoid branch about 60 million years ago.  The Center is recognized as the focal point for prosimian research and conservation activities outside Madagascar. As part of its research mission, the DUPC provides on-site access to animals, and ships tissues and blood samples to faculty and students from diverse local, regional, national, and foreign institutions for off-site use. Users are charged a fee scaled to the kind and quantity of usage. This award insures the continued availability of animals and tissues for use by outside researchers at relatively modest cost.  In addition to its involvement in enabling research, the Center conducts a variety of education and outreach efforts aimed at middle school, high school and college students, and allows public viewing of the animals.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis NSF award supported nearly 30% of the operating costs of the Duke Lemur Center (DLC).  The DLC houses the largest living collection of endangered primates in the world, comprising more than 230 animals from 20 species.  The vast majority of species are lemurs, unique to the island nation of Madagascar.  The intellectual merits of the DLC span a remarkable array of scientific disciplines, from conservation biology, to behavior and cognition, to physiology and genomics.  The DLC also serves as a model organization for studying primates within a \"do-no-harm\" framework.  Advances in the fields of genomics and nanotechnology are allowing scientists at the DLC to ask and answer increasingly sophisticated scientific questions, while simultaneously maintaining a healthy stress-free environment for the animals.  Within the last year of the project period alone, publications reporting data gathered at the DLC appeared in high-impact venues as wide ranging as the Wall Street Journal and Science magazine.\n\n \n\nThe broader impacts of the DLC are also very strong.  The Center considers its education mission to be of vital importance, both in the realms of scientific investigation and biodiversity conservation.  Each year, thousands of K-12 students visit the DLC, and hundreds of undergraduates from universities throughout the nation are involved with independent research, scientific outreach, or animal husbandry.  Increasingly, we are finding that students who are exposed to the Duke Lemur Center early in their lives are choosing to pursue educational opportunities and careers in science.  Indeed, many of the undergraduates currently involved with research at the DLC report that they are there due to early exposure to the Center as children.  The DLC thus serves as inspiration and education of the next generation of American scientists.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anne D Yoder"
