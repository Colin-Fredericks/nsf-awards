 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Divisions of Materials Research, Physics, and Mathematical Sciences.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: This project focuses on continued research on the exact study of the statistical \r\nmechanics of model systems.   The research concentrates on two areas:\r\n\r\n1) critical percolation in two dimensions, an important and very extensively\r\nstudied model system, to which we are bringing new and unexpected approaches, and\r\n\r\n2) the thermodynamics of the Farey fraction spin chain, a set of one\r\ndimensional models with interesting phase transition behavior and connections to\r\nmultifractals, and dynamical systems.\r\n\r\nThis project aims at new results and insights in both these areas.\r\nResearch on the Farey models illuminates an interesting borderline case in the\r\ntheory of phase transitions and has inspired several publications in number theory.\r\nThe percolation research has already led to some surprising features, especially the\r\napplicability of modular forms. Ongoing work aims at extending and deepening\r\nthese connections.\r\n\r\nAn important feature of the research is the relation to pure mathematics,\r\nincluding close collaboration with mathematicians. This has already led to some\r\nnew developments in number theory in both areas mentioned, and to synergistic\r\ndevelopments, where the number theory provides new tools to gain insight into\r\nphysical systems.\r\n\r\nWe employ a variety of theoretical methods including conformal field\r\ntheory, Monte Carlo simulations, mathematically exact solutions of model\r\nstatistical mechanical systems, and techniques from number theory. This research\r\nextends and develops the PI's program of basic research in statistical mechanics in\r\ntwo dimensions and related topics.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this project include the synergy with number theory\r\nalready mentioned, training of graduate students in these research areas, and\r\nimpacts on the PI's teaching methods. There is also ongoing significant spinoff on\r\na very practical level, involving instrumentation for mass spectrometers (and\r\nsimilar instruments). This has led, in particular, to the formation of Stillwater\r\nScientific Instruments, Inc. Our main role in this company exploits our familiarity\r\nwith conformal methods.\r\n\r\nNon-technical Abstract:\r\n\r\nIn this research funded by the Divisions of Materials Research, Physics, and Mathematical Sciences, the study of the behavior of particles and small magnets moving on surfaces will be connected to the study of pure numbers.  This connection between surface physics and pure mathematics provides a fertile area for the education of students and the discovery of unexpected mathematics and physics.\r\n \r\n\r\n",
