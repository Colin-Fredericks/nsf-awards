 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is a step towards better\r\nmathematical understanding of some aspects of Mirror Symmetry.\r\nMirror Symmetry predicts a natural correspondence\r\nbetween the moduli of deformations of a singular Calabi-Yau variety, on one\r\nhand, and the moduli of (Kahler structures on) resolutions\r\nof  the mirror dual  Calabi-Yau variety, on the other hand.\r\nHowever, there are plenty of examples of singular  Calabi-Yau varieties\r\nwhich have either no deformations or no resolutions at all,\r\nor both. In such cases, Mirrror Symmetry predicts the\r\nexistence of some sort of `noncommutative' substitutes for\r\nthe nonexistent commutative deformations, resp. resolutions,\r\nthat recovers the above mentioned duality between  deformations\r\nand  resolutions.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the proposal could be briefly formulated as follows.\r\n\r\n1. Generalize the techniques based on the notion of\r\nSymplectic reflection algebra introduced by P. Etingof and the PI during\r\nthe last 5 years to other classes of singular symplectic\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n2. Develop general machinery of noncommutative deformations\r\nof symplectic resolutions analogous to the theory of Poisson\r\ndeformations developed earlier by the PI and D. Kaledin.\r\n\r\n3. Begin development of the theory of Calabi-Yau algebras.\r\nThese  algebras should replace symplectic reflection algebras\r\nin the case of not necessarily symplectic  Calabi-Yau orbifolds.\r\n\r\nNoncommutative Geometry is a relatively new area of\r\nmathematics which arose in early 1980-s at the junction of\r\nclassical geometry and quantum theory. Classical geometry\r\nwhich was created in its modern form in the 19-th century, is a\r\nmathematical theory which is designed to describe precisely\r\nvarious phenomena of Space and Time. It plays a fundamental role\r\nin the equations governing electric and magnetic forces,\r\nand is even more fundamental for Einstein's Relativity theory.\r\n\r\n The discovery of the famous `Uncertainty Principle' had clearly\r\ndemonstrated that Classical geometry can\r\nnot adequately describe all of the complexity of Quantum theory.\r\nThe latter is one of the most important achievements of theoretical\r\nphysics of the 20-th century, which lies at the foundation of\r\nthis century's technological revolution, including\r\nlaser technology and computers.  It is a physical theory\r\nwhich allows to describe the behavior of very small objects, like\r\natoms and electrons. Noncommutative Geometry is a new kind of\r\ngeometry, that may also be called Quantum Geometry since it is\r\ndesigned to provide the adequate geometry at very small distances.\r\nDevelopment of  Noncommutative Geometry is thus absolutely\r\nfundamental for Quantum physics. The present proposal\r\nseeks to further develop this theory and to explore its\r\ninteractions with other areas of mathematics and physics,\r\nincluding quite unexpected connections to Probability theory.\r\n\r\n",
