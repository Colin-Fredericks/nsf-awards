 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum electrodynamics (QED), the Standard Model of electromagnetism and a basis of modern physics, has been enormously successful in predicting the properties of electrons in weak fields. In the strong field limit, however, precise tests are still pending. Measurements of binding energies for strongly bound electrons in atoms having a high nuclear charge and a comparison of these results with theoretical predictions are, therefore, critical tests of QED in intense fields. Such exotic atoms also offer opportunities to test few-body Coulomb calculations with extremely high accuracy.\r\nThis experimental research program is aimed to make a precise measurement of the 2s Lamb Shift, a critical parameter for tesing QED calculations, in hydrogen-like uranium as well as high-resolution measurements of the x-ray transitions between the excited states of helium-like uranium ions. The precision of the measurements will be less than 1 electron volt using a ten-fold improvement in energy resolution offered by the microcalorimeter developed by the PI. The measurements will be made at the heavy-ion storage ring, SIS/ESR, in Germany by a team consisting of the PI and undergraduate students working with him.  This program is co-funded by the Physics Division and the Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\n",
