 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe objective of this study is to develop the analytical models for the\r\ndynamics of ZnO nanowires, nanobelts and nanosheets. We will study\r\nboth the nonlinear single mode and the dual mode responses of these\r\nnanostructures subject to the electric field. These investigations will establish the\r\nlink between the single crystal structure of ZnO and the nonlinear dynamics\r\nbehavior of the nanostructures in nanowires, nanosheets and nanobelts. The study\r\nwill lead to an exploration at a later stage of a series of different nanostructure\r\noxides in different molecular structures for their behaviors in higher complexities,\r\nsuch as the coupled modal responses and chaotic synchronization. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: \r\nThe outcome of this research will push forward the sensor development in biochemistry and bioengineering, as well as for high precision instrumentation and field effect\r\ntransistors, among others.  Oxide-based nanostructures exist mostly in single crystal molecular structures. By a controlled growth mechanism, single-crystal semiconducting oxides in various forms of morphology have been synthesized, i.e. in the forms of\r\nnanowires, nanobelts, nanosheets and nanodiskettes as well as of nanorods. The\r\ndiverse properties of the oxides show promise as future sensors in the areas of\r\nhigh precision scanning probes, gas sensors, and drug delivery carriers, as well as\r\npiezoelectric sensors and actuators.\r\n\r\nWe will focus on the nonlinear dynamics of the single crystal nanowire,\r\nnanobelt and nanosheet subject to an electric field. A series of Nonlinear\r\nDynamics models will establish the quantified relations between the\r\nnanostructures and their dynamic behaviors under the applied field. These\r\nanalytical models for ZnO-based nanostructures will be used for sensor\r\ndevelopment and characterization.\r\n\r\n",
