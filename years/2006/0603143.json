 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Engineering Technology (58)\r\n\r\nEight multimedia-based problem-based learning (PBL) case studies and instructional resource materials are being created to complement the successful PHOTON curriculum previously funded by NSF.  The case studies actively engage the students in a genuine problem solving process.  High school and community college photonics technology instructors from 16 institutions are being recruited and trained to implement, assess, and evaluate the PBL case studies in their classrooms.  The project team is conducting research on the efficacy of the photonic case studies in engineering technician education.  Pedagogy experts are working with instructional designers to develop and test an approach to student assessment that will be integrated with the PBL problem scenarios.  Many of the alpha-testing school partners are in communities with large numbers of underrepresented groups.  Dissemination of the field tested case studies and the research findings through associations with industry, professional education and technology associations impact a broad audience.  Use of the PBL case studies in photonics technology curriculum assist in preparing a work force that can compete in a globally competitive work place.\r\n",
