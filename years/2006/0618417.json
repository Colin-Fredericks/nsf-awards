 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nPomona College will acquire new EDS microanalysis and nanometer pattern generation\r\nsystems to enhance the electron microscope facility at Pomona College. These\r\nsubsystems will be added to the college's field emission scanning electron microscope.\r\nThe EDS system consists of an X-ray detector, a pulse processor, and an analyzer used\r\nfor identification of elemental composition and mapping of specific elements with\r\nsubmicron resolution. The nanometer pattern generation system will allow the design and\r\ncreation of arbitrary patterns in polymers with features smaller than 50 nm with\r\nplacement accuracy less than 5 nm. We will upgrade the stage controller and In-Lens\r\nsecondary electron detector as well. The primary research projects will include\r\nnanostructure fabrication and characterization, combinatorial methods for materials\r\nresearch and performance optimization, and the exceptional fossil deposits from the\r\nperiod of the 'Cambrian Explosion'. In addition to this, faculty colleagues from across\r\nthe Claremont Colleges Consortium have expressed interest in adding these specific\r\ncapabilities for research programs in Biology, Chemistry, Engineering, Geology, and\r\nPhysics. We anticipate that curricular modifications of laboratory courses in Chemistry,\r\nGeology, and Physics will result in approximately half of all undergraduates enrolled at\r\nPomona College being exposed to this instrumentation. Additionally, each year several\r\nprograms bring large numbers of under-represented minority K-12 students and teachers\r\nto Pomona College. We will use this facility in outreach programs to inspire these\r\nstudents to consider a future in science.\r\n\r\nLay Abstract\r\n\r\nLarge numbers of our undergraduate students are already experiencing the wonders of\r\nelectron microscopy. This facility allows students to study carbon nanotubes,\r\nnanostructures of thin films, chemical sensors, chemical reactions, and crystal and rock\r\nstructures formed in a variety of geologic processes. The advantages of this technique\r\nover traditional microscopy are a substantial improvement in both magnification and\r\ndepth of focus in the images. Electron microscopes have played a key role in both the\r\nadvances in modern electronics, biology, materials science, and the development of\r\nnanotechnology. While our current microscope allows us to look at samples, the EDS\r\nsystem will allow us to identify the chemical elements in these samples. In other words,\r\nnot only will we be able to image the samples, but we will also know what they are made\r\nfrom. The nanometer pattern generation system converts the electron microscope from a\r\ntool for taking pictures to one that can draw tiny patterns that can be turned into\r\nelectronics, sensors, motors, tunnels, optical switches and filters. In this mode an\r\nelectron beam is focused to a fine point and scanned by a computer in two dimensions to\r\nwrite the patterns. The patterns are written in a special polymer resist film that can then\r\nbe developed to show the final patterns. These patterns can be transferred from the\r\npolymers to other materials by etching, plating, stamping, and many other techniques.",
