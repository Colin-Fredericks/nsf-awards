 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with investigations into the distribution\r\nof zeros of L-functions, prime numbers and divisors of integers.\r\nThe distribution of prime numbers and zeros of L-functions have long\r\nbeen known to be related, but some relations have only recently come\r\nto light.  Together with A. Zaharescu and K. Soundararajan, the\r\ninvestigator is exploring connections between fractional\r\nparts of imaginary parts of zeros of L-functions, counts of\r\nprime numbers in short intervals, and the pair correlation of zeros\r\nof L-functions.   A second area of study involves uncovering\r\nsubtle inequities in the distribution of numbers with exactly\r\nk prime factors (k>1) in arithmetic progressions, problems intimately\r\nconnected with the location of the zeros of Dirichlet L-functions.\r\nA focus of the research is examining differences between the\r\nthe behavior in arithmetic progressions of primes (k=1) and \"almost\r\nprimes\" (k>1).  Thirdly, the investigator will continue studying\r\nhow the divisors of \"typical\" and \"atypical\" integers are distributed.\r\nInvestigations into the probability theory underlying the study of\r\ndivisors will be a major theme.\r\n\r\nThe positive integers are perhaps the most basic objects in\r\nmathematics, and it is important to understand their multiplicative\r\nstructure - how they may be written as products, both of\r\nprime numbers and in general.  Questions about the distribution of\r\nintegers with a certain multiplicative structure, especially prime\r\nnumbers, are often very difficult and poorly understood.\r\nSeveral problems of this type are being investigated in this project, with\r\nparticular emphasis on the connections with the behavior of\r\nspecial functions called L-functions and with probability and\r\nstatistical theory.\r\n",
