 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on topics in the representation theory of p-adic groups\r\nin the context of Langlands program.\r\nIt concerns both the classical representations on complex vector spaces\r\nand p-adic representations. In the area of p-adic representations,\r\nthe investigator will work with Peter Schneider on problems in the theory of locally\r\nanalytic  and Banach space representations. This is a new research area, with lots\r\nof open problems. The theory of p-adic representations is totally different from\r\nthe classical theory of complex representations. In both theories, we can ask similar\r\nquestions, but the answers are often completely different. This research will contribute\r\nto the development of the theory of locally analytic and Banach space representations.\r\nThe research in the classical representation theory is motivated by Arthur's conjectures.\r\nThe investigator will work with Chris Jantzen on problems related to geometric R-groups\r\nand Arthur packets. In addition, she will study the effects of the Aubert involution on\r\nArthur parameters and Arthur packets. The local questions considered in the project appear\r\nin the consideration of local factors of terms of Arthur's trace formula. The obtained\r\ninformation will play a role in future arithmetic questions related to automorphic forms.\r\n\r\nLanglands program is a mathematical philosophy and area of mathematical research.\r\nIt originates in a series of conjectures formulated by Robert Langlands,\r\ndescribing deep and hidden connections between number theory, representation theory\r\nand automorphic forms. James Arthur's advanced research resulted in generalizations\r\nof Langlands' conjectures. After decades of mathematical research, it is amazing to see\r\nthat Langlands' conjectures turn out to be true in so many different situations.\r\nThe unifying principle of Langlands' conjectures is now investigated in a new area:\r\nthe theory of p-adic representations. The work of Schneider and Teitelbaum on locally\r\nanalytic and Banach space representations is one of the cornerstones of p-adic\r\nLanglands program. The problems in the representation theory investigated by this project\r\nare of importance for Langlands program.",
