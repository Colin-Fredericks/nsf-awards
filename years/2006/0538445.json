The program would support 8 to 12 Fellows each year to work in partnership with master teachers in the Boston, Dedham, and Milton public school districts to bring science to K-12 students. The program, known as Watershed-Integrated Sciences Partnership-2 (WISP-2) remains focused on individual partnerships between science Fellows and middle school teachers who work together to modify and implement high quality inquiry-based science instruction within the context of the local Neponset River Watershed. The watershed provides a common experiential framework for classes and field/laboratory modules covering fundamental concepts in life sciences, physical sciences and earth sciences. Partners also include the Environmental Business Council of New England and the Massachusetts Insight Education and Research Institute. \r\n",
