Qiu, Tennessee Technological University\r\n\r\nThis proposal focuses on a novel theory and testbed for high-data-rate ultrawideband (UWB) wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transceivers. The proposed system paradigm uses time-reversal with noncoherent detection as an alternative to coherent reception. It exploits the hostile, rich-multipath channel as part of the receiver chain.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThis research will be the first to investigate the time-reversal UWBMIMO from a unified, coherent view. The combination of statistical communication theory, time-domain transient electromagnetics and real-life prototyping will lead us to better understand the limits of nature. If the proposed project is successful, a new theoretical framework will be created and be systematically applied to various systems, including wireless, optical, acoustic, and seismic fields. This new theory has many resemblances to the corresponding narrowband MIMO theory, but in its peculiarly transient electromagnetic parts is incomparably richer, and more difficult than the narrowband MIMO that offers no analogies to the time-reversal based UWB MIMO.\r\n\r\nBroad Impacts: \r\nThe proposed system framework can potentially be a solution to the most pressing problem of how to reduce transceiver complexity in UWB community. The lowcost, low-power, high-data-rate transceivers will open a new range of wireless networking and services. The proposed research will potentially lead to revolutionary breakthrough in many branches. The immediate applications include all aspects of science and engineering such as the wireless industry, UWB radar and sensors, underwater acoustics, remote sensing, and image-guided therapy and surgery. The society will be benefited economically due to the technological advancement.\r\n\r\n",
