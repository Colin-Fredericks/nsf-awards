PI Bhat, University of Arkansas will visit Professors S. Ramaprabhu and V.D.Vankar of the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) in Chennai and Delhi to finalize a research and education initiative in nanotechnology.  There has been substantial interaction before face-to-face meetings take place to discuss the research programs at these institutions, assess the laboratory facilities and review nanotechnology course curriculum.  These leading institutions in India have active programs on applications of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in field emission devices, fuel cells and electrocatalysis.  The collaboration will leverage that expertise.   \r\n    \r\nScope: This project deals with an important scientific problem and will integrate research and education in nanotechnlogy.  The Indian researchers have the facilities and programs for developing cutting-edge applications for CNTs in critical engineering fields.  These resources complement Dr. Bhat's industrial R&D experience in chemical vapor deposition technology and his expertise in developing patented methods for use with advanced ceramic composites.  All investigators are motivated to develop an innovative education model that will attract talented students to nanotechnology.  The Division of Design and Manufacturing Innovation is providing cofunding for this award.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
