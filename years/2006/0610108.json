 "awd_abstract_narration": "0610108/0610003\r\nWildenschild/Schaap \r\nExisting analyses on thin film characteristics in porous domains are often built on two- or\r\nquasi-three dimensional geometrically simple pore structures without explicitly\r\naccommodating pore connectivity in the third dimension. More in-depth numerical and\r\nexperimental studies are needed to bridge the gap between two- and three dimensional\r\nexperimental analyses as well as the gap between three-dimensional numerical and\r\nexperimental analyses of pore-scale thin-film characteristics in granular porous media.\r\nHence, the proposed research, which builds on our ongoing pore-scale interfacial\r\nresearch, aims at integrating experimental and numerical analyses for better\r\nunderstanding of thin film characteristics and thermodynamics in three-dimensional\r\nporous media consisting of interconnected arbitrary rough-walled pore geometries.\r\nIn this 1-year extension proposal, we aim to develop a thermodynamically sound\r\nfree-energy-based multiphase lattice-Boltzmann model (that can handle fluids with highdensity\r\ncontrasts and implements thermodynamically-sound solid-fluid interactions). To\r\nobtain data for model verification, we will measure thin film characteristics related to\r\nfilm formation and distribution in a crushed volcanic tuff. This includes imaging water\r\ndistributions as they progress from adsorbed films to capillary held water with increasing\r\nvapor pressure. Based on the images it is possible to estimate the critical separation\r\ndistance at which capillary condensation takes place. The film characteristics will first be\r\nmeasured in geometrically simple two-dimensional flow channels using time-lapse digital\r\nmicroscopy, and subsequently using computerized microtomography (CMT) for more\r\ncomplex three-dimensional systems in crushed tuff samples. From the CMT images we\r\nwill determine the location and the extent of the capillary condensed regions to be used to\r\nvalidate new model developments.\r\nOnce the model is validated using the two-dimensional experimental data, the\r\nmodel will be used to simulate thin film formation and distributions in a threedimensional\r\nnatural porous medium with hydraulically connected arbitrary pore\r\ngeometries. Numerically simulated results on the geometry and extent of capillary\r\ncondensed zones will be compared to the microtomography data. The numerical model\r\nwill then be used to map the spatial distribution of variables that cannot be measured\r\nexperimentally such as fluid density, vapor pressure in thin films, interfacial width, and\r\nthree-dimensional curvatures, to subsequently calculate interfacial energies, surface\r\ntension, chemical potentials, and disjoining pressures.\r\nBroader Impacts of the proposed research:\r\nWe expect that the findings from the proposed research could have important\r\nwider impacts in diverse fields where processes relevant to the low saturation regime are\r\nof significance, including arid zone irrigation and water management, fate and transport\r\nof contaminants and colloidal particles in the vadose zone, nuclear waste disposal in very\r\ndry climates, enhanced oil recovery, and in planetary sciences. In addition, the project\r\nwill provide training for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a post-doc.\r\n\r\n",
