 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to enable rapid, parallel operation of distributed arrays of nanoelectromechanical systems. The approach is to simultaneously actuate arrays of nanomechanical resonators using a modulated laser source. The displacement of each array element is determined using a full-field optical interferometry system. The signal processing in this system is done optically, such that the phase modulation of an optical probe beam, induced through the resonator motion, is down-converted to a low-frequency intensity modulation and read out on a charge-coupled device. The intensity modulation measured at each pixel on the camera is directly proportional to the surface motion at the corresponding point on the sample surface, allowing for the acquisition of a displacement map of the devices. The investigators will fabricate large arrays of nanomechanical resonators, design and build a full field optical detection system, and demonstrate parallel operation of arrays using this device.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThis research addresses one of the most significant experimental challenges in the development of the next generation nanoelectromechanical systems: parallel operation. Parallel operation is crucial for future nanoelectromechanical systems based sensors, signal processors and computers. The approach will also represent a significant development in nanoscale optical metrology.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nIn addition, the investigators will develop a new \"Science Saturday\" program for local high schools, allowing students to get hands-on experience in nanoscale science and laser-based sensors. The investigators will also incorporate the research results into graduate level coursework through courses on Nanomechanics (actuation and sensing) and Experimental Techniques in Solid Mechanics (optical metrology).\r\n",
