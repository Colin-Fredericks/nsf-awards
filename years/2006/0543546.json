 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to obtain partial travel support for junior U.S. scientists to attend the biennial meeting of the International Society for Behavioral Ecology (ISBE) in Tours, France, to be held 23 - 28 July 2006.  The proposal will allow selected U.S. scientists to present their work, make contacts with others in their specific fields of interest, and facilitate the forging of international collaborative research efforts.  The proposal will encourage junior, less established U.S. scientists to attend this meeting, which takes place every two years and is the premier international forum for presenting work in the field of behavioral ecology. The selection committee will make a special effort to encourage applications by members of underrepresented groups. Behavioral ecology in general and the International Society for Behavioral Ecology in particular have been consistently effective at attracting women scientists, not only to the meetings themselves but also as officers in the society and as invited and plenary speakers.\r\n",
