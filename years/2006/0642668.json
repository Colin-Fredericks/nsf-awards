 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\n\r\nSpatial heterogeneity is an important organizing concept in ecology. However,\r\nstudies of ecological heterogeneity have often focused on small scale, wild, or\r\nuninhabited landscapes. As ecology turns increasing attention to urban areas,\r\nadditional aspects of heterogeneity must be better understood. New frameworks\r\nfor spatial heterogeneity are required to support new models of resilient urban\r\necosystems as coupled ecological, social, and built systems.\r\nBecause much of the spatial heterogeneity in urban systems is anthropogenic,\r\nthe urban design and ecology must be better linked. We propose a Cary\r\nConference to explore common frameworks for ecology and urban design. This\r\nwould be the 12th biennial Cary Conference at the Institute of Ecosystem\r\nStudies. These conferences are known as milestones in the development of\r\necology due to their synthetic, interdisciplinary, and fundamental nature.\r\nThe 2007 Cary Conference will advance the fundamental ecological theory and\r\nsynthesis of data on urban spatial heterogeneity, as well as articulate the theory\r\nand practice of urban design in an ecological context. For ecology, advances\r\nwould include 1) development of integrated frameworks for urban spatial\r\nheterogeneity, 2) better integration with social processes and the hazards\r\nassociated with infrastructural and designed components of urban systems, 3)\r\nexploration of new models of urban spatial heterogeneity; and 4) refinement of\r\necological models of urban systems. For the fields of urban design, advances\r\nwill include 1) summarizing contemporary ecological insights to support new\r\nstrategies for resilient urban design, and 2) understanding ecological functions of\r\nurban designs in their larger contexts. Utilization of insights from environmental\r\nhazard analysis and feedback from ecological urban design to social science will\r\nalso be explored.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThrough the building of professional networks, the publication of a crossdisciplinary\r\nbook, and the construction of a website on ecological urban design,\r\nthe Conference will promote the development of more ecologically motivated\r\ndesigns in cities, suburbs, and the urban fringe. It is crucial to make the best\r\ncontemporary ecology available to urban design. The growth of global and US\r\nurban population and land conversion confirms that urbanization is a pressing\r\nissue for the 21st century. This Conference will help incorporate contemporary\r\necological knowledge into design practice by 1) communicating ecological\r\nconcepts and principles to design theorists, educators, and practitioners, and 2)\r\ndemonstrating how basic ecological science can be applied in an urban setting.\r\nIn addition, encouraging an experimental aspect to design and development can\r\nencourage more ecological research in urban systems.",
