 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project consists of two parts: the first one is devoted to description\r\nof constructible sheaves on homogeneous spaces (mostly of the loop groups)\r\nin terms of coherent sheaves; the second one concerns with study of categories \r\nof coherent sheaves by the method of quantization in positive characteristic. \r\nThe first one is a continuation of our previous work inspired by the (local\r\nversion of) \"geometric Langlands duality\" conjecture of Beilinson and Drinfeld.\r\nThe second one is suggested by our work (with Mirkovic and Rumynin) on \r\ngeometric approach (especially, use of D-modules) in modular representation \r\ntheory. In some situations the two constructions lead to the same \r\n(t-)structures  on the category of coherent sheaves.\r\nThe results of the project are expected to yield a better understanding of \r\nthe nature of this intriguing  coincidence.\r\n\r\nFrom a formal point of view representation theory is a branch of algebra.\r\nHowever, many of its famous advances were due to discovery of connections to\r\nother disciplines such as differential or algebraic geometry, where geometric\r\nintuition can be applied. In a previous work we developed such geometric \r\nmethods for a branch of representation theory called modular representation\r\ntheory (where the role of numbers is played by residues of integers modulo a\r\n fixed prime number). One of the goals of the present project is to \"repay\r\nthe debt of algebra to geometry\" by applying ideas stemming from this\r\nwork to  questions in algebraic geometry. The geometric structures arising from\r\nsuch applications also appear in the study of some topological objects related\r\nto loop groups (whose definition is similar in spirit to constructions of \r\nphysists' String Theory). This miraculous coincidence has strong technical\r\nconsequences; we hope to get a better understanding of its nature as a result\r\nof the work on the project.\r\n",
