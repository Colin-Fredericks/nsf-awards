 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will provide an in-depth examination of how and when Sesotho-speaking children understand and use complex syntactic structures such as the passive (e.g. The ball was kicked by Chris). In so doing, it will provide critically needed cross-linguistic information about how children learn the structure of language.  The results will have a significant impact on our understanding of the constraints on language learning, and the extent to which this is influenced by both biological (maturational) and environmental (language-specific) factors.\r\n\r\nThe project has several broader impacts. First, it will serve as a stimulus for further research on little studied by genetically important languages, expanding the research database beyond English and other European languages.  Second, this data will be made available in the public domain. Third, this project will enhance international collaboration with the National University of Lesotho. Finally, underrepresented students will be provided with a range of educational, research and training opportunities in the fields of linguistics and cognitive science.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the International Office of Science and Engineering.",
