 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nMost of this proposal lies under the umbrella of a vast program proposed \r\nby Gromov: classify finitely generated groups by their quasi-isometric \r\ngeometry. One way to study the geometry of a group is via a space called \r\nthe asymptotic cone; in several important cases, interesting algebraic \r\nstructure of groups has been found encoded by the topology of their \r\nasymptotic cones. Through a study of asymptotic cones, the PI will work \r\ntowards understanding the geometry of several particular classes of \r\ngroups, including mapping class groups, relatively hyperbolic groups, and \r\nthree-manifold groups. In particular, the goal of the project is to \r\ndevelop new geometric invariants with an eye towards proving one of the \r\nmain geometric conjectures concerning mapping class groups, namely \r\nquasi-isometric rigidity. This conjecture asserts that no other groups \r\ngeometrically look like mapping class groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nGroups are an algebraic way of encoding the symmetries of a space. It \r\nturns out that an important class of groups (the finitely generated ones) \r\nare themselves associated with a certain geometric object. This object is \r\nbuilt by taking each symmetry to be a point and declaring the distance \r\nbetween a pair of points to be the number of simple symmetries one has to \r\napply to get from one to the other. In the study of finitely generated \r\ngroups, insight into their geometry can often be gained by looking at the \r\ngroup from ``infinitely far away'' -- this notion can be made \r\nmathematically precise and yields what is called an asymptotic cone of the \r\ngroup. The PI proposes certain ways to study groups from this asymptotic \r\nviewpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
