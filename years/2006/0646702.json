This meeting is the premier international Marine Biotechnology meeting and emphasizes the use of molecular approaches in studying the protection and enhancement of global marine resources.  It provides an opportunity for scientists from many countries to present the latest research findings from genomic, metagenomic and related studies on marine organisms.  This award will fund the attendance of US scientists and students.\r\n\r\nFunding to enable many US scientists and students to attend IMBC2007 will contribute to US research efforts remaining at the forefront of the rapidly advancing field of marine biotechnology. Priority is given to support of graduate student and postdoctoral associates, who will be funded at twice the level of more senior scientists.  Particular efforts are made to encourage participation from students in groups traditionally underrepresented in science.  This support will ensure attendance at IMBC2007 of many students and postdoctoral associates who would otherwise not be able to attend this meeting.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
