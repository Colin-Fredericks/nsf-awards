The eight week research program takes place in Costa Rica at the Las Cruces Biological Station, an important research station in the Neotropics and a major OTS center for hands-on training in field-oriented research.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the Native American and Pacific Islander program is to continue to provide an intensive field research experience for Native American and Pacific Islander undergraduate students.  The new program is structured around an eight-week stay in Costa Rica and Panama, during which the participants will conduct research at the OTS Las Cruces Biological Station, among other sites, and visit indigenous communities.  The focus of the program is the development of the students interest in biology and their capacity to conduct independent field research.  The program introduces participants to biodiversity, cultural diversity and community-based conservation issues of the tropics. \r\n\r\nThe NSF Louis Stokes Alliances for Participation (LS-AMP) program funded a successful pilot program of 15 students in 2005 under grant HRD 05-03308.      \r\n",
