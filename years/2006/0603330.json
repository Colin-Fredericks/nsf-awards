 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing an associate degree and professional certification program in Secure Logistics to provide students with the requisite knowledge and skills to be employable in the field of secure logistics and be prepared to work in a variety of business and industry settings to improve synchronization and security of the supply chain. This project targets the retraining of the incumbent worker in the transportation and secure logistics industry and supplies businesses in the local service area with training in new technologies to ensure an efficient and accurate transport of goods. The offering of both degree and a professional certification programs in secure logistics seeks to address immediate and future workforce needs while providing the means for continued education and career advancement in the field. \r\n\r\nThe project is:\r\n(1) Developing and piloting an Associate in Applied Sciences (AAS) degree in Secure Logistics and Supply Chain Management that addresses identified gaps in the education of transportation, logistics, and security industries. Working in conjunction with academic institutions, state agencies, national business partners, ports, and local businesses; the program provides a direct linkage between cutting edge technologies such as RFID and business supply chain methodologies. \r\n(2) Developing and piloting a professional certification program in Transportation and Secure Logistics that addresses the growing need for the training and further education of workers and managers at all levels of the supply chain. This certificate program encompasses training in the use of Geographic Information Systems/Global Positioning Systems (GIS/GPS) and IT as they relate to common carriers, global logistics, business, secure computing and telecommunications, and point-to-point tracking of goods. The certificate program serves the needs of employees with limited training time and provides for future growth through achievement of the AAS degree in Secure Logistics as the courses in the certificate program count towards the associate degree.\r\n(3) Developing a tiered professional certification program that builds on existing IT and wireless technology certification programs.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project is creating new educational opportunities for an emerging field responsive to pronounced local needs and educating incumbent workers in secure logistics and supply chain management. Led by a team of faculty and a strategically selected advisory committee with representatives from critical organizations such as Intel, Western Pacific Truck School, Western Pacific Trucking, Dell, U.S. Naval War College, Pierce College, Clark College, and the State of Washington Dept. of Transportation, the project is informed by industry and builds upon research literature and the work of others. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The engagement of industry is a direct response to employer and workforce demands. To promote diversity, recruitment efforts for training of new entrants into the industry are focused on minorities and underrepresented populations in the transportation and secure logistics field. The project serves as a nationwide model for other institutions with results disseminated through Transportation and Homeland Security programs of collaborating institutions and regional and national conferences.\r\n",
