Kane, Om Nalamasu\r\nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY\r\n\r\nThis proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 05-610, category NIRT.  The objective of the research is to explore a biologically inspired method for facilitating the separation of DNA.  The approach is to combine theory and experiment to design soft surfaces which actively reconfigure and/or reassemble in the presence of adsorbates.  Several fundamental and technological issues critical for the development of these novel separation methods will be investigated.  These include the development of nanostructured lipid surfaces, actively modulating the adsorption behavior of these surfaces, and testing the ability of these actively nanostructured surfaces to significantly enhance the separation of DNA. \r\n\r\nThe proposed work will contribute to the development of high resolution methodologies for biomolecule separations which will have a direct impact on the important fields of genomics and proteomics. These fields have well-defined societal impacts. In addition, these research activities will be coupled to a suite of education and outreach efforts which utilize the experience of the investigators in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The investigators will participate in the \"Molecularium\" project which aims to create planetarium style movies to excite and educate children of all ages about science; this effort has the potential for major impact since these animations can be screened on domes in planetariums and museums all over the country. Mentoring undergraduate and graduate researchers and participation in educational activities in K-12 schools in the New York City and the Albany metropolitan areas will be other important aspects of the work.\r\n\r\n",
