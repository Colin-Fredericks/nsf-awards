 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this study is to examine how a group of 200 low-income parents from New Orleans, all of whom registered for community college in 2004, have coped with the effects of Hurricane Katrina. The researchers will study how the pre-hurricane resources and capacities of individuals--defined to include their mental and physical health, social networks, and economic resources--affect their ability to successfully adjust to a major life trauma. The researchers will also examine the determinants of successful social and economic adjustment, including the re-establishment of social networks and resumption of employment and educational activities. Quantitative analyses will provide empirical evidence on the effects of the disaster on a vulnerable segment of the population. In-depth qualitative interviews will add richness to the quantitative work, and will provide a record of the experiences of the hurricane for the group being studied.\r\n\r\nThis research will be drawing on a rich base of data, which were collected shortly before Hurricane Katrina. As such, the researchers can study the pathways through which low initial levels of health, social, and economic resources might impact post-hurricane outcomes. Another advantage of this study is that the subjects are part of a randomized design intervention that provided some sample members with additional resources through a community-based program. By examining whether those in the intervention group experienced better outcomes, the researchers can assess whether the ability to cope in the aftermath of a disaster is modifiable through social programs. Additionally, the sample of low-income, primarily single, African-American parents (mostly mothers) is an especially relevant group to study. There was great deal of heterogeneity in the resources and capabilities of members of this group prior to the hurricane, making it possible to study how these resources and capabilities relate to their experiences of and adjustments after the hurricane.\r\n",
