 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) offer the promise of revolutionizing the way scientists observe the physical environment. Unfortunately, experience from the networks deployed to date has shown that planning and managing a sensor deployment is a great challenge requiring expertise in multiple areas of Computer Science. However, future sensor networks must be implemented by researchers in other disciplines.  For this to happen, the process of deploying and managing sensor networks should be radically simpler.\r\n\r\nIn this project we develop a set of network design tools. These tools use  site-specific  signal propagation models coupled with detailed physical layer radio models to calculate packet loss rates. Based on these estimates, the tools determine the location of additional relay points and gateways necessary to create a reliable network around the required measurement locations. Furthermore, we develop a network self-monitoring tool that correlates measurements taken by individual sensor nodes to construct a global view of the operational network. Information from the deployment is fed back to the network design tool. Through this coupling, incremental adjustments to the network layout are made until the network reaches the desired level of performance.\r\n\r\nUsing the tools developed by this project, sensor networks will become predictable and robust instruments, empowering scientists to observe phenomena that were previously out of reach. We are working with scientists at Johns Hopkins University as well as high school teachers to bring the results of this project to the broader academic and educational community.\r\n",
