 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Tenure System in Engineering\r\nRoli Varma\r\nUniversity of New Mexico\r\nThis proposal studies the importance of the tenure system in engineering in institutions of higher\r\neducation. The tenure system distinguishes the academy from other forms of professional work.\r\nHowever, the rapid reduction of tenure-track positions and the rise of part-time and non-tenure\r\ntrack positions has reduced the importance of the tenure system. Most importantly, the tenure\r\nsystem has become a controversial subject that passionately divides scholars between those who\r\nargue for maintaining the system and those who argue for eliminating it. The proposal focuses on\r\nengineering because it makes an interesting case study of the technical system and human values.\r\nThis is primarily a qualitative study based on in-depth interviews with 15+ subjects. This\r\nsample includes 10-12 engineering faculty who are tenured and on tenure-track, female and\r\nminority faculty, and faculty who are in their terminal year from one public university and one\r\nprivate university. The sample of tenured and on tenure-track faculty will be drawn randomly\r\nwhere as the sample of female and minority faculty and the faculty in their terminal year will be\r\nselected via snowball sampling method.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nEngineering is one of the best disciplines in which to illuminate the underlying roles of the\r\ntenure system that go beyond the traditional justification of academic freedom. Engineering, as a\r\ntechnical field, is unlikely to investigate those problems that result in deep-rooted prejudice and\r\nintense emotional reaction for which tenure has been justified. Yet engineering design is a\r\ndecision-making process in which technical knowledge is applied to convert resources into a\r\nsocially required product. Engineering design implies some understanding of the structure of\r\nsociety, social organizations, work environment, peoples safety, and protection of the\r\nenvironment. Furthermore, engineering deals with technologies that have profoundly\r\ntransformed society since World War II. Most importantly, engineering faculty increasingly\r\ncollaborate with industry which undermines the traditional notion of academic autonomy. In\r\nother words, engineering is not really value neutral as proclaimed. An investigation into\r\nwhether engineering faculty involved in social and political questions relevant to the university\r\nface challenges during the tenure process, whether the engineering faculty with industry s links\r\nhave a competitive edge in securing tenure, and whether women and minorities face additional\r\nhardship in tenure promotion in engineering, will show the underlying relationship between\r\ntechnical and social systems.\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThis is a pilot study; findings from this study will result in a full proposal to the NSF on August\r\n1, 2006. In probing the importance of tenure to academic personnel, it is likely to illuminate\r\nstructures of status and opportunity in academia. It will also show the ways in which the\r\nsupposed political neutrality of engineering is constructed despite patently social and political\r\nviews held by engineering faculty. It will provide data for social scientists concerned with social\r\nequity. This project also has great potential to contribute to undergraduate teaching; the findings\r\ncan be incorporated in future teaching. It is especially important because engineering students are\r\nin great need of understanding the social and political dimensions of their own curricular and\r\ndisciplinary worlds.",
