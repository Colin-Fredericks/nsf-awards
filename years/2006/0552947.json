 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Arkansas for the summers of 2006-2008. The program director is David Paul who is assisted by co-PI Donald Bobbitt. Nine students each year will do research in chemistry (analytical, inorganic, materials, organic and physical) and biochemistry.  The participants will be integrated into nine different research groups and activities are planned to promote student independence and to develop professional skills and judgment. A key facet of this development will be the opportunity given each participant to present his/her research at a meeting within the department, and to write up a summary of their work in a journal format that will be compiled for distribution to their home institution. In addition, funds are committed to allow each student to attend a regional or national chemistry or biochemistry oriented meeting in the year following their participation in the REU program. Since the thrust of the program is to include students from institutions with limited opportunities for research, \"hands-on\" exposure to many state-of-the-art instrumental techniques is available to the participants. Thus the participants will be provided an experience which will not only enable them to obtain a realistic view of modern chemical research, but they will be exposed to an environment indicative of that to be expected in graduate school. The focus of this program is undergraduate students from institutions with limited opportunities for research in the 8-state region. Special efforts will be made to recruit women and minority groups traditionally underrepresented among professional chemists.",
