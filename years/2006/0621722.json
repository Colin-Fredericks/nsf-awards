 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is the development of a novel solder technology for future semiconductor packaging applications.  The approach involves the development of fused metallic nanoparticle technology as a \"solder\" material.  This technology will achieve dramatic improvements in electrical performance, reliability, and environmental compatibility over conventional solders by exploiting the low melting temperature of metallic nanoparticles.  This in turn should allow the continued scaling and evolution of microelectronics technology.  \r\nChallenges for conventional solder technology are extreme.  Environmental regulations have resulted in a move away from lead-based solders.  There has also been a move towards polymer-based packages, placing constraints on peak processing temperatures.  Increased chip densities have also resulted in the need for unprecedented I/O pin densities.  The novel solder technology pursued in this proposal specifically addresses these needs through efforts in nanoparticle synthesis, development of printable nanoparticle inks for use as solders, and characterization of electrical properties and reliability of nanoparticle solder joins.\r\nThis proposal is technically important since it will contribute to the development of a viable solder technology for future generations of semiconductor packaging technology.  With the continued deployment of low-cost, portable, system-in-package consumer appliances, the need for dramatic improvements in packaging technology are tremendous.  Broader impacts of this proposal include mentorship of undergraduates in research, outreach to high-school students to facilitate their retention in science and engineering, and outreach to underrepresented minority groups through recruiting activities at historically black colleges and universities, with the goal of attracting underrepresented minority students into engineering research.\r\n",
