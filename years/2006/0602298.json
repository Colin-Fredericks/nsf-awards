One \r\ndirection is the basic problem of classifying homotopically equivalent \r\nmanifolds up to homeomorphism. Surgery theory was developed  for this \r\npurpose. But in order to make this theory effective for manifolds with a \r\ngiven fundamental group, it is necessary to calculate the algebraic L- and \r\nK-groups of its its integral group ring which occur in the surgery exact \r\nsequence. Direct algebraic methods have generally proven\r\nunsuccessful for this. The case of finite fundamental groups being a major \r\nexception. The techniques to be used instead will come from differential \r\ngeometry, controlled topology, dynamical systems and Lie group theory. The \r\nresults obtained so far using these methods have been quite encouraging. The \r\nsecond direction of the project is to find applications of these manifold \r\nclassification results to geometry. One area that looks promising is to \r\nunderstand the topology of the space of all negatively curved Riemannian \r\nmetrics on a smooth manifold and its quotient moduli space. There is the \r\nrelated following question. If one smooth structure on a closed manifold \r\nsupports a negatively curved Riemannian metric, then does every other smooth \r\nstructure support such a metric? And a possible application to affine \r\ngeometry is to the problem of whether homeomorphic complete closed affine \r\nflat manifolds are necessarily diffeomorphic.\r\n    Manifolds are geometric objects which locally resemble the space of \r\nEuclidean geometry but are usually quite different globally. For example the \r\nsurface of the sphere locally resembles the plane; but is only finite in \r\nextent. Being finite in extent is what is meant by a closed manifold. A \r\nsmooth manifold is one without corners or edges. For example the surface of \r\nthe sphere is smooth but the surface of a cube, although a manifold, is not \r\nsmooth. However these two manifolds are homeomorphic; i.e. it is easy to \r\nconstruct a continuously varying bijective correspondence between the points \r\nof these two surfaces. When the distance between points on a manifold is also \r\nconsidered, we are now talking about Riemannian manifolds and distance \r\npreserving correspondences are called isometries. For example the egg and the \r\nball represent two different positively curved Riemannian metrics on the \r\nsurface of the sphere. And these two metrics even represent different points \r\nin the moduli space of such metrics since the ball is uniformly round while \r\nthe egg is not. However if only the notion of straight line is being \r\nconsidered (i.e. geodesic ) we are talking about affine manifolds and affine \r\nequivalences. Distance preserving correspondences take straight lines to \r\nstraight lines but not necessarily vice versa.\r\n",
