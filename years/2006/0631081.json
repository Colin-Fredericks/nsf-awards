 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ohio University will design and build two sets of trigger\r\nscintillators for the Qweak experiment at Jefferson Lab. This\r\nimportant new experiment will measure the weak charge of the proton,\r\nas a precision test of the running of the weak mixing angle, thus\r\nproviding a uniquely sensitive probe of physics beyond the Standard\r\nModel of particle physics.\r\n \r\n   The trigger scintillators are an essential component of the Qweak\r\nparticle tracking system, and will be used to start the electronics\r\nand to veto neutral particles during the calibration and background\r\nmeasurements.  Each scintillator will be 225 cm x 16 cm x 1 cm and\r\nmade from BC408 or its equivalent.  Non-UVT lightguides at each end\r\nwill provide a mechanically reliable optical coupling joint.  UVT rods\r\nthat are 5.1 cm in diameter and 5 cm long will couple the rectangular\r\nlightguide to the photomultiplier tubes. The long edges of the\r\nscintillators will be diamond milled and the ends finished to a 600\r\ngrit sanded finish.  Given the extreme ratio of thickness to length,\r\nthe scintillator counters must be supported by a frame which is then\r\nmountable to the rear chamber package.  To reduce radiation damage,\r\nthis package will be removed from direct view of the beam for the high\r\ncurrent running mode.\r\n\r\n   The assembly and testing of the detectors will be done at the Ohio\r\nUniversity Institute for Nuclear and Particle Physics by a graduate\r\nstudent and at least one undergraduate student, under the supervision\r\nof Professor Opper.  The Ohio University group will also develop the \r\nfast triggering system which is required for this experiment.  \r\nWhen the detectors have been deemed ready for installation, the \r\nstudents will participate in their commissioning at Jefferson Lab.\r\n",
