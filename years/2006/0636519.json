Win, MIT\r\n\r\nWe propose a hybrid satellite/terrestrial system for seamless localization and communication, in which satellite links serve as a backbone for communication, while GPS provides positioning references for the terrestrial anchor nodes. UWB transmission between terrestrial nodes (anchors and GPS-denied agents) enables accurate localization and robust wireless communication in situations where narrowband techniques may fail. The combination of these technologies in a hybrid network will extend the localization and communication capabilities beyond the boundaries of current systems.\r\n\r\nResearch\r\nThis project aims to develop basic research in support of seamless location-awareness and communication for large, dynamic networks. To achieve this objective, we will: \r\n.\tformulate an analytical framework for cooperative localization;\r\n.\tdevelop localization algorithms suitable for dynamically changing networks; \r\n.\tdetermine optimal anchor node placement strategies under different constraints; and \r\n.\tinvestigate optimum combining methods for anchor and satellite relay diversity. \r\n\r\nEducation \r\nPrimary educational goals are to integrate research results into graduate coursework and to further develop the multidisciplinary laboratory at MIT. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis research will enable the design and analysis of efficient distributed algorithms for cooperative UWB technologies, optimal anchor placement, and satellite relay diversity techniques. It will additionally provide novel methodologies for the fundamental understanding of hybrid satellite/terrestrial networks.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis research will facilitate new technologies for future wireless networks. The framework and methodologies will be integrated into standardization efforts, teaching materials, and textbooks. This project will create a cadre of engineers, including women and minorities, who will help develop and operate future hybrid systems.\r\n",
