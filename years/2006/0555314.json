In these studies, the Principal Investigator and his group at the Pennsylvania State University seek to model and exploit the special properties of cluster beams (enhanced sensitivity to higher molecular weight molecules and reduced accumulation of chemical damage during ion beam etching, compared with atomic primary particles).  Specifically, they plan to use C60+ primary projectiles for molecular depth profiling experiments, thereby extending previous 2-dimensional sub-micron resolution imaging to provide 3-D analysis of materials with complex molecular architectures.  \r\n\r\nPotential applications of the work of Professor Winograd and his coworkers include analysis of organic semiconductors and laminar polymers.  Fundamental insights are to be derived through the interplay of experimental measurements and molecular mechanics modeling.  Models will be tested for their ability to predict parameter optimization, experimental profiles of ion emission energies and angles, and erosion during depth profiling using thin films of peptide-doped trehalose glass or amorphous ice deposited on a metallic substrate.  Results from these studies will impact such diverse fields as mass spectrometry, polymer science, astrophysics, drug discovery, geology, and chemical imaging.  The work will provide a unique learning experience for a large, diverse, and interacting group of graduate students, postdocs, and visiting scientists.\r\n",
