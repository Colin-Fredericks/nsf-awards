 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant provides funding for the acquisition of a sputtering system to enhance micro/nanotechnology research, training, and education at Louisiana Tech University, and to allow the neighboring institutions and users in north Louisiana and the region to have access to this instrument for research, educational, and industrial needs.  The new sputtering system will be located at Louisiana Tech's Institute for Micromanufacturing.  The Institute is dedicated to micro/nano scale systems research, education, and commercialization. It provides its faculty and external partners and users with micro/nanomanufacturing resources for the development of micro/nano systems for biomedical, chemical, information technology, and other applications. \r\n\r\nA wide range of research and development efforts will benefit from the new sputtering system, ranging from projects on the realization of miniaturized sensing systems for industrial and homeland security applications, to projects on the implementation of alternative energy systems for use in many consumer products.  Moreover, the new sputtering system coupled with the existing resources at the Institute for Micromanufacturing will make it possible for Louisiana Tech University and its collaborating partners to promote micro/nanotechnology research and education in a historically disadvantaged region of the nation. Planned educational efforts include teaching sputtering theory and practice in courses on micro/nanosystems development. Furthermore, the new sputtering system will positively impact economic development and industrial needs of north Louisiana and the surrounding region, and will contribute to maintaining the momentum realized in Louisiana over the past several years in the area of high tech research and education.",
