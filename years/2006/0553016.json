Vanderby\r\n\r\n\tIf a weight is hung on an elastic material  such as a steel spring, it stretches and remains at that deformed length. When the weight is removed, it immediately recovers its original length.  If the same weight is hung on a viscoelastic material, it stretches initially, but continues to stretch over time.  When the weight is removed, some of the stretch is immediately recovered and some is recovered gradually with time. If damaged in the stretch, then it will never recover its original length.  Ligaments are viscoelastic.  They stretch  during physical activity and recover during periods of rest.  Tissue stretch and recovery is fundamental to its function but not yet well understood. The objective is to  experimentally characterize the mechanical behavior of ligaments, both during loading and recovery. This study will include forces that are below and above the threshold of damage.  Experimental data will be analyzed with mathematical models. \r\n\tStretches which produce damage (sprains) can weaken the tissue and put joints at risk for pain and osteoarthritis. Results will be used to guide the best routines for stretching exercises for athletics and rehabilitation, and to provide a framework for the design of artificial ligaments. Results will also be incorporated in the bio-mechanics classes taught by the co-principal investigators and in our popular web site. This grant will train two graduate students for careers in biomedical research. New findings will be presented at conferences and in journal papers. \r\n\r\n",
