A malware detector classifies a program as malware or\r\nbenign. Malware writers continuously test the limitations of malware\r\ndetectors in an attempt to discover techniques to evade\r\ndetection. This leads to an arms race, where malware writers find new\r\nways to create malware that are undetected by commercial malware\r\ndetectors, and where researchers working on malware detection respond\r\nby devising new detection techniques. Attackers create new malware\r\nusing two main approaches: program obfuscation and evolution. There is\r\nstrong evidence that malware writers are using obfuscation and\r\nevolution because the number of new malware families is growing at a\r\nmuch slower rate than the number of malware instances. For example,\r\naccording to Symantec threat reports, in the first half of 2005 there\r\nwere 10,866 new virus and worm variants but only 170 new families of\r\nmalware. This data also indicates that signature-based techniques for\r\nmalware detection will not be able to cope with the increase in the\r\nnumber of malware instances. Recent results by one of the PIs also\r\nsuggests that current commercial malware detectors are not resilient\r\nto obfuscation and evolution techniques used by malware writers. All\r\nthis evidence clearly suggests that we need a new approach to malware\r\ndetection.\r\n\r\nWe propose to explore behavior-based malware detection: our algorithm\r\nfocuses on detecting malicious behavior (such as mass-mailing behavior\r\nused by certain worms) rather than searching for syntactic\r\npatterns. We specify malicious behavior in a formal language and then\r\nperform static analysis on the code to determine whether it contains\r\nthe specified behavior. Prior work by the investigators demonstrated\r\nthat this behavior-based malware detector can detect families of\r\nmalware using a single specification. However, there are challenges\r\nthat need to be addressed in the context of behavior-based malware\r\ndetection. We propose tasks to address these challenges.  Solutions to\r\nthe proposed tasks will lead to malware detection techniques that will\r\nresist evasion techniques used by malware writers better than existing\r\nmalware detectors. Behavior-based malware detectors can also detect\r\nnew malware that are variants of old malware..  \r\n",
