 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"A Museum-based After-School Program Examining Amphibian Ecology\" is a partnership between Dr. David Skelly's research lab and the Peabody Museum at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. The program will engage 20 middle and 20 high school students from under-represented groups in the New Haven Public Schools in an experiential program focused on science literacy, STEM career awareness and college preparation.  The program is based on Dr. Skelly's work on the meta-community dynamics of amphibians and their predators and the scale up from local dynamics to larger spatial scales.  This program combines an environment-based research program with an established youth program called \"Evolutions.\"  Participants conduct hands-on research activities at Dr. Skelly's Connecticut research site, develop a traveling museum exhibition, host an ecology seminar series, present their work at local schools and produce their own science pod casts.  The work of the young people will reach a wider local audience numbering in the thousands with the museum exhibits pod casts and elementary school outreach programs.  The project will result in a program tool kit including strategies for setting up these types of partnerships, how to engage families and how to administer the program.\r\n\r\n",
