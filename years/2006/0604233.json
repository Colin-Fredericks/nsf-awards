 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Shareshian works on problems in algebraic, topological and\r\nenumerative combinatorics that have close connections with other areas of\r\nmathematics.  Alone, in joint work with Michelle Wachs and in additional\r\njoint work with Philip Hanlon and Patricia Hersh, he studies group actions\r\non homology of order complexes of various partially ordered sets, with\r\napplications to permutation enumeration and representation theory of\r\nsymmetric groups and finite groups of Lie type.  In joint work with David\r\nWright, he studies certain vector spaces with bases indexed by finite\r\ntrees, which arise in the study of the Jacobian Conjecture.\r\n\r\nThis grant supports work in the area of combinatorics.  Roughly,\r\ncombinatorics is the study of discrete, usually finite, mathematical\r\nobjects.  Combinatorial problems arise naturally in various scientific\r\ndisciplines, including biology, computer science and electrical\r\nengineering, and in most areas of pure mathematics.  Most of the work\r\nspecifically supported by this grant involves the study of symmetries of\r\npartially ordered sets.  A partially ordered set is a set in which some\r\n(but not necessarily all) pairs a,b of elements are related in a manner\r\nthat mimics the relation a<b on the set of real numbers.  (For example,\r\nif a,b are related and b,c are related then a,c must be related.)  A\r\nsymmetry of a partially ordered set is a rearrangement of the set which\r\nsends related pairs to related pairs.  (For example, if we take the set of\r\nall real numbers with the usual < relation, then the rearrangement\r\nobtained by sending each number x to x+1 is a symmetry, while the\r\nrearrangement obtained by sending x to -x is not.)  Partially\r\nordered sets and their symmetries are of interest to mathematicians\r\nworking in several areas of pure mathematics, including topology and\r\nalgebra.  They have been used to attack difficult problems in theoretical\r\ncomputer science.\r\n",
