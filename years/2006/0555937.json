 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes Constrained Geometric Morphing (COGEM) as a novel generic mechanical design framework that will allow intuitive geometric modifications of arbitrarily complex baseline designs via shape morphing (deformation) procedures while preserving key prescribed geometric parameters. The goal of the project is to provide new theoretical and computational foundations for COGEM to enable intuitive and efficient geometric modifications of existing baseline designs to satisfy new functional requirements. The anticipated approach will lead to formal foundations for the geometric design of product families of complex mechanical systems, and will be supported by the development of computational algorithms. More broadly, the fact that every parametric update can be expressed in terms of a sequence of shape deformations implies that constrained shape deformation can be thought of as a generalization of parametric design, and could potentially lead to the emergence of a new discipline. The proposed research will enable students to quickly explore the design spaces above and beyond the current capabilities of parametric solid modeling technology. At the same time, the integration of geometric reasoning and algorithmic design into the engineering curriculum will help develop a new generation of engineers that will be able to exploit the potential of modern computer aided design technology in conjunction with traditional mechanical engineering expertise.",
