 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project  is devoted to  mathematical   problems arising from quantum physics, in particular from  the study of forces between the fundamental constituents of matter. The  fields of interest for this project  include Yang-Mills fields, which mediate   interaction between fundamental particles of nature. These fields are modeled mathematically by the geometric notion of connections. These  are fundamental to the study of both gravitation and the   interactions of elementary particles of nature. The quantum behavior  of such fields is described mathematically in terms of    functional integrals.  Investigations, begun in large part through the work of G. \"t Hooft in the early 1970s, have  found a wealth of deeper structures and ideas in the behavior of such integrals   when the physical field's symmetry size, described by a number N, is large. One direction being proposed in the project is the development of a mathematically complete description of this large-N 'master field.' An area known as free probability theory is expected to play a central role here. Other directions, involving generally the same areas of mathematics, will also be pursued.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to discover new mathematical results and structures, such as a generalized geometry arising from the limiting large-N theory, which are inspired by physical theories. The mathematical contexts range from differential geometry to stochastics and large random matrices.  The research work on this project is expected to have a positive impact on graduate and undergraduate education through seminars and lectures to be arranged in the course of the project. The   project would involve international research collaboration. In a   broader intellectual plane, the project would produce a  fruitful combination of ideas from the frontiers of physics and mathematics.\r\n",
