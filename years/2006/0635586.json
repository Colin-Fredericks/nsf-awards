The symposium is titled: Synthesis and Structure-Property Relationships in New Inorganic Materials, and topics will include nonlinear optical materials, fuel cells, oxide nanoparticles, and perovskite oxides. The full-day session will involve mostly early career faculty, with the involvement of graduate students and post-doctoral associates being highly encouraged.\r\n\r\nNon-technical Abstract\r\n\r\nThe symposium will provide faculty, specifically younger faculty, with an opportunity to discuss their research. Additionally, these early career scientists will be able to interact with established researchers in the solid-state chemistry and materials research community. Collaborations will be enhanced, as scientists from different, but related, disciplines are able to interact. Most importantly, knowledge and discovery in critical areas of solid-state chemistry will be advanced, and the solid-state materials community will be informed of pressing research challenges.\r\n\r\n",
