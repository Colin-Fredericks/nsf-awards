 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe research is focused on the representation theory of quantum\r\n\r\ngroups at roots of 1, on invariants of 3-manifolds with flat\r\n\r\nconnections, and on some aspects of statistical mechanics. Quantum\r\n\r\ngroups emerged from the study of integrable models in quantum\r\n\r\nfield theory. These models though quite simplistic relative to\r\n\r\ntheir realistic counterparts, exhibit properties which are hard to\r\n\r\nstudy using conventional methods. Another class of simplistic but\r\n\r\nextremely interesting quantum field theories are topological\r\n\r\nquantum field theories. In these theories the \"dynamics\" is absent\r\n\r\nand all they \"know\" in the topology of the \"underlying\r\n\r\nspace-time\". The theories provided new topological invariants.\r\n\r\n\"Physical\" formulation involves integration over the infinite\r\n\r\ndimensional space of connections, mathematical formulation\r\n\r\ninvolves representations of quantum groups. One of the major\r\n\r\ndirections of the project is to reconcile two approaches. Another\r\n\r\ndirection of research is related to random discrete surfaces and\r\n\r\nrelated structures such as random partition, random tilings of a\r\n\r\nplane, random spanning trees on a planar graph etc. Some of the\r\n\r\nquestions in this direction are closely related to the limit when a\r\n\r\ntopological quantum field theory known as Chern-Simons theory\r\n\r\nturns into a topological string theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart of the project is focused on the\r\n\r\nstudy of quantum groups at roots of unity. The goal is to\r\n\r\ninvestigate the category of generic modules as a monoidal category\r\n\r\nfibered over the corresponding group, and when it is the case, as\r\n\r\nas a braided monoidal category fibered over a braided group. The\r\n\r\nresults will be applied to construct and study invariants of\r\n\r\n3-manifolds with flat connections. This direction is closely\r\n\r\nrelated to the possible relation between the A-polynomial and\r\n\r\nJones invariant of knots, which was discussed in the literature in\r\n\r\nthe last few years. The research will also be focused on dimer\r\n\r\nmodels and on related models in statistical mechanics. For\r\n\r\nexample, the limit shapes for the 6-vertex model may have singular\r\n\r\nboundaries, and one of the goals is to study the fluctuations such\r\n\r\nsingularities.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
