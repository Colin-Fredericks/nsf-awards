 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Mechanical (56)\r\n\r\nThis CCLI Phase 1 Exploratory Project is introducing multi-scale engineering concepts including nanotechnology into undergraduate engineering mechanics curriculum through new modules, examples, and small-scaled problems. Molecular dynamics, finite element method, and computer aided design and drafting are being used to help students visualize the behavior of nanoscale materials. Learner-centered pedagogy is allowing a deeper understanding of the unique scientific rules governing engineering mechanics and analysis at this scale. Formative assessment is being used to evaluate options at each stage of implementation, considering guidelines from ABET and the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE). An Industrial Advisory Board is helping with the formative assessment. An external evaluator is conducting the summative assessment of the project. The project is being disseminated through a supplementary textbook, a website, and faculty development workshops and is broadening the participation of an under-represented group, Native Americans in Engineering. Students are developing an assortment of problem-solving tools that they can use throughout their professional careers.",
