 "awd_abstract_narration": "Luther College is engaged in the study of heavy Quarkonia at the CLEO-c experiment at the Cornell CESR Laboratory.  Heavy quarkonium systems - charmonium, the system of bound states of the charm quark and its antiquark, and bottomonium, the analogous system in the bottom quark sector - are generally regarded as an important testing ground for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the quantum theory of strong interactions, and Lattice QCD calculations.   One of the central aims of this proposal is to observe the lowest lying singlet states of bottomonium- those states in which the quark and antiquark spins are oppositely aligned. These states have not yet been observed experimentally, and as a result, there is no knowledge of the important spin-spin interaction in bottomonium. In charmonium, the low-lying singlet states have been observed, but their mass measurements need improvement in order to provide stringent tests for theory.   The proposed measurements have a potential impact beyond the immediate context of strong-interaction physics and quarkonium spectra, by helping to provide input for tests of the Standard Model that are being pursued experimentally at the B-factories and elsewhere. To bring a particle physics research effort to a small undergraduate institution like Luther College is rare indeed, and the proposed effort will serve to strengthen the Departments research portfolio and make available more opportunities for research work to undergraduate students in significant numbers.",
