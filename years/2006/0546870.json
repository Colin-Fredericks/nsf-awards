 "awd_abstract_narration": "In her research plan, the principal investigator (PI) proposes to carry out integrated research on multimedia coding, content delivery, and security for media streaming on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks.\r\n\r\nMedia streaming on IP networks has been constrained by limited bandwidth, large and variant end-to-end delay, and poor playback quality. The advent of P2P networks brought new opportunities (e.g., more bandwidth from participating peers and lower delay because of path diversity) and new challenges (e.g., security risk) for media streaming. This project aims to realize the full potential of P2P networks in media streaming by exploiting the interaction of multimedia coding, the structure of coded bit stream, overlay network architecture, and transmission strategies.\r\n\r\nSecurity issues associated with P2P networks imply that we need to provide security services (e.g., cryptography and authentication) for media streaming on such networks. However, security and QoS sometimes raise conflicting requirements. In this project, the PI will thoroughly study their relationship and tradeoff, and investigate how to leverage P2P network architecture to ease the tension between security and QoS requirements.\r\n\r\nIn her education plan, the PI endeavors to broaden the scope and improve the quality of education by integrating the latest research developments into instructional activities. The plan consists of three components: 1) exploiting ties with local industry and research labs to keep students up-to-date with new technologies and innovations; 2) enhancing both undergraduate and graduate courses in networking through curriculum development; and 3) involving students from underrepresented groups in research projects.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. The PIs research plan will lead to media streaming applications with improved QoS and better protection from malicious attacks. While previous work inspected individual aspects on P2P media streaming architecture, media delivery, and content protection, the proposed research tasks in this project study QoS and security issues in an integrated fashion, exploiting new developments in the networking, signal processing, and security communities. The PI believes that this integrated approach is more likely to advance the state-of-the-art technology in QoS and security for general multimedia networking applications.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. The proposed career development plan will broadly impact the university, industry and research community in a number of ways. 1) It creates and fosters a synergistic relationship with local industry in Silicon Valley; 2) It enhances both undergraduate and graduate curriculum in the Computer Engineering Department, San Jose State University, a non-Ph.D. granting institution; 3) It reaches out to undergraduate, minority, and women students to involve them in challenging research projects; 4) It helps the research and educational community by making project results publicly available. The research results will be published in articles, while related software and course materials will be made available on the web.\r\n",
