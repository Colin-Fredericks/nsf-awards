 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Mw=9.3 Dec 2004 Sumatra  earthquake ruptured 1000 miles of  \r\nIndia's eastern plate boundary causing damage in the Nicobar and  \r\nAndaman islands, shifting them bodily 3m-7m southwestward,  and  \r\ntilting them down to the east.  Although shaking damage in the  \r\nAndaman and Nicobar islands was minor,  the tilting caused massive  \r\ndamage to coastline ecologies.  Thousands of hectares of agricultural  \r\nland were flooded, and erosion of forested shorelines has commenced  \r\nin regions that sank. Hundreds of km of coral reefs were killed where  \r\nthe land rose, with attendant loss of nearshore fishing grounds. Yet  \r\nclearly this was not the first time that this has occurred,  and it  \r\nis certain that it will occur again.\r\n\r\nSeveral societal questions arise. How frequently do these  \r\ncatastrophic tsunami earthquakes occur? Are the flooded islands  \r\npermanently drowned or will they slowly recover their former levels?   \r\nWill the saline intrusion and flooding of shoreline farmland be  \r\nreversed or worsened in the coming decades.  Will  harbor defenses  \r\nand docks require extended construction to accommodate additional  \r\nsubmergence or emergence.  In what way does the Sumatra earthquake  \r\nresemble a similar Mw=9 expected in the Pacific NW of the US?  What  \r\ncan be learned from the Sumatra earthquake that has application to  \r\nthe coasts of Oregon and Washington?\r\n\r\nThese questions can be answered  from a geophysical knowledge of the  \r\nsubsurface process involved in the Sumatra/Andaman event.  Near Port  \r\nBlair, where most of the people of the Andaman/Nicobar islands live,   \r\nthe plate boundary accomodates both northward motion of India and the  \r\nwestward motion of the Andaman plate: every 100 years it accommodate  \r\ns roughly1 m of northward motion  and  4 m of convergence.  All this  \r\nmotion occurs infrequently in earthquakes, yet it is driven by slow  \r\ninterseismic processes.\r\n\r\nScientists from Memphis and Colorado are investigating continued  \r\nmovements in the Andaman islands using Global Positioning geodesy and  \r\nsea level  monitoring devices to find out whether  these catastrophic  \r\nchanges are increasing or decreasing. The spatial variation of these  \r\neffects with time provides unique constraints on the continuing  \r\nprocesses in the islands.  Their initial results indicate that  \r\nalthough the islands continue to move SW some of the subsidence has  \r\nbeen reversed.   In this two year project they hope to provide many  \r\nhundreds of points to constrain future motions, and to answer how  \r\nfrequently these earthquakes occur.\r\n\r\nOne of their objectives is to show local scientists how to undertake  \r\nthese kinds of measurements. Strong collaborative agreements have  \r\nbeen established with scientists affiliated with the Society for  \r\nAndaman and Nicobar Ecology (SANE) who have access throughout most of  \r\nthe islands.\r\n",
