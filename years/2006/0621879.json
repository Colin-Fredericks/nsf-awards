Yang, Univ of Florida\r\n\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to develop new decomposition techniques for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels and to design efficient MIMO transceivers. In the past, MIMO transceiver designs have always relied on the singular value decomposition (SVD) or QR decomposition to convert a MIMO channel into parallel scalar channels with vastly different gains. This either leads to the bit-loading strategy, or entails a persistent tradeoff between channel throughput and system error performance. In this proposal, the PIs aim to decompose a MIMO channel into multiple identical scalar channels so that the same modulation can be employed on all parallel channels.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal, the PIs propose a combined theoretical and experimental effort including the following high-level research tasks: 1) Establish the theory of flexible and robust MIMO transceiver design based on the new channel decomposition paradigm; 2) Generalize the theory to account for various levels of channel state information; 3) Optimize and adapt MIMO transceivers for frequency-agile spectrum sharing in broadband channels; 4) Investigate techniques enabling seamless multiple access in heterogeneous networks; and 5) Prototype and jointly optimize the channel decomposition, precoding/decoding algorithms and the implementation architectures.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nAs an enabling technology, the successful implementation of this project is anticipated to significantly influence medical electronics, consumer entertainment, emergency response and homeland security. Besides integrating interdisciplinary designs into the curricula, special efforts will be devoted to combining graduate student training with industrial internship experience, and recruiting and retaining women and underprivileged students.\r\n\r\n",
