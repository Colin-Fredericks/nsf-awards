 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of the project are to increase the number of students completing a bachelors or masters degree in computer science, mathematics, computing and management, or computer graphics. It provides financial and academic support to students who have completed the first year of the undergraduate curriculum or who have completed the prerequisites for a masters degree. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Students are supported by active mentoring and career counseling through a series of workshops, computer equipment, internships from the second or third year of study through to graduation, and access to professional training for entrance examinations to graduate schools. Building on experiences in the Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship (CSEMS) program, the project is also increasing the number of graduates who go on to masters and doctoral programs in computer science and mathematics by providing, in addition to the financial and academic support, an environment in which students' horizons and expectations are broadened. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The project is meeting the needs of a large urban area. While serving a student body that is 72% female and 82% either Hispanic or Black, it is increasing the numbers of students going on to work or graduate school in mathematics or in computer fields.\r\n\r\n",
