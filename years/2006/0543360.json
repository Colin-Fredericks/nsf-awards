 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical Ecology of Uropygial Gland Secretions \r\n\r\nAt the base of their tail, birds possess a gland known as the uropygial or preen gland. This gland produces oily secretions. Multiple times a day birds use their beak to spread these secretions over their feathers. It has long be known that this behavior is essential for maintaining feathers in good condition because applying these secretions to feathers keeps them supple and malleable. Previous studies have shown that although most birds produce secretions, the chemical composition varies between bird species. Secretion composition also changes seasonally, and may differ between males and females. In warmer weather secretions contain a larger number of chemical components than during cooler periods. In and on bird feathers numerous organisms can be found. These include bacteria, fungi, mites, lice and other arthropods. Many of these organisms are harmful to the birds, and it can be hypothesized that preen-gland secretions would play an important role in protecting the bird against them. The objective of this proposal is to describe the very complex chemical composition of preen-gland secretions, to determine how these vary in time and space within a single species, and to test the effect the secretions have on parasitic bacteria, fungi and arthropods. The research will lead to the discovery and identification of new chemical compounds and determine which of these have anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-lice and miticidal effects. Some of these chemicals may have novel structures that are not produced by other living organisms. Such compounds could be of great value in veterinary sciences (poultry), and could perhaps even have applications for medicinal use. \r\n",
