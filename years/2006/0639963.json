 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves studies of global and regional seismicity.\r\nCentral to the project is a continuation of the Harvard\r\nCentroid-Moment-Tensor (CMT) Project, which now represents a\r\n22-year-long effort to analyze global earthquake activity and to\r\nmaintain a comprehensive and authoritative catalog of earthquake\r\nfocal mechanisms, the CMT Catalog. In addition to the systematic\r\nanalysis and of earthquakes and dissemination of earthquake information,\r\nthe research also includes the development of a dynamic earthquake\r\nmoment-tensor database. The new catalog will be searchable on the\r\nweb, and will include auxiliary data, such as information about the\r\nseismograms and Earth model used in the analysis, the quality of\r\nthe solution, and any history of updates to the results.\r\nA second component of the project is an examination of previously\r\nundetected earthquakes. More than 1,800 events with magnitudes greater\r\nthan 4.7 have recently been found using a new detection algorithm, and\r\na substantial subset of these are clearly not common earthquakes.\r\nThe effort will involve a first-order, systematic analysis\r\nof the new events to determine why they eluded earlier\r\ndetection (e.g., whether all of the events lack high-frequency\r\nradiation and are thus slow earthquakes) and the specific tectonic\r\n(or non-tectonic) explanations for several specific groups of\r\ndetections, including (1) events associated with volcanic eruptions\r\nor collapses; (2) events associated with glaciers in Alaska, Antarctica,\r\nand Greenland; and (3) events off the coast of North Carolina,\r\npossibly associated with submarine slumping.",
