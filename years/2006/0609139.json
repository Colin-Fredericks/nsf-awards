 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a three year continuing award, a renewal of the BBSI@PITT:Simulation and Computer Visualization of Biological Systems at Multiple Scales, at the University of Pittsburgh, under the direction of Dr. Ivet Bahar.  This program offered since 2002 by the University of Pittsburgh (lead institution), the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, Duquesne University, and Carnegie Mellon University, will host a ten week summer program for a total of 39 undergraduate and graduate students, 13 per year, for a total of three years.  The students will have strong analytical and quantitative skills and high potential for careers in Computational Biology, Bioengineering, or Bioinformatics.  BBSI@Pitt will continue to focus on computational and mathematical approaches to understanding the function and dynamics of molecular and cellular systems using known structure, biochemical pathways and other data, much of which is increasingly accumulated in web accessible dateabases.  \r\n\r\nThe objectives of BBSI@Pitt are to provide students with a unique training and research experience through a series of cross-disciplinary lectures, computational laboratory sessions, and independent research opportunities not available in traditional undergraduate programs; broaden the student's view of post-genomic computational and mathematical research areas in molecular, cellular, and systems biology; and motivate students to pursue careers in the field.\r\n\r\nComputational Biology, Bioengineering, and Bioinformatics exist at the interface of many different fields, and individuals with truly cross-disciplinary expertise are quite rare.  BBSI@Pitt will continue to have a broad impact on the field by identifying and encouraging promising young students through intensive cross-disciplinary mentoring, providing advice and guidance for career options, and thus contributing to transforming the new generation's approach to biomedical computing problems of far greater complexity than those accessible to earlier generations.\r\n\r\nThis project is being co-funded by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS)/ Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Science (DMS), the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE)/ Division of Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS) ,  the Directorate for Engineering/ Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB).",
