 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this effort is to develop a manufacturing process for drugs and other organic compounds known as mechanochemical synthesis (MCS). Drug nanoparticles manufactured by MCS are expected to exhibit significantly improved pharmacological properties which will increase the effectiveness of many important pharmaceutical treatments. This research will contribute to the advancement of materials nanomanufacturing by developing a MCS process for organic compounds with low melting points, and is driven by a documented need within the pharmaceutical industry. The development and optimization of a nanomanufacturing process and exploration of the underlying responsible phenomena will be addressed. In particular, this project will establish conditions for ensuring high reproducibility and develop the control strategy/equipment for production. The analytical and nanoscale manufacturing experience of a team from Drexel University will be combined with the mechanochemical synthesis and equipment design experience of iCeutica Inc., presenting an opportunity to promote collaboration with industry, fostering a better understanding amongst industry and university scientists, and potentially leading to scientific breakthroughs and technological accomplishments in the fields of manufacturing research. The proposed study will have a strong educational component, building on the existing strengths of the A.J. Drexel Nanotechnology Institute in research and education. Activities within this project will be integrated into existing NSF-supported RET and REU programs.",
