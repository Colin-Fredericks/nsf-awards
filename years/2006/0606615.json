 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs' research program in stochastic analysis, as part of NSF's\r\nefforts in Analysis, Modeling, and Computation of Stochastic Systems,\r\nranges widely in probability theory and its applications to physical\r\nsystems. It focuses on models in continuous space and time, with turbulent\r\nor otherwise chaotic behavior, and makes heavy use of infinite-dimensional\r\nrandom objects, especially stochastic partial differential equations\r\n(SPDEs) which feature white-noise behavior in time and various irregular\r\nspatial behaviors, as well as non-white-noise-based objects which fail to\r\nhave the martingale or the Markov properties (e.g. fractional Brownian\r\nnoise). Specific topics to be covered, with corresponding physical\r\napplications, are divided in three categories: (i) problems based on SPDEs\r\nand their probabilistic representations, including Feynman-Kac approaches,\r\nranging from very basic questions of existence and uniqueness for highly\r\nirregular coefficients, to quantitative questions on the asymptotic\r\nbehavior of linear multiplicative stochastic heat equations including the\r\nAnderson model and directed polymers measures in Gaussian environments, to\r\nquestions of diffusive behavior around random Gibbsian\r\nimpurities/obstacles; (ii) specific physically motivated SPDEs:\r\nmagneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) in a turbulent environment, based on a\r\nFeynman-Kac formulation and its connection to products of random matrices;\r\na framework for self-organized criticality unifying microscopic and\r\nmacroscopic time scales; (iii) extensions of the Russo-Vallois theory of\r\nstochastic integration to general Gaussian and even highly non-Gaussian\r\nprocesses, with SPDE applications to a genealogical framework for\r\nconnecting fractional Brownian motion to Kolmogorov operators.\r\n\r\n    The PIs' purpose for studying these topics is to come to a better\r\nunderstanding of complex random (\"stochastic\") phenomena that change\r\nsimultaneously in space and time. While many typically think of chaotic\r\nphenomena as being devoid of the possibility of predictable behavior, the\r\nPIs choice of complex models is designed to illustrate how specific\r\ninputs, no matter how random, invariably cause outputs which, while they\r\nmay look very random on a short time scale, do show extremely predictable\r\nbehavior in other scales of space and time, with important physical\r\nconsequences. For instance, the MHD model should be capable of exhibiting\r\nthe so-called \"fast dynamo\" effect, by which a magnetic fluid with low\r\nviscosity (the earth's oceans, or its atmosphere, or the sun), when\r\nsubjected to a uniformly random energy input, will exhibit a magnetic\r\nintensity which grows at a specific exponentially rate; this effect could\r\nhave applications to non-mechanical locomotion. Also of note is the model\r\nfor self-organized criticality, which can help understand two-time-phased\r\nsystems, such as avalanches: rather than being considered as events which\r\noccurs instantaneously when a threshold is reached, the model will take\r\nadvantage of a heat-transfer setting reacting to a random environment in a\r\nshort time scale. Many of the project's other models are also based on the\r\nidea that a random environment can have predictable effects, such as\r\nnon-diffusive behavior for polymers or particles around random impurities\r\nor force fields. As mathematicians, the PIs are motivated by the beauty of\r\nthe continuous-time continuous-space probabilistic tools needed to study\r\nthese physical models, and remain true to their commitment to bridging the\r\ngap between theory and applications. Graduate students working with the\r\nPIs will take part in this project's fundamental aspects, and in\r\ninvestigating quantitative issues via calculations or numerical computer\r\nwork. The PIs will encourage students from underrepresented groups to join\r\ntheir research program.\r\n",
