 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWe propose to host a 5-day intensive graduate training workshop for students of history,\r\nphilosophy, and social studies of biology. The workshop will be modeled on the very\r\nsuccessful graduate training FDISH conference held in San Francisco in 2004, which was\r\nsponsored by both the NSF and ISHPSSB (the International Society for the History,\r\nPhilosophy, and Social Studies of Biology).  Ten researchers of distinction from the\r\nfields of history, philosophy, and social studies of biology will be invited to address\r\nthe specific questions: what is the future of biology studies? what are the benefits and\r\nchallenges of interdisciplinary collaboration? what can philosophers, historians,\r\nsociologists, and biologists learn from one another? In addition to these plenary talks,\r\nthe faculty attendees will also participate in hands-on workshops addressing training\r\nissues, such as: how to write a paper for submission to a journal; strategies for\r\nnavigating the job market; how to obtain funding for research in biology studies. An\r\ninnovative feature of the San Francisco FDISH meetings will be continued at the IU\r\nmeeting, namely, \"office hours\", wherein faculty members make themselves available at a\r\nspecific time and location (coffeehouse, restaurant, classroom), for students to drop in\r\nand make informal contacts or discuss research ideas.\r\nThe intellectual merits of the workshop are expected to be widely distributed and varied.\r\nDisciplinary training in philosophy, history, and social studies of biology is taken as a\r\ngiven. More unusual intellectual fruits of the workshop will involve interdisciplinary\r\nsynergies arising from the interactions of the scholars at the various individual sessions\r\nand personal interactions. For example, one researcher in philosophy from the past\r\nworkshop gained access to work of another in ecology that proved fruitful in her\r\npostdoctoral project. These sorts of idiosyncratic and unpredictable interactions\r\npredictably appear when these groups of researchers on biology are thrown together in the\r\nright ways, as we plan to do with the organization of both formal and informal sessions.\r\nBroader impacts include: increased interdisciplinary understanding, especially among\r\nsciences and humanities; dissemination of up-to-date information regarding high-priority\r\nbio-risks and bio-ethical issues; training opportunities and opportunities for\r\nnetwork-building for graduate students from a wide variety of institutional backgrounds,\r\nincluding historically black and women's colleges; and emphasis on future employment\r\nopportunities for well-trained bio-ethics personnel.",
