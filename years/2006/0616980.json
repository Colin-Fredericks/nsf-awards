 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI), jointly supported by the NSF and Department of Energy (DOE), will take place in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico from October 23 to November 8, 2006 on the topic of \"Beyond the Standard Model (SM) in Cosmology, Astroparticle and Particle Physics\". Organized by Dr. Marleigh Sheaff of the University of Wisconsin, the institute will involve approximately 31 participants from the United States and Latin America including graduate students and junior and established investigators, and about 12 instructors (internationally recognized scientists, active in the field).   The activities will consist of a combination of tutorial lectures, advanced-topic presentations, round table discussions, and poster sessions, with the goal of providing the participants with an up-to-date review of this field of research.  A primary goal is to infuse the student participants with the excitement that lies just ahead as accelerator energies approach those heretofore seen only in the early universe. \r\n\r\nThe wide range of applications and materials will impart a significant interdisciplinary nature to the Institute, and should foster the cross-fertilization of new ideas to advance the field and, ultimately, increase relations between Latin American junior and senior investigators and their counterparts in the U.S.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
