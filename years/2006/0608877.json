 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThis proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 05-610, category NER.  The objective of this research is to develop a live bioelectronic nanodevice system by coupling the enzymatic processes in live microorganisms to a physical nanodevice, directly translating the functions of the microorganism into an electrical charge.  The approach is based on a new type of device architecture- a necklace of nanoparticles. Punctuated with isolated, single nanoparticle islands that function as single electron tunneling devices, the rest of the percolating necklace provides the nanocircuitry connecting the device for signal and power. This project will explore using the nanoparticle necklace to create a BioTransistor and a nanObattery.\r\n\r\nThis research has the potential to completely transform the way energy is conceived by creating environmentally-friendly, locally-powered nanosystems using regenerative power.  Possible applications include sensors to detect biological weapons, analytical devices detecting molecular action at the single-cell level for rapidly designing drugs, and mechanisms for revealing the complex pathways of cells.  Basic findings from this research will be used by the PI in two outreach activities, Discover Engineering Day and Bright Lights Summer Program, where Nebraska middle school students will explore ideas like nanotechnology, organic power and material science.   \r\n\r\n\r\n",
