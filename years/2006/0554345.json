 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, it has become clear that many interesting problems,\r\nin particular problems in arithmetic, quantum chaos and the theory of\r\nL-functions, may be profitably reduced to questions concerning\r\nequidistribution of points or measures on homogeneous spaces. These\r\nquestions regarding equidistribution can be approached from many\r\nangles. Two theories which have proved to be particularly well-suited\r\nto study such questions are the spectral theory of automorphic forms,\r\nwhich is closely related to the theory of L-functions, and the theory\r\nof dynamical systems, particularly the study of unipotent and more\r\ngeneral flows on these homogeneous spaces. Recently there has been\r\nconsiderable progress involving tools such as special value formulae\r\nfor L-functions, and (partial) classification results for measures\r\ninvariant under higher rank torus actions. Particularly exciting is\r\nthe possibility, already realized in some instances, of combining\r\nthese techniques. The purpose of the proposed FRG is to investigate\r\nfurther this circle of ideas, which we believe has the potential to\r\nimpact many other problems related to the above. The result of these\r\ninvestigations will be a deeper understanding of the dynamics of group\r\nactions on homogeneous spaces, of the analytic theory of automorphic\r\nforms, and the (sometimes unexpected) applications to problems of\r\narithmetic nature.\r\n\r\nThe present project is concerned with a surprising link between two\r\nclassical fields of mathematics of quite disparate origin: number\r\ntheory and dynamics. The study of number theory began thousands of\r\nyears ago, motivated, in significant part, by questions about prime\r\nnumbers.  On the other hand, ergodic theory and dynamics are\r\nmathematical fields of more recent provenance, which arose from\r\nstudying the long-term evolution of complicated deterministic\r\nprocesses -- such as planetary motion. It is a striking fact (which\r\nhas only recently begun to be heavily exploited) that, in certain\r\ncontexts, ideas from ergodic theory interact very deeply with classical\r\nproblems in number theory.  This project will enhance our\r\nunderstanding of this inter-relation and how we can combine knowledge\r\nfrom both of these fruitful disciplines effectively.\r\n",
