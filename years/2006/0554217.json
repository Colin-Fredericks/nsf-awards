 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) and Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB) will conduct a professional development series to improve the content knowledge of science teachers.  \"Across the Sciences,\" a ten-unit series requiring approximately 145 hours to complete, will better qualify 9th and 10th grade science teachers to teach multicisciplinary science courses.  The number of these courses is increasing.  Teachers prepared in one science discipline will benefit from opportunities to increase and deepen their interdiciplinary science content knowledge and their understanding of student needs associated with learning science.  The target audience is in-service and pre-service teachers who anticipate teaching courses that use a multidisciplinary approach, or teachers who over the past 3-5 years have begun to teach multidisciplinary science.  Special care is given to materials developed for teachers in resource-poor schools and for those who need additional knowledge to deliver science in a culturally competent framework.  Teachers participating in this project have the option to register for college credit through Montana State University and thus move toward recertification and/or earning an advanced degree.",
