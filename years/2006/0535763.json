 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nConducting polymers are an important class of polymers that are currently under intense investigation in both industry and academia for electronic materials applications.  These polymers stimulate interest across many fields including chemistry, materials science, chemical engineering and physics.  Undergraduate students are introduced to conducting polymers through inquiry-guided exercises selected from established literature methods and procedures.  A major emphasis of this project is the integration of conducting polymers across the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.  This integration assists in creating a curriculum that is interdisciplinary with respect to both teaching and research, and introduces topics with practical focus and real-life applications.  In addition, the project bridges the gap between teaching and research within the chemistry curriculum.  The project also prepares students to be contributors to the next generation of scientists, since polymer chemistry is investigated broadly in industry and academia.  The project is assessed for community building within chemistry and with other disciplines.  Finally, the project is used as a model for dissemination to other institutions, based on the design of exercises derived from successful investigations in the literature.\r\n\r\n",
