 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of North Dakota (UND) for the summers of 2006-2008. Evguenii Kozliak is the site's program director and Michael Mann from the Department of Chemical Engineering is the Co-Director. Scientists and engineers of the Center for Gas and Gas-Solid Interactions Impacting the Environment (CIGSIIE), Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Atmospheric Science will serve as REU mentors to nine students, who will each participate in a ten-week program. Students will be recruited from colleges in the Upper Midwest, with particular attention to Native Americans and first generation students resident in the rural communities of the upper Midwest and Western states. Students will gain experience in research applications of green chemistry by selecting from a pool of research projects in which applied environmental chemistry is used to address real societal issues. A majority of the projects will have multiple mentors, thereby introducing participants to collaborative and multidisciplinary research. Fifteen research projects are described in the area of gas-phase chemistry and related environmental chemistry. Students will conclude the program with a poster presentation at a statewide meeting. This award is co-funded by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\n",
