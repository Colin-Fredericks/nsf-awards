 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fabrication of Submicron-Scale Electronic and Photonic Structures Using Direct Photo-Patterning Techniques\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is the direct fabrication of sub-micron scale electronic and photonic device structures based on direct photo patterning. The approach involves the use of direct optically induced fabrication of surface relief structures on azobenzene substituted polymers. This approach can be effectively combined with unique post-processing techniques to reliably obtain patterned micro/nanostructures of both inorganic oxides, and flexible polymer films for fabricating optical and opto-electronic devices. \r\n\tIntellectual merit: This initiative will help in significantly extending the state-of-the-art to the facile fabrication of large-area micro/nano-patterned arrays of both inorganic materials and patterning of large area polymeric substrates. The knowledge base developed in this work is also applicable to other emerging nanoscale technologies including light emitting diodes, solar cells, ultraviolet laser, liquid crystal displays and distributed feedback grating for integrated optics and sensor arrays. \r\nBroader Impact: An additional very important impact of the proposed work involves the training of the involved graduate students in this novel patterning technique. Innovative technically trained personnel shall help foster new technologies that can spawn new businesses and provide U.S. companies the competitive edge in an era of global competition. This activity will also provide considerable stimulus to undergraduate and high school students, through the outreach programs in place at the university to pursue studies and ultimately embark on careers in science and engineering. \r\n",
