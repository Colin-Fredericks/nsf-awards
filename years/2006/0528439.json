Since 2001, Dhir has hosted an NSF funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) in Biotechnology for ten students per year. Mentoring elements have emphasized support of independent research, self-confidence and teamwork skills, communication of research (oral and written) and career guidance.\r\n\r\nThe Dhir-supported (minority) students from the U.S. mainland and Puerto Rico participate in the Center for Biotechnology for the summer. Dhir also mentors high-school students, who subsequently have won a total of 198 awards, 190 students have made presentations, 238 students have participated in conferences, and 15 students have published papers as a senior author or co-author. Two high school students were finalists in the Siemens Westinghouse competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
