 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Social Relations Model (SRM) is a general model of dyadic relations which has been used to examine interpersonal perception, primarily within a group. A conference is proposed that will expand the use the model to the area of intergroup relations.   The perceptions of ingroup and outgroup members can compared using the SRM in theoretically interesting and complex ways.  The two-day conference will bring a group of ten researchers from several disciplines including social psychology, organizational psychology, and family studies who will discuss the application of the model to intergroup relations.   Special efforts will be undertaken to recruit members from under represented groups and researchers in the earlier stages of their career.  The conference organizers, as well as the participants, will share information about strategies in data collection and recent advances in statistics and software that simplify the computation of model parameters.  Efforts will be undertaken to seek publication of an edited book of the conference papers.  The book would highlight the theoretical and empirical usefulness of the model for the study of intergroup relations.",
