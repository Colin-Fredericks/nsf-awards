 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nHurricanes not only unleash horrible destruction on human communities, they also may reek havoc on natural ecosystems. As hurricanes are unpredictable in time and space the critical pre-disturbance data needed to measure their effects on natural ecosystems rarely exist.  This is a project to do a comparative inventory of insects in the coastal area of Alabama, before and after the recent series of hurricanes. What makes this study possible - and unique - is five years of data collected  before the recent suite of hurricanes struck the Gulf of Mexico. Insects are ideal subjects for this study because they are; 1) abundant; 2) respond quickly to environmental changes; 3) critical components of the food chain; 4) excellent indicators of biodiversity; and 5) numerous species transmit the agents of human disease (e.g. West Nile). \r\n\r\nThe earth is in a warming cycle which in all likelihood will result in increased hurricane activity. Best management practices of storm damaged ecosystems requires a clear picture of the ecological community before and after hurricanes strike. In addition, there are  disparate opinions about how hurricanes like Katrina can effect mosquito populations and thus the transmission of diseases to human.  Accordingly, this work has vital significance for both best management practices of storm disturbed ecosystems as well as public health and vector management concerns. \r\n",
