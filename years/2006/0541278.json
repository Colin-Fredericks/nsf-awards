Low-latency, low-energy circuits for communications will require regular, structured interconnect to engineer wires and tune circuits to those wires. On-chip networks (OCN)\r\nprovide such a structured fabric in which communication is obtained by routing packets through a  general-purpose interconnect structure rather than using a design-specific ad hoc global wiring network routed by CAD tools. The PIs will investigate the design of scalable OCNs for multi-core systems-on-chip by combining a new low-latency, low-energy, current-mode signalling approach based on damping \r\ncompensation with the design of latency-insensitive communication protocols extended to support fault-tolerant communication as well as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling and power-down for the cores.\r\n",
