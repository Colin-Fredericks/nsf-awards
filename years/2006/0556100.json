 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project, to be conducted at Louisiana State University (LSU), is to advance a portfolio of science and technologies needed to commercialize metal-based microscale heat exchangers (MHEs). This project builds on our ongoing research in areas of high temperature molding replication of metal-based high-aspect-ratio microscale structures (HARMS), detailed heat transfer measurements on a localized level, and conventional and novel joining methods. To push metal-based MHEs to the commercial realm, technologies for low-cost mass production of metal-based HARMS will be researched and proven, detailed information on heat transfer characteristics at the micron scale will be measured and rationalized, and reliable strategies for joining/packaging HARMS based microsystems will be devised and implemented. By integrating research on microfabrication, local heat transfer measurements and modeling, and assembly/packaging, our interdisciplinary program aims to lay the technological foundation for commercializing MHEs.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of microfabrication technologies to society is ultimately measured by new products that can positively influence our way of living and our environment. The ability to mass produce metal-based MHEs with improved thermal characteristics and reliability, and with low cost, offers the potential for introducing MHEs into the market place. Potential energy savings from incorporating more energy efficient MHEs into household appliances, and from employing them in manufacturing and automotive industries can bring significant environmental benefits. The maturation of fabrication and assembly/packaging technologies regarding metallic HARMS may lead to many other microdevices which can be operated at high temperatures and in other harsh environments, and has important implications to the microdevice technology horizon. Our planned research involves graduate students in microfabrication, microscale fluid flow and heat transfer, and microsystems joining/packaging activities, and embodies the spirit of cutting edge, multidisciplinary, engineering research. Through our interactions with Southern University, one of the largest Historically Black College and University (HBCU) institutions, we have actively involved ourselves in mentoring and education of minority students, and will continue to do so in association with the present project.\r\n",
