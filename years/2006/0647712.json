 "awd_abstract_narration": "Corrosion is a problem that plagues the infrastructure of modern society through the chronic wearing of metal surfaces.  Corrosion of pipelines, tanks, separators and other equipment can result in leaks that, in turn, lead to health and safety concerns, environmental damage and expensive disruptions of industries and services.  A timely illustration is the unexpectedly severe pipeline corrosion necessitating the shutdown of the Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska.  In this case, the problems are caused by microbial-influenced corrosion (MIC), and this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) is being awarded to address this urgent situation. There have been relatively few investigations whose goal is to identify the specific microbial communities that are directly responsible for MIC.  This is because it is disruptive and prohibitively expensive to obtain real corrosion-impacted pipeline samples. It is imperative that the replacement of a portion of the Prudhoe Bay pipeline be used as an opportunity for microbiologists to obtain samples of corrosive biofilms in problem areas and to compare the interacting microbial populations in these areas with those in corrosion-free pipeline sections.  The remarkable tools of modern molecular microbiology and genomics will be used to make such comparisons with the goal of identifying the organisms most often associated with corrosion. Comparing the microbiota of corrosive versus non-corrosive biofilms and testing the energy sources for these communities, will provide a basis for future control measures.  The same procedures will be used on pipeline fluids and sludges to determine where the organisms come from, and what role hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria play in MIC.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the identity and function of corrosion-causing bacteria in pipeline biofilms will likely lead to more targeted monitoring and control efforts.  Such measures may help mitigate corrosion processes before they become too severe.  It may be also be possible to devise ways of altering the metabolism of microbial biofilm communities away from corrosion to less immediately harmful processes. Comprehending corrosion problems go well beyond the immediate impact in the Alaskan pipeline. Corrosion is a problem throughout many sectors of society. Various entities (oil companies, regulatory agencies, many industries, etc.) know that MIC is a substantial cost in terms of control measures, replacement parts, product interruptions and environmental damages.  However, society as a whole is affected by corrosion since the costs are ultimately passed on to consumers.  As such, corrosion contributes to higher prices at the pump and to virtually all aspects of modern life. This study represents a unique opportunity to gain insight on the nature of MIC, at least as it impacts the infrastructure of the U.S. energy supply system.\r\n",
