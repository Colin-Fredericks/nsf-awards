 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe proposed research on \"Regulation of Polymer Blend Morphology Using \r\nNanospheres and Nanorods, \"aims to understand how phase separation in polymer blend\r\nfilms affects the dispersion of nanoparticles (NP) and how NP affect phase evolution,\r\nwetting and film stability.  Whereas prior studies focus on neat blends, the current study\r\nwill investigate how particle characteristics, in particular, surface chemistry and shape,\r\ninfluence how NP disperse and organize in a multi-phase morphology.  Nanospheres of\r\nsilica and nanorods of CdSe will be investigated.  To control their location, NP are\r\nfunctionalized by acid-groups, neutral brushes, and attractive brushes.  By tuning the \r\nsurface properties, which control partitioning and organization, NP can be driven into one\r\ndomain or towards the interface between phases.  The location of NP dictates film\r\ncharacteristics including wetting layer growth rate, mprphology, phase evolution, and\r\nfilm stability.  By controlling the location of NP, a new route for engineering phase size is\r\nexpected from these systematic studies.  For example, stable biocontinuous structures can\r\nbe produced by NP \"jamming\" resulting in highly efficient photovoltaic devices.  The\r\nproposed research requires a palette of complementary depth and lateral profiling\r\ntechniques including ion beam etching combined with scanning electron microscopy.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nPolymer nanocomposites (PNC) are foundin everyday materials such as tires and\r\ngolfballs as well as high technology devices for energy conversion and sensor\r\napplications.  PNC are examples of nano-based materials, which are driving the\r\nrevolution in nanotechnology.  This exploding field has received worldwide investments\r\ntotaling $8 billion in 2004 with an anticipated impact of $2.6 trillion by 2014.  Although\r\nhighly versatile and widely used, a fundamental understanding of PNC is lacking and\r\nbasic science is necessary to produce PNC based devises that are reliable, efficient and\r\neconomical.\r\n\r\nDuring the past 3.5 years, this NSF project has provided research training for 25\r\nengineering undergraduates (10 females) and 6 high school teaching (2 female, 2\r\nminority).  Two of these have received NSF Graduate Fellowships.  Lectures about\r\npolymer science to teachers in the Philadelphia School District has lead to great\r\nenthusiasm about developing laboratories for a Science Van that will reach out to \r\nunderrepresented nimorites in middle school.  With University encouragement, the \r\nScience Van project is in the planning stages.  International collaborations with scientists\r\nfrom the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic will provide students with a better\r\nunderstanding about research in these countries.\r\n  \r\n",
