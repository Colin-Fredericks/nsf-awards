 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Molecular Genetics of Bacteria and Phages Conference, traditionally held at Cold Spring Harbor and now being held in alternate years at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, is a central forum for the presentation of new results in molecular genetics of bacteria and the viruses that infect them.  On the order of 200-400 participants attend, representing laboratories throughout the world, and most present either short talks or posters, making it an important forum for the exchange of information in this era of scientific specialization. Topics covered include fundamental work on bacterial replication, recombination, repair, control of gene expression, synthesis of proteins, signaling, protein folding and secretion, stress response, cell development and division, and pathogenesis.  For many graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, this is the first large meeting at which they have an opportunity to speak.  Due to its highly interactive nature, the meeting provides an important opportunity for these young scientists to meet and talk to the senior scientists they know from the literature.  In response to the large numbers of students who attend the meeting and the diversity of topics covered, established and distinguished scientists are invited to chair each session.  This strengthens the meeting because each chairperson gives a short introduction in which he or she summarizes some of the key facets of the field to be covered and provides a conceptual framework for the major questions that the talks will address.",
