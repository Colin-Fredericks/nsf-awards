Both\r\nthe atmosphere and ocean also display strong shear flows that may\r\nbecome unstable, producing rolls that can also lead to mixing and\r\nlocal homogenization of the density.  The investigators study the\r\nissue of which of these two processes prevails in a given flow\r\nconfiguration.  Based on preliminary work, the investigators\r\nconjecture that in the shallow water regime there is a sharp\r\nboundary below which the dynamics disallow shear instabilities,\r\nleaving only wave breaking as the possible mixing mechanism.  In\r\nmathematical terms, they consider systems of partial differential\r\nequations of mixed type, where the hyperbolic domain corresponds\r\nto the internal waves and the elliptic domain to shear\r\ninstability.  The question of nonlinear stability of the flow can\r\nthen be formulated in terms of whether the solutions themselves\r\ncan make the system become elliptic.  The investigators have\r\nproved that this cannot happen for a simple system and here\r\nextend the result to much more general scenarios.  In addition to\r\nthis stability result, they propose a closure that quantifies the\r\nmixing taking place when waves break.\r\n\r\n     Understanding and quantifying fluid mixing is a key\r\ningredient in global weather and climate studies.  The atmosphere\r\nand ocean are stratified fluids: fluids whose density varies\r\n(primarily) with height due to temperature, salinity and other\r\neffects.  Stratified fluids allow for the propagation of internal\r\nwaves, and these waves may eventually break and mix the fluid. \r\nAnother possible source of mixing is due to shear instabilities:\r\nthe formation of eddies at the interface between flows of\r\ndifferent speeds.  In this project the investigators study which\r\nof these two effects is more likely to prevail given the ambient\r\nconditions.  Such a study has far-reaching implications: the\r\natmospheric and ocean mixing layers control the coupling between\r\nthe two, and hence exert a critical control on the evolution of\r\nthe climate.  The work advances the predictive capabilities of\r\ncoupled atmosphere-ocean models, by improving their\r\nparameterization of fluid entrainment and mixing.  It also trains\r\nundergraduate and graduate students in the use of applied\r\nmathematical tools for the advancement of the natural sciences.\r\n",
