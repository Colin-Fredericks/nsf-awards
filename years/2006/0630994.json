 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe University is building on a successful CSEMS scholarship program to award scholarships in science and engineering disciplines.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe university admits a talented but often financially needy student population.  Driven by financial circumstances, a significant number of students periodically \"step-out of\", or slow their academic programs during what should be their final two years. This project is designed to identify eligible students in those final two years of their degree programs, award 32 scholarships in each year of the four year grant period, and provide the students with academic support resulting in substantially improved retention and degree achievement. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nAn Advisory Board, whose membership includes representatives from financial aid, advising, multicultural affairs, and career services offices, is developing, implementing, and carrying out the objectives of this program, which includes awarding at least 10% of these scholarships to students in minority groups. S-STEM Scholarships allow awardees to focus on academic work, internships, and service, thus accomplishing the key goals: to reduce students' time to graduation, increase GPAs and increase their civic responsibility.",
