 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his collaborator have established a\r\nconnection between the Castelnuovo Theory of subvarieties in projective space, and\r\nthe geometric Schottky problem, i.e. that of identifying Jacobians among\r\nall principally polarized abelian varieties based on geometric\r\nproperties of the polarization. This includes in particular a relationship with the celebrated Trisecant Conjecture of Welters. They are now\r\napproaching directly the Trisecant Conjecture, using these connections, as well as\r\nhomological $M$-regularity methods. They are also interested in developing a \"higher\r\nCastelnuovo-Schottky theory\", based on deeper similarities\r\nbetween subvarieties in projective space and those of abelian varieties. In this respect, one of the main points they are interested in is a conjecture of Debarre on which are the subvarieties of principally polarized abelian varieties representing minimal classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Trisecant Conjecture, or the Strange Duality Conjecture, are among the\r\nmost prominent conjectures in the respective directions (which can be called roughly speaking the abelian and non-abelian theory of theta functions). The proved statements, or even significant progress towards them, would have a large number of consequences, as documented in numerous places in the literature. Further development of the asymptotic methods has the potential to provide new insight into the geometry of every smooth projective variety, the main objects of study in algebraic geometry.\r\nAll parts of the project would further the knowledge in the field,\r\nwould have a broad range of applications, and will\r\ncreate interaction with people of different backgrounds.\r\nMany of the problems in this proposal are of interest to researchers\r\nin adjacent fields, like complex analysis (theta functions), complex\r\nanalytic geometry (transcendental methods in algebraic geometry)\r\nand conformal field theory (conformal blocks), and will lead to\r\ninteractions with some of them.\r\n",
