 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis proposal focuses on spectrum- and energy-efficient medium access and routing in resource-constrained cyberinfrastructure. It develops the enabling technology that allows the seamless integration of ubiquitous sensing, wireless communications, and heterogeneous networking. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The joint exploitation of spectrum, channel, and traffic dynamics forms the unifying theme of this research. The proposed research aims to put on firm theoretic ground the methodology of cross-layer design by pursuing a decision-theoretic approach. This approach integrates spectrum sensing with spectrum access, signal processing for traffic estimation and change detection with opportunistic routing, energy and power constraints with channel fading and traffic statistics. The ultimate goal is a cyberinfrastructure that is traffic adaptive, spectrum agile, and resource efficient.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: As a multidisciplinary project intersecting signal processing and wireless networking, this research promotes interaction and collaboration across different research communities and facilitates compilation of research efforts made by independent societies for the advance of Cyberinfrastructure. Specific research topics arising from this project enrich undergraduate and graduate curriculum and stimulate the interests of undergraduate students in pursuing a postgraduate degree in engineering. In particular, the proposed summer exchange program with Cornell University promotes outreach to underrepresented student groups. In addition, this research leads to a collaborative project with industry that addresses several practical issues central to the design of resource-constrained Cyberinfrastructure, potentially resulting in technology transfer.\r\n\r\n",
