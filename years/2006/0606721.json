Inspired by\r\nBeshadsky-Coccoti-Ooguri-Vafa, the principal investigator , joint\r\nwith Lu and Yoshikawa, has constructed a new holomorphic\r\ninvariant of Calabi-Yau manifolds, which can be computed the\r\ninvariant for one dimensional moduli spaces. In general, the\r\nprincipal investigator suggests an approach to analysis the\r\nasymptotic behavior of the new invariant, by using the local\r\nindex theory techniques. This project should give insight on\r\nbetter understanding of the torsion invariants and the Calabi-Yau\r\nmoduli.  The proposed study can be viewed as an attempt to study\r\nproblems in algebraic geometry using methods of differential\r\ngeometry. By studying local geometry analytically near the\r\nsingularities, the principal investigator also hopes to give new\r\nexamples of the explicitly computable torsion invariants and\r\nreveal relations of torsion invariants to number theory.\r\n\r\nThis project also will have broader impact. Torsion invariants\r\nhave come from topology and high energy physics theories. The\r\nproposed study will shed new light on understanding Mirror\r\nSymmetry, which is one of the central problems in current\r\ntheoretical physics.  Understanding this theory will give\r\nmathematical foundation of the String Theory, which is a\r\npotential unified theory for high energy physics long sought\r\nafter since Einstein's time. For example, the proposed research\r\nmight lead to better understanding of (the number and the shape)\r\nof the universe. Interaction with fellow mathematicians and\r\nphysicists is expected and will be necessary for the success of\r\nthis research project. The principal investigator will\r\nparticipate the integrated research and education activities that\r\nwill promote the education level of the nation.\r\n",
