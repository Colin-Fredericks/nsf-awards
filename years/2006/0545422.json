Ultimately, the knowledge base of legal cases and social psychological research, combined with an effective public outreach and dissemination strategy, will be available to academic leaders and faculties seeking to understand and address both the causes of and solutions to the under-representation of women in science and engineering. \r\n\r\nThe project seeks to develop a compelling business case for gender equity. through readily accessible information about major patterns of glass ceiling and maternal wall bias and stereotyping, based on a comprehensive literature review of social psychological studies and social cognition theory.  The  project brings together a unique combination of legal experts and social scientists to develop materials that will promote equity in sciences and engineering.  The project reflects integration of cutting-edge research with effective dissemination techniques. \r\n",
