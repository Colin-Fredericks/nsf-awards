 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Paterson, New Jersey, school district is designated as an Abbot District by the State of New Jersey, or an urban district with long-standing, severe educational deficiencies.  For the past ten years, Ramapo College of New Jersey has partnered with the Paterson School District through College Bound, Upward Bound Math/Science, a high school STEM academy, teacher training placements for Ramapo students, and field experiences at the College's Meadowlands Environment Center for Paterson students and teachers.  The Ramapo College Noyce Scholarship program provides a natural extension to these programs by increasing the pipeline of Paterson residents who return to the District to teach in mathematics and science disciplines.  In the four years of the Noyce program, 35 Ramapo College undergraduates, who major in a STEM field while pursuing separate coursework in teacher training to be effective science and math instructors in elementary grades through high school, are receiving financial support in their junior and senior years, as well as academic and career support services. Participants have an extensive academic, intellectual background since they major in the field they will teach.   After graduation, during the critical first two years of teaching, Noyce Scholars participate in a summer institute, mentoring programs, and ongoing communication with faculty from Ramapo College and the Paterson schools. The Noyce Program helps address a national shortage of well-prepared teachers in STEM disciplines, particularly in an underserved, high-needs school district.\r\n\r\n",
