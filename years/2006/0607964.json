 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe catfish family Ictaluridae is of great economic and scientific significance.  It includes economically important species such as the channel catfish, blue catfish, and flathead catfish.  All ictalurid catfishes have spines with associated venom glands on their pectoral and dorsal fins. These spines are thought to be the primary means of defense from predators.  The size and shape of these spines and venom glands varies greatly among species, but it is unclear if pectoral spine shape is related to venom gland structure.  This research will elucidate the phylogenetic tree describing relationships of ictalurid catfishes; the tree will be used to examine the evolution of spine shape and venom gland structure.\r\n\tThis project will provide the opportunity to teach undergraduate students the principles of systematic biology and hypothesis testing in evolutionary biology.  Students recruited to aid in data collection will learn technical skills including analysis of molecular and morphological data.  Learning these skills by doing laboratory research teaches problem solving and critical thinking skills more effectively than classroom projects.  Results from this project will be presented to the public in a variety of forums at the Bell Museum of Natural History.  In addition to these immediate educational benefits, this project will also provide valuable information on the biology of a group of fishes important to anglers and aquaculturalists.\r\n",
