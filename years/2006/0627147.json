In addition, the degree of anonymity is affected by the wireless eavesdropping techniques, encryption methods, user traffic patterns, motion pattern and routing protocols that are in use.  The combination of these factors requires an in-depth investigation in order to understand their influence to the degree of anonymity protection and to create comprehensive measurements that can be used as a baseline for performance evaluation.  This project is focused around obtaining such understanding and measurement, and developing countermeasure strategies by taking an approach that emphasizes the impact from motion behaviors.  Specifically, this project develops formal definitions and conducts analyses of the anonymity problem and emerging anonymity concerns.   The project also develops new metrics to quantify new anonymity properties and uses them to develop preliminary results on network performance and possible trade-offs through in-depth simulations.  These studies will lead to the development of best-practices regarding routing strategies when dealing with different security assumptions and levels of privacy.  This effort will impact the fundamental understanding of the anonymity issue in mobile multi-hop wireless networking and provide an excellent platform for graduate student training. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
