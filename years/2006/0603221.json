 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers in this project are assessing the current and future needs of aerospace manufacturing for technicians and engineers, assessing current educational offerings for two-year programs and developing curricula to close the gaps between the two. The curricula and the underlying body of knowledge are being made available to educational institutions and professional societies. Aerospace manufacturing leaders from many of the principal suppliers actively support the project allowing unusual access by researchers to topic experts and entry-level engineers and technicians. The participating researchers from El Camino College, Oregon Institute of Technology, Wichita Area Technical College, and Purdue University partner with the Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME), and participate in the development of an SME Certified Aerospace Manufacturing Engineer exam. The aerospace industry is key to the defense and economic well being of this country. Currently the industry is being challenged to cope with employee losses in a \"graying\" workforce, unprecedented demand for their product, demand for more cost-effective products, and a very steep new technology curve both in product development and manufacturing processes. This project produces course materials that allow for easy adaptation into those educational institutions supporting this industry segment.",
