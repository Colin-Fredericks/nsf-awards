Narayan, University of Maryland College Park\r\n\r\nAs wireless radio frequency (RF) communication technology continues to grow in sophistication and demand, and, at the same time, free space optics (FSO) steadily emerges as an attractive communication technology, it is becoming increasingly evident that the best possible gains in overall system performance can be reaped through a hybrid communication system which combines in a complementary manner its RF and wireless optical components. We propose a new and tractable class of information theoretic models for a hybrid wireless RF and optical communication system. Through our theoretical analysis of these new models, our prime objective is to characterize the fundamental limits of performance of the hybrid communication system, and to provide qualitative and quantitative guidelines for the design and optimal use of its component subsystems.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: The cornerstone of this proposal is a new information theoretic view of a hybrid RF-optical communication system. This will enable several important classical results as well as recent advances in information theory to play a primary role in formulating new mathematical models of hybrid RF-optical systems, characterizing fundamental performance limits, and offering new insights and engineering guidelines for their operation. Expected outcomes of the proposed project include significant innovations in areas of critical importance to hybrid wireless RF and optical communication. Furthermore, it has the potential of leading to important advances in information theory through the introduction and analysis of new models, solution of fundamental open problems, and new applications of information-theoretic ideas. The specific goals of this research are the following:\r\n\r\n(i) the development of an information theoretic framework for the mathematical modeling and analysis of a hybrid RF-optical system, using appropriate sum channel models;\r\n(ii) a characterization of the fundamental limits of performance of the hybrid system in terms of channel capacity, i.e., the maximum code rate of reliable information transfer;\r\n(iii) the development of strategies for the complementary use of the RF and optical subsystems based on channel conditions; and\r\n(iv) the development of adaptive signaling and power control strategies in the RF and optical modes as a function of available information on the channel conditions.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The proposed project will provide a rich learning environment for graduate students in the rapidly emerging technology of hybrid wireless RF and optical communication systems. Specifically, the basic elements of the technical approach will be discussed in Special Topics courses and seminars; and students will play a major role in the study and performance evaluation of the RF and optical signaling and power control schemes developed, in addition to graduate students' participation in the project at the level of M.S. and Ph.D. degrees.\r\n",
