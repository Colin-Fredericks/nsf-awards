 "awd_abstract_narration": "UCLA has a unique environment for advancing the careers of young researchers.  State of the art research in applied mathematics, including  image processing, materials science, and fluid dynamics is developed with full participation of a vibrant group  of graduate students and postdocs. We propose to build on this program to provide an  exceptional training and mentoring experience for younger students at the undergraduate and early graduate level. This program will support, over five years, up to 60 REU students from both UCLA and Harvey Mudd College. Proposed research projects include spatio-temporal pattern analysis in crime data,  experimental and analysis of slurry flows, imaging processing, and cooperative control of robotic vehicles. An additional group of 15 PhD students, in the early stages of their career, will develop a research career in applied mathematics. These students will have the opportunity to participate in summer internship projects with faculty from other departments and with industry and national laboratories.  Students will receive additional training in  computation as well as mathematical analysis skills necessary to succeed in a top PhD program.\r\n\r\nThe investigators propose a research training program to enhance the workforce of US citizens  and permanent residents entering research study  applied and computational differential equations.  This program is designed for undergraduate students and graduate students in the early part of a research career.  They will work both one-on-one and in small research groups with faculty mentors on cutting edge research problems in an immersive research environment.  This program will support, over five years, up to 60 REU students\r\nfrom both UCLA and Harvey Mudd College. These students will have the opportunity to be part of a research team in a large research university. Proposed research projects include modeling of crime in Los Angeles, laboratory and mathematical studies of mud slides, medical imaging, and coordination and tracking of autonomous vehicles. In addition,  up to 15 PhD students, in the early part of their careers, will participate in this program, which includes summer graduate internship projects with faculty from other departments and with industry and national laboratories.  All students in the program will have the opportunity to participate in new curricular activities aimed at developing the mathematical and computational background necessary to succeed in a top PhD program in computational and applied mathematics.\r\n",
