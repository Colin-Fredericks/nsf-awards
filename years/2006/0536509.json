This project is: a) introducing cutting edge rapid prototyping technology to 2-year and 4-year engineering technology students, b) increasing overall student diversity in technology education, c) enhancing student learning in advanced manufacturing technologies, d) modernizing laboratory facilities for a wide regional area, e) encouraging undergraduate student research projects, f) creating new opportunities for faculty development, and g) developing educational innovations by contributing a novel 3D printing rapid prototyping knowledge base for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. The evaluation plan is focusing on student learning and is also comparing the relative advantages of remote and traditional laboratories. Through this project, many more users are benefiting from state-of-the-art rapid prototyping technology, thereby better justifying the cost of purchasing and maintaining the overall facility. Furthermore, the project is providing new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of remote access environments for both the design/manufacturing technology and distance education communities.",
