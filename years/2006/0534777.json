 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mixed- and augmented-reality (MR-AR) techniques extend the virtual reality (VR) paradigm by selectively augmenting the physical environment with computer-generated objects or vice versa, and consequently create tremendous interest in exploring a wide range of applications such as scientific visualization, medical diagnosis and surgery planning, and training and education.  However, lack of image brightness common to many existing 3D display systems imposes significant restrictions on the lighting conditions of the working environment, forcing users to turn off or dim room lighting for most MR-AR demonstrations, and eliminating application scenarios where well-illuminated environments cannot be avoided (e.g., outdoor environments and surgical operating rooms).  In this project the PI will seek to alleviate this problem by developing a prototype ultra-bright head-mounted polarized projective display, in which advances in optical design coupled with careful manipulation of the polarization state of the light passing through the optical system results in an observed image that is theoretically up to 4 times brighter than is possible to achieve in existing designs.   Because the measure of display technology is that it provide quantitative and qualitative visual representations of scenes that conform to a predictive model, the PI will further devise methods for calibrating the new display's parameters, and evaluate both subjective and objective image qualities as well as the accuracy of depth/size representation.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  This research will result in better displays suitable for demanding MR-AR applications where bright and high-contrast virtual images are required and only minimal intrusion by real-world views is acceptable.  This in turn will spur development of MR-AR solutions in domains for which illumination has until now been an insurmountable challenge.",
