 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I Project describes the development of a commercially relevant sustainable production method of a family of anti-inflammatory agents, the pseudopterosins. These compounds and the related seco-pseudopterosins are isolated from the gorgonian coral, Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae, and shown to have promising activity in various in vitro and in vivo models. Methopterosin, the methyl ether of pseudopterosin A, has progressed through Phase I and II clinical trials as a topical antiinflammatory agent. Currently, the only source of these compounds is from extractions of biomass collected from reefs. The aim of the work described is to purify and sequence the native terpene synthase involved in the biosynthesis of these compounds and clone the corresponding gene.  This would represent the first cloning of a terpene synthase from any marine organism. \r\n\r\nMarine natural products such as the pseudopterosins and seco-pseudopterosins represent an exciting new source of therapeutic agents. The mechanism of action of the pseudopterosins appears to be novel suggesting that these marine natural products represent a new class of anti-inflammatory drugs with a commercial market as a cosmetic additive and a future clinical market. \r\n",
