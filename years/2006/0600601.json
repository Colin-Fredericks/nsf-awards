 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for research into the modeling and  solution of equipment replacement problems that incorporate both  continuous and discontinuous technological change.  Continuous  technological change refers to the gradual improvement in assets  available over time for replacement.  These generally coincide with  the manufacturer periodically releasing new models, which are more  efficient than previous models.  Discontinuous technological change  refers to breakthroughs in technology, often accompanied by jumps in \r\nproductivity when compared to previous models.  We assume  breakthroughs define a new vintage of asset that gradually improves in  subsequent model releases of the same vintage.  In either case, the  economic impact of the technology may not be known until it arrives.   Stochastic dynamic programming is proposed to solve this problem under  various scenarios of technological, capital budgeting constraints, and  multiple suppliers.  Due to the large state space of the system,  approximation techniques will be used to allow for the solution of  longer horizon problems, ensuring (near) optimal time zero decisions. The expected benefits of this work lie in the ability to determine  optimal or near optimal policies for consumers of technological assets, such as hospitals.  To verify these insights, Lehigh Valley  Hospital has offered data on over 24,000 pieces of medical equipment.  This information will allow for the application of the developed  models.\r\nFurthermore, extensions of this work will more closely examine how to  influence consumers' choices concerning technological change.  For  example, manufacturers may offer maintenance contracts or pecialized \r\nwarranties in order to entice purchases while sharing the risk of  using newer technologies.  Furthermore, governments may offer  incentives for manufacturers to adopt newer technologies with greater  investment.\r\nThese policies can be examined by analyzing the optimal replacement  policies under differing conditions.  The benefits of these analyses  will be in designing methods (policies and contracts) that foster capital investment and technological innovation.\r\n",
