 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed conference will bring together people working in the two areas, including\r\nleading experts in the both fields, in order to explore the possibility of transferring the\r\nknowledge accumulated in quantum many-body physics into the area of quantum\r\nalgorithms and back, and also to attract more physicists to the problem of quantum\r\ncomputation.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe merits  of holding this conference are determined by the revolutionary role of\r\nquantum computing, which should provide means for solving problems that may not be\r\nsolved with ordinary computers. New breakthroughs in quantum computing are expected\r\nfrom exchange of ideas and results obtained in relevant areas of classical and quantum\r\ncomputational algorithms and quantum many-body physics, which is closely related to\r\nquantum computing. In turn, the fast progress in quantum computing should significantly\r\nenrich many-body physics and lead to new technologies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe broader impact of the conference comes from its truly interdisciplinary scope. Bringing\r\ntogether world-leading experts in computer science and physics should dramatically\r\nextend the scope of the studies on quantum computing and attract more scientists to this\r\narea. Participation of students and postdoctoral research associates will help disseminate\r\nthe knowledge among younger generation of scientists.",
