 "awd_abstract_narration": "Problems in two areas of probability are considered. The first \r\nis concerned with uniqueness for the solutions of stochastic\r\ndifferential equations arising from the areas of stochastic partial\r\ndifferential equations, measure-valued branching diffusions with branching\r\nand spatial interactions, equations that depend on the past, \r\nand equations corresponding to degenerate elliptic operators.\r\nThese are typically infinite-dimensional systems of equations, often \r\nwith coefficients that degenerate at a boundary.  The second area of \r\nresearch concerns Harnack inequalities and heat kernel estimates. \r\nAn attempt will be made to characterize the Harnack inequality in both \r\ncontinuous models and ones with jumps. In addition regularity of \r\nsolutions to equations associated with non-local operators in bounded \r\nregions will be investigated.\r\n\r\nIn recent years researchers in mathematical physics, economics, and\r\nmathematical finance have realized that to adequately model real-world\r\nphenomena, the possibility of jumps must be allowed. For example, an\r\nunexpected discovery or unexpected regional conflict might cause a sudden jump\r\nup or down in stock prices. However, some of the very basic questions\r\nabout models that incorporate jumps are as yet unanswered. One of the areas\r\nto be investigated is the regularity of such models. A typical question is:\r\nif the initial data is perturbed slightly, is it true that the behavior of \r\nthe model at future times will also be only slightly perturbed?  There are \r\nsimilar unanswered questions for certain models that originate in mathematical\r\nbiology. In these cases the difficulty is not the presence of jumps, but\r\nthe presence of huge numbers of individuals and the possible interactions\r\nbetween individuals.",
