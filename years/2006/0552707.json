Eight undergraduate students will be recruited for a ten-week summer experience in the field of Computer Science and Engineering.  The program will provide opportunities for students to conduct research as part of a team, present research results orally and in writing, and disseminate project information and results through the web. In addition, each participant will attend a national conference (i.e. Society of Women Engineers (SWE) to gain an up-close experience about research as a profession.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this project is to promote graduate studies and research careers in Computer Science and Engineering to these talented undergraduate students.  The majority of the students will be recruited from two and four -year colleges with limited on non-existent research program opportunities for undergraduate students with a special emphasis placed on recruiting minority women students from southeastern Michigan. It is anticipated that this REU Site will increase the number of women in Computer Science and Engineering who embark upon graduate studies to pursue careers in industry, government or academia.\r\n\r\n",
