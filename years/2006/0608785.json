 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a research project in Computational Mathematics. Our goal is to \r\nuse new algebraic ideas for the development of algorithms to solve \r\ndiscrete optimization problems. Discrete optimization is the study of \r\noptimization problems in which there are a finite (but usually very large) \r\nnumber of potential solutions. These are not enumerated but rather defined \r\nimplicitly by equation or inequality constraints, e.g., linear or \r\nnonlinear relations. We focus in non-linear integer programs with \r\npolynomial constraints which are notoriously difficult and we explore \r\nseveral non-traditional tools for solving them, including multivariate \r\nrational functions and complex analysis, polynomial Hilbert's \r\nNullstellensatz certificates, and new canonical reformulations for integer \r\nlinear programs. We are also interested on closely related problems in \r\ncomputational convexity. Including the computation of polyhedra related to \r\noptimization, the practical approximation of regions by unions of \r\npolyhedra and the solution of geometric problems using convex programming \r\nmethods.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoftware and algorithms for solving discrete optimization problems has \r\npotential applications to many fields of huge practical importance, such \r\nas data mining, finances and economics, transport scheduling (e.g. crew \r\nscheduling problems), and circuit design. Examples of discrete \r\noptimization problems include the minimum spanning tree problem of \r\nselecting the least expensive network connecting given sites or the \r\ntraveling salesman problem (TSP) consists of selecting the least expensive \r\ntour of a given set of locations. Since most discrete optimization \r\nproblems are useful but very difficult to solve, researchers have explored \r\nspecial structures to be able to solve them in practice (e.g., in the case \r\nof the TSP) or settle for algorithms that compute near-optimal solutions. \r\nIn our project we try non-traditional tools based on recent mathematical \r\nprogress as a way to approach these very difficult problems. We also have \r\na strong educational component for this project. Several graduate and \r\nundergraduate students will all play important roles in the project's \r\ndevelopment.\r\n",
