However, measurements of large-scale time-varying deep deformation along\r\nvertical strike-slip plate boundaries such as the San Andreas Fault have been difficult to obtain,\r\ndue to the limited extent, coverage and sampling frequency of geodetic measurements and the\r\nfundamental trade-offs and assumptions required to infer deep deformation on vertical faults from measurements of surface motion.\r\n\r\nTo more clearly understand the role of deep transient deformation along the San Andreas\r\nFault (SAF) plate boundary in central California, data from new seismic indicators of deep fault\r\nzone deformation are analyzed and compared to geodetic measurements of deformation and\r\nmoderate to large earthquake occurrence. The new seismic indicators are of two types: 1)\r\ncharacteristically repeating microearthquakes (used to inferred deep-fault aseismic slip\r\ninformation) and 2) deep non-volcanic tremor activity (indicators of episodic slow-slip events in\r\nthe deep sub-seismogenic lithosphere).\r\n\r\nThis project will produce a large-scale catalog of tremor activity along 175\r\nkm of the central SAF that does not currently exist and that will likely be of use for related\r\nresearch. The proposed activity will also comprise a component of a graduate student's Ph.D.\r\ndissertation and will be a major component of an undergraduates senior thesis. Results will be\r\ndisseminated to the public through K-12 tours and annual public open houses of the Berkeley\r\nSeismological Lab and to the scientific community scientific community at meetings and in\r\npublication . Results will also be incorporated into an upper-division undergraduate course on\r\nCalifornia Earthquakes (eps 130). Two undergraduates are also participating in the preliminary\r\nand ongoing research through an independent research course (eps 199). Project activities will\r\nbenefit society through public education, education and training of students and by providing\r\ninformation on the complex processes occurring along the SAF plate boundary and the timevarying\r\naspects of slip-deficit accumulation in the region, all of which are critical inputs for the\r\naccurate assessment of the seismic hazard posed by the active tectonics of this region.",
