 "awd_abstract_narration": "Benjamin Widom of Cornell University is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for research on the statistical mechanical theory of liquids and interfaces. The main aspect of the research project is the examination of the line tension, a quantity that is analogous to the surface tension, but which applies to a one-dimensional system. In work previously supported by NSF, Widom determined that the analog of the Gibbs adsorption equation for the surface tension does not apply in the one-dimensional case, a surprising result. In the current project, Widom and his students are carrying out several simulation and verification tests to determine if the prior theoretical predictions are valid. The results are expected to have a broader impact on our understanding of nano-wires and a variety of biological systems, particularly membranes and viruses. Two additional projects are also being carried out:  one involves the interfacial tension between fragments of embryonic tissue which are in contact with one another while the other is a study of the hydrophobic heat capacity.",
