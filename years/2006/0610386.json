 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given a group, one can associate to it a group ring, which is formed from \r\ncomplex linear combinations of group elements. The idempotent conjecture \r\nis that if a group has no elements of finite order, then the only elements \r\nin the group ring which are equal to their own square should be zero or \r\none. This is a completely algebraic statement, which can be re-phrased by \r\nsaying that there are only trivial solutions to a certain finite set of \r\nequations. However, suitably completing the algebraic group ring can turn \r\nit into a geometric object, and the idempotent conjecture can be \r\nreformulated in geometric terms. If the group is commutative, the \r\nidempotent conjecture is known to be true, and to be equivalent to the \r\nconnectedness of the n-dimensional torus. I propose to develop analytical \r\ntools related to the operator norm completion of the group ring to get a \r\nbetter understanding of a more general class of groups, which includes, \r\nfor example, the special linear group SL(n,Z).\r\n\r\nGroups arise in many scientific fields because they encode symmetries of\r\nphysical, biological or other systems, therefore it is important to study\r\nthem. It is impossible to say anything useful about all groups, so we\r\ndivide them into classes and study each class separately. I am interested\r\nin classes of groups that arise as symmetries of geometric objects.\r\nUnderstanding something about the geometry of these objects often can be\r\ntranslated into algebraic information about the group. I plan to develop\r\ntools from algebra and analysis to study these geometric objects, with a\r\nparticular emphasis on understanding geometric properties which only\r\nbecome apparent on a large scale.\r\n",
