 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will focus on three related areas of research in algebraic\r\ngeometry over finite fields. First of all we intend to attack Artin's\r\nconjecture that the Brauer group of a projective surface over a finite\r\nfield is finite. Here do Jong will study especially elliptic surfaces and\r\nsurfaces with ample cotangent bundle. Secondly, de Jong will study the\r\narithmetic fundamental groups of curves over finite fields. Here the\r\nmain questions are concerning the dynamic of the Verschiebung on the\r\nmoduli spaces of bundles, the growth of the fundamental group, and the\r\ndistribution of the Frobenius elements in the fundamental group. And\r\nthirdly, in an ongoing collaboration with others (Starr, Hassett,\r\nTschinkel, et al) de jong will study the geometry of moduli spaces of\r\nrational curves on higher dimensional varieties. Here of\r\nparticular interested are in finding applications to other areas of\r\nresearch. Meanwhile, with the goal of making it easier for graduate\r\nstudents and newcomers to work on these problems, de jong intends to run a\r\nweb-site where collaborative development of introductory texts on the\r\ntopics is done.\r\n\r\nThe area of mathematics that this proposal finds itself in has seen a\r\nlot of progress in the last decade. Nonetheless there are many\r\nimportant problems outstanding. Perhaps the most exiting of these is\r\nArtin's conjecture mentioned above. Among other things it implies the\r\nBirch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for elliptic curves over function\r\nfields of curves over finite fields. An example of such a field is the\r\nfield of rational functions in one variable over a finite field. Many\r\nfamous classical number theoretical questions have their analogue for\r\nsuch function fields, and a number of these, such as the Riemann\r\nHypothesis, have been shown to be true in the function field case. The\r\nreason for this is that people can study curves and more generally do\r\nalgebraic geometry over finite fields, to prove the conjectures. In\r\nthis project we will study geometric approaches to Artin's conjecture,\r\nfor example by thinking about moduli of vector bundles over curves and\r\nsurfaces over finite fields.",
