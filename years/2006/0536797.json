 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to encourage students to consider research careers in biochemistry, cell biology and molecular biology by introducing students to the powerful, versatile, and engaging technique of live-cell fluorescence imaging.  Funds are requested to outfit a teaching laboratory with a fluorescence imaging microscope and a spectrophotofluorometer and to develop a semester-long course entitled, \"Visualizing the Cell.\"  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit.  Because fluorescence is used to study a wide range of biological processes, including cell communication, organelle trafficking, and gene expression, faculty mentors of different expertise can use the same approaches to accommodate students with very different interests.  The proposed activities blend teaching and research in a way that allows students a more authentic view of the scientific process.  The biological subdisciplines addressed by the semester-long course include cell physiology, enzymology, bioenergetics, toxicology, biophysics, cell physiology, pharmacology and signal transduction.  Evaluation includes measuring student learning of different biological concepts and tracking student career trajectories to examine whether or not students prepare themselves for research careers after their immersion into live-cell fluorescence imaging.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact.  The project directly impacts a group of diverse students, including 40% African-Americans.  Dissemination includes collaborative activities with other course instructors, the publication of a laboratory manual, presentations and publications by the PI in education journals, and by student publication and presentations at regional and national professional levels.\r\n",
