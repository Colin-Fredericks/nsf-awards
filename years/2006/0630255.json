 "awd_abstract_narration": "The California State University, San Bernardino is offering $10,000 scholarships to twenty math and science students to support their training as secondary mathematics and science teachers in the San Bernardino City Unified School District (SBCUSD). The program is recruiting high achieving local students who are already connected to the community and familiar with the student population with whom they will be working.\r\n\r\nActivities are focusing on recruitment, support and retention. New and enhanced recruitment strategies are being integrated into existing infrastructure to facilitate sustainability.  Ongoing support includes supervised classroom-based service experiences, extensive mentoring, regular professional development seminars and online peer learning communities.\r\n\r\nOutcomes include:  1) recruiting 20 teachers in mathematics and science; 2) recruiting and retaining all Scholars as interns or as student teachers in SBCUSD; 3) retaining as teachers in SBCUSD, 100% of the Noyce graduates for the full period of their commitment; 5) retaining at least 80% of the Noyce graduates for at least five years beyond their commitment; 6) sustained support and mentoring that includes a peer and faculty/district component; and 7) continuing teacher peer support independent of the Noyce Program by actively participating in professional societies.\r\n\r\nRecruitment efforts are targeting a diverse range of applicants, many of whom are from underrepresented groups.  The program is building capacity by creating recruitment and support strategies that can be sustained beyond NSF funding.  Recruitment vehicles are being designed so that support and articulation activities are sustained within existing infrastructure and so that personnel are prepared to be involved in the recruitment process.  The project is creating a model community of well-prepared teachers that support each other and mentors new teachers as they are recruited.  This model can be disseminated to add to the body of knowledge on best practices regarding recruitment, teacher preparation and retention. \r\n",
