 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for a workshop that will discuss both the need for and design of a center that would promote interaction at the intersection of mathematics and biology that would focus on both proposals from the scientific community and the ability to respond to needs for expertise on relatively short time scales. The workshop will develop ideas that could be used in the future design of such a center. The overall product will be a report that will be available immediately on the web, as well as in a print version after a reasonable amount of time. The report will focus both on issues of the design of a center, the need for a center, what potential issues would arise in funding and operation and evaluation, as well as the kinds of needs that could be met both in terms of scientific advances and training and infrastructure. \r\n\r\nIt is becoming increasingly recognized that the solutions to many essential problems in biology require mathematical approaches. Past successes at combining mathematics and biology have ranged from improving basic theoretical understanding to developing practical solutions to problems of societal importance. Today, many pressing problems require the use of mathematical approaches, including important applied questions, such as the modeling of infectious diseases, ameliorating the effects of human activities on the environment, and understanding the basic biology underlying many animal and plant diseases.\r\n",
