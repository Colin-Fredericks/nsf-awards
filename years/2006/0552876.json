 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site is for a nine-week summer program at Colorado State University. The Site focuses on the scientific study of Mind and Brain, including the topics of perception, cognition, and cognitive neuroscience. Ten students will be selected from across the country, especially undergraduates at ethnic-minority serving institutions and non-Ph.D. granting institutions. Intellectual Merit: The centerpiece of the program is an intensive research experience in which each student participant develops, runs, and analyzes her or his own experiment under the mentorship of a faculty member. In addition, students will complete a course on Mind, Brain, and Behavior; participate in workshops on the use of our state-of the-art equipment (driving simulator, EEG equipment, eyetracker, etc.); participate in additional workshops on experiment construction and data analysis; go on a site visit to the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center to gain experience with fMRI and MEG methods; attend weekly seminar sessions that cover research ethics and professional development; and attend additional meetings in which speakers from other disciplines discuss research and applications pertaining to mind and brain. As a capstone experience, students will present their work at a research symposium held at the end of the nine-week session. Broader Impacts: A central goal of the program is to stimulate interest in the science of mind and brain by integrating research and education, and by providing knowledge, skills, and experiences that are rare at the undergraduate level. In doing so, the program enhances participants' prospects for pursuing graduate study and careers in science, particularly for those participants who do not have comparable opportunities at their home institution. This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",
