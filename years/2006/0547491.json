 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to understand two photon induced polymerization (2PIP) of Ormocer(R) organic-inorganic hybrid materials and evaluate the potential of this technology for fabrication of three-dimensional microstructured medical devices. In 2PIP, femtosecond laser pulses from a laser are used to break chemical bonds on photoinitiator molecules within a small focal volume. These radicalized molecules react with Ormocer(R) monomers to create radicalized polymolecules. The desired structures are fabricated by moving the laser focus in three dimensions using a micropositioning system. The key research activities include: (1) biological, chemical, and mechanical characterization of Ormocer(R) materials created using two photon induced polymerization, (2) structural and functional characterization of Ormocer(R) microneedles and microneedle arrays, and (3) functional characterization of integrated drug delivery devices, which combine microneedles with microscale piezoelectric pumps. \r\n\r\nThis program will also address biomaterials education and underrepresented minority outreach. The PI collaborating with faculty at North Carolina A&T State University on joint research activities, which will provide minority students with hands-on experience in laser materials research; make contacts with minority students and faculty through student symposia; and recruit minority undergraduate students into the UNC/NCSU graduate biomedical engineering program. The PI is also involved with several biomaterials education and training programs, in which the processing, characterization, and application of advanced biomaterials will be discussed. This integrated research and education program will advance the development of medical device microfabrication technologies for the delivery of next generation protein- and DNA- based medicines.\r\n",
