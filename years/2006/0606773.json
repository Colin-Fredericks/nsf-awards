 "awd_abstract_narration": "2005 Gilbert Club meeting\r\nIntellectual merit\r\nThe Gilbert Club has met every year in Berkeley after the Fall American\r\nGeophysical Union since 1983. It has grown from the original 7 participants to, in 2004,\r\nnearly 200, and has been a forum for new ideas, community initiatives, sustained\r\ncommunication, and the building of collegiality. Geomorphology has expanded rapidly\r\nin this 20-year period, and the Gilbert Club has contributed to that evolution. The\r\nmeeting consists typically of three speakers followed at the end of the day with pop-ups\r\nof short reports by any attendee. Until now we have always been completely independent\r\nof any organization, and covered costs of the one-day (and evening) meeting through a\r\nfee. Our costs have grown and this proposal requests funds to reduce the fee we must\r\ncharge the attendees. Because so many of our participants are students, we feel this\r\nsupport is particularly appropriate and needed.\r\nThe meeting is run entirely on volunteer efforts of Berkeley graduate students, but\r\ncosts for room and vehicle rentals, meals, and some travel must be covered by a charge to\r\nthe participant. Here we request $7200 in participant costs, such that we can charge $15\r\nfor day and evening participation and $10 just for the day.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nUnder-represented individuals have been invited in the past and are particularly\r\nsought among the new and emerging group of geomorphologists. We actively seek\r\nnames and track progress in order to make speaker invitations when individuals are ready\r\nto give a substantial presentation. Gilbert Club is openly advertised and anyone is\r\nwelcome to participate.",
