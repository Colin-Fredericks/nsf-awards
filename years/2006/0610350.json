Science education centers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Boston community-based after school centers and the Institute for Learning Innovation evaluation team will collaborate on developing this project resulting in documentation of the program's impact and a portfolio of tools, strategies and curricula. Through presentations at conferences, support from NASA in identifying potential national sites and a year four national conference for 50 professionals to introduce the tool kit the model will be replicated in various forms on a national scale. \r\n\r\nDrawing from existing astronomy program for high school students at the Timothy Smith Network Community Technology Centers, youth apprentices partner with program fellows who are recent college graduates trained in the use of remote telescopes, a related astronomy curriculum and National Institute for Out of School Time's project based learning workshop. The fellows work with the apprentices and build relationships with the after school staff at eight of the TSN centers. The apprentices conduct astronomy investigations in partnership with scientists, the fellows and with the use of remote telescopes. They then translate their personal learning and enthusiasm into outreach programs for younger children, families and community members at a series of after school programs, events, Community Star Parties, and local television shows. The project offers 64 adults from after school programs training and support and 360 young people opportunities to continue in progressive levels of independence and responsibility surrounded by a rich array of resources and advisors. The project evaluation documents the key principles and strategies for success that will be useful to future YAA sites. In Boston the outreach program will reach 700 family members, 600 teens and preteens and 600 senior citizens and adults. When the dissemination plan is in full operation 6500-9500 people across the country will participate in astronomy programs connected to the YAA model and the SAO MicroObservatory Remote Telescope Network. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
