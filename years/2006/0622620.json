 "awd_abstract_narration": "By creating a seamless transition between Oregon high schools, community colleges, and universities, this project is establishing a model for improving the recruitment, transfer, and retention rates of students along that spectrum of educational levels, eventually leading to baccalaureate STEM degrees. Key elements include: early identification of community college and university students with interest in STEM fields; provision of intensive week-long camps and 10-week research projects in the summer; and training in education outreach, peer-led tutoring, academic and career-path mentoring. Following these activities students serve as peer tutors at their home institutions (both community colleges and universities) during the next academic year under the supervision of graduate student and faculty mentors. The intellectual merit of the project lies in the immersion of students in early research experiences - with a special focus on community college students from diverse, non-traditional backgrounds - in order to improve completion rates of physical sciences-related transfer associate degrees, and to boost the numbers who transfer to four-year institutions and complete baccalaureate degrees in these areas. It also tests models for catalytic peer- and near-peer mentoring and tutoring at community colleges and high schools to increase interest in physical sciences and related careers. The project's broader impacts are felt in its targeting of community colleges that have the most diverse group of students engaged in post-secondary education in the state. Through the project's design students from diverse backgrounds are able to mentor, tutor, and otherwise encourage their peers to successfully complete coursework and move into physical sciences careers. Evaluation of the project is providing valuable and needed data to the educational and political leadership in the state as it seeks to improving transitions between high school, community college and four-year institutions.",
