The primary goal is an adjustment of facilities support that will enable progress on the recommendations of the Decade Survey including operations funds for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array and other priorities (the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, the Giant Segmented Mirror Telescope, etc.). At the same time, a healthy core program of astronomical research must be preserved (if not grown). This process is essential to support the scientific programs that will be undertaken with the next generation of facilities, to seed further capability, and to attract, train, and retain the next generation of astronomical researchers.\r\n\r\nHere a \"Town Hall Meeting\" will be hosted by the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities on Friday, 7 October 2005 at a Minneapolis hotel to allow members of the astronomical community to provide input, interact face-to-face with Astronomical Sciences Division staff, ask questions, and express concerns. The comments and ideas collected during these meetings will be included in the process.\r\n",
