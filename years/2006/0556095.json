 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to conduct research on quasirandom analogues of\r\ndiscrete random systems, both as tools for simulation problems\r\nand as objects of study in their own right.  Quasirandom simulation\r\nschemes often are just as fast as random simulations schemes, and \r\nwhen applied to estimation problems typically give smaller error.  \r\nThe PI's research will study such schemes, and will explore new ways \r\nof removing the ``noise'' from random systems while retaining key \r\nfeatures of their average-case behavior, building on earlier work \r\nby the PI, Lionel Levine, Yuval Peres, Josh Cooper, and Joel Spencer, \r\namong others.  The resulting non-random systems exhibit startling \r\nsymmetry and unexpected structure that call out for explanation.\r\n\r\nCurrent technology depends heavily on simulation, and many existing\r\nmethods of simulation make use of randomness, whether or not the\r\nsystem being simulated has a random element to it.  This ``Monte\r\nCarlo Method'' has had huge success in the past century.  My work\r\nwill explore the notion that in many cases, what makes Monte Carlo\r\nwork is not randomness per se but certain regularities that are \r\nconsequences of randomness.  By bringing these regularities to\r\nthe fore and jettisoning randomness itself, one should be able to\r\ndevise general methods of simulation that are more accurate.\r\n",
