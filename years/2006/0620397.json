 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal: Robotics and Intelligent Systems Planning within the Context of the International Advanced\r\nRobotics Programme1\r\n\r\nWilliam R. Hamel, Professor and Head\r\nMechanical, Aerospace, and Biomedical Engineering Department\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is proposed that the United States host a planning meeting in conjunction with the 2006 IEEE\r\nInternational Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) to be held in Orlando, Florida May\r\n14-15, 2006. The planning meeting will be restricted to invitation only. It will incorporate a\r\nworkshop-style environment to facilitate discussion about new ideas and emerging technologies\r\nthat should drive future IARP workshops. The ICRA venue will provide access to world experts\r\nin selected topical areas who will be invited to give position papers on the basic\r\nrobotics/intelligent systems technical areas corresponding to IARP interests: 1)\r\nintelligence/reasoning, 2) perception, 3) action and 4) human interfacing/interaction matters. The\r\nworkshop output will provide assurance that future IARP meetings are based on collective\r\nreasoning about importance and priorities, thus enhancing the value of the overall IARP\r\ninteractions to the US and other country participants.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The planning forum will include plenary keynote presentations from world\r\nexperts in fundamental topics of robotics and intelligent systems. Researchers from the US and\r\nother countries will hear the keynotes and participate in breakout discussions about the most\r\nimportant research challenges that lay ahead. The collective result will be the integration across a\r\nrepresentative subset of the international community as to the key research issues in robotics and\r\nintelligent systems.\r\nBroader Impacts: The planning forum will provide a focused platform for open discussion on key\r\nresearch challenges as viewed by a cross-section of leading international researchers from\r\ngovernment, industry and academia. By virtue of the large number of member countries and\r\nmember affiliates, the results of the planning and the execution of future workshops based on the\r\nplanning, the results will influence research agendas across the globe. The forum will provide\r\neach participating country with a global view of robotics and intelligent systems research interests\r\nand priorities.",
