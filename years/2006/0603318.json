 "awd_abstract_narration": "This UMEB proposal builds upon a successful model developed with initial UMEB funding. New program elements guided by lessons learned through program assessment have been added. The goal is to provide intensive support and mentoring for 24 students from under-represented groups, particularly Native Americans. Student's interest is nurtured beginning freshman year through senior year, using shared student activities in the field as well as on campus. An intensive 2-year experience of mentoring, research and community outreach activities begins in the junior year. A three-stage field experience is initiated by weekend field trips to the Adirondack Ecological Center (AEC) during the freshman and sophomore years, a 5-week summer field course at the Cranberry Lake Biological Station (CLBS) after the sophomore year, and the capstone experience of mentored summer field research at the AEC or CLBS after the junior year. Shared coursework in the field, 4 semesters of focused UMEB seminars and a close-knit community for collaborative learning are hallmarks of the program. Students also work with a stewardship mentor-- a scientist from a collaborating environmental organization or agency. Research projects are student-driven under the theme of \"Science and Stewardship in the Adirondacks\".  The proposed activities bridge the gap between traditional classroom learning and application of the knowledge in the field. Pairing of students with professional stewardship mentors from the conservation community benefits both UMEB students and the work of stewardship organizations. Communication of research results via community outreach programs will benefit ESF partners in the Adirondack Mountains by further integrating sound science into decision-making.\r\n\r\n",
