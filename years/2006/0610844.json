 "awd_abstract_narration": "The family Vespertilionidae contains about 376 species of small, primarily insectivorous, bats with a worldwide distribution.  Unfortunately, our understanding of the evolutionary relationships within this family of bats is seriously lacking.  Given that vespertilionids comprise approximately 34% of all bat species and about 8% of all species of mammals, this paucity of knnowledge is surprising.  Therefore, the objectives of this study are to elucidate the phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships of vespertilionid bats through the generation of DNA sequence data from 7 nuclear genes.  These newly generated data will be combined with mitochondrial DNA sequences previously generated for these same taxa.  Data from all 8 loci will be analyzed using a variety of phylogenetic methods.\r\n\r\nOver the last decade, viruses responsible for 3 diseases potentially deadly to humans (Hendra, Nipah, and SARS) have been traced to bats.  Although the viral component is not part of this project, it is obvious that if virologists and epidemiologists are to understand the evolution of viruses carried by bats, it is paramount to have a clear understanding of the taxonomy and evolutionary relationships of bats they are sampling.  Thus, elucidating the evolutionary relationships and taxonomy of vespertilionid bats is not only critical to our understanding of the adaptive radiation of this remarkably successful group, but also to the field of virology and potential human health issues.\r\n",
