 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at North Carolina State University for the summers of 2006-2008. The program director is Lin He who is assisted by co-PI Paul Maggard. Nine students each year will do chemical research in the fields of materials science and life science. Special efforts will be made to assist students in career and academic decisions by broadening their perspectives on chemical research careers and by providing research opportunities for rising juniors/seniors of all backgrounds with demonstrated academic excellence. The program goals will be accomplished by developing a program that focuses on independent research projects as the central foundation, with incorporation of facility tours, a research presentation and conference participation that complements the research experience. Participants will have an exposure to government and industrial research experiences through invited seminars and on-site laboratory visits. Students will also have the opportunity to present their work at a National ACS Meeting in the spring following their summer internship. Recruiting efforts will focus on the inclusion of underrepresented minority groups, particular consideration will be given to rising juniors/seniors from HBCUs in the southeast region.",
