 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will extend the applicability of the multi-environment probability density function (MEPDF) method to model turbulent combustion problems with realistic chemical kinetics within comprehensive Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations of practical combustion equipment. The project aims to further advance the MEPDF method by extending it to simulate industrially relevant single-phase and two-phase combustion systems, such as chemical process furnaces fired with lean pre-mixed gas burners; oil fired utility boilers and industrial furnaces; and coal gasification equipment. \r\n\r\nThe proposed activities for extending the MEPDF method to simulate practical combustion systems using complex chemical kinetics would result in a tool that will enhance the scientific and engineering knowledge base for these processes. The advanced simulation tools produced from this project would provide a means for companies in the power generation, chemical process, mineral process, and incineration industries to improve product designs and services, which in-turn would benefit the environment, global competitiveness and national/homeland security.  \r\n",
