The proposed activities are intended to comprise the most comprehensive study to date of protoplanetary disks around low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, and to help determine the abundance and diversity of planetary systems in the universe. \r\n\r\nDr. Luhman will undertake educational activities that consist of: 1) developing a new graduate course on extrasolar planets and planet formation; 2) involving undergraduate and graduate students in both research and educational activities; 3) guiding projects in astronomy by middle- and high-school students in the research competitions of the Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science; 4) participating in the astronomy training of middle- and high-school educators through the Penn State Inservice Workshops in Astronomy; 5) initiating a new elderhostel on astronomy at Penn State University; and 6) disseminating to the general public the discoveries from his research activities through press releases and public lectures.\r\n",
