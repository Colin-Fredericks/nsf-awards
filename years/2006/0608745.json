 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is a fundamental exploration of nanomaterials that can be utilized to create an architecture of optical biosensing devices with unique sensitivities and capabilities. The research will leverage both functionalized quantum dot development and protein resonance energy transfer in order to fabricate the next-generation of nanosized fluorescence-based biosensing probes that measure intrinsic conformational changes induced by antigen binding to an antibody. The approach involves an investigation of quantum dot functionalization schemes and characterization in terms of optical properties and biofunctionalities.  The resulting nanoprobes are based on fluorescently-labeled cardiac troponin-I antibodies to the functionalized quantum dots. Sensor performance will be determined.  Cardiac troponin-I will be utilized as a model system to test the capability of the newly-developed nanoprobes.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThis research explores the development of unique nanoprobes that integrate the optical properties of nanoscale materials with fluorescently-labeled antibodies to develop a resonance energy transfer system capable of detecting biomolecular interactions.  The research will be a significant advancement over existing knowledge in terms of enhanced sensor performance, and would provide a foundation to launch new sensor technologies.  These unique nanoprobes will have an enormous impact on a wide range of applications relating to national security, health care, the environment, energy, food safety, and manufacturing.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe research also includes a prominent educational component and outreach to groups underrepresented in engineering and the sciences, including undergraduate student researchers recruited from regional college programs and dissemination of nanoscience to the general public.  \r\n",
