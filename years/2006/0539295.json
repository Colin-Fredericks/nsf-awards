 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will evaluate the technical and commercial feasibility of producing nanotube and nanoparticle \"masterbatches\" in selected high-performance thermoplastics using specifically tailored POSS components as dispersing agents. Polymer modification with carbon nanotubes and other nanoparticles is the subject of extensive research and interest because of the potential to produce dramatically enhanced mechanical, electrical and thermal properties.  Current commercial use of carbon nanotubes in polymers, however, is limited to only a few specialized applications due chiefly to difficulties in obtaining adequate dispersion of the nanoparticles in the polymer matrix, which is critical to achieve the desired properties. Unlike many other nanoparticles, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) nanoparticles are easily dispersed in a wide range of polymer matrices. This is achieved by tailoring the chemical structure of the POSS molecule for compatibility with the specific polymer resin. \r\n\r\nCommercially, conductive, transparent engineering thermoplastic nanocomposites based on POSS/carbon nanotube dispersions could find immediate application in a wide range of high-tech products including antistatic and/or shielding plastics for displays, electronic packaging, computer and business equipment products, and aircraft canopies. The market for conductive plastics alone is estimated at $1 billion for 2005. In addition, a prominent  plastics manufacturer has shown interest in commercialization of the POSS  masterbatches at the completion of Phase I. \r\n\r\n",
