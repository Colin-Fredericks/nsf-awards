 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU Site at Heritage University (HU) will provide research experiences in the biological sciences to Native American and Hispanic students, in partnership with the University of California at Davis and University of Puget Sound.  Students will conduct their research at HU and partnering institutions, under the guidance of faculty mentors.  The objectives of the program are 1) to engage students in research projects related to molecular biology and understanding of plant genetics, 2) to develop the skills of undergraduates in order to enhance their scientific knowledge and competency, and 3) to enhance students' self-esteem and self-identities, while conducting biological research integrated with their culture and history. The goal is to expose students to interesting and relevant scientific projects to facilitate the completion of, and further advancement in, their academic career, through attainment of BS, MS or PhD degree.  Students will receive training on their chosen project and in the preparation of oral presentations and written reports. Students will present their findings at an annual REU workshop and at national meetings of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science, the American Indian Science and Engineering Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Salary, room and board will be provided.  The REU program is expected to increase the number of Native American and Hispanic STEM graduates, especially those with background knowledge and skills in molecular biology and genetics.
