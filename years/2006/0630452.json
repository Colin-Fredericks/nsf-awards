 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Robert Noyce Scholarship Program at California State University Northridge (CSUN) is increasing the number of mathematics and science majors entering teaching careers, as well as improving the preparation they receive at CSUN prior to their teaching. Based on the three principles of (a) aggressive recruitment, (b) strong mentoring, and (c) continuous assessment, the project is identifying and preparing selected talented and motivated undergraduate majors, post-baccalaureate, and STEM professionals for the teaching credential program, and strengthening the existing partnership with the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD).  Two-year scholarships are offered to outstanding juniors in the two- and four-year integrated degree/credential programs in mathematics, as well as to senior math majors in the Secondary Teaching Option who have committed to an additional credential year. In addition, the program offers two-year scholarships to undergraduate junior-level science majors, one-year scholarships to postbaccalaureate CSUN science graduates electing a fifth credential year, and final-year stipends to STEM professionals taking additional courses at CSUN in pursuit of science teaching careers.  The two- and four-year integrated options of the Mathematics degree and teacher preparation program combine mathematics content and pedagogy through concurrent coursework and pedagogical content courses. The program includes early and ongoing field experiences, an emphasis on adolescence and urban schools, specialized academics and professional advisement and access to program classes. Students earn a bachelor's degree in mathematics and a mathematics teaching credential in four years. Thirty new Noyce-funded teachers are being produced over the duration of the project. Noyce Scholars participate in a weekly Noyce Seminar that challenges the scholarship/stipend recipients to deeply consider broader issues of mathematics and science content and pedagogy related to their future teaching positions.  The CSUN Noyce project is collecting data that allows comparison of integrated versus traditional teacher preparation programs.  \r\n",
