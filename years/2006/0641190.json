 "awd_abstract_narration": "Imaging a Natural Experiment in Drainage Divide Migration\r\nIntellectual Merit - The objective of this proposal is to acquire and analyze highresolution\r\ndigital topography data for an ~18km2 field site in the Colorado high plains\r\nthat represents a natural experiment in scarp retreat and drainage divide migration.\r\nThe site offers a unique opportunity to document landform development and test\r\nphysically based landscape evolution theory under differential baselevel control. The\r\nlarger importance is two-fold. First, drainage divide migration is a fundamental aspect\r\nof landscape response to tectonics, eustasy, and other forms of baselevel control.\r\nSecond, testing physically based landscape evolution models requires natural\r\nexperiments that involve a transient response to a known forcing factor, such as\r\nbaselevel. High-resolution, research-grade laser altimetry data are essential to\r\nachieving these goals because standard USGS digital elevation data lack the necessary\r\nresolution and accuracy to document the topographic signatures of the governing\r\nprocesses, extract statistics for model-data comparison, and map incised surfaces. The\r\nproject is timely because the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM)\r\nwill launch a mission to acquire data from other sites in Colorado this summer. The\r\ncost of data will be significantly lower if the data for the study area are collected\r\nduring NCALM's 2006 Colorado mission. The data will be analyzed to determine\r\ncharacteristic topographic signatures, including slope and curvature maps and\r\nfrequency distributions, slope-area diagrams, area aggregation indices, and related\r\nmetics. They will also be used to reconstruct the former extent of a series of incised\r\nvalley fills and upland surfaces. These data, when combined with timing constraints\r\non cut and fill events, will provide a unique method for testing landscape evolution\r\nmodels and their predictions about divide migration in response to differential\r\nbaselevel lowering. Exploratory iterative forward modeling using the CHILD model\r\nwill be used to identify process laws and parameter sets that can and cannot account\r\nfor the observed topography and soil thickness. Success in this project is expected to\r\nseed a larger effort that will generate geochronology data, real-time process\r\nmonitoring, and sediment-yield estimates, resulting in a comprehensive data set for\r\nuse by the research community in testing other landform evolution models. Note that\r\nin addition to the budget requested in this proposal, funds are also requested for data\r\nacquisition by NCALM. If funded, the University of Florida will request a\r\nsupplemental budget for these expenses.\r\nBroader Impacts - The broader impacts of this research fall into several categories.\r\nThe high-resolution altimetry data will directly support the dissertation research of a\r\nPh.D. student at the University of Colorado, thus contributing to teaching, training,\r\nand learning. The project enhances infrastructure by providing the scientific\r\ncommunity with altimetry data and associated information for a valuable research\r\nsite; in addition to its geomorphic importance, the area encompasses a world-famous\r\nterrestrial Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary section. Broad dissemination will be ensured\r\nnot only through the usual routes of publications and conferences, but also by\r\nproviding data and images to the Plains Conservation Center, a non-profit land\r\nconservation and public education organization that owns the site, and to the Denver\r\nMuseum of Natural Science, which leads research on the K-T boundary section and\r\nhas a strong track record in research-based public outreach related to the geology of\r\nthe Denver Basin. Benefits to society include advances in our understanding of soil\r\nerosion, transport, and deposition, which is applicable to land management.",
