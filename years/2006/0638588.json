The mission of the I/UCRC is to serve as a center of excellence for the creation and dissemination of a systematic body of knowledge in precision forming and fabrication of lightweight-high strength materials of interest in this century, and ultimately to impact the next-generation products and production systems with precision, responsiveness and near-zero waste.  The objectives of this I/UCRC are to explore, conduct research and to bring about innovation and practical solutions by focusing on industrially relevant research needs; foster collaborative and interdisciplinary research projects between industrial and academic engineers and scientists; and promote intra-university research activities and prepare the next generation of engineering graduates for the metal forming industry.",
