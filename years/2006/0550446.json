 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the  conduct of a public opinion study of the Nicaraguan\r\nnational elections to be held in November of 2006. It builds on the authors' previously\r\npublished analysis of national presidential elections and regime transition in Nicaragua\r\nfrom 1990 through 2001. That study, Learning Democracy: Citizen Engagement and Electoral Choice in Nicaragua 1990-2001 (University of Chicago Press, 2005), was supported in part by NSF funding.\r\nThe previous study examined the capacity of the poor and poorly educated Nicaraguan\r\nelectorate to engage in reasoned vote choice amidst severe systemic crisis that threatened\r\ntheir everyday lives. In doing so, it looked extensively at citizen attitudes and evolving\r\nvote intent during the 1990 presidential election in which the two major candidates\r\nproposed different regime directions to resolve the systemic crisis, which included civil\r\nwar, economic embargo and economic deterioration. The study then analyzed the processes\r\nthrough which the new conservative democratic regime addressed the crisis and the voting\r\nbehavior through which citizens reaffirmed its hold on power in the 1996 and 2001\r\nelections. Across the three elections, the study documented the sophisticated reasoning\r\ncapacities -- both retrospective and prospective -- that Nicaraguans brought to their vote\r\ndecisions. These findings suggest that such citizens may be more capable of democratic\r\ncitizenship than dominant public opinion studies suggest, even when faced with system\r\ncrisis.\r\nThe current study returns to Nicaragua in 2006 to examine citizens'\r\ndecision-making capacities as the nation faces new crises -- issues of constitutional\r\nauthority, power usurpation, party system upheaval and electoral manipulation -- that\r\ncould derail democratic consolidation. At issue is the ability of the voting citizenry to\r\ncomprehend and respond to institutional/procedural crises that are relatively removed from\r\ntheir everyday lives but can nevertheless have disastrous consequences for them and the\r\ndemocratic structure of their nation. The study thus speaks directly to the roles that\r\nthird-world voters can play in struggles for democratic consolidation as their nations\r\nmove beyond the initial transition to electoral democracy and confront the 'dark and\r\nhidden side' of democracy, including parliamentary intrigue, complicated struggles over\r\nconstitutional power, and electoral and party rules that can inhibit rather than foster\r\nresponsive democratic choice.\r\nThe investigation examines citizen attitudes and vote decision\r\nmaking across the six months prior to the November elections and during the weeks\r\nfollowing them. Surveys are national in scope.\r\nThe proposal's intellectual merit lies in addressing a core puzzle in survey research that\r\nhas received scarce attention: the capacity of poorly educated third world citizens to\r\nreason in their vote decisions in systematic ways analogous to voters in established\r\ndemocracies. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts include (1) clarifying for national policy makers the\r\nexpectations they can hold of third world citizens as they craft policies in support of\r\ndemocratization;(2)fostering reassessment of views that stress the limited decision\r\ncapacity of poorly educated citizens in an established democracy, including among ethnic and racial minorities; and (3) spurring rigorous public opinion research by other scholars and advanced doctoral students into vote decision making by third world citizens and poor\r\ncitizens internationally.\r\n\r\n",
