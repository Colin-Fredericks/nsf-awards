The REU site builds upon prior experience over the last eight years of successful REU sites at USC. This program focuses on two core research areas related to Green Chemistry: (1) catalysis and (2) hydrogen technology (i.e. production, storage and use of hydrogen for the hydrogen economy).  The site will involve 10 chemical engineering undergraduate students, over a ten-week summer program.  They will join eight other REU students supported on a materials research REU grant for a cross- disciplinary research experience. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the program are: (1) encourage students to continue their studies and seek research careers in chemical engineering; (2) help them to realize the employment and research opportunities available in chemical engineering aspects of sustainable technologies; (3) enhance professional development and communication skills; and (4) provide a rewarding experience by exposing them to outside classroom faculty-student interaction.  The program provides not only stimulating research opportunities, but it also offers a variety of social events and group activities designed to foster interaction among the REU students, undergraduates, graduate students, industrial representatives and participating faculty. The proposed group activities include a research communication studio, tours of industrial sites, participant-led laboratory tours, workshops on graduate studies, an ethics seminar in science and engineering, a welcoming reception and a final research symposium, and the various social activities.   \r\n",
