The workshop also will address social and legal barriers to the sustainability of urban water resources and develop practical approaches to overcome those barriers. The topic of this workshop is relevant to the CLEANER-Hydrologic Observatory Network, and representatives from these initiatives will participate in the workshop. An interdisciplinary team of experts will organize the workshop, which will be co-funded by the Johnson Foundation and CDM, Inc. The workshop will engage both young and senior members of the academic communities in environmental and water resources engineering in a meaningful and focused dialogue and will produce an edited proceedings for publication as a book.",
