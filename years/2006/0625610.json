 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nPower generation from Fuel Cell (FC) systems involve interplay of various attributes\r\nfrom its chemical, fluid, mechanical, thermal, electrical, and electronic subsystems. This\r\nstudy concentrates on the process that describes the reactant and water dynamics in a\r\nproton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. While computational fluid dynamic models\r\nhave been gainfully used to represent this process and aid in the design of fuel cell\r\nsystems, they are difficult to calibrate for large stacks and too complex for control design.\r\nAny model-based control scheme used for water management must adequately trade-off\r\nsimplicity while still being able to predict the dynamic behavior of the vapor and liquid\r\nphase transport, and consequently electrode flooding. The goal of this project is to extract\r\ntractable models of the two-phase, reaction-diffusion, spatially distributed water\r\ndynamics for parameterization and model-based control of fuel cells. Discretization and\r\nmodel order reduction techniques will be employed to reveal the dominant processes and\r\nparameters. Analytic methods for the identifiably and parameter convergence problem\r\nwill be supplemented with unique experimental methods. The results from this project\r\nwill be used jointly with NIST to develop guidelines for parameterization and estimation\r\nof water in FCs. The models will be used in the last phase of the project for water\r\nmanagement, namely, predicting, detecting, and avoiding flooding or de-hydration.\r\nFuel cell systems promise to be an attractive alternative to traditional energy systems\r\nsuch as gas turbines and internal combustion engines, as they are cleaner and more fuelefficient.\r\nMore importantly, they enable the goals of reduced dependence on foreign oil\r\nand ease the transition to a hydrogen based economy. However, before the successful\r\ncommercialization of Fuel Cell technology in transportation and stationary power\r\napplications, a critical need for increasing the life-time and robustness of these systems\r\nhas to be addressed. This project seeks to address this challenge by developing and\r\nimplementing advanced control methodologies for these fuel cell systems.",
