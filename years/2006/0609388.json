 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is the synthesis and characterization of multiferroic ferromagnetic-ferroelectric nanowire heterostructures in order to fundamentally understand the dual functionality of the magneto-electric effect in novel one-dimensional systems. Multiferroics are materials in which at least two of the ferroelectric, ferro/antiferro-magnetic and ferroelastic phases co-exist. The coupling of these magnetic, electronic and shape altering properties, referred to as a magneto-electric effect, allows for unique dual functionality in a single-phase or composite material system. The approach will be to fabricate core-shell nanowire heterostructures of CoFe2O4 - BaTiO3 using vapor phase and solution synthesis techniques. To rationalize the active properties as a function of synthesis conditions and geometry, detailed materials characterization of the composite nanostrustructure will be conducted using transmission electron microscopy. The magnetic, ferroelectric and magnetoelectric properties of the synthesized nanowires will be quantified using various methods. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n The relatively unexplored nanostructured geometry for multiferroics offers several possibilities to understand and exploit the coupling effects between ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials. The development of composite magnetoelectric nanowires provides for potentially new technological opportunities in novel memory storage media, actuators, transducers and several other real-time sensor applications. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe research results will be directly interfaced with the industrial sponsors of the multi-disciplinary Center for Materials for Information Technology at the University of Alabama through yearly workshops. This will provide faculty and students unique opportunities to disseminate the research results. The research project will also help direct an underrepresented student into a research orientated career through participation in the summer research experience for undergraduate (REU) program.\r\n",
