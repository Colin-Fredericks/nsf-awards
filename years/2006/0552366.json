 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past decade, advances in molecular techniques and analytical methods have revolutionized studies of the behavior, mating systems, social organization, and population dynamics of wild primates.  These advances have also yielded both theoretical and practical insight into issues relevant to primate phylogenetics and conservation and have provided an important window into understanding the adaptive significance of molecular variation, both within and between primate taxa.  At this juncture, a major new synthesis of the discipline of Molecular Primatology is both opportune and crucial, not only for reviewing the current state of the field but also for providing a forward-looking view on where the field can and should go. \r\nWith this in mind, we have organized an international conference entitled Molecular Primatology: Progress and Promise to be held at New York University in March, 2006.  Focusing on four major and cross-cutting areas of research in modern molecular anthropology (Molecular Ecology, Conservation Genetics, Molecular Diversity and Adaptaion, and Behavioral Genetics and Comparative Genomics), the conference will draw together 21 cutting-edge scientists - plus graduate students and post-doctoral members of their research groups - for three days of formal presentations, poster sessions, and small working group meetings in which we will explore both theoretical and practical aspects of how molecular data can be used in studies of primate biology and evolution.\r\nSituated at the interface of anthropology and evolutionary biology, the field of Molecular Primatology is fast-moving and growing rapidly; this conference will serve to synthesize and showcase current developments in the field and to chart a course for future work.  Moreover, because no other forum exists for assembling the diverse, interdisciplinary group of researchers currently conducting molecular research on primates, the conference will offer a unique and unprecedented opportunity for dialog, discussion, and intellectual interchange among the set of invitees and will foster the development of new research partnerships and collaborative connections between research groups from around the globe.  Finally, the various public components of the conference and its follow-up will promote the education, training, and involvement of younger scientists and directly benefit the large and active group of faculty, postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduates engaged in both primatological and molecular research in New York City and the surrounding area.\r\n",
