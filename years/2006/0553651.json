This technique has the potential to develop an all solid-state cryocooler for a variety of applications such as sensor cooling. To date, solids have been cooled from room temperature to 208 K (temperature difference T = 92K). We propose to enhance the cooling performance using nanopowders, to T = 170 K. Absorption is increased by (a) increasing the population of participating electrons through dopant concentration optimization, (b) increasing the number of photons in the interacting volume by photon localization in nanopowders, and (c) increasing the number of participating phonons by phonon density of states optimization using nanoparticle size effect. This enhanced laser cooling performance will be demonstrated by a combined theoretical, computational and experimental investigation.  To our knowledge, this will be the first attempt of laser cooling in nanostructured solids, and the first time to bring laser cooling performance to cryogenic temperature range.  With respect to Broader Impacts, the emergence of nanotechnology has increased the science content of the engineering research and education. This proposed project is part of the PI's continuous and systematic effort to include more physical fundamentals into an integrated and current academic research-education program in heat transfer.\r\n",
