 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\nSoftware vulnerabilities have been the biggest culprit behind cyber\r\nattacks in the past several years. A handful of vulnerabilities, such as\r\nbuffer overflows, format string, SQL injection, command injection,\r\ncross-site scripting, and directory traversals, have come to dominate,\r\naccounting for about 70% of the CVE vulnerabilities reported in the last\r\ntwo years. Although that these vulnerabilities are well understood and\r\ndocumented, their number continues to escalate from one year to the next.\r\nNew vulnerabilities continue to be discovered in recently released\r\nsoftware, as well as established software.\r\n\r\nThis will develop novel techniques for defending applications from known\r\nas well as unknown attacks, and for immunizing applications from future\r\nattack instances. The proposed approach can thus protect the integrity as\r\nwell as the availability of vulnerable applications. A central component\r\nof the proposed approach is an efficient fine-grained dynamic taint\r\nanalysis that tracks the flow of untrusted information through a\r\nvulnerable program. Both specification-based and anomaly-based attack\r\ndetection techniques can be made highly versatile and accurate by using\r\nfine-grained taint, and can stop the wide range of attacks mentioned\r\nabove. Taint analysis will also form the basis of an immunization\r\ntechnique that is based on learning input filters that characterize\r\nattack-bearing inputs, and selectively discarding such inputs.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work can address multi-billion dollar losses experienced due\r\nto cyber attacks, since it can stop most types of exploits before they\r\ncause damage. To maximize impact, the techniques developed in the project\r\nwill be implemented into open-source software prototypes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
