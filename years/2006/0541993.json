 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nRed Raider Mini-Symposium, November 17-19, 2005 : \"Geometry, Statistics \r\nand Image Analysis\" focuses on nonparametric statistics on manifolds,\r\nanalyzes on shape spaces, saddlepoint approximations and systems\r\ntheory leading to frontiers of science in medical imaging, system\r\nreliability, survival analysis, pattern recognition and\r\nbioinformatics. Principal speakers are Rudy Beran, University of\r\nCalifornia Davis, internationally renowned for his contributions\r\nto robust statistics, directional data analysis, and\r\nbootstrapping; Rabindra Bhattacharya, University of Arizona,\r\ninternationally renowned for his contributions to large sample\r\ntheory, Edgeworth expansions and bootstrapping, statistics on\r\nmanifolds and stochastic partial differential equations; Ronald\r\nButler, Colorado State University, internationally renowned for\r\nhis contributions to saddlepoint methods, systems theory and\r\nstochastic networks, special function approximations, robustness\r\nand likelihood inference; John Kent, University of Leeds, United\r\nKingdom, internationally renowned for his contributions to\r\nmultivariate statistics, shape analysis and stochastic models for\r\nprotein structure, robustness, spatial statistics, tomography;\r\nPeter Kim, University of Guelph, Canada, internationally renowned\r\nfor his contributions to the interface between geometry and\r\nstatistics, density estimation on Riemannian manifolds and\r\napplications of statistics to image acquisition, Madan Puri,\r\nIndiana University, internationally renowned for his contributions\r\nto nonparametric statistics, splines, tests of normality, fuzzy\r\nsets and measures, stochastic processes, statistics of directional\r\ndata, random sets, and time series and Anuj Srivastava, nationally\r\nrenowned for his contributions to \"image understanding\" which aims\r\nto develop automated systems that can match human abilities in\r\nanalyzing images.\r\n\r\nThis symposium is conceived to bring together outstanding researchers\r\nworking in the interface of geometry, statistics and image\r\nanalysis and consists of a series of lectures by outstanding\r\nscholars in vibrant areas of mathematics and statistics, with\r\nimportant applications in astronomy and geophysics, homeland\r\nsecurity, medical imaging, computer vision and pattern\r\nrecognition. These lectures provide an opportunity to learn about\r\nnew research venues for the members of the statistical community,\r\nespecially early career researchers and graduate students\r\nincluding women and under represented minorities. This\r\nmini-symposium provides a perfect medium for interaction and\r\ncollaboration between the conference participants and the\r\ndistinguished speakers. It will be very helpful for shaping future\r\ndirections of statistical research that address problems of high\r\nsocietal impact.",
