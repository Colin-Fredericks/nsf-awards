 "awd_abstract_narration": ".This Small Business Innovation Research aims to describes an innovative approach to develop a high-power-density, thin-film based anode-supported protonic. The target performance is, at a minimum, 0.5 W/cm2 at a temperature as low as 650C. This represents a fourfold increase over existing reported data, and the temperature is several hundred degrees lower. The work will consist of the preparation of the proper anode support, deposition of the thin films using  proprietary coating technique, and testing the electrochemical performance and stability of the cells.\r\n\r\nThe technology described in this proposal will advance P-SOFCs from a laboratory curiosity to a serious commercial contender for clean and efficient power generation. The high power density and the reduced temperature operation of the proposed P-SOFC cells will not only make the device more suitable for real-world applications but will also result in significantly lower capital cost. If deployed in large markets, such as residential, remote and distributed power generations, high efficiency PSOFCs will enable significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, thereby contributing to curve down the global warming trend.  \r\n\r\n",
