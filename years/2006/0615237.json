 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organizations of all sizes have been purchasing an increasing number\r\nof single-function computing appliances, such as firewalls, mail\r\nfilters, Web caches, etc. With the increasing power of commodity\r\nprocessors and hardware, these appliances are often server-class PCs\r\nwith the operating system and software pre-configured to match the\r\nhardware. While this approach provides some initial simplicity, its\r\nlong-term problems can include a proliferation of machines that\r\nrequire individual OS updates, are harder to upgrade, and that cannot\r\nbenefit from server consolidation.\r\n\r\nThis research investigates operating system support for\r\nappliance-style server development without complete hardware\r\nisolation.  Some of the mechanisms investigated involve\r\nhardware-assisted virtual machines, \"soft\" virtual machines using OS\r\ncontext support, fine-grained resource isolation and accounting, and\r\nmore explicit resource management interfaces. Such OS support reduces\r\nthe resource consumption footprints of each server, and provides\r\nmechanisms to share common infrastructure across previously isolated\r\nappliances. As a result, developers still retain the benefit of\r\npre-tuned OS and server configurations, without incurring the\r\nmaintenance overheads for the shared portions of the appliance.\r\n\r\nThis research will produce operating systems modifications to aid\r\nconsolidating server appliances. We will modify servers to use these\r\nfeatures, to demonstrate that they can reduce their resource\r\nconsumption, become more predictable, and also become easier to\r\nprogram in the process. We will release the modified operating system\r\nand demonstrate it with suitable servers that previously would have\r\nbeen run on separate hardware platforms. As processors become faster,\r\nand the number of cores increases, this research will simplify\r\ncomputing infrastructure.\r\n",
