 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides 12 undergraduates with an intensive eight-week summer educational research experience in psychology at Oklahoma State University. Intellectual Merit - Students learn all aspects of the research process, including hypothesis formulation, integration and analysis of scientific literature, study design, data collection, data analysis, and oral and written presentation of findings. Students join research teams in the areas of invertebrate learning, children's cognitive and social development, adult cognition, personality, and language acquisition and conduct their own independent projects in consultation with a faculty mentor.  Students attend weekly seminars focused on statistics, research methods, and preparing for the graduate school application process. To maximize exposure to multiple areas of research, they attend seminars in which faculty mentors present their research.  Finally, students are paired with graduate student mentors and serve as mentors themselves to high school students. Students present their work at a one-day public mini conference that caps off the REU experience. Broader Impacts - The project integrates research and education. The REU scholars are taught the steps to conduct research and also receive instruction in a variety of topics mentioned. Many students present their projects at professional meetings. Recruitment procedures identify students who would benefit the most from this type of experience. Students are purposely recruited who might not have otherwise had the chance to undertake an independent research project.  Dissemination activities include a website, conferences, and a presentation to high school students.  Students gain an immense amount of experience in a short time. This makes them more competent scientists, and better consumers of science. Moreover, these students take their knowledge and passion back to their communities, thus affecting many lives.\r\n",
