 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides renewed support for a series of annual summer activities of the Center for Game Theory in Economics designed to stimulate and disseminate new advances in research on game theory and its applications, and to make conceptual and methodological developments in game theory available to an expanding group of scientists in economics and other disciplines.  Each summer the Center holds research-oriented conferences and workshops and, on occasion, an intensive course of instruction on a topic of major significance, complemented by a further period of informal research activities. This brings together a large international group of researchers--a mix of established scholars, junior faculty, and graduate students--whose interests represent a diverse array of theoretical and applied aspects of game theory.  The programs for 2006-2008 are a continuation of the series of summer activities held at Stony Brook from 1990 to 2005, each of which attracted about 120 participants on average. Formal activities normally include a five-day conference with plenary and parallel sessions, and invited and contributed papers; two workshops on selected themes; and from time to time one to two weeks of intensive instruction on selected topics. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this this format and approach are evident in the success of the previous programs in extending the frontiers of research in pure game theory and expanding the scope of applications in economics and other fields.   This conference series also makes special efforts to promote young scholars including doctoral students by giving them a platform to present their research and obtain feedback from both their seniors and their peer group.",
