 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general subject of the proposed research is the physics underlying the standard model of particle physics. Much of this work is guided by a search for the resolution of the hierarchy problem, but it is also motivated by the search for understanding possible implications of string theory and cosmology for low-energy dynamics and vice versa. \r\nThe majority of this proposal is focused on the study of the physics of extra dimensions, primarily in a context with a warped geometry. The study of extra dimensional physics has gained tremendous momentum in the last few years with the recognition of the importance of branes. Not only does it mean that not all particles necessarily probe the full dimensions of space, but it also gives rise to new and important solutions to Einstein's equations. \r\nThe research that the researcher has been doing and intends to continue concerns several arenas of extra dimensional physics. She will pursue the study of phenomenological implications of these theories. She will also further pursue some of the more theoretical implications of warped geometries. In particular, the locally localized gravity work has many possible implications that have only begun to be explored. Furthermore, it is of interest to find other localizing geometries with higher codimension. Finally, investigations into cosmology, both in an extra-dimensional and four-dimensional contexts, will be pursued. \r\nThere will be continued intense involvement in public outreach to convey the scientific goals of particle physics and string theory. The researcher has recently completed a book about particle physics, string theory, and extra dimensions entitled Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions. By giving further public lectures and writing magazine and newspaper articles related to these subjects, she intends to educate people about the science that particle physicists and string theorists pursue.",
