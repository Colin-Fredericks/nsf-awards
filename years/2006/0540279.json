 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thirteen/WNET New York will develop and produce ten new episodes for a fifth season of Cyberchase.  Broadcast daily on 340 PBS stations, Cyberchase has helped millions of children acquire a stronger foundation in mathematics.  Cyberchase's content spans the 3rd-5th grade standards of the National Council of Mathematics.  Ancillary materials, outreach and a highly popular Web site extend the learning and help make Cyberchase the sole mathematics media project available for the target age group of 8 to 11 year-olds.  The new season will introduce a new campaign, \"Math & Inventions:  My Big Idea\", to link mathematics and technology education and involve children in the invention process.  These new programs will enrich the series' content while keeping viewers tuning in to the current shows.  Plans include enhancing the Web site, building the inventory of multi-media outreach activities, strengthening the show's presence in after-school programs, and launching a new relationship with the museum community.  Multimedia Research will conduct formative evaluation of two new elements to \"My Big Idea\" and a prototype of the online \"Invention Machine.\"  MediaKidz Research and Consulting (MRC) will conduct the pilot phase of a groundbreaking research study to evaluate the impact of varied media, and the interactions between the television series, Web site and outreach components, on children's mathematical thinking and attitudes toward mathematics.\r\n\r\n",
