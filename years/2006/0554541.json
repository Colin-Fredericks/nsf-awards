 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference was designed to assist districts and schools across the state to develop strategic and coherent plans for professional development in mathematics to improve instruction and achieve higher levels of mathematical learning for all students. There will be two weeklong summer conferences for participants to experience and analyze the potential merits of five innovative professional development resources for elementary mathematics.\r\n\r\nThis project has three main goals:\r\n1) to experience and analyze professional resources in elementary mathematics teacher development;\r\n2) to mobilize districts within the state to develop five-year action plans aimed at elementary teacher development; and\r\n3) to create a network of elementary professional educators who can support one another as they design and carry out their action plans.\r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes from these conferences are as follows:\r\n1) Participating districts will create a five-year action plan to strengthen the knowledge and skills of elementary mathematics teachers in order to improve student learning that includes an assessment of that plan.\r\n2) The conference organizers will develop a statewide website to give districts access to the action plans, descriptions of professional resources for elementary mathematics teachers and an up-to-date directory of state expertise in mathematics professional development.\r\n3) There is a commitment from the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction for continued funding to support annual face-to-face networking of professional educators in elementary mathematics.\r\n\r\nDuring the first summer conference teams from schools and/or districts have the opportunity to experience and analyze the professional development resources.  Each school or district sends a four to six person team that may include administrators, teacher leaders, curriculum developers and specialists, and parents.  The total attendance should be about 100 participants.\r\n\r\nBetween the two summers the principal investigators and the panelists will meet with each participating team to further develop their action plan.  This work will be supported by funding from participating schools and/or districts.\r\n\r\nDuring the second summer conference participating teams receive support as they build capacity in their schools or districts to use the resources showcased in the first conference.  Participating teams must identify a cadre of professional educators (e.g., curriculum specialists, coaches and/or teacher leaders) who will become more knowledgeable in the use of the materials that have been included in their long-term plans.\r\n",
