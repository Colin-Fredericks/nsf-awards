 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Theoretical Biology and Biomathematics is held every two years and has been running for more than 30 years. The primary goal of the conference is to bring together established and young investigators from a wide range of fields in quantitative biology to share new approaches and discuss advances in this exciting and rapidly growing area of science. This meeting continues the conference's long tradition of exceptional and enthusiastic speakers presenting new research results at the frontiers of the subject. The relatively small number of attendees and informal format of the meeting provide an ideal setting for germinating new scientific collaborations. This multidisciplinary conference is crucial for identifying new challenges and directions in theoretical biology and the health sciences.\r\n\r\nThe format of the conference is nine formal sessions, each beginning with an introduction to the field by the session chair followed by two or three invited talks. In addition to the formal sessions, there are two afternoon poster sessions. The session chairs and invited speakers consist of both established leaders and energetic new researchers. Consistent with tradition, a wide variety of topics ranging will be represented at this conference: noise in biological systems, biological polymers and membranes, biological networks, cancer, environmental stoichiometry, calcium dynamics, social insects, synaptic plasticity and immunology. The breadth of topics cover many spatial and temporal scales of biological phenomena, reflecting the theme of this year's conference, ``From Molecules to Networks.'' Invited speakers have been selected based on their expertise and accomplishments, while trying to balance gender and minority representation.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this conference are numerous. Its multidisciplinary nature fosters new collaborations between biologists and researchers from the mathematical sciences. The conference provides an ideal setting for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to interact with leaders in the field of theoretical biology. The breadth of topics represented at the meeting exposes researchers to new mathematical and computational tools that are being developed in fields different from their own. Last but not least, the conference provides a collegial and inclusive environment that encourages the participation of women and other groups that are underrepresented in science.",
