 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU site includes fieldwork on the island of Dominica in the West Indies (4 weeks) and associated post-fieldwork studies for 4 weeks at either the University of Arkansas (UA) or California State  University, San Bernardino (CSUSB). Half of the students will do post-fieldwork at UA and half at CSUSB. The techniques are field volcanology, Global Positioning System (GPS) geodesy, simple quantitative modeling and laboratory studies, including petrology and geochemistry of  volcanic rocks, sediments and waters from geothermal sites. The objectives are to develop research, scientific, and technical skills in undergraduate students who are interested in magmatic systems, volcano monitoring, and hazard assessment. Students will be paired with a partner for field research and develop  individual projects for additional study for the 4 week post-fieldwork period. Research projects include: constraining surface deformation using GPS geodesy; identifying the characteristic behavior of individual volcanoes; particle analysis and modeling of pyroclastic flows; geochemical  analysis of geothermal systems; and examination of the relationship between volcanism and surface deformation to regional tectonics.  The REU students will prepare presentations on their results to local island audiences and the Office of the Disaster Coordinator of Dominica at the end of their field seasons.  They will also participate in a 1-day research symposium at the end of the 8-weeks (videoconferenced between UA and CSUSB); a mid-year conference at either UA (years 1 and 3) or CSUSB (year 2) and a national meeting.  Rising juniors and seniors with majors in the physical sciences will be recruited  nationally with focused recruitment at HIS's and HBCU's where we have personal contacts.  Because of the volcanological diversity, direct study of a  variety of processes and products is possible. Students will thus receive broad-based research experience that may be applied to other volcanic systems worldwide.  Integrated results over the 3-year period will significantly improve understanding of volcanic hazard in Dominica and of complex andesitic magmatic  systems in general.  Dominica has no  university and this REU brings invaluable assistance to the Office of the Disaster Coordinator.  In addition, the REU will expose U.S. undergraduates to a culture similar to their own, but still significantly different. An REU in volcanic systems is timely, given the current investment in Earthscope.",
