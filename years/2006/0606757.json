 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the work of Professor Paul Floreancig of the Chemistry Department at the University of Pittsburgh. This research will involve the development and applications of electron transfer initiated cyclization reactions. In this project the results from prior studies will be used to broaden the scope of these reactions in areas that impact small molecule and spatially directed synthesis.  The applications of oxidative cleavage reactions will be expanded by designing new electroauxiliary groups based on enol ethers. The utility of these oxidative fragmentations for the synthesis of polycyclic ethers via cascade cyclizations will be examined.  In addition, attempts will be made to tether photooxidants to oxidative cleavage moieties for potential use such as photodynamic therapies and photochemical surface modifications.  \r\n\r\nIn a broader sense, these projects exemplify the important role that physical organic chemistry can play in new reaction design. In this project, students will be exposed to research objectives in nanoscience.  The emphasis on mechanistic analysis through first principles in this project imparts a significant benefit to students.\r\n",
