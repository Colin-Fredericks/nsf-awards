 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research program is to develop a functionally graded Hydroxyapatite (FGHA) coating for orthopedic and dental implants with a tailored release rate of an antimicrobial component. In this case, the antimicrobial element will have a higher release rate together with the mostly amorphous layer at the surface of the coating immediately after implantation, and its release rate will gradually decreases with increasing crystallinity of the coating. Furthermore, the proposal aims to increase the service-life of an orthopedic/ dental implant by creating coatings that forms a strong, long lasting bond not only with the juxtaposed bone, but also with the metal substrate. All this will translate into the patient receiving an orthopedic or dental implant, with a superior bioactive coating with an integrated antimicrobial component. As a result, the patient could return to a normal lifestyle sooner with the reduced antibiotics intake along with less risk of infection and its subsequent complications.\r\n\r\nThe proposed study investigates a new coating material with tailored dissolution rate that can match with bone growth together with gradually released antimicrobial components that can have a great impact on the development of the next generation of orthopedic and dental implants with improved durability, along with better biological responses. The education plan involves four complementary initiatives including: interdisciplinary research based on collaboration between three different departments at two university in US and the Japan National Institute of Materials Science, new graduate course development on Advanced Materials including Biomaterials, team work between undergraduate and graduate students and a special attempt to hiring female, underrepresented and disabled students\r\n",
