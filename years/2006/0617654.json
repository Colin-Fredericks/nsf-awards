 "awd_abstract_narration": "The processes by which magnetospheric substorms are initiated and evolve remain one of the critical, unsolved problems in space physics. This project will further develop a multi-fluid plasma simulation code to study substorm onset and evolution. The code will be used to examine the two major competing substorm models - the tail current disruption model and the near-Earth neutral line model. Simulations will be run with various solar wind conditions to study external versus internal triggering processes. An integral part of the work will be the use of a high resolution grid, which will enable the study of the role of ion skin depth/ion cyclotron effects and heavy ion outflows on the structure and dynamics of the magnetotail. The simulations will also examine how ion outflows affect auroral zone current systems. Included in the model development will be a detailed study of (1) the coupling of the magnetotail to the ionosphere through field aligned currents, (2) the temporal variation of the auroral current system, and (3) the energization of plasma populations due to dynamical processes, for both isolated substorms and storm-time substorms. The work will be a key step in the development of a model that can reliably and accurately forecast the effects of solar storms on the Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere.",
