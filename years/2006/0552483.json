 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project creates a new Research Experience for Undergraduates site focused on the areas of computer security and networking.   A nationwide recruitment process is used to select cohorts of undergraduate students to participate in a ten-week summer research program at the host institution. Particular emphasis is placed on recruitment of students from under-represented populations and from community colleges. The project includes mentorship by the experienced computer science faculty members, technical seminars and workshops, student presentations, and laboratory visits and other professional development opportunities.\r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in strong research basis and the expertise of the faculty. The projects are in major current research areas that are of interest to the community at large and that have clear practical applications. The students participate in a full range of research activities from preparing research literature reviews to production and dissemination of research results.\r\n \r\nThe broader impacts of the project include providing a quality research experience to undergraduate students, particularly students from underrepresented groups and community college students. The participating faculty members are committed to engaging women and under-represented minority students in their research.  Thus this project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting learning. \r\n",
