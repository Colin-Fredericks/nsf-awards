 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference will be devoted to the study of a variety of topics in geometric and combinatorial group theory, with special emphasis on asymptotic and probabilistic methods and their applications. More specifically, this includes:  group actions, quasi-isometries, isoperimetric functions, growth, asymptotic invariants, random walks, algorithmic problems, etc.\r\n\r\nApplications will be emphasized, especially those concerning complexity theory and information security, in particular theoretical cryptography. Cryptographic protocols have become a key element of information systems, protecting data and communications to ensure confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of data. While most symmetric key systems have relatively modest mathematical requirements, asymmetric or public key cryptosystems have become increasingly mathematically sophisticated, and, in particular, the emerging ``non-commutative cryptography\" exploits various properties of non-commutative infinite groups in very non-trivial ways. Building a solid mathematical foundation for the use of infinite groups in cryptography inevitably involves operating with various asymptotic and statistical aspects of infinite groups, and this is\r\nwhere modern group theory finds its important applications. More information an be found on the conference web site\r\nhttp://www.epsem.upc.edu/~gagta/",
