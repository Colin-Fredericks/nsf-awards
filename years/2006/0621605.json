In this project, robust, inexpensive sensor modules will be developed to achieve real-time hydrological monitoring and management of the sluice gates using optimal control techniques. Responding to the mandate from the Vietnamese government to increase the educational level of Delta inhabitants, we also propose to develop university-level curricula at Can-Tho University (CTU). Metrics for successful implementation will be to assess whether the controlled region with sluice gates has a similar ecology to an uncontrolled region with no hydrological regulation and whether CTU becomes an effective, independent research institution in the area of mechatronics, control and automation. This work will break new ground in (1) research and development of cheap, robust sensors, (2) establishment of a new working mathematical model of the Mekong Delta and (3) synthesis of an optimal controller for a large-scale system that is highly non-linear, has limited/noisy sensor data and exhibits long delays.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe research has potential for broader impact as follows. (1) Establish a new method for modeling and control of hydrology in a large-scale, natural delta system. (2) Provide better knowledge and control of the hydrology in the Mekong Delta, leading to long-term socio-economic improvement. (3) Establish more efficient land use and land distribution practices, leading to overall improvement of environmental health. (4) Increase capacity of local inhabitants through research training, and (5) enhance long-term collaborations between UW and CTU.\r\n",
