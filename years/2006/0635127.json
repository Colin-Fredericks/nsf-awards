 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design of efficient, and low complexity, coding and decoding algorithms is a critical component in\r\nthe optimization of wireless and wire-line networks. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of new\r\npowerful paradigms, e.g., belief propagation, as well as the revival of classical approaches, e.g., sequential\r\ndecoding, for the design of decoding algorithms. This proposal seeks a deeper theoretical foundation for the\r\ndesign and analysis of efficient decoding algorithms, along with the associated code ensembles, by building\r\non this recent progress.\r\nThe overarching goal of the proposed research is to unify under one framework the class of algorithms\r\nthat exploit the power of local constraints, e.g., the linear programming or belief propagation decoders and\r\ngeneralization thereof, with the class of algorithms that optimize a global cost function, e.g., tree search\r\ndecoders. The proposed research benefits from our preliminary results that establish interesting connections\r\nbetween different decoding schemes (as detailed in the sequel). Our results are expected to elucidate the\r\nproperties of known algorithms and inspire the design of more powerful decoders. Our investigations\r\nwill start with the traditional point-to-point scenario where the complexity of the model ranges from the\r\nsimplified binary erasure channel to the challenging multi-path fading channel. In the latter case, our\r\nwork will target a joint detection and decoding approach and consider, explicitly, the associated signal\r\nprocessing tasks, e.g., the preprocessing stage which will be defined rigorously in the sequel.\r\nOur research will then proceed to investigate three distinct categories of multi-user channels. The\r\nfirst thrust will focus on the outage-limited multiple access channel where efficient decoding algorithms\r\nthat achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff will be pursued. The same line of work will also\r\nseek code ensembles and decoding algorithms that achieve the capacity of the compound multiple access\r\nchannel (CMAC), one of the few examples where the celebrated successive cancellation decoder fails to\r\nachieve capacity. The CMAC model captures the essential characteristics of delay-limited multiple access\r\nchannels with limited transmitter channel state information. The study of the broadcast channel (i.e.,\r\ndownlink) is our second research thrust where low complexity and high performance dirty paper codes\r\nand rateless codes will be constructed. Within this context, classical works on tree search source coding\r\nwill be revisited in order to construct low complexity vector quantization stage for the dirty-paper coding\r\nscheme. The third research thrust will be devoted to cooperative channels. Here, our efforts will seek\r\nto characterize the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the cooperative interference channel along with the\r\nassociated optimal coding and decoding algorithms. This work will build on the intimate relationship\r\nbetween the CMAC and the interference channel. Finally, inspired by our recent work in the area, novel\r\napproaches for cooperative lattice coding and decoding algorithms will be unveiled.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in the fundamental nature of the posed questions\r\nand the expected contributions to information and coding theories. New bridges between information\r\ntheory, from one side, and optimization and algebraic number theories, from the other side, will be built.\r\nFurthermore, analytical tools, as well as efficient numerical methods, that aid in the design and analysis\r\nof decoding algorithms will be pursued.\r\nThe PIs, with collective expertise in information theory, coding theory, wireless communications, and\r\nsignal processing, form a qualified team for undertaking the research plan. This project builds on recent\r\nresults from the PIs' ongoing collaboration. The proposed theoretical research is expected to have a broad\r\nimpact on the information theory and signal processing communities. Furthermore, the anticipated results\r\nwill contribute to the design of efficient encoding/decoding algorithms which percolate through many\r\napplications (please refer to the support letters from Texas Instruments and ST Microelectronics). On the\r\neducational front, graduate students at the two participating institutions will be heavily involved in the\r\nresearch activities.",
