 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42)\r\n\r\nThis project is developing a digital carbonate rock petrography tutorial consisting of a library of 60 to 80 densely annotated virtual thin sections.  Each virtual thin section is being constructed in a layered PDF file format.  Layers consisting of images in plane-polarized light, cross-polarized light, scale grids, and mapped features are being constructed for each thin section.  Collapsible text boxes (pop-up notes) are being added to each image for annotation of selected features of interest in the thin section.  Annotations for the thin sections are being developed by a number of different individuals and differences of interpretation in thin sections are being included in the tutorial.  The tutorial is building on experiences in multi-media curriculum development and assessment gained in a previous successful digital sandstone petrography tutorial and represents the next step in development of resources for teaching highly visual material in petrography.\r\n\r\nWhen complete, the material will be published, most likely by a non-profit society publisher (AAPG, SEPM, GSA, etc.).  In addition, papers describing the tutorial will be submitted to appropriate journals.  This material will be evaluated in the same manner as the previous successful sandstone petrography tutorial.  An existing carbonate class with 80-100 students acted as a control group in the Fall of 2005.  Subsequent offerings of the course will use the tutorial materials for three semesters at all participating schools.  During this time faculty input will be sought concerning the material's accuracy, balance, and overall appropriateness for undergraduate students.  Student understanding of carbonate petrography will be compared between the control group and subsequent semesters of students who have used the tutorial.\r\n",
