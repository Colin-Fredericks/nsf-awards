 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry Division award supports student and faculty travel to the Council of Chemical Research annual meeting to be held April 30 - May 3, 2006 in Tucson, AZ.  Twenty graduate students will participate in all aspects of the meeting and assist the breakout session chairs in facilitating discussions.  These participants will include students from underrepresented groups.  Twelve faculty members from minority serving institutions that have undergraduate chemistry and/or chemical engineering programs and are not current members of the Council of Chemical Research will be invited.   Both faculty members and graduate students will benefit intellectually from contact with research leaders from academia, industry and government in discussions on significant research and education related issues affecting the chemistry and chemical engineering community.  The students will benefit from networking contacts and leadership skills related to their discussion group activities.  The Council of Chemical Research will benefit from the broadened participation and insights that the students and faculty who ordinarily do not attend this meeting will bring.  The Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems, Engineering Directorate cofund this award.\r\n",
