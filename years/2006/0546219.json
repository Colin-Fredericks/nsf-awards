The research will advance the application of heterogeneous nucleation and solid solution processes to environmental systems. Research on uranium- and lead-rich nanoparticles will contribute to the nascent fields of environmental nanoscience and nanotechnology. While building on the PIs experience combining macroscopic, microscopic and molecular-scale techniques to elucidate  reaction mechanisms at the solid-water interface, new collaborations have been established to pursue further mechanistic insights with a powerful arsenal of spectroscopic techniques. By integrating the study of immobilization mechanisms with investigations of contaminant remobilization, the work bridges the gap between fundamental aquatic chemistry research and applied environmental remediation. In addition to the direct benefits to contaminated site management, the new mechanistic information will also benefit research on water treatment and corrosion processes.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. The integrated research and education plans will reach a diverse audience and broaden the participation of underrepresented groups through recruiting and outreach.  Educational programs on water quality and sustainability for middle school students and the community reach beyond the university. The project expands the infrastructure for research and education by developing relationships between environmental engineering and other disciplines through the cross-listing of courses, formation of multidisciplinary research teams, and collaboration with chemists and earth scientists. The scientific results will be broadly disseminated to contribute to the fields of environmental engineering, aqueous geochemistry, and interfacial science. New course initiatives of problem-based learning projects and integrated aquatic chemistry learning units will be made available to the environmental engineering academic community. Advancing the understanding of lead and uranium immobilization mechanisms benefits society by enabling improved site management and remediation strategies. The education of environmental engineering students and outreach to pre-college students will have societal benefits extending into the future, especially when students develop a passion for lifelong learning. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project advanced frontiers in interfacial environmental chemistry, contributed to scientifically-based site management, and enhanced environmental engineering education.  The project focused on the important but poorly understood processes of nanoparticle surface precipitation and co-precipitation of heavy metals at the mineral-water interface.  These processes and their impacts on contaminant transport were studied for systems involving lead and uranium as contaminants, iron oxyhydroxides as mineral substrates, and phosphate as a potentially useful additive for remediation.  A combination of conventional and innovative methods were used to elucidate and quantify mechanisms controlling (1) the continuum between adsorption and surface precipitation and (2) uranium and lead uptake during iron oxyhydroxide growth. \n\n\nThe research advanced our understanding of the impacts of phosphate on heavy metal and radionuclide immobilization in contaminated sites.  Phosphate was found to enhance lead immobilization by promoting both the adsorption to iron oxide surfaces and the precipitation of lead phosphate solids.  A reaction-based model for adsorption processes demonstrated that phosphate could increase lead binding to iron oxides solely through its effect on the electrostatic contribution to the adsorption process.  New measurements of the solubility and dissolution rates of the lead phosphate solid chloropyromorphite, the dominant predicted product in many remediated environments, were made that revised our understanding of its behavior and improved our ability to predict the behavior of lead in phosphate-treated systems.  Uranium interactions with iron oxides were also influenced by both adsorption and precipitation processes.  In contrast to the behavior of lead, the enhanced adsorption of uranium was the result of the formation of ternary uranium-phosphate-iron oxide surface complexes.  For uranium a transition was observed from adsorption to precipitation, and electron microscopy provided evidence for heterogeneous nucleation of uranium phosphates on the iron oxide surface as an intermediate stage in this transition. \n\nThe project advanced the infrastructure for environmental engineering research through the development of a research approach that combined macroscopic, microscopic and molecular-scale techniques to elucidate reaction mechanisms at the solid-water interface.  Collaborations were established to pursue mechanistic insights with an arsenal of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques that included X-ray absorption spectroscopy.  Transport modeling involved collaboration with chemical engineers.  By integrating the study of immobilization mechanisms with investigations of contaminant remobilization, the results helped to bridge the gap between fundamental aquatic chemistry research and applied environmental remediation.  In addition to the direct benefits to contaminated site management, the new mechanistic information also benefitted research on water treatment and corrosion processes and has applications to the fields of chemistry and biogeochemical sciences. \n\nThe integrated research and education activities of the project reached a diverse audience and broadened the participation of underrepresented groups.
