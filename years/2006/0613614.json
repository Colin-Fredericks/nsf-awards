 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mutations are permanent changes in DNA that drive evolutionary processes, and such changes occur both at the nucleotide and at the chromosomal level.  Although a low level of mutagenesis is essential for the adaptation of species to an ever-changing environment, most mutations are detrimental and have negative effects on survival.  Mutagenic processes also are central to basic research, with the identification of mutants being the basis of the genetic analysis of complex biological processes.  The 2006 Mutagenesis Gordon Research Conference will be held August 6-11, 2006, at Salve Regina University (Rhode Island), and will bring together an international group of researchers actively engaged in mutagenesis-related research.  Topics to be discussed include the mechanisms that generate mutagenic intermediates, the diverse repair mechanisms that prevent the fixation of such intermediates as permanent mutations, and the regulation of mutagenic processes.  \r\n\r\nThe conference will be limited to 135 participants and will occur within a relaxed setting that encourages the open discussion of new data and novel ideas.  Invited speakers will present their results in morning and evening sessions, with the afternoons being devoted to informal interactions and poster presentations. The diversity of topics represented at the Mutagenesis Conference sets it apart from other specialized conferences, and the small size and collegial nature of the meeting make it unique within the field of mutagenesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
