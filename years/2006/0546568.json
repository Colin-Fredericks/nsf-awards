 "awd_abstract_narration": "While we are increasingly dependent on networked, distributed systems,  current distributed  systems require extensive manual effort to deploy, are expensive to administer, and tend to be fragile nevertheless. These problems stem fundamentally from the fact that current distributed systems lack principled design and depend on unreliable heuristics for their operation.\r\n\r\nWe are investigating new techniques for building robust, high-performance infrastructure services, based on novel analytical and numerical techniques for optimally or near-optimally performing resource allocation in large-scale distributed systems. We are developing new techniques that enable a new generation of highly reliable, self-organizing infrastructure services.  In particular, we are developing a next-generation name service to replace the Domain Name Service that seamlessly supports the existing name hierarchy, a high-performance web cache that achieves predictably high performance by delivering hot data items close to clients proactively, and an eternal software repository that minimizes download time for swarming, bittorrent-style downloads. \r\n\r\nThis work lays a foundation for a principled understanding of resource tradeoffs in distributed systems that are currently performed either manually or in an ad hoc fashion. The new techniques are directly applicable to self-organizing peer-to-peer systems and lead to performance,   manageability and availability properties that are difficult to achieve via conventional means. The application of these techniques to the implementation of infrastructure services will yield more robust replacements for fragile and expensive services, such as DNS, web caches, and software distribution than we use today.\r\n\r\n                              \r\n",
