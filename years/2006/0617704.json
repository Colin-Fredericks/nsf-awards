 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will evaluate uranium isotope ratios of clastic sediments as a measure of the\r\ntime required for bedrock to be reduced to small grains by weathering, and then\r\ntransported and deposited as sediment. The method may open up new ways of studying and\r\nunderstanding sediments, the processes that produce them, and how sedimentary processes\r\nare dependent on climate and tectonics. Detailed physical and chemical characterization\r\nof natural sediment from well-controlled environments will be combined with isotopic\r\nmeasurements. Fieldwork consists of collecting samples of terrestrial sediment from\r\nlakes, loess deposits, streams, and alluvial fans. The work is designed to further\r\nevaluate the approach and also investigate variations in sediment transport time as a\r\nfunction of climate and depositional environment. The combination of U-series isotopes\r\nand cosmogenic nuclides (Be-10 and Al-26) may yield information about timescales of soil\r\ngeneration, erosion, transport, and storage, and may allow important types of continental\r\nsedimentary deposits to be dated. Intellectual merit: The research will contribute to\r\nunderstanding of fundamental aspects of sedimentology and landscape evolution. The PI has\r\n28 years experience in geochemical research, an extensive publication record, and has\r\ntrained more than twenty Ph.D. students who have gone on to successful careers in\r\nacademia, government, and private industry. U.C. Berkeley has a long record of support of\r\nadvanced scientific research, and provides ample facilities, support personnel, and\r\ninfrastructure for research and graduate education. Broader Impacts: The research has\r\nbroad applicability to geology and environmental studies. It requires knowledge and\r\ntraining in mass spectrometry, analytical and nuclear chemistry, and hence is an excellent\r\nvenue for advanced education. The funding will help support a research facility that, in\r\nthe previous 15 years, has benefited 22 graduate students (10 women) 10 postdoctoral\r\nfellows (5 women), plus more than 20 visitors, undergraduates and collaborators.",
