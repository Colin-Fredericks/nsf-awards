 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will work on several problems in higher dimensional\r\nalgebraic geometry. In a joint project with Alexeev, Hassett, and\r\nKoll\\'ar he plans to complete the proof of existence of coarse\r\ncomplete moduli spaces of stable log surfaces, an analog of the moduli\r\nspace of stable curves.  In another project the investigator is going\r\nto work on boundedness, rigidity and hyperbolicity of subvarieties of\r\nmoduli stacks of canonically polarized smooth projective varieties. \r\nThese questions evolved from a landmark conjecture of Shafarevich, and\r\nits solution by Arakelov and Parshin, which played an important role\r\nin Faltings' proof of the Mordell Conjecture. Part of this project is\r\njoint work with Kebekus.  In a third project the investigator and\r\nHacon are going to study the impact of the existence of nowhere\r\nvanishing differential forms on the geometry of the underlying\r\nvariety. Their goal is to prove several outstanding conjectures in the\r\narea.  In a fourth project the investigator and Araujo will work\r\ntoward proving a conjecture of Beauville giving a new characterization\r\nof projective spaces and quadric hypersurfaces.\r\n\r\nThis research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest\r\nparts of modern mathematics, but one that blossomed to the point where\r\nit has solved problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, and\r\nstill in its simplest form it treats figures defined in the plane by\r\npolynomials.  Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but\r\nalso from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used\r\nin those fields. Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as\r\ndiverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding\r\ntheory and robotics. A central problem in algebraic geometry is the\r\nclassification of all geometric objects. In turn, an important part of\r\nclassification theory is the theory of moduli. The latter's core idea\r\nis that one does not only want to understand these objects, but also\r\nunderstand the way they can be deformed. Moduli spaces play a very\r\nimportant role in theoretical physics.  Studying curves on moduli\r\nspaces provides information on how an object is changing in\r\nspace-time. One of the focuses of this project is on compact moduli\r\nspaces. Those are extensions of moduli spaces in general and they give\r\nadditional information about singular deformations, ones that are\r\nessentially different from others. Other goals of the project involve\r\na better understanding of certain higher dimensional varieties.\r\n",
