Sources include Duhems\r\nview of measurement outcomes as theory-laden and Poincare's  view of measurement as\r\nperspectival. These aspects of measurement are to be explored in the context of recent as\r\nwell as classical physics. Envisaged is an account of measurement outcomes as\r\nperspectival representations that provide a bridge between pure and applied science.\r\nThis project on measurement is the final stage of a larger project on the subject of\r\nscientific representation, overlapping with each of its parts. Part I, Representation,\r\ninvestigates the general concept, restricted to physical and mathematical representations\r\n(excluding concerns of psychology). Part II, Structure, addresses scientific modelling as\r\nrepresentation of phenomena, with special reference to measurement instrumentation.\r\nHistorical examples include the development of perspective in art and architecture;\r\nCopernicus  explanation of  retrograde  planetary motion; the development of\r\nmicroscopy; the changes in spatio-temporal representation introduced by the theory of\r\nrelativity, and the description in quantum mechanics of the experiments that support it.\r\nPart III, Perspective, engages paradoxes that threaten structuralist views concerning\r\nscientific representation, referring to arguments from Herman Weyl to Hilary Putnam.\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT: The PI will introduce original responses to the theoretical\r\nand philosophical problems encountered, both in the current project on measurement and\r\nin the larger project of which this is part. Measurement and modelling, structure and\r\nperspective are at the center of recent developments in philosophy of science. The\r\nproject is envisaged to solve or dissolve outstanding problems concerning these, and\r\ninvolves the design of a distinctly empiricist structuralism offered in critical response to\r\nrecent structural realism and to recently revived and extended neo-Kantian views.\r\nBROADER IMPACT: The PI proposes to present the theoretical results in a book under\r\ncontract with Oxford University Press, Scientific Representation: Paradoxes Of\r\nPerspective. Begun in the Locke Lectures, Oxford 2001, the project is evolving in active\r\nscholarly consultation and cooperation through international conferences and journal\r\nexchanges. While the PIs most recent book, The Empirical Stance offered a broad view\r\nof empiricism today, this project continues the more technical investigations of his Laws\r\nand Symmetry and Quantum Mechanics: an Empiricist View -- while addressing some of\r\nthe most lively topics in current philosophical debates.\r\nThese debates have salient repercussions in our wider culture, and require for\r\ntheir response a combination of subtlety and rigor. Within this distinctively empiricist\r\nview to be developed, a specifically pragmatic turn makes it possible to dissolve a family\r\nof paradoxes that have been thought to support relativism and skepticism concerning the\r\nsciences. The PI continues here his critique of relativism and skepticism, as initially\r\npresented in his 1992 Presidential Address to the Philosophy of Science Association.\r\n",
