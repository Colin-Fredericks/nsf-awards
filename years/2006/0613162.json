It differs from other forms of design in that software design is expected to meet a set of constraints that changes dynamically and faster than the software can adapt.\r\nMoreover, future trends in software development will force developers to design systems that are out of their control. This research investigates whether a component model that includes the semantics of a component as part of its interface can address these problems of software design. Semantics is used here in the broad sense to include the functionality of the component, security and privacy constraints imposed on or by the component, a recovery model, and an economic model for choosing components. The research involves  exploring ways of defining and checking such semantic specifications against component implementations and the use of such specifications as a new design metaphor.  If successful, this approach promises to let developers control software design and get a handle on many of the problems that plague the evolution of modern software.",
