 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are proposing a series of 3 workshops to be held over three years focusing on the subject\r\nof scattered wave imaging using earthquakes recorded by densely spaced broadband\r\nseismograph arrays, and particularly using the USArray data. The workshops will be organized\r\nby a steering committee, and developed in cooperation with the participating scientists as the\r\nseries progresses. The workshops will be advertised broadly and will be open to anyone\r\ninterested in attending.\r\nThe workshops will be designed to accelerate the development of scattered wave imaging\r\ntechniques by creating a virtual center of scientists and students. The virtual center will actively\r\nengage scientists and students involved in this research in a working forum for exchange of\r\nideas, joint development of software, and exchange of field and synthetic datasets. Workshop\r\nand study topics will include 1) investigation of the effects of the approximations used in\r\nformulating imaging algorithms on the final images, 2) testing and validation of different\r\nimaging methods using field and synthetic data, 3) experiment design criteria, 4) seismic velocity\r\nanalysis, and 5) relating the images to composition and physical state of the Earth.\r\nThe workshops will be designed to include working classes for graduate\r\nstudents (and senior scientists) involved in this research area. This will build community in the\r\nnew generation of young scientists who are emerging as the next group of theoretical leaders in\r\nseismology, and who will reap the benefits of the Earthscope endeavor. The synergy of bringing\r\npeople from academic and industrial backgrounds will advance the field more rapidly than is\r\npossible otherwise. This improved communication will help advance knowledge in both the\r\nacademic and industrial research communities and enhance cross-fertilization between these\r\ngroups.",
