 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Acquisition Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas, Austin will obtain an  X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer.  This equipment will enhance research at a consortium that includes five other institutions: the University of Texas at San Antonio, Trinity University (in San Antonio), Southwestern University (in Georgetown), Texas State University (in San Marcos) and Baylor University (in Waco).  The instrument will be used for a broad range of studies that focus on catalysis, electronic and photonic materials, environmental studies, fuel cell research, and biological materials.  \r\n\r\nThe X-ray photoelectron spectrometer enables researchers to probe the surface composition and the oxidation state of chemical elements in soft (organic) and hard (inorganic) materials.  The instrument is configured to provide depth profiling and imaging capability.  The imaging resolution will be approximately at the micrometer scale.  This allows researchers to correlate chemical and physical properties with chemical composition.  The instrument will be automated so that off-site users will be able to collect and analyze their data from their home institution at the completion of the sample run.  The majority of the studies will be focused on energy-related studies, particularly catalysis, and environmental research.  Undergraduate and graduate research students from the geographic area clustered around Austin will benefit from the training afforded by this remotely accessible instrument.  UT (Austin) will introduce this technique into a new pilot program, first year undergraduate laboratory, that will have students engaged in research problems. \r\n",
