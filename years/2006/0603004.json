 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Materials World Network project is a joint research and education activity between the University of Texas at Austin and the Materials Analysis Laboratory of the Centre de Recherche Public-Gabriel Lippmann in Luxembourg that explores how ultra thin amorphous films are formed in chemical and physical deposition approaches and how they function.  The studies explore boron-carbon-nitrogen (B-C-N) ternary compounds because this nonoxidic ceramic material can be grown with variable composition and bonding, which in turn affect the thin film materials properties.  The ultra thin films have considerable potential in micro-electronics device packaging applications as a diffusion barrier to copper and in nanoelectronics applications as a passivating film for nanowire-based devices.  With this award, the research team at the University of Texas at Austin will study: 1) molecular bonding within the film and at the interface that controls the barrier and diffusion properties; 2) at what thickness the films become continuous and at what thickness the films cease to function as a barrier; 3) how the amorphous films nucleate and grow from oxide, semiconductor and metal surfaces; and 4) how the nature of the chemical bonding within the film and at the interface with semiconductors affects interface traps and carrier mobility.  The research team in Luxembourg will study: 1) physical deposition conditions that would lead to amorphous versus crystalline films with tunable dielectric constants; 2) copper diffusion mechanisms in the films; 3) developing methods to characterize the material properties of 2-5 nm thick films; and 4) approaches to enhance bonding between the films and metals such as copper, cobalt, tungsten and tantalum.  \r\n%%%\r\nSince boron carbonitride ternary compounds can potentially be grown or processed with variable composition and bonding, their material properties could be adjusted including crystallinity, microstructure, hardness, tribological, optical, field emission, thermal conductivity, and dielectric constant.  These material properties make them ideal for microelectronic and nanoelectronic applications.  This award will support the teaching and training of graduate students at Texas, and their travel to Luxembourg for research activities mentored by scientists there.  These activities along with planned research activities of students and faculty from Luxembourg to University of Texas at Austin will expose the students and faculty to different scientific disciplines and cultures, and make them aware of different approaches to scientific activities and how to resolve scientific problems.  Annual joint review meetings are planned to foster collaboration, dialog and exchange of ideas.  The US students will mentor undergraduates in open-ended research projects lasting an academic term and will develop an exhibit that would explain the revolutionary and current devices that motivate this research, such as sensors and microelectronics, and introduces these concepts to the general public and to pre-college students.  The exhibit will be presented and displayed through a variety of University of Texas sponsored venues.\r\n\r\n",
