 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for the research activities of the High Energy Astrophysics (HEA) group in the Physics Department at Case Western Reserve University which is active in two major experimental projects: (1) The Solar Tower Atmospheric Cherenkov Effect Experiment (STACEE) for detecting gamma-rays in the 50 to 250 GeV range, and (2) The Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) for observing the highest energy cosmic rays at EeV energies.\r\n\r\nSTACEE is a ground-based gamma-ray detector using the heliostat mirrors of a solar array to collect atmospheric Cherenkov radiation. The large mirror area available at the array permits STACEE to operate at energies well below previous ground-based instruments and to explore the gamma-ray energy range between 50 and 250 GeV.  The experiment has been in continuous operation since 2001 and has observed and reported results on several Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), gamma-ray pulsars and supernova remnants, and has searched for high-energy emission from Gamma-Ray Bursters (GRB). This proposal requests support for the continued operation of STACEE, and the participation of the Case HEA group as one of its founding members.  Activities on STACEE will ramp down during the proposal period as this experiment ceases observations on June 1, 2007.\r\n\r\nThe Auger Observatory is a new major international experiment to measure the energy and arrival direction of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) above 1020 eV. The origin of the UHECR remains one of the important questions being probed in UHECR physics.  The Auger Observatory is a hybrid detector consisting of two co-located detector systems: (1) an array of 1,600 water Cherenkov Surface Detector (SD) stations spread over 3,000 square kilometers area for detecting air shower particles on the ground, and (2) a set of four Fluorescence Detector (FD) telescopes which provide stereo calorimetric measurements of the development of cosmic ray showers as the propagate through the atmosphere.  The experiment is located near Malargue, Argentina and construction is well underway, with three of the four FD's operational and more than 950 of the 1,600 SD stations installed and running. Data from the partially complete Auger observatory are being collected and the first set of science results from Auger have recently been presented.  The Auger Observatory will be completed by early 2007. This proposal requests support for the continued participation of the Case group in Auger, which participates in several areas of detector development, deployment, calibration and data analysis.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts:  Several members of the Case group are active in a variety of education and outreach programs, including a new program for physical science instruction for Cleveland high school teachers and the application of wireless transmitters (\"clickers\") for introductory physics education. Several techniques developed for STACEE and Auger by the Case group are applicable in other arenas, including: (1) the use of heliostats to support remote sensing by earth-viewing satellites, (2) the design and application of new types of non-imaging optical systems, and (3) the development of mirror measurement techniques for solar energy applications.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHere we describe the scientific activities supported by NSF grant\n0601088.  This grant was originally funded for the three-year period\n(06/01/2006 through 05/31/2009).\n\nThis grant supports the scientific activities of the High Energy\nAstrophysics (HEA) group in the physics department at Case Western\nReserve University.  Members of the HEA group play a major role in the\nPierre Auger Cosmic Ray Observatory (PAO), which has been constructed\nand is operated by an international consortium of collaborators. The\npurpose of the Auger Observatory is to study the highest energy cosmic\nrays -- high energy particles that travel through the Universe.\nDiscovered by Victor Hess in 1912 during a high-altitude balloon\nflight, the cosmic rays are particles of intense energy arriving to\nthe Earth from all directions is space.  However, even after decades\nof effort by astrophysicists, the origins and exact nature of these\nmost energetic particles remains an elusive mystery.  These are the\nmost energetic particles in the Universe, as much kinetic energy as a\nfast-pitch baseball concentrated into a single subatomic particle.\nHow is it possible that such a large amount of energy can be\nconcentrated in such a small package?  What is the nature of those\nastrophysical objects where such particles might be accelerated?  What\ncan we learn about fundamental physics by studying the process of how\nthese particles are accelerated and propagate to us?  These are the\nquestions that the Pierre Auger Cosmic Ray Observatory has been\ndesigned to address.\n\nThe purpose of the Pierre Auger Observatory is to measure the arrival directions, energies and other physical properties of the highest energy cosmic rays.  When these particles enter the Earth's atmosphere from space, an extensive shower of new particles is created which then rains down to the surface.  Auger is an array of over 1600 individual particle detectors arranged over an area of 3000 square kilometers, located in the high desert pampas of Argentina to the east of the Chilean Andes.  The Auger Observatory is a large international collaboration of more than 400 physicists from 19 countries.                                                                            \n                                                                                                                                        \nFor Auger, construction of experiment in Argentina is complete, and\nthe Observatory has been operating continuously at full size since\n2008.  Auger has observed dozens of cosmic rays at the highest energies, and has already extended the the exposure to several times over that achieved by all previous experiments combined.  Auger has now reported results for cosmic ray energy spectra, upper limits on the fraction of gamma-rays )which places a strong constrain against top-down source models), and upper limits on tau neutrinos.  All of these results place strong constraints on models for the astrophysical origins of cosmic rays.  Additionally, the Auger experiment has presented a major result in the detection of anisotropy for the highest energy cosmic rays where we have shown that the arrival directions are correlated with the positions of relatively near by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) believed to be large black holes located at the centers of large galaxies.  This new result conclusively demonstrates the extragalactic nature of the sources of the highest energy cosmic rays and opens the door for future prospect for conducting \"charged particle astronomy\", with the ultimate goal of identifying individual astrophysical sources of cosmic rays in the sky.\n\n                                                                                                                                 \nThe Case Western group continues to have a leadership role in the Auger Collaboration in two main technical arenas: (1) GPS event time-tagging, which is critical for Auger shower arrival direction reconstruction and (2) large-area wi..."
