Microfabrication tools will be used to engineer high density arrays of femtoliter wells on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates for whole genome-scale DNA amplification. Single DNA molecules from a genomic DNA or cDNA library will be cloned in massive parallel on the microfluidic devices using the rolling circle amplification (RCA) technology developed by the investigator. A new sequencing technology called \"sequencing by denaturation\" (SBD) will be developed to enable the massive parallel sequencing of the single molecular clones on the whole genome or transcriptome array. These technologies will be integrated with a high throughput imaging system to engineer an integrated system for genomic analyses. \r\n",
