 "awd_abstract_narration": "WORKSHOP: UINTAS 2006\"The Uinta Interdisciplinary Assessment Symposium\r\nThis proposal seeks funding for partial support of a conference focused on Earth system science in\r\nthe Uinta Mountains of northeastern Utah. The Uinta Mountains are a fascinating natural laboratory\r\nfor the study of Quaternary climate changes, landscape evolution, and geoecology. The mountain\r\nrange contains a federally designated wilderness area spanning nearly half a million acres, and is\r\nadministered by three different National Forests. Over the past decade, numerous academic\r\nresearchers have forged innovative collaborations with land managers working on these National\r\nForests, which have greatly improved our understanding of previously overlooked aspects of the\r\nUinta land system. This work began in the mid-1990s with a dedicated program of geomorphic\r\nmapping that formed the basis of a Forest Service land systems inventory. From that starting point,\r\nresearch has expanded in a multitude of directions, encompassing topics as diverse as Quaternary\r\ngeochronology, periglacial landscape evolution, paleolimnology, post-glacial climate changes,\r\ntreeline fluctuations, fluvial geomorphology, and forest ecology. The addition of new researchers\r\nand the establishment of new research programs have been particularly rapid over the past five years,\r\nwith the result that more than a dozen academic scientists are actively pursuing funded research in\r\nthe range, including two multi-year projects supported by the National Science Foundation. The\r\nresults of this work have been presented in more than 10 peer-reviewed papers, and have\r\nconsiderable relevance to ongoing studies elsewhere in the central Rocky Mountains.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The vibrant nature and breadth of current research in the Uintas is exciting and\r\npresents considerable potential for interdisciplinary collaboration. However, the large number of\r\nresearchers focused on so many varied topics is inhibiting the efficient communication of research\r\ngoals and results necessary for the development of future collaborations. This is not the fault of any\r\nindividual research group, but rather the inevitable outcome of an increasingly specialized scientific\r\ncommunity in which researchers with different interests attend different meetings and follow\r\ndifferent literature. As a result, the great potential for innovative interdisciplinary research in the\r\nUintas will remain unrealized until these artificial barriers between disciplines are overcome and\r\nrobust connections can be made between research groups with complementary interests.\r\nThe weekend conference described in this proposal, UINTAS 2006\"The Uinta Interdisciplinary\r\nAssessment Symposium, will address this situation by greatly enhancing communication between\r\nthe academic research groups currently active in the Uintas. Through presentation of research\r\noverviews and results, and focused planning sessions, a foundation will be constructed for the next\r\ngeneration of innovative, interdisciplinary, projects. The conference will also highlight ways to\r\nbetter connect academic research with the needs of land managers to ensure that the history of\r\nfruitful collaboration between academe and the Forest Service will be maintained.\r\nBroader Impacts: The concept for this conference has met with great enthusiasm from the research\r\ncommunity currently active in the Uintas, and from the U.S. Forest Service, which is providing the\r\nmajority of the funding. Forest Service land managers are particularly excited about the potential for\r\nthis conference to become a model for how government land management agencies may better\r\ncoordinate their needs with the interests of academic researchers. As such, this conference has great\r\npotential for impacts beyond the community of researchers currently focused on the Uintas.\r\nFurthermore, it is expected that approximately 16 presentations will be made on aspects of Earth\r\nsystem science in the Uintas at the conference. These presentations will be collected and published\r\nas a special issue of the journal Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research, ensuring that the conference\r\npresentations, and the results obtained to date by the different research groups, will be readily\r\navailable to the broader scientific community.",
