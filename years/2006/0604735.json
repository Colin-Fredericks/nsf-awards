LeBrun\r\n\r\nWorking both jointly and independently, Anderson and LeBrun plan\r\nto study a cluster of related geometric structures on\r\nlow-dimensional manifolds. Their research program focuses on\r\nrelationships linking geometry to topological structures,\r\nalgebraic geometry, and theoretical physics. Jointly, Anderson\r\nand LeBrun plan to study the existence and moduli of canonical\r\nmetrics on 4-manifolds, with an emphasis on the Kahler case.\r\nAnderson will also investigate problems concerning asympotically\r\nhyperbolic Einstein metrics, the AdS/CFT correspondence, and\r\nmathematical aspects of general relativity. LeBrun will also\r\nstudy the curvature of 4-manifolds, Seiberg-Witten theory,\r\nextremal Kahler metrics, and the twistor geometry of holomorphic\r\ndisks.  The proposed work is expected to have a significant\r\nbroader impact on two different fronts. On one hand, it will\r\npromote further interactions between researchers in differential\r\ngeometry and those in topology, in algebraic geometry and,\r\nespecially, in theoretical physics.  The project also has a\r\nsignificant educational impact at the graduate level, in that\r\nAnderson and LeBrun oversee a large number of graduate students\r\nwho are working on problems closely tied to the research\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\nThe relations between mathematics and theoretical physics are at\r\nthe forefront of research in both disciplines, leading on both\r\nsides to remarkable new insights and developments. Much of the\r\nplanned research activity takes its inspiration from current\r\nattempts to bridge the gulf between Einstein's theory of\r\nspace-time geometry and gravitation (General Relativity), and the\r\nquantum field theories that are currently understood to govern\r\nthe other fundamental forces of nature. Some of the research has\r\nto do with the problem of describing all possible geometries of\r\n4-dimensional universes governed by Einstein's gravitational\r\nequations.  One of the toolsto be used involves use of the\r\nSeiberg-Witten equations, which originated in the theory of\r\nshort-range nuclear interactions, but nonetheless turn out to\r\nplay a major role in our understanding of the\r\nlarge-scalestructure of many 4-dimensional universes. Other\r\naspects of the planned research are closely linked to\r\ndevelopments in string theory, which is arguably the most\r\npromising and exciting avenue of research in theoretical physics,\r\nand which has had a profound and multi-faceted impact on recent\r\nprogress in mathematics.\r\n",
