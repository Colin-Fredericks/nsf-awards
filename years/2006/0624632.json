 "awd_abstract_narration": "TechMath goals are to prepare in-service mathematics and science teachers to develop critical and analytical thinking, information technology skills, and mathematical understanding through problem-based instruction.  The project will serve 70 high school teachers from twelve school districts in rural North Carolina.  A concentrated effort will be exerted to recruit teachers from diverse backgrounds.  Two cohorts of teachers will participate, one in each of the two years of the project.  The first year for each cohort will include emersion in technology and mathematics as used by the business partners and will culminate with the formation of a TechMath team consisting of a mathematics or science teacher, a student and a business partner.  The teachers and students will choose the business partner, visit the partner and work with them on a real problem they may have.  Over thirty business partners have been identified.   Each team will produce a teaching module that fits into the existing curriculum and is based on the local business problem.  A total of 70 teachers and 70 students will be directly involved in the project.  Project work will be done in after-school and weekend settings throughout the academic year, and the modules will be used in the classroom during the year.  The project includes a two-week summer workshop and a career retreat with all participants at the end of each year.  The teams will develop, test and evaluate modules to be used in future teaching.",
