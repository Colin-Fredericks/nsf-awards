 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST-0607028\r\nFerland\r\n\r\nMuch of our understanding of the chemical and physical evolution of the universe comes from the analysis of spectral lines produced by interstellar gas.  This project is a simultaneous attack on a range of star-forming environments, extending from nearby regions of ionized hydrogen to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies and luminous quasars, with the common theme of developing the theoretical tools needed to chart their physical and chemical evolution.  It centers on the development and application of the large-scale plasma simulation code Cloudy, a multi-pronged effort that combines plasma simulations, numerical radiative transport theory, and atomic and molecular physics.  The goal is to establish a theoretical understanding of the underlying physics that governs what we observe, extending the existing successful framework to increasingly complex environments.\r\n\r\nStrong broader impact comes from the fact that Cloudy is openly available and is used by others in more than 100 papers each year (many of them the doctoral theses of students at other universities).  The principal investigator also supervises several graduate students each year.  Programs incorporating aspects of this research are presented at an observatory open to students and to the public.",
