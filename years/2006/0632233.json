The main focus of this proposal is to examine whether chemolithotrophic microbes are common in the Arctic Ocean and whether chemolithotrophy is key to the survival of bacteria and archaea during the winter months. This interdisciplinary project will use environmental genomics, microbial ecology, and biogeochemistry to examine microbial life in coastal Arctic waters. The work will be conducted at Barrow, Alaska, and will use an environmental genomic approach to identify the main chemolithoautotrophic microbes. The scientific team has also proposed studies to investigate the environmental functionality of these organisms, and will include qRT-PCR and combined FISH and microautoradiography (Micro-FISH) in their research plan. It will link Arctic and Antarctic genome studies, and it will involve colleagues in Bergen, Norway. The lead investigator is a member of PAME (Polar Aquatic Microbial Ecology), which has been recognized as an IPY program by the ICSU/WMO Joint Committee. The project will support the work of a graduate student and provide material for intern projects conducted by undergraduate students. The lead investigator will give presentations about the Arctic to the general public (Coastal Current Lecture Series and Coast Day, an open house that draws 10,000 people annually) and will also give presentations to the Barrow community to discuss the role of marine microbes in Arctic climate change. \r\n",
