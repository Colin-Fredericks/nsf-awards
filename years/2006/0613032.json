 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last few decades, iterative methods, in particular Krylov \r\nsubspace-based algorithms, have become widely-used and indispensable tools for\r\nthe solution of large-scale computational problems in science and engineering.\r\nWhile most Krylov methods were originally developed for the solution of large\r\neigenvalue problems or large systems of linear equations, starting in the early\r\n1990s, Krylov techniques have also proven to be powerful tools for order \r\nreduction of large-scale systems of ordinary differential equations or\r\nalgebraic-differential equations.  The basic idea of order reduction is to\r\nreplace the original large-scale system with a system of similar type, but of\r\nmuch smaller dimension.  In recent years, a lot of Krylov machinery for order\r\nreduction has been put in place.  Still, the existing algorithms are not at the\r\nsame level as Krylov subspace methods for eigenvalue problems or systems of\r\nlinear equations.  For example, Krylov subspace methods combined with powerful\r\npreconditioning techniques are routinely used to solve linear systems with\r\nmillions of unknowns.  However, the application of Krylov techniques for order\r\nreduction to such truly large-scale systems remains prohibitive for a number of\r\nreasons.  First, most existing algorithms generate reduced-order models via\r\nexplicit projection after a suitable basis for the underlying Krylov subspace\r\nhas been generated, and thus they require the storage of all these basis \r\nvectors.  In the truly large-scale case, the resulting storage requirements\r\nbecome excessive.  Second, Lanczos-type algorithms generate reduced-order\r\nmodels on the fly, and thus avoid the issue of keeping all basis vectors.\r\nHowever, in general, the resulting reduced-order models do not preserve crucial\r\nproperties of the original large-scale system, such as stability or passivity.\r\nThird, all existing Krylov techniques involve the solution of large sparse\r\nlinear systems of equations at each Krylov iteration.  It is usually assumed\r\nthat these systems can be solved via sparse direct methods.  However, this is\r\nnot the case in all applications.  The goal of the proposed work is to develop\r\nnew and effective Krylov subspace-based methods for order reduction that\r\novercome the above issues and are thus applicable to truly large-scale systems.\r\nIn particular, the focus will be on techniques that allow the use of\r\npreconditioned iterative methods for the solution of the inner linear systems,\r\ninstead of sparse direct methods, and on methods that allow flexible\r\nshift-and-invert preconditioners for the outer Krylov iteration itself.  The\r\nuse of nonlinear semidefinite programming to remedy the loss of stability or\r\npassivity of reduced-order models generated by Lanczos-type algorithms will\r\nalso be explored.  The proposed research is expected to lead to a more complete\r\nunderstanding of Krylov subspace-based order reduction and to result in\r\noriginal algorithms that are on par with their state-of-the-art counterparts\r\nfor large eigenvalue problems and large linear systems.\r\n\r\nThe use of computational techniques and numerical simulation is ubiquitous in\r\nthe design and verification of today's complex engineering systems.  For\r\nexample, a state-of-the-art computer computer chip contains about one billion\r\ntransistors.  Despite this enormous complexity, the design and verification of\r\nsuch chips is done almost exclusively with simulation, and first-time-correct\r\nfabrication in silicon is the norm.  However, even with today's computing\r\npower, simulation of a complete system is often not feasible due to the\r\nextremely high dimension of the mathematical model describing the system.\r\nOrder reduction is a key technology to make such simulation tasks possible by\r\nfirst replacing the original model by a suitable approximation of much smaller\r\ndimension.  The proposed research is expected to lead to new order-reduction\r\ntechniques that will have applications in many important areas, including the\r\ndesign of computer chips, microelectromechanical systems, nanotechnology, and\r\nstructural dynamics.\r\n",
