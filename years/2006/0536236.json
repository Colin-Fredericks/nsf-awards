 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Electrical (55)\r\n\r\nThis project is developing educational materials for control systems and digital signal processing courses in the Electrical Engineering curriculum.  The conventional approach in control systems courses is to use the classical DC motor as a primary example.  The investigator is exploring the incorporation of the principles of magnetic levitation (maglev) into control systems, digital control systems, and signals/systems courses as well as senior design projects.  This involves developing a control system to keep a ferromagnetic object suspended, without contact, beneath an electromagnet, and to move the suspended ferromagnetic object to simulate a maglev train.  This inherently nonlinear and open-loop unstable application complements the conventional DC motor example as well as increases awareness of an emerging technology such as the maglev train while offering a technical challenge for students.  Anticipated outcomes include development of prototypes for one-, two-, and three-dimensional maglev systems along with relevant software, laboratory experiments, and instructional materials.\r\n",
