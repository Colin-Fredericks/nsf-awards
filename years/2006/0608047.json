 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science and the City: Fusion of Formal and Informal Learning Experiences into an Innovative Geoscience MA-Teacher Program\r\n\r\nThe \"Science & the City\" project is developing a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program for Earth science teachers thematically structured upon a \"City-as-Lab\" approach. The American Museum of Natural History, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Central Park Conservancy, The Prospect Park Alliance and Prospect Park Audubon Center, and The National Parks of New York Harbor, have teamed with Brooklyn College for the development of this program. A Program Design Team composed of higher education faculty in geology and education, informal science educators, high school Earth science teachers and school administrators has been configured to create a new MA-Teacher program that uses a thematic \"essential questions\" approach to course development and infuses informal learning opportunities at partnered sites into a formal, college-based master's degree program.  New opportunities are being created that will allow licensed teachers to apply for second certification in Earth science and science graduates with no education background to apply for an initial certification in Earth science teaching. Graduates of the program will be prepared to integrate the resources of the city into their teaching and will be part of an extensive community of scientists and educators at museums, parks, and scientific organizations across the city. \r\n",
