 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this collaborative research project is to explore a unique concept of manufacturing using carbon nanotube/nanofiber based nanopapers and achieve the multifunctionalities of such nanocomposites with improved structural damping, thermal conductivity, and fire retardancy. This project's approach involves making carbon nanopapers by the filtration of well-dispersed carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers under well-controlled processing conditions. The carbon nanopapers are integrated into laminates using modified composites manufacturing processes. Process analysis will be conducted using multi-scale and multi-physics modeling techniques in an attempt to optimize the quality of carbon nanopapers and nanocomposites. Two carefully selected test beds will be utilized for the proof-of-concept of this technology. Fundamental research in the project will contribute to the understanding of the processing-morphology-property relationship of multifunctional nanocomposites and polymer transport in the hybrid reinforcements.\r\n\r\nThis research will have a major impact on nanomanufacturing through advancing processing science of carbon nanopapers and multifunctional nanocomposites. The carbon nanopaper offers numerous potential applications including structural composites, electronics, heat sinks, and fuel cells. If successful, this research will develop light-weight composites with improved thermo-mechanical and structural damping properties for potential applications in space, aerospace, and soldier protection equipment. This research will enhance the thermal conductivity and fire retardancy of nanocomposites, which can enable many potential applications such as ship and offshore structures. This research involves strong interdisciplinary collaboration between materials science and mechanical engineering. In addition, the innovative research will also benefit undergraduate and graduate education at the two collaborating universities (University of South Alabama and University of Houston) through the Nanocomposites Educational Kits and new course modules on nanocomposite materials. This research will also be integrated into minority programs, women engineering programs, and outreach programs at both universities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOutcome Report\n \nThrough the collaboration of Dr. Gou of University of Central Florida (UCF) and Dr. Song of University of Houston (UH), this project developed a systematic approach to address both basic research and applications research in nanocomposites science and technology. The development of structural and multifunctional nanocomposites has the following six key components: (i) carbon nanopaper manufacturing, (ii) carbon nanopaperenabled nanocomposites manufacturing, (iii) mechanical and damping properties of nanocomposites, (iv) thermal conductivity and flammability of nanocomposites, (v) modeling and simulation in nanocomposites manufacturing, and vi) proof-of-concept test beds.\n \nOutcomes  in Intellectual Merit: The proposed project involved strong interdisciplinary collaboration between materials science and engineering (carbon nanopaper, polymer composites manufacturing and characterization-UCF) and mechanical engineering (static mechanical, fatigue and structural damping evaluation of polymer nanocomposites - UH). This research developed a new concept to manufacture nanocomposites based on carbon nanopapers. The light-weight carbon nanoapers were integrated into composites structures to enhance their static mechanical properties, fatigue and structural damping properties. This research also studied the acoustic damping of nanocomposites, which could enable many potential applications. In addition, fundamental research in the proposed project contributed to the understanding of the dynamic damping modeling of nanocomposites. The proposed research has positive impact on nanomanufacturing through advancing manufacturing process science of structural and multifunctional nanocomposites. \n \nOutcomes in Broader Impacts: Through the collaboration of 5 instructors (including the PIs) from 3 diverse universities - University of Central Florida, University of Houston, and Hong Kong Polytechnic University, this project achieved many broader impacts. At University of Houston, this project offered thesis topics to two Ph.D. students and partially provided financial support to three graduate students: two Ph.D. students and one M.S. student. A new course module on nanocomposite developed based on the research findings and was integrated into Dr. Song's teaching, benefiting both undergraduate and graduate education at Univeristy of Houston. Through REU supplements, three domestic undergraduate students received training in nanotechnology. Two K-12 teacher received training in nanocomposites through the RET program.   \n \nThis Project Outcomes Report for the General Public is displayed verbatim as submitted by the Principal Investigator (PI) for this award.
