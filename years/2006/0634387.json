For this, the applicants are instituting and organizing the First International Conference on Biomolecular Engineering (ICBE).  This meeting, to be held every two years, will cover the breadth of Biomolecular Engineering and serve to promote, shape, and refine the definition of the field as a whole.  The Theme of the first meeting will be \"Integration of Biological Design Principles, from Molecules to Cells\"; the conference Aims are to provide a venue: (1)  For scientific presentations from a diverse group of leading researchers who cover the breadth of Biomolecular Engineering, (2)  For interactions between academic and industry researchers, who bring different approaches and perspectives to the field, (3)  For active participation by Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers, who represent the future of Biomolecular Engineering, and (4) For healthy discourse on the current state of the field as a whole, with an emphasis on integrating across the interfaces between different levels of biological complexity. The three major topics of the conference will be: (1) engineering functional biomolecules, (2) molecular interactions and intracellular pathways, and (3) systems biology and multi-scale integration. The scientific program will include 8-10 invited talks, roughly 20 contributed talks, and 2 poster sessions for graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty to showcase their research, as well as panel discussions to discuss and debate the current issues of this field.  \r\n\r\n",
