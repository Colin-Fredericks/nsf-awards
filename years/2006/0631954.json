 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of this workshop on Product Re-X: Recovery, Recycling, Remanufacturing and Reuse Innovations in Business Models, Product Design and Economic Development to be held in Atlanta, June 21, 2006 is to explore multi-disciplinary systems level approaches and needs in this relatively are of Environmentally Benign Design and Manufacturing. In product design and manufacturing, there is a growing concern for considering post-use as part of the design process, so that appropriate decisions can be made on recovery of materials or components, recycling of materials, remanufacture of parts or the complete system, and reuse of some components while recycling others. The need for comprehensive systems approaches to address environmental issues in manufacturing was noted in a recent NSF/DOE sponsored study on Environmentally Benign Manufacturing. The overarching goal of this workshop is to facilitate the knowledge transfer and collaboration between parties that have different perspectives on product re-X and to stimulate innovative system-level solutions that will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of product re-X in practice. This interdisciplinary workshop promotes such comprehensive approaches for the post-use phase in a unique manner that brings together engineering with management, public policy and economic development. The perspectives that will be covered include engineering aspects (material selection and product design), enterprise business models (remanufacturing strategy, voluntary take-back consortia), innovation (bio-based materials), regulation (impact of international policy developments on US businesses) and economic development (recycling as a development tool). More importantly, we will emphasize the linkages between these perspectives and emphasize integrated approaches to product re-X challenges.\r\nIn addition, there is scant research on some important areas including the impact of emerging technologies such as bio-based materials on the post-use phase of products, which we aim to stimulate with this workshop.\r\n\r\n",
