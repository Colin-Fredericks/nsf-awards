A new 20-inch computer controlled telescope and a research-class CCD camera will be purchased and housed in an existing 16-foot dome.\r\n\r\nThe primary users of the telescopes will be the permanent and seasonal staff of the MMO and the MMO REU students. 30% of the observing time will be available to visiting astronomers. The telescope will also be regularly used for public outreach during the MMO  Open Nights, for programs of mentored astronomical research for students enrolled in local public and private schools and for other special educational programs. The MMO has a century-long history of important research on variable stars and asteroids based on observations with its 7.5-inch photographic Cooke/Clark telescope, the only research telescope at the MMO. Now, the era of photographic astronomy is over, and the MMO has had to turn to obtaining observing time on nationally available facilities. Although successful at winning observing time for short periods of time, the MMO experiences an acute shortage of opportunities to perform long-term observations of variable objects, one of the traditional topics of its research and one of the most fruitful themes for student research projects. As a result of this award, the MMO will once again have modern observational facilities in situ to support its scientific and educational mission.\r\n\r\nExperienced, dedicated scientists and talented students will use this new, modern facility. For almost 50 years student research has been a major component of the research activities at the MMO. Over the next 15 years at least six REU students per year (over 100 in all) will participate in modern photometric observations. Each student will present his or her results at an AAS meeting, and, based on past recent history, 75% of them will eventually generate a refereed publication from their REU project. Visitor usage will swell these numbers.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the MMO has greatly strengthened its program of public outreach, and now attracts over 1500 people per year to its observatory open nights. During the next 15-20 years, thousands of Nantucket summer visitors, seasonal residents, and year-round islanders will attend open nights and special public programs based on the use of the proposed telescope. Education programs with the Nantucket K-12 schools will open the joys of science to many young students, and will provide opportunities to join a mentored program of research with a modern telescope. Astronomy workshops for teachers are now a part of the MMO educational outreach program. But, perhaps the most important contribution will be to the development of new, motivated and qualified astronomers through the MMO REU program, of which this telescope will be a crucial part.\r\n\r\nThis award is funded by the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n\r\n",
