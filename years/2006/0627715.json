 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aleksandar Kuzmanovic\r\nPollution Resilience for Internet Caches\r\nNorthwestern University\r\n0627715\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThe majority of requests for the Domain Name System (DNS) entries, web, \r\nor even peer-to-peer (p2p) content in today's Internet are not served \r\nby origin servers, but rather by intermediate caches. As such, they \r\npose an attractive target for malicious attackers. This project will \r\naddress the problem of cache-targeted DoS attacks on a broad front: \r\n(i) by developing and studying a new generation of large-scale \r\ncache-targeted pollution attacks, (ii) by designing fundamental \r\nknowledge in creating deployable anti-pollution mechanisms, and \r\n(iii) by designing and implementing counter-DoS solutions for three \r\nimminent threats: web, p2p, and local DNS cache-targeted pollution \r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nThe proposed pollution attacks pose a challenging problem for the \r\nentire Internet community: (i) they are capable of degrading overall \r\nnetwork performance without flooding network resources; (ii) they \r\npossess a dangerous level of indirection; (iii) they pollute the cache \r\nwith unpopular, rather than bogus files; (iv) they may operate at much \r\nlonger time-scales than classical DoS attacks operate and are thus \r\ninvisible for state-of-the-art counter-DoS schemes. \r\nBy leveraging data streaming computation techniques, our goal is to \r\nattain a scalable solution by significantly reducing the amount of \r\nstate needed to maintain, and to make the detection system itself \r\nresilient to DoS attacks. The involvement of industrial partners in \r\nthis project will accelerate the transfer of the research results \r\ninto operation. In particular, we will collaborate closely with the \r\nUltraDNS Corporation which provides DNS services for over 20\\% of \r\nthe world domains, including top-level domains as well as numerous \r\nprivate organizations.\r\n",
