 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CCLI Phase 2 Expansion Project is addressing attrition in engineering programs due to the problems incoming engineering students often have with the traditional freshman calculus sequence. This project is replacing this sequence with a novel freshman-level engineering mathematics class that covers just-in-time, salient mathematics topics used in core engineering courses. Engineering faculty are teaching this new mathematics course and motivating all mathematical topics by their direct application in core engineering courses. This model is allowing students to advance in the engineering curriculum without first completing the traditional calculus sequence. The model is also placing some sophomore-level engineering courses in the freshman year and moving a revised engineering mathematics sequence, to be taught by the math department, later in the curriculum. \r\n\r\nThree universities are testing the new model and determining whether it increases student retention, motivation, and success in engineering. The project is being assessed through a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures of student retention, motivation and success in engineering, with particular emphasis on student learning in subsequent math and engineering courses. The project is being disseminated through the development of a new textbook, faculty professional development workshops, a website, and outreach to regional high schools.\r\n",
