 "awd_abstract_narration": "Epistemology and Fisheries Science: A Study of Forced Knowledge Collisions\r\nThis request for SGER funding describes an exploration of what happens when\r\nworldviews collide. Its backdrop is a recently initiated co-management regime in Chile that\r\nmandates partnerships between fishermen and scientists, effectively setting the competing\r\nknowledge systems of these two groups on a collision course towards a very uncertain outcome.\r\nThe object of the proposed study is to examine this outcome and explore its relevance to the\r\nwider field of Science and Technology Studies.  Through interviews with scientists participating in the Chilean program, the proposed study aims to discern scientists  perceptions of differences in the two groups knowledge about the resources they are required to jointly assess and manage, as well as their perceptions about themselves and the fishermen they work with as creators and defenders of this knowledge. By examining scientists  experiences, it aims to get a sense of discrepancies in what the two groups know about the biology of a single species, the loco  (Concholepas concholepas), that may ultimately determine whether the  forced knowledge collisions coalesce into productive partnerships or splinter into culture clashes with reverberations for the very concept of scientific resource management.  Interview questions will elicit scientists  estimations of differences in the substance, generation, transmission, substantiation, and validity of each groups knowledge of the loco and will discern possible contextual variables, such as temporal duration of each partnership, that might influence how these knowledge differences are dealt with by each partnership.\r\nIntellectual merit: This exploratory research into an innovative fisheries management\r\nprogram is premised on the notion that the outcomes of collisions between scientists  knowledge\r\nand fishermens'  knowledge are determined by fundamental epistemological issues elemental to\r\nScience and Technology Studies. In its consideration of processes of knowledge development and\r\ntransmission and its focus on the philosophical underpinnings of different knowledge systems, it\r\nposes questions of paramount interest to the discipline and presents a unique opportunity to\r\nadvance abstract inquiry through field research.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: In the immediate run, the proposed study has potential to contribute\r\nto better relations between users of competing knowledge systems in Chilean fisheries science\r\nand management. But the gains of the research will be applicable far beyond Chile and the field\r\nof fisheries. As an analysis of one of the worlds'  most cutting-edge instances of two up-and coming natural resource management models -- co-management (the shared making of decisions\r\nabout harvest and conservation by government and resource users) and cooperative research (the\r\njoint endeavor by resource users and professional scientists to characterize natural resources) --\r\nthis study promises to illuminate the multifaceted nature of knowledge conflicts that threaten\r\nthese arrangements and to lay the theoretical groundwork for future research that will benefit all\r\nparties involved in these collaborative efforts.\r\n\r\nWhy SGER?: This proposal responds to a unique and fleeting opportunity to study\r\nknowledge conflicts as they emerge. As fishermen-scientist partnerships mature, the ability to\r\nobserve the initial stages of these partnerships disappears. As a consequence both of this urgency\r\nand of a lack of comparable studies documenting knowledge collisions and examining what\r\nhappens to them over time, the methods proposed for this study may be somewhat provisionary.\r\nAn SGER is suitable to this project because it allows for flexibility and exploration. In addition,\r\nthis project is considered preliminary because the interviews with scientists that it encompasses\r\ncan be seen as a prelude and a compliment to a larger project involving systematic surveying of\r\nfishermen participating in the collaborations under scrutiny. The second, fishermen-focused phase\r\nof the larger project will be funded by a Fulbright grant awarded to the senior field researcher for\r\nthe period of March to  December 2006, which further limits the temporal window of opportunity\r\navailable for this SGER project.\r\n",
