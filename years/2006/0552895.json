In addition, the presence of an NSF Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate Program (AGEP) will create a pipeline for minority REU students to pursue Ph.D. degrees in a diverse and supportive academic community.  It is anticipated that explicit linking of technical and human aspects during this REU experience will provide a new model for future researchers in Environmental Engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
