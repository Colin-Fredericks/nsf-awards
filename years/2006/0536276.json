 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21) This project is providing a structured opportunity for ten Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to reform their college algebra or calculus curricula. Three person teams from each school are working with a set of mentors who have experience both with the national reform efforts and in local implementations of reform projects. The teams gather in the early summer to share strategies and develop their implementation plans during a faculty development workshop. Mentors follow up during the academic year with site visits and all teams gather during the winter mathematics meetings to report on progress. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its emphasis on developing problem solving and modeling skills in the students, changing the classroom from being teacher-centric to student-centric with an emphasis on small group work (activities/projects), and championing the appropriate use of technology for teaching and learning mathematics. Each participating school is experimenting with their new curriculum for at least two years. This enables the performance of an evaluation study that compares student learning under the reformed programs to student learning under traditional programs. Findings from this study are contributing to a larger assessment effort currently led by the Mathematical Association of America, thus leading to an enlargement of the knowledge base in this area. The project is also demonstrating broader impact through its direct engagement of faculty at leading HBCU campuses and its ultimate effect on students at those institutions. The EHR Division of Human Resources Development (HRD) is providing significant co-funding of this project because of its alignment with the mission and goals of HRD.",
