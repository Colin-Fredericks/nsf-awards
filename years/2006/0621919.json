 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to conduct a feasibility study for implementing carbon nanotubes, nanotube-nanotube and nanotube-polymer nanocomposites as novel optical sensors, detectors and photovoltaic devices operating in the critical long-wavelength range of spectrum. The approach will comprise developing new strategies for controlled and property tunable engineering of device specific nanotube topologies based on the example of individual nanotubes, nanotube arrays and bundles, designing and carrying out a battery of relevant characterizations and measurements as well as their property optimization. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit lies in detailed investigation of novel electro-optical effects and phenomena by performing temperature and diameter dependent transport and photo-conduction studies on nanotubes and their nano-composites as to elucidate the primary mechanisms behind light absorption as well as photocarrier generation and recombination as a function of the nanotube diameter, type and configuration. Novel one-dimensional nanotube-polymer nano-composites will be engineered while their transport and spectral response in the long-wavelength spectral ranges which will be investigated experimentally and analyzed theoretically. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact is to create a collaborative, interdisciplinary and multicultural program at UWM with the focus to enhance research in nano-photonics and nano-opto-electronics, which will allow for preparing future generation of scientists, engineers and educators, and stimulate active participation of underrepresented groups and K-12 students in research and education. The projected benefits include future development of a new class of advanced infrared sensors with drastically improved performance in multi-spectral and high sensitivity applications, including remote temperature sensing, analyte sensing applications, biological sensing, military target identification, and astronomy.\r\n\r\n",
