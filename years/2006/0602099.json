He will correlate the new Multi-Array Galactic Plane Imaging Survey (MAGPIS) with existing surveys to construct a detailed, multiwavelength picture of the Galactic plane and to explore its population of supernova remnants and pulsars. MAGPIS is a Very Large Array (VLA) radio survey of sensitivity, resolution and dynamic range more than an order of magnitude greater than any previously available.\r\n\r\nDr. Agueros will also reach high school students from traditionally underrepresented groups by working with programs such as the Science and Technology Entry Program at\r\nColumbia to develop a series of astronomy lectures for their students. He will also participate in teacher-training activities such as those organized by the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). Dr. Agueros's outreach program builds on relationships that he has developed with several organizations in New York City and on his previous work to understand and address the \"leaky pipeline\" that prevents many students from underrepresented populations from pursuing higher education and careers in astronomy.\r\n",
