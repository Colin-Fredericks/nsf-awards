 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe East African Rift System (EARS) is the only place on the planet \r\nwhere the geochemical and isotopic compositions of continental mafic \r\nlavas spanning 40 million years of volcanism can be studied.  This \r\ngeochemical information must be used in conjunction with modern \r\ngeophysical and seismic information to address fundamental geodynamic \r\nquestions about the relationship between features of the deep Earth \r\nand those at the surface. We focus on the evolution of upper mantle \r\ntemperature and composition by using numerical models of limited \r\nmantle depth extent. Geological and geochemical observations in the \r\nEARS provide strong constraints on the timing and location of melt \r\nformation in the mantle. The dynamical modeling provides the ability \r\nto predict the formation of melt in a self-consistent manner and make \r\nquantitative estimates of the temperature, depth and rate of melting. \r\nWe will also pursue a comprehensive geochemical study of select \r\nMgO-rich EARS basalts. New geochemical and isotopic (Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf-He) \r\ndata, coupled with existing data from the literature, will be used to \r\ndefine the distribution of chemically distinct reservoirs that \r\nsustain EARS magmatism. Trace element and isotope geochemical data \r\nenable refinement of the compositional structure of the upper mantle \r\nand will help constrain reasonable dynamical models. Our main \r\nhypothesis is that one or more plumes bring hot material from the \r\nEarths interior to melt below the EARS lithosphere, since we find it \r\ndifficult to understand how long-lived and voluminous volcanism can \r\nbe generated without such deep transport. A sensitivity study will \r\nallow us to estimate whether and how non-plume models can predict the \r\ntiming and location of melt generation observed in the EARS. For \r\nplume models, we will assess a variety of dynamical scenarios by \r\nincorporating tracer techniques to test whether the observed \r\ndistribution of geochemical signatures and volumes of magmatic \r\nproducts along the EARS can be satisfied with a single \r\ncompositionally heterogeneous plume. The resulting dynamical models \r\nwill enhance our understanding of the origin of the EARS, the African \r\nsuperswell and eventually the African superplume. The collaboration \r\nbetween geochemists with mutually supporting areas of expertise \r\n(Furman  trace element geochemistry, Bryce  lithophile radiogenic \r\nisotope geochemistry, Graham  helium isotope geochemistry) and a \r\ngeophysicist / numerical modeler (van Keken) will provide a \r\nmuch-needed interaction between observational and theoretical \r\nefforts.  The results of the work will be incorporated into \r\nresidential and electronic delivery courses at the participating \r\nuniversities, including several Historically Black Colleges and \r\nUniversities. We will support graduate students at Penn State, \r\nMichigan and New Hampshire, introducing this next generation of \r\nscientists to interdisciplinary research and collaboration.\r\n",
