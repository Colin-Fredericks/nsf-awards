 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Departmental Multiuser Instrument Acquisition (CRIF-MU) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Bowling Green State University will acquire a scanning confocal microscope.  Prof. D. C. Neckers will use the proposed instrument in studies of microencapsulation, photopolymerization, 3D imaging and studies of organic-electronic materials. Other primary users include Prof. Pavel Anzenbacher who will use the instrument to investigate photophysical processes in new supramolecular materials as anion sensors as well as donor-acceptor OLED materials, and Prof. F. N. Castellano who will use the instrument for studies of single molecule spectroscopy of metal-organic chromophores, for 2-D and 3-D photochemical fabrication of metallic objects and nanostructures, in addition to the study of dye sensitized solar cells. For Prof. Wilson, the instrument will be an essential tool in his research involving high-intensity photochemistry and development of photochemical tools for manipulation of biological molecules with emphasis on photodynamic modification of nucleic acids. Prof. McKay will be able to use the microscope in studies of luminescent cyanobacterial bioreporters focused on the development of whole-cell sensors for iron in marine ecosystems. \r\n\r\nThe proposed instrument and associated investigations will have significant impact beyond the basic scientific community as the interdisciplinary themes presented are relevant to many areas of emerging technologies and life sciences with anticipated benefits to society, the economy, and the educational mission of the university and the NSF. While the acquisition of the instrumentation will open new avenues of research at BGSU, it will also greatly advance the educational mission of both departments whose primary research projects serve as a training conduit for both undergraduate and graduate students. The instrument will be used by students and postdoctoral associates involved in photosynthetic, photonic materials, photochemistry, biochemistry, and life science-related research projects.\r\n",
