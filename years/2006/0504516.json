 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop and apply a technique called Fluorescence Confocal Polarizing Microscopy (FCPM) that provides 3-dimensional visualization of the molecular orientation in liquid crystals.  Liquid crystal matrix influences will be characterized to determine the interactions between colloidal particles, how the external electric field changes the structure of layered liquid crystals with one-dimensional periodicity, what are the structural and dynamic features of topological defects such as dislocations and disclinations, and what is the structural organization of biologically relevant materials such as actin. This research will be conducted at the Liquid Crystal Institute at Kent State University (KSU). KSU provides for graduate (Chemical Physics Interdisciplinary Program) and undergraduate training (supported by NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates grant), and provides a fertile ground for industrial partnerships (Industrial Partnerships Program involving about 30 companies).  \r\n\r\nThis project focusing on the basic science of liquid crystal systems is aimed at providing immediate practical benefits to society, namely, through the development of liquid crystals for biosensors, in which the colloidal particles are represented by bacteria and viruses, and fast displays and beam steering devices. The molecular orientation patterns in liquid crystals formed by molecules of biological origin, such as actin, will aid an understanding of the role of orientational order in biological systems.  Finally, the study will address the role of imperfections of liquid crystals, so-called topological defects, and how they alter the properties and structure of the liquid crystalline medium.   \r\n",
