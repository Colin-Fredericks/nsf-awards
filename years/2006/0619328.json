 "awd_abstract_narration": "Magnetorheological (MR) elastomer composites are among a few smart materials which can provide satisfactory performance on the four essential properties for engineering applications: quick-response, wide-controllable range, long-term stability, and simple servo-system. However, they are quite soft with respect to the storage moduli and uncontrollable in terms of damping ratios, impairing their great potentials applied to sensors, actuators, and semi-active devices.  In this project, we aim to develop an integrated fabrication and testing system for novel MR elastomer nanocomposites reinforced with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), whose properties can be significantly improved and actively controlled in comparison with the existing MR composites. The system consists of a materials fabrication module and a materials testing module to control the ferrous particles and CNTs to form desired micro-scale and nano-scale structures respectively. The completion and success of the development will allow us to fabricate the state-of-the-art smart nanocomposites with improved performance and functionality. We are committed to taking advantages of the established system to investigate and optimize the nanocomposites performance for various engineering applications such as smart dampers and isolators for seismic protection of civil infrastructure, pressure sensors for structural health monitoring, adaptive power actuators and semi-active suspension for automobile systems, and adaptive acoustic emitters for sonar systems.\r\nThis project is among the first attempt to develop such a fabrication and testing system for MR smart nanocomposites. It will lay a solid foundation for advanced research in the area of smart nanocomposites with various engineering applications. It will promote cross-disciplinary research among materials scientists, structural engineers, and solid mechanics researchers. Furthermore, it will provide the state-of-the-art instrumentation and opportunity for research training of diversified students to gain experience on hand-on training in materials design and system integration as well as actual control systems implementations.\r\n",
