 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sidman proposes two main lines of investigation.  The first involves \r\nlexicographic Groebner bases and the other has to do with properties of \r\nsecant varieties.  The goal of her work on lexicographic Groebner bases is \r\nto use the notion of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity to produce concrete \r\nstatements about the complexity of the lexicographic term ordering and the \r\ngeometry of projections that would explicitly confirm long-held beliefs \r\nabout their behavior.  She also proposes to work on several problems in \r\nwhich computational and combinatorial methods are applied to the study of \r\nsecant varieties.  Interest in secant varieties has arisen in diverse \r\nareas including algebraic geometry, coding theory, computational \r\ncomplexity, and algebraic statistics.  Recent applications of secant \r\nvarieties in algebraic statistics have brought both new techniques and new \r\nquestions to the forefront. \r\n\r\nIn the undergraduate mathematics curriculum the objects of so-called \r\n\"modern\" algebra, groups, rings, fields, and modules, have a reputation \r\nfor being very abstract.  Indeed, the names \"modern algebra\" and \"abstract \r\nalgebra\" are often used interchangeably.  The power of the abstraction \r\nonly becomes evident when one sees how these ideas enable us to discuss an \r\nincreasingly large variety of applications in a common framework.  \r\nComputational algebra is an area that is useful to pure mathematicians in \r\nalgebraic geometry and commutative algebra.  It is also able to bridge the \r\ndivide between abstract algebra and many concrete applications including \r\ninteger programming, enumeration problems in statistics, and geometric \r\nmodeling.  Sidman's first project connects computational algebra with \r\nalgebraic geometry.  The questions she proposes to study related to secant \r\nvarieties are also related to algebraic geometry, but were motivated by \r\nwork in the emerging field of algebraic statistics.  Thus, the proposed \r\nwork reflects the ways in which pure and applied mathematics influence \r\neach other, often in unexpected ways.\r\n",
