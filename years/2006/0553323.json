 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this new GOALI award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the work of Dr. Raymond C. Francis of the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse, New York in collaboration with Andritz, Inc. of Glens Falls, New York. This research, involving the chemistry of paper production, will investigate the chemistry of soda pulping catalyzed by anthraquinones (AQs). Residual lignins (in the pulp fibers) were analyzed and the results indicate that the rate of lignin condensation (C-C bond formation) is higher for these soda/AQs processes as compared to the standard kraft process (sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide) that is currently being used. The bleaching chemicals (oxygen, chlorine dioxide, hydrogen peroxide) that are used are ineffective at breaking these C-C bonds and bleached soda/AQs pulps appear to contain more lignin fragments and tend to be less white than bleached kraft pulps. In the current process being used, recovery and recycle of the sodium sulfide is a major complication.  If the bleachability problem of soda/AQs pulps can be solved then many kraft mills would convert to soda/AQs processes and produce low-sulfur black liquors. Further, due to the significantly higher efficiency of steam reforming/gasification, not all of the flue gases generated with this process would be needed by the mill. Excess flue gases can easily be converted to electricity, liquid fuels or chemicals.\r\n\r\nThis research has resulted from on-going university-industry collaboration with the industrial partner being the fiber line supplier for the only full scale soda/AQ (anthraquinone) mill in the U.S.  Society would benefit from this research in more energy being produced from wood, a carbon dioxide-neutral source, and by a reduction in the emission of reduced sulfur compounds into the environment. The NSF funding would be used to educate and train a graduate student in the critical area of process modifications to increase energy and chemical production from wood, an abundant and renewable resource.\r\n",
