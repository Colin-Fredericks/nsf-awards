 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multihop wireless networks can offer a wide variety of important applications that could have a substantial impact throughout society as mobile devices become more and more critical to our day-to-day lives. However, the infrastructure of such networks is vulnerable to many types of network dynamics such as node mobility, potential attacks, and misbehavior. This research aims to develop models and algorithms for a deeper understanding of multihop networks when multiple failures are present. Specifically, this project includes three thrusts under the theme of resilience-to-failure: (1) the design, modeling, and analysis of the impact of multiple failures based on the Semi-Markov Process; (2) the design, evaluation, and implementation of a new mechanism in order to minimize the impact of neighboring node failures; (3) the study of distributed optimization algorithms for hierarchy and cluster formation. The expected results, such as models of node behavior and failures, along with techniques for topology discovery and topology optimization, promise significant scientific impact by presenting a theoretical framework for the design and implementation of network algorithms. The societal impact of this research lies in the wide deployment of portable devices for which communication failures may affect human welfare. Resilience-to-failure, as one of the areas that integrate multi-disciplinary characteristics, is used to initiate innovative curriculum and to advance the integration of research and education. In addition to traditional publications, informative and instructional materials will be developed and posted on the web in a timely manner for fast dissemination of results and education in the developed techniques.",
