 "awd_abstract_narration": "The P.I.'s research programme is to study conformally \r\ninvariant measures first in multiply connected domains and \r\nthen on Riemann surfaces. In particular: Identify diffusions \r\non an appropriate moduli space that give rise to  conformally \r\ninvariant measures on curves satisfying the restriction \r\nproperty; Measuring the restriction defect for other \r\ndiffusions, and calculating or characterize intersection \r\nprobabilities as functions of the moduli; Link the measure \r\nand its change under perturbations of the conformal structure \r\nto highest weight representations; Study conformally \r\ninvariant quantities for domino tilings and the Gaussian free \r\nfield in multiply connected domains. \r\n \r\nSelf-avoiding planar curves arise in many natural contexts. \r\nFor example, if a very shallow plate is filled with water and \r\noil, we can consider the curve (or curves) separating the two \r\nliquids. Another example are coastlines, the borders of \r\ncountries on maps, or rivers seen from an airplane. \r\nTypically, these curves are very irregular. But what exactly \r\nis ``typical,'' and how can the irregularity be quantified? \r\nSince all coastlines are different, it does not make sense to \r\nlook for one self-avoiding curve as the mathematical model of \r\na coastline. On the other hand, it does make sense to look \r\nfor a probability distribution on the set of all \r\nself-avoiding curves ( the ``possible'' coastlines) so that \r\nif we sample from the set of these curves according to this \r\ndistribution, then the statistics are in agreement with \r\nstatistics of real coastlines. The P.I. proposes to study \r\nthese probability distributions in the case when the geometry \r\nis complicated by holes (think of pebbles in the shallow \r\nplate with water and oil) or the curves are situated on a \r\ncurved surface such as a sphere (the globe), a donut, or a \r\npretzel. \r\n \r\n",
