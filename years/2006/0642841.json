 "awd_abstract_narration": "As Global Environmental Change Science moves from a global scale to the regional, from global process to detail and complexity, and from observation and modeling to impact, its emphasis is increasingly on the scientific foundations of adaptation, mitigation and the assessments of risk. All these are socially constructed. The scientific analysis of the human dimensions of global change is therefore becoming a crucial component of the biophysical investigation of global change. \r\n    With the collaborative research networks (CRN II) the IAI has established a new global change science program which is largely focused on biophysical research. The IAI Directorate has taken an active role in developing international and interdisciplinary science within CRN II by linking projects, initiating regional and topical cooperation and moving towards a more balanced interdisciplinary science. Strengthening the social sciences in CRN II is a task prescribed by the IAI's science agenda and its need for a balanced research portfolio. This new grant program will build on the strong interdisciplinary networks created in CRN II and is designed to strengthen Theme IV, Human Dimensions and Policy Implications, of the IAI Science Agenda. The program is to develop a strong human dimensions research in conjunction with CRN II with specific emphasis on complex and dynamic coupled human and biophysical systems.\r\n    The specific intellectual merit of the activity is that the Small Grants Program for the Human Dimensions does not only call for human dimensions projects with their own disciplinary focus, but integrates a broad range of human science as an integral part of the new generation of natural science projects under CRN II. A genuine integration of the human sciences with funded CRN II projects will provide new directions not only in current CRN II research but in global change science. Human dimensions research has largely been conducted in much the same disciplinary focus as the natural science research. On the basis of the topics of existing CRN II networks, an overarching theme of 'vulnerability and adaptability of socio-ecological systems to global change' will provide opportunities for truly integrated research on human dimensions areas such as urban centers & urbanization, rural transformation and sustainability, institutional dimensions of adaptation and Global Environmental Change (GEC), human health or management of vulnerable zones and communities. The thematic priority will be on human dimensions research for topics with which synergies are expected with approved CRN II projects and that address current and future vulnerability and adaptability of socio-ecological systems to GEC.\r\n    The combination of CRN II with this new effort is expected to provide broader impacts by significantly enhancing the regional capacity to deal with global environmental change issues and their social and economic causes and effects in the Americas. The integrative approach will provide sound scientific understanding in support of sustainable development and adaptation to global change in the region. The major challenge, as highlighted in the CRN II program, will be to provide the best possible scientific basis for documenting, understanding and projecting changes in the Earth's life-support system and to facilitate full use of scientific information in policy and decision making on possible response strategies for adaptation or mitigation.",
