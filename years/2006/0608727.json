 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information-based complexity (IBC) studies optimal algorithms and\r\ncomputational complexity for the continuous problems which arise in\r\nphysical science, economics, engineering, and mathematical finance.\r\nIBC has studied such continuous problems as path integration, partial\r\ndifferential equations, systems of ordinary differential equations,\r\nnonlinear equations, integral equations, fixed points, and integration.\r\nUsually these problems have to be solved numerically and therefore\r\napproximately to within error e.  Often these problems involve a very\r\nlarge number of variables numbering in the hundreds or thousands.  If a\r\nworst case assurance of an e-approximation is demanded, then the\r\ncomputational complexity depends exponentially on the number of variables;\r\nthe problem suffers the \"curse of dimensionality\".  The investigators and\r\ntheir colleagues attempt to vanquish the curse by settling for a\r\nstochastic assurance (average, probabilistic, randomized) or by using\r\ndomain knowledge about the application.  The investigators are also\r\nstudying the power of quantum computation for continuous problems.  To\r\nunderstand the power of quantum computation for continuous problems one\r\nmust know the computational complexity of these problems on a classical\r\ncomputer in various settings.  This is exactly what has been studied in\r\nIBC.  Recently the investigators introduced a new quantum setting in which\r\nrandomized queries are permitted.  They have shown that for path\r\nintegration there is an exponential improvement for the qubit complexity\r\ncompared to the standard quantum setting.  This is important since the\r\nnumber of qubits is a critical resource for the foreseeable future. Among\r\nthe questions the investigators and their colleagues stydying are:\r\nWhat are the query and qubit complexities for other continuous problems?\r\nAre there trade-offs between query and qubit complexities?\r\n\r\nFor some forty years, computing has been driven by Moore's Law which is\r\nthe empirical observation that computing power doubles about every 18\r\nmonths.  Powerful computers have been crucial for our economic strength\r\nand our national security.  They have made the internet possible.  For a\r\nnumber of reasons the consensus among experts is that Moore's Law using\r\ncurrent silicon technology will end in some 10 to 15 years.  These reasons\r\ninclude the shrinkage of logic gates and wires to atomic size, the tre-\r\nmendous heat generated as chips get smaller and faster, and the cost of\r\nfabrication facilities.  Since it is so important to maintain the\r\nMoore's Law trajectory, new ways to compute are being considered.  One\r\nof the most promising ideas is to use the principles of quantum mechanics\r\nto do quantum computing.  The investigators and their colleagues are\r\nstudying the following question:  If physicists and chemists succeed in\r\nbuilding quantum computers, which continuous problems arising in science\r\nand engineering can be solved much faster on a quantum computer than on a\r\nclassical computer?\r\n",
