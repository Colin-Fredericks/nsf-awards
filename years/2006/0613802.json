 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the biodiversity of Mexico, the country with the greatest number of amphibians and reptiles in the world. A collaboration is proposed between the University of Texas at Arlington and the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.  Participants will conduct a comprehensive survey of the amphibians, reptiles, and the parasite fauna associated with these classes.  The investigators will focus their efforts on northern Mexico from the Transverse Volcanic Cordillera to the US border.  Mexico is of particular biogeographical interest because it includes the transition zone between the two great faunal regions of the Western Hemisphere, the Neartic and Neotropical.  It is estimated that more than 200 species of amphibians and reptiles unknown to science remain to be discovered in Mexico, and the parasites in general are extremely poorly known. \r\n\tThe urgency for this project is more acute than for other tropical countries, for several reasons.  First, human population density in Mexico has now reached the point where the last vestiges of forests are disappearing in many areas, and these forests are recognized for their extremely high biodiversity and levels of endemism.  Second, the diversity of amphibians and reptiles in Mexico is higher than any other country in the world, regardless of size or location.  Finally, dramatic population declines have been identified in both amphibians and reptiles; some species have already been lost and others will follow soon. The materials collected (specimens, tissue samples, digital images, recordings) during this survey will be valuable aids to persons working in many diverse disciplines of research, including systematics, ecology, and conservation.\r\n",
