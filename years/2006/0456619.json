 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is concerned with a broad range of research in gravitational physics. The specific research topics that will be investigated include the development of an axiomatic framework for quantum field theory in curved spacetime, the investigation of convergence issues in perturbative \r\nquantum field theory, the development of a gauge independent formulation of the effects of gravitational radiation reaction on point particles, the investigation of multiple lensing encounters and other issues in gravitational lensing, the investigation of fundamental issues related to \r\ninflation and dark energy, and the analysis of the viability of models with extra dimensions and theories that involve modifications to Einstein's equation. Although this research includes a wide range of topics in a number of different areas, there is a common theme to the main goals of the research: To obtain a deeper understanding of the mathematical and physical properties of classical general relativity and of quantum phenomena occurring in strong gravitational fields.\r\n\r\nProgress on the topics relating to quantum field theory in curved spacetime should have a significant impact on research in quantum gravity.  The development of a gauge independent formulation of gravitational radiation reaction should signficantly aid the calculation of effects that \r\nmay be observed by LIGO and LISA. Progress on gravitational lensing, issues related to inflation and dark energy, and models with extra dimensions should have a significant impact on research in cosmology. The general areas of research associated with this award are of considerable \r\ninterest to the public. This award will heavily involve the direct participation of graduate students in all aspects of the research.",
