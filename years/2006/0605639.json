Wendland\r\n\r\nIt has become a successful practice in mathematics to take\r\nadvantage of lessons learnt from physics. In this proposal, three\r\nsuch lessons are singled out, which should be of interest in\r\ntheir own right but also contribute to the proposer's long term\r\nresearch aims, a complete understanding of conformal field\r\ntheories (CFTs) on K3 surfaces and beyond. The first part of the\r\nproject is devoted to classically unknown properties of\r\nelliptically fibered Calabi-Yau 3-folds, arising from the\r\nconjectured heterotic-type IIA string-string duality. We will\r\ncombine an algebraic geometric and an index theoretic approach,\r\nwhich is novel.  A new index theorem and novel insights into the\r\nmathematics of the duality are aimed for. A recent conjecture of\r\nJohn McKay is also tested, relating Dynkin data to sporadic\r\ngroups. The second part of the project deals with so-called TERP\r\nstructures, which underlie the geometry of moduli spaces of\r\nsupersymmetric quantum field theories.  Here, D-branes and their\r\nstability conditions shall be studied using techniques from\r\ngeometric analysis and integrable systems rather than the\r\nstandard approaches. CFTs on K3 surfaces are studied in the third\r\npart of the project, where for a powerful new family of examples\r\nvarious techniques for the study of boundary CFTs and vertex\r\noperator algebras shall be tested. A generalization of previously\r\nobtained results about CFTs on K3 surfaces to certain\r\nBorcea-Voisin 3-folds is also planned. This research will\r\nunderpin and generalize the PI's previous results, confirming and\r\nextending an applicable dictionary between geometry and CFT.\r\n\r\nString theory is as yet the most promising candidate for a\r\nphysical model of the real world. It describes particles and\r\nforces of nature using one-dimensional extended objects, the\r\nstrings, whose behavior naturally depends on the ambient\r\ngeometry. Vice versa, one can view these strings as testing the\r\nambient geometry, whose properties can be read off from the\r\nbehavior of the strings. This bi-directionality is crucial, since\r\nstring theory on the other hand uses the language of quantum\r\nfield theory which in many ways is richer than classical\r\ngeometry. Hence string theory provides a natural bridge between\r\ntwo fundamental, seemingly unrelated concepts: quantum field\r\ntheory and geometry. The proposed research aims to make use of\r\nthis bridge. In particular, it is proposed to use classically\r\nunknown predictions coming from string theory to gain a deeper\r\nunderstanding of various geometric structures, including\r\nparticular Calabi-Yau 3-folds and so-called tt* geometry in\r\ngeneral.\r\n",
