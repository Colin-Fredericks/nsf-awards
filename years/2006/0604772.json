 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\tOne of the several subjects which this project will focus on is a\r\n(possibly) new type of invariant for finite group actions on toplogical \r\nspaces.  Let G denote a finite p-group, for some prime integer p, and let\r\nF denote a field of characteristic p.  Any cellular group action\r\nh:GxK ---> K  by G on a finite CW complex K gives rise to a chain complex\r\nC(*) over the group ring F(G).  An \"elemental chain subcomplex\" of C(*)\r\nis any chain subcomplex E(*) such that for some integer i the boundary\r\nmap  E(i) ---> E(i-1)  is an isomorphism between principle F(G)-modules, \r\nand  E(j)=0  if j is not equal to i,i-1.   A chain subcomplex D(*) of \r\nC(*) is called a \"minimal core\" for C(*) if C(*) is the direct sum\r\nof D(*) and some elemental chain subcomplexes of C(*), and if D(*) does \r\nnot have any elemental chain complex direct summands.  In recent work \r\nJones has shown that a minimal core always exists and that its \r\nisomorphism type depends only on the equivariant homotopy type of the \r\ngroup action h.   In future work Jones plans to focus on the \r\nclassification (up to isomorhism) of all minimal cores over the group ring\r\nF(G).\r\n\r\n\tIn toplogy (that field of mathematics to which this project is \r\nmost closely associated) one studies the structure of spaces in a very\r\nloose manner.  Examples of the spaces which topologists study occur \r\neverywhere ---- from theortical physics to objects occuring in everyday\r\nlife such as a ball or donut.  From the point of view of toplology\r\nall balls are the same (they have the same shape when considered as\r\nabstract toplological spaces); likewise any two donuts have the same\r\n\"shape\";  however a ball has a different \"shape\" than a donut (since\r\na donut has a hole but no ball has a hole in it).  The main object of \r\ntopology is the determination of when two differenet spaces have the \r\nsame \"shape\" (such spaces are said to be \"topologically equivalent\").\r\nFor well over one hundered years an important approach to this problem\r\nhas been to associate algebraic objects (such as numbers, groups, rings,\r\netc.) to each space in such a way that if two different spaces are \r\ntopologically equivalent then all their known associated algebraic objects \r\nmust be equal.  This approach has been very successful because the associated\r\nalgebraic objects are generally much easier to understand then are the \r\nspaces themselves.  Jones has recently discovered what seems to be a new\r\ntype of algebraic object associated to spaces.  Currently he is trying \r\ncalculate this new algebraic object and to understand how it is related \r\nto the many older well known algebraic objects associated to spaces.\r\n",
