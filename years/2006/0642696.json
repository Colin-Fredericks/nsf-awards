The conference is sponsored by the U.S. ASME and the Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.  The importance of nano-science and engineering has been well recognized by research communities and governmental organizations worldwide.  It is believed that breakthroughs in nano-science and technology will change all aspects of society, from energy utilization to homeland security. The uniqueness of this conference is that it places emphasis on the system level design, integration, and manufacturing, and commercialization of nano-technologies. It will deal with issues across the spatial scale, from fundamental phenomena at the atomic and molecular level to issues vital for system integration. It will bring very different technologies and expertise together to establish communication across disciplines. The broader impact of the conference is that it will bring together researchers in nano-science and engineering from diverse areas in materials, energy, transportation, environment, and health care. The conference will promote academic-industry collaboration and international collaboration, and promote technology transfer and commercialization. The NSF funding will in particular help to offset the expenses of young researchers, including junior faculty and graduate students, who are especially encouraged to attend the conference so as to provide them with opportunities of interaction and collaboration with their peers within and outside of the United States.\r\n",
