The carbon dioxide based metalworking fluids are proposed as replacements for aqueous-based metalworking fluids.  Based on preliminary work, the carbon dioxide metalworking fluids promise to have less environmental impact as well as improved coolant and lubrication characteristics.  This work will advance the fundamental understanding of supercritical fluids and their solvation properties in uses with bulk and boundary lubricants.  The development of a vegetable oil-in-ScCO2 metalworking fluid to replace the traditional mineral oil-in-water will result in a \"green\" material that is 100% petroleum- and water-free.  This knowledge will allow selection of the proper components and process operating conditions necessary to use the fluids in the automotive, medical, and aerospace industries.  The development of these environmentally benign metalworking fluids will enhance productivity while eliminating substantial health risks and aqueous wastes.  The metalworking industry represents a greater than $1 billion sector of the United States economy and creates over two billion gallons of aqueous metalworking fluid waste each year.\r\n\r\n",
