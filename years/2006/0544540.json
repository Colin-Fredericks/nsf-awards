As an outcome of this workshop we will develop a prioritization for\r\ndata acquisition, catalyze collaborations among users from different sub-disciplines, and begin\r\nthe development of a cohesive and comprehensive plan from the consortium of users to effectively\r\nand efficiently obtain, process, and disseminate high resolution LIDAR derived DEMS.\r\nThe development of high resolution DEMS along the rapidly evolving San Andreas plate boundary in Northern California are a critically needed data set for a wide range of the active tectonic studies driven by Earthscope research. Specific targets include fault development and amalgamation, and drainage basin and river response to active tectonics, faulting, and earthquakes.\r\nLIDAR derived DEMs are critical to analyses of active tectonics and thus are key to the Earthscope goals. In addition they provide information critical to a wide range of societally important issues including hazard assessment, land stability, flooding vulnerability, and land use planning. A goal of this workshop is the development of a consortium of researchers and users. Modeled on the PSLC that serves the broad community of researchers, engineering geologists, planners, and regional governments.",
