 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecologists have long recognized that coexistence of interacting species depends on a diversity of separate, but linked habitats. Most models of species coexistence treat these habitat \"patches\" as unchanging elements of the landscape, but in reality, they are constantly changing in size and shape. The structure and dynamics of the food webs that inhabit them both control and depend on these changes. This collaborative project between investigators at Harvard University and the University of Vermont seeks to understand how species interactions change the spatial distribution of dynamic habitat patches across the landscape, and to determine how food webs are structured within and among these patches. The experimental system for this five-year research project is the Sarracenia \"microecosystem\": the northern pitcher-plant Sarracenia purpurea; the unique food web of bacteria, protozoa, rotifers, mites, and fly larvae that live within its rainwater-filled leaves; three species of bog-inhabiting ants that are the primary prey for this carnivorous plant; and larvae of the pitcher-plant moth, Exyra fax, which cut and drain pitchers and remove food web habitat. Results from surveys of 50 New England bogs and three field experiments conducted at the Harvard Forest Long-Term Ecological Research site will parameterize a simulation model to predict changes in spatial structure of ant, moth, and plant populations, and the structure and composition of the aquatic food web associated with the plant. \r\n\r\nThere are three broad impacts to this research project. First, the research engages undergraduates, graduate students, K-12 teachers, research assistants, and a post-doc in collaborative research. Second, this research will yield a generally applicable framework for understanding how complex assemblages of organisms assemble, disassemble, and reassemble in spatially-structured changing environments. Third, the use of a model ecological system - the Sarracenia microecosystem - will be expanded to encompass landscape-level dynamics of food webs.\r\n",

In particular, we studied the carnivorous pitcher plant <em>Sarracenia purpurea</em>, which grows in bogs in the eastern and central U.S. and Canada; the ants that it eats; and the moths that feed on the leaves and rhizomes. The leaf of the pitcher plant has evolved to form a tube that fills with rainwater and captures insect prey. The plant secretes sugary nectar to attract insect prey; in New England, the primary prey captured by the pitcher plant are individuals of more than 25 species of ground-foraging ants that live in bogs and adjacent forests. Caterpillars of the two herbivorous moths are specialized feeders on pitcher plants. The leaf feeder, <em>Exyra fax</em>, bores a hole in the leaf that drains the liquid, and then the caterpillar feeds on the tissue of the leaf. The rhizome feeder, <em>Papaipema appassionata</em>, bores into the underground stems and kills the plant (which normally lives 30 to 50 years), but the dead tissue serves as a nesting microhabitat for ants. Both species of moths are uncommon or rare in New England. We measured the spatial pattern of the ants, caterpillars, and plants in 77 bogs throughout all six New England states. At Harvard Forest in Massachusetts, we also established experimental arrays of plants with different spatial patterns (clumped or dispersed) and measured the responses of the ants and the caterpillars to these different arrays. We discovered that although ant capture by pitcher plants and leaf feeding by caterpillars individually are negative interactions, these three species are positively associated in space: moths are more frequently found to attack large plants, and ants are more likely to feed at, be fed on by, or nest nearby large living plants, as well as to nest in the dead leaves of large plants. In this highly flooded habitat, the spatial clumping of suitable microhabitats over-rides the negative effects of species interactions.<br /> <br /> Broader impacts of the project include education, data products, software development, and interactions with conservation and environmental management professionals in New England. Throughout this project, an elementary school teacher, high school students, undergraduates, and a post-doctoral associate worked with us in the field and in developing new statistical methods to analyze the data. Research results were provided to state agencies and conservation organizations that monitor wildlife and plant populations in these threatened bog habitats throughout New England.
