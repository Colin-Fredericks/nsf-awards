RouteViews provides data on routing in the global Internet and tracks changes at Internet nodes. The project builds upon the existing RouteViews data collection system that was launched in 1998. That system archives routing data from the global Internet and was originally intended as a tool for network operators. Over the last few years, the RouteViews archive has quickly become a major data source for the network research community and numerous recent network routing research projects have benefited from it. These projects range from network topology measurement and routing stability analysis to network diagnosis, anomaly detection, and new routing protocol designs. RouteViews data is also starting to appear in classrooms and has potential for use in both graduate and undergraduate education. This project will address weaknesses in the initial implementation both in the system architecture and the quality of data collected. The investigators will replace the current router software package with an extensible data collector, rebuild the data archive with a new standard format, and provide real-time distribution of the global routing information.\r\n",
