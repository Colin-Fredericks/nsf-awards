 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) consists of 4 km baseline detectors in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington, and an additional 2 km detector in Hanford. LIGO's operating principle is to use precision laser interferometry to measure the relative motion of seismically-isolated test mass mirrors due to the extremely small forces from gravitational waves (GW's) emitted by distant astrophysical events. These waves have not yet been directly observed.  Louisiana State University (LSU) is located approximately 40 km from LIGO Livingston (LLO) and has a long-term collaborative relationship with LIGO as a member of the LIGO Scientific\r\nCollaboration (LSC).  The LIGO data are being analyzed by the LSU group, as part of the LSC, for GW signals from pairs of black holes or neutron stars whose orbits spiral in towards each other and coalesce, and for signals from other sources that produce short-duration bursts.  The group's work also includes the physical measurements and data analysis necessary to provide calibration and data quality information that is necessary for astrophysical source searches.  Research, development, and prototyping of a seismic isolation system for Advanced LIGO, an upgraded version of the LIGO Observatory which could detect several sources per week, is also being carried out at various LSC facilities, with critical LSU group involvement. Finally, a conceptual design of a tilt measurement system necessary for high duty cycle of the Advanced LIGO detectors is being studied.\r\nIn a broad context, these activities involve LSU faculty, postdocs, graduate students and undergraduates at LIGO, bringing LSU people the benefits of working with experienced LIGO and LSC scientists, and with apparatus that allows an excellent possibility of significant scientific discovery.  The LSU group has been involved in several projects to present the science of\r\ngravitational waves to the general public, and the group will keep up the effort to take advantages of, and create, opportunities for outreach.  LSU shares its libraries, networking facilities, and workshops with LIGO.  LIGO personnel participate the LSU Physics and Astronomy department's colloquia and astrophysics discussion groups, and often work directly with our students.  This close and extensive relationship between LIGO and our nearby research university is expected to be strengthened with continued collaboration.",
