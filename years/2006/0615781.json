 "awd_abstract_narration": "Probably the most important mechanism of glacial erosion is quarrying:\r\nthe growth and coalescence of cracks in subglacial bedrock and\r\ndislodgement of resultant rock fragments. Although evidence indicates\r\nthat erosion rates depend on sliding speed, rates of crack growth in\r\nbedrock may be enhanced by changing stresses on the bed caused by\r\nfluctuating basal water pressure in zones of ice-bed separation. To\r\nstudy quarrying in real time, a granite step, 12 cm high with a crack in\r\nits stoss surface, was installed at the bed of Engabreen, an outlet\r\nglacier of the Svartisen Ice Cap, Norway. Acoustic-emission sensors\r\nmonitored crack-growth events in the step as ice slid over it. Vertical\r\nstresses, water pressure, and cavity height in the lee of the step were\r\nalso measured. Water pressure was manipulated by pumping water to the\r\nlee of the step. With repeated pump tests, the crack on the stoss face\r\ngrew until the step's lee surface was quarried indicating that\r\nfluctuating water pressure caused stress thresholds required for crack\r\ngrowth to be exceeded. To fully comprehend quarrying mechanisms, another\r\nfield effort will measure quarrying rates as a function of sliding speed\r\nduring the spring melt season when sliding speed is expected to increase\r\nby a factor of 2 to 3. Acoustic emissions will be correlated to sliding\r\nspeed and also to natural water-pressure fluctuations. Results will\r\nallow an assessment of the relative effects of sliding speed and\r\nwater-pressure variability on quarrying. By providing the first\r\nmeasurements of crack growth in subglacial rock, this project will\r\nprovide the necessary data to correlate glaciological variables to\r\nquarrying rates, removing the ambiguity that exists presently in\r\nlandscape evolution models which are grounded on uncertain erosion\r\nrules. The field data will be combined with a theoretical model of\r\nglacial quarrying. The culmination of this work will be a quarrying rule\r\nthat can serve as a basis for large-scale erosion models.\r\n",
