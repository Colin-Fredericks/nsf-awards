 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vertical Distribution of Phytoplankton \r\nElena Litchman\r\nGeorgia Tech Research Corporation - GA Institute of Technology\r\n\r\nMicroscopic algae (phytoplankton) form the base of the most aquatic food webs and affect water quality in both freshwater and marine environments.  Phytoplankton often are distributed non-uniformly in the water: they can form surface scums and subsurface maxima.  These non-uniform distributions may significantly impact zooplankton and fish and cycling of material and energy, thus potentially affecting water quality and ecosystem functioning.  This project will examine the mechanisms for the formation and maintenance of non-uniform phytoplankton distributions using mathematical models and laboratory experiments.  Plankton tower experiments will allow them to test the predictions of the new theory in highly controlled yet spatially resolved environment.  The research at the interface of experimental and theoretical ecology will involve undergraduates from Georgia Tech as well as from the historically black colleges in Atlanta area.  Funding provided will also help launch an independent career of a woman scientist.  Freshwater ecosystems are essential to human well-being and are heavily impacted by human activities.  The results obtained in this project will provide fundamental insights into their dynamics, which will allow better management of lakes. \r\n",
