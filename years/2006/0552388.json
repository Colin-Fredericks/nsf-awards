 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main activity of the project is the analysis of new limit laws and \r\ntheir associated integrable differential equations that appear in a \r\nvariety of stochastic processes. These stochastic processes include the \r\nAiry process, the Pearcey process and its higher order generalizations, \r\na nonintersecting  Brownian excursion path model, and a class of \r\ninteracting particle systems called the asymmetric exclusion process. \r\nThe main methods to be employed are a combination of ideas and \r\ntechniques coming from random matrix theory, integrable systems and \r\noperator theory. An operator theory application to integrable systems \r\nwould establish new limit theorems for a class of operator determinants \r\nproviding solutions to the cylindrical Toda equations in so-called \r\ncritical cases. The methods are related to those used in the study of \r\ntruncated Wiener-Hopf and Toeplitz operators.\r\n\r\nMany physical systems possess such complicated behavior that exact \r\npredictions become impossible. Random matrix theory provides \r\nmathematical models that allow a simulation of such behavior and \r\npredictions that allow comparison with experiment. This was its original \r\nmotivation, but it has since had significant applications in other areas \r\nof mathematics, science and technology, in such diverse subjects as \r\ncommunications, probability, statistics, number theory, condensed matter \r\nphysics, and engineering. One can anticipate that ideas from random \r\nmatrix theory and techniques developed in part by the PI and his \r\ncollaborators will be instrumental in the study of the stochastic \r\nprocesses describe above. Further, the project should provide, through \r\nthe integrable differential equations, implementable numerical \r\nalgorithms to compute properties of these processes. This last aspect is \r\nmost important for applications.",
