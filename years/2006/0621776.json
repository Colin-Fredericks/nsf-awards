 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract- Carrier Spin Dynamics and Device Applications in Carbon Nanotubes \r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to explore spin dependent properties of the carriers in carbon nanotubes and their potential device applications. The approach is based on the theory and numerical (ab initio) modeling of carrier spin relaxation and transport dynamics in carbon nanotubes.  Specific concepts/structures leading to a novel class of spintronic nano-devices will also be pursued beyond the current scaling limit.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: This research effort will provide (1) theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of carrier spin dynamics in carbon nanotubes; (2) design of novel device architectures that exploit the unique spin transport properties; (3) a coherent hierarchy of spin device simulation methods that can be scaled to large-scale processes. Overall, the key outcome will be a fundamental description of the feasibility of advanced spintronic devices based on carrier spin dynamics in carbon nanotubes.   \r\nBroader impact: Through an interdisciplinary training effort, a new generation of scientists and engineers will be produced with expertise that is not limited to a single discipline, but rather who are trained to attack complicated problems with a broad outlook using methods that transcend traditional barriers between science and engineering disciplines. It will be built on the strong outreach and public education record of the principal investigators that includes live and web-based tutorials on nanotechnology, working with high school students and their teachers in summer programs, and participation in national committees on public implications of nanotechnology.   If successful, pursued nano-devices could also offer significant technological and economical benefits.\r\n",
