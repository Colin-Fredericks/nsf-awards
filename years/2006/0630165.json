 "awd_abstract_narration": "Workshop Support: GeoFrame Walker Lane\r\nPrincipal Investigator:\r\nDaniel Stockli, University of Kansas, Lawrence\r\nGeoFrame is an integrative geologic initiative that takes a multi-dimensional view of the\r\nbuilding and modification of the North American continent through time and space. The\r\ninitiative's goals can be achieved by systematic integration of geologic and geochronometric\r\ninvestigations and the results from unprecedented geophysical imaging as part of the EarthScope\r\nProgram. The overarching EarthScope geophysical experiment has the potential to be a\r\ntransformative program for the Earth Sciences, building a foundation for a more complete\r\ngeodynamic understanding of the evolution of the North American continent. GeoFrame has\r\noutlined seven focus regions across the conterminous U.S., specifically to address fundamental\r\naspects of the growth and modification (e.g., rifting) of the North American continent through\r\ntime. The GeoFrame effort envisions these focus site investigations to entail map-scale arrays of\r\npassive source seismic receivers and associated active source seismic studies and complementary\r\ngeophysics in conjunction with geologic-based synthesis and targeted studies. Study of these\r\nregions should proceed in an intensified fashion, in concert with planned USArray steps.\r\nOne of these focus sites is the Walker Lane region in eastern California and western\r\nNevada. We propose to organize a two-day workshop that will bring together a wide spectrum of\r\ngeologists and geophysicists who are working in the Walker Lane. This GeoFrame focus site\r\nworkshop is particularly timely given the deployment schedule of the USArray \"BigFoot\" array.\r\nThis workshop is intended to facilitate the organization of an integrated geophysical and\r\ngeological approach to understanding the geodynamic evolution of the Walker Lane.\r\n\r\nImplicit in the design and implementation of EarthScope is the recognition that progress on\r\nissues such as these requires the collaborative efforts of researchers working in complementary\r\ndisciplines. This workshop is designed to build a broad-based community of researchers focused\r\non integrative geophysical and geological investigation of the Walker Lane. As such, it will open\r\nnew avenues of collaboration between working groups and identify new research needs and\r\nopportunities. We anticipate the integration of results and efforts with the NSF Margins\r\nRupturing of Continental Lithosphere (RCL) initiative in the Gulf of California by continuing the\r\nwork onshore from the Gulf of California to the north into Nevada.",
