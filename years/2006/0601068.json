 "awd_abstract_narration": "Iris is a Northern Hemisphere genus of perennial herbs with more than 260 species.  In spite of its economical importance as a plant of high horticultural value, little is known of its origin, evolution and dispersal.  Dr. Wilson will research 90 species that represent the morphological and geographical diversity present in Iris.  She will use molecular sequence data to develop a classification that explains the evolutionary diversification leading to major subgroups within Iris.  The probable area of origin will be determined and significant morphological innovations will be identified.  The study will provide a framework of evolution within Iris that should stimulate further research.\r\n\r\nDuring this research, graduate and undergraduate students will use the scientific method to test hypotheses of evolution and will learn basic laboratory techniques.  Students will also benefit indirectly as examples from this research are incorporated into Dr. Wilson's courses.  The inclusion of a recent Ph.D. from Turkey will promote international collaboration and diffusion of knowledge.  The public will benefit through presentations to community organizations and development of a webpage on the classification and evolution of these valued wildflower and garden plants.  This research is relevant to studies on plant responses and modifications to aridity.  Most Iris species inhabit dry, semi-desert or rocky, high-altitude environments today and probably diversified across the Mediterranean and Asia during times of increasing seasonality, aridity and temperature extremes.  The presence of a multiplicity of modified organs (roots, stems and leaves) for storage and renewal growth in Iris indicates that adaptation to aridity involved several independent strategies.\r\n",
