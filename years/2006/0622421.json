 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a nationwide shortage of graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields in the U.S.  This project is helping to address this shortage by increasing the number of students graduating in the Biological Sciences area.  The following retention activities are being implemented: 1) one credit freshman seminar classes that teach students how to study science effectively; 2) one credit Applications courses for each of the four Biology courses that majors take in the first two years of the program that allow students to learn to apply difficult concepts in a small group; 3) monetary incentives to stay in the Biology program; 4) engagement of students in intensive research with faculty mentors; 5) expansion of group activities to increase the sense of community; 6) inclusion of scientists from underrepresented groups to serve as role models; and 7) increased interactions with minority student campus services.  The new recruiting strategies that are being implemented include: 1) increased communication with high schools and community colleges; 2) increased personal contacts between faculty and potential students; and 3) increased activities for high school students from surrounding areas.  The effectiveness of these recruitment and retention activities is being assessed and communicated to STEM disciplines at various institutions.\r\n",
