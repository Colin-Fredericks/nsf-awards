The objective of this research is to introduce a new innovative digital bio/nanoelectronics interface for single cell assays.   The approach is to use advanced micro/nanofabrication technologies to build transducers that can convert biological or chemical response to an electrical signal.  Successful delivery of the proposed work will lead to a dramatic improvement of the state-of-the-art electrophysiological assays; it will also facilitate the development of drug screening in the pharmaceutical industry and accelerate electrical stimulation therapies in clinical applications. \r\n \r\nBroadly speaking, by developing a fundamental understanding of a unique nanobiosystem, addressing the significant engineering challenges within, and performing scientific studies to demonstrate its utility, the proposed work will contribute to sensitivity and throughput enhancement in the single cell electrophysiological analysis .  In addition, multiple high-reward education themes will be focused, where special opportunities exist for undergraduate and graduate students, especially an African American female student, to perform fundamental studies in nanoscale devices and systems architecture.   The proposed work will also reach out to Cambridge public schools (K-8) via a program called the Science Club for Girls.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
