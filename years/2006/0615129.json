 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developers often extend large, C-based software systems, including\noperating systems, databases, and web servers, in an ad-hoc manner to\nmeet their performance and functionality requirements.  Many of the\nextensions represent crosscutting concerns in that they do not fit\nwithin a single program module and are scattered throughout the\nsource.  Maintaining and applying such extensions with commonly used\ntools, notably diff and patch, is time consuming and error prone.\nFurthermore, it is challenging to ensure correctness when composing\nmultiple extensions.  This work makes crosscutting concerns part of\nthe architecture of C-based systems by leveraging aspect-oriented\nsoftware development techniques.  Specifically, extensions are\ncaptured as aspects, which provide a language-supported methodology\nfor expressing crosscutting concerns.  The work also builds a new set\nof tools that extract, inject, and translate system extensions\nrepresented as aspects.  Moreover, the work develops static program\nanalysis technology that aids in the semantic separation of extension\nfrom mainline code and safe composition of extensions.  To validate\nthe tools' effectiveness, the PIs conduct case studies on the Linux\nkernel and open source extensions such as the Nooks system that\nprovides device driver isolation and recovery. For the educational\ncommunity, the work offers an attractive approach to hands-on learning\nabout real-world systems.  For the system software community, the work\noffers the ability to more rapidly and seamlessly move from idea to\ndesign to implementation for new system-level extensions.  Finally,\nfor the broader community of commercial developers and their\ncustomers, the work offers a path to more flexible reuse of system\nsoftware.\n",
