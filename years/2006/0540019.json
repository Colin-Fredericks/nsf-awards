 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach (MFO), situated in a beautiful valley in Germany's Black Forest, is one of the leading mathematical research centres worldwide. Each week, 50 weeks per year, the institute organizes a workshop or seminar devoted to a particular mathematical subject with 40 - 50 participants, coming from different countries and being leading experts in their field of research. The aim of these workshops is to present the most recent developments and to discuss further research projects. \r\n\r\nParticipants of the Oberwolfach workshops come from all over the world, about one third from Germany, one third from the rest of Europe and the majority of the last third from the US (slightly more than 20% of all participants). The selection of 40 - 50 leading experts from a certain field of research imposes very high standards, and consequently senior people dominate. This is scientifically justified as long as we do not miss the outstanding young scientists, something we try to achieve. However, young people usually need financial support since the MFO cannot contribute to travel expenses. \r\n\r\nIn this situation the support by the NSF allows the invitation of additional young researchers who are called \"US Junior Oberwolfach Fellow\". Participation in these workshops and seminars will give young scientists from the US the possibility to benefit in an early stage of their career from the chances to meet top senior scientists from all over the world. They can present their own results, and listen to what the others have to say and take part in the numerous and scientifically very profitable public and private discussions. For many young mathematicians the first stay in Oberwolfach has been an important step in the process of being acknowledged in the scientific community. In addition the participation of young people keeps a field of research alive and allows a discipline to grow successfully. \r\n",
