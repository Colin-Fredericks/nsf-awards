 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate the\r\nfeasibility of fabricating high quality MgO-based magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices\r\nwith magnetoresistance (MR) values of over 500%, via an innovative process which\r\nutilizes optimized plasma-based magnetron sputtering and RF plasma oxidation. We will\r\nuse a number of novel methods to fabricate highly symmetrical, near epitaxial MgO\r\nbarriers with (001)-orientation using plasma sputtering and oxidation methods. Using\r\nthese methods, we will be able to realize a smoother barrier and the resulting process will\r\nbe suitable for adaptation to large-scale production with high yield and uniformity. Our\r\nmethod combines three innovations. First, we will design a new deposition procedure to\r\nmake symmetrical interfaces on both sides of the MgO barrier to enhance the coherent\r\ntunneling effect required for high MR. Secondly, we will improve the (001) texture of the\r\nMgO barrier by choosing ferromagnetic layers with a composition tuned for both high\r\nspin polarization and small lattice mismatch. Finally, we will implement a new plasma\r\noxidation method to minimize both plasma damage to the barrier and MTJ interface\r\nroughness. If successful, the resulting MgO-based MTJ devices will surpass the\r\nperformance of all other existing magnetoresistive devices.\r\n\r\nCommercially, this technology will have a huge commercial impact on the non-volatile memory specifically, for MRAM (magnetic random access memory) and disk drive for tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) read/write heads industries. The success of the project will not only bolster the market position of MRAM and MTJ read heads, but will also enable innovative new products in other market segments, such as semiconductor failure\r\nanalysis and a wide range of emerging bio-magnetic applications. \r\n",
