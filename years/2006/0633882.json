This is the first of a series of Summer Schools, with the second to be held in summer 2007 at CERN.  The purpose of the school is to focus on training as aid to:  introducing the physics and scientific potential of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), exploiting Fermilab Tevatron data and learning from it for the forthcoming LHC program, and providing a sense of community and eventual leadership for the field.   Operationally, the School will provide an intense schedule of lectures and discussions with internationally recognized experts in hadron collider physics.",
