 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\n   This Focused Research Group brings together researchers from the \r\nUniversity of Michigan's Departments of Mathematics, Physics and \r\nChemical Engineering to address important problems of modeling, \r\nsimulation and analysis for dynamical processes where underlying \r\ndiscreteness plays a non-negligible role in large scale descriptions \r\nvia deterministic continuum systems (generally systems of ordinary and \r\npartial differential equations).  This Focused Research Group combines \r\nthe investigators' expertise in theory, modeling, analysis and \r\nscientific computation to study a suite of problems from materials \r\nphysics, chemical kinetics and the life sciences to elucidate the \r\nfundamental scientific issues and develop appropriate quantitative \r\ntools to analyze them.  The specific problems to be studied are: (1) \r\nMesoscopic mathematical models of wound healing with cell proliferation \r\nand migration, and including the biologically important effect of \r\ncell-cell adhesion; (2) The application of new and improved simulation \r\ntechniques, direct solutions of the Becker-Doering equations, and \r\nsimulation and analysis of stochastic models to investigate the role of \r\nmicroscopic correlations in Ostwald ripening; (3) The development of\r\nanalytic asymptotic methods for accurate reduced descriptions of slow \r\nstochastic variables properly incorporating residual fluctuation \r\neffects with applications to (bio)chemical reaction networks possessing \r\na wide spectrum of reaction rates; (4) An extension of modeling, \r\nanalysis and simulation methods developed for simple systems to \r\nincreasingly complex stochastic models in population biology and \r\nepidemiology including epidemics in structured populations and \r\nextinction of competing species; (5) Spatial inhomogeneities and \r\nreaction-rate variations in the stochastic Fisher-Kolmogorov equation, \r\na fundamental paradigm of front propagation and pattern formation.\r\n\r\n   Results from this project will lead to the development of effective \r\nmathematical descriptions and efficient computational schemes for \r\nproblems of increasing importance for small-scale physical and chemical \r\nprocesses in materials science and nano-technology, and for \r\nquantitative modeling in the life sciences.  With regard to the even \r\nbroader impact of this project, it contributes to the development of \r\nthe scientific workforce by providing advanced training for \r\npostdoctoral researchers and doctoral students in the natural, \r\nengineering and applied mathematical sciences.\r\n",
