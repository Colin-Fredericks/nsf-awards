 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU program in Tropical Ecology and Evolution, conducted by the University of Puerto Rico, is based at El Verde Field Station, in the tropical rainforest of Puerto Rico. The program goal is to provide undergraduates with meaningful research experiences under the guidance of established scientists, in research focused on tropical ecology and evolution. Undergraduate students will spend most of their 10-week internship developing a research project under the mentorship of a faculty, in various areas of ecology and evolution such as plant population biology, community dynamics, forest ecology, arthropod biology, soil ecology, plant reproductive ecology, and population genetics. Students have a wide variety of potential areas of study to choose from, depending on their areas of interest. Students also participate in seminars and workshops on scientific data analysis, data presentation, and techniques to study different groups of tropical organisms and ecosystems (e.g., forest, soil, streams). An ethics component focuses on common issues likely to be encountered by students during their careers as well as discussions on the role of scientists in modern society. This combination of activities provides students with the tools needed to conduct scientific research in any area of science, with emphasis on Tropical Ecology and Evolution.  Each year, eight students are selected based on their academic qualifications (e.g., GPA, letters of recommendation) and interest in pursuing graduate studies. Emphasis is given to students from institutions where research programs are not easily accessible and those from groups under-represented in science. Additional information is available at http://sunites.upr.clu.edu/REU/index.htm, or by contacting the Program Director, Alonso Ramirez (aramirez@sunites.upr.clu.edu; Telephone: 787-764-0000, ext. 7781).",

We did this by immersing them in an active research environment, providing guidance from established scientists while they develop an independent research project, providing educational activities designed to equip students with the necessary tools to conduct scientific research, and, in many cases, providing them the opportunity to study and conduct research in an ecosystem and culture not easily accessible at their home institution. \n\nStudents work on a research project under the advice of a faculty mentor on several areas.  Examples of research topics include:\n- Reproductive success and evolutionary characteristics of tropical plants: Including research on plant-pollinator interactions, reproductive biology of orchids, and environmental factors affecting plant reproductive success.\n- Stream ecology and aquatic biodiversity: the role of stream invertebrates in sediment dynamics, shrimps and organic matter processing, biodiversity and ecosystem function: the role of insects in processing leaf litter in tropical streams, and biofilm enzyme activity as an indicator of land use impacts on streams.\n- Terrestrial arthropod diversity and ecosystem processes: millipede density, biomass, and richness in Tabonuco Forest, abundance and behavior of litter snails, and interactions between fungus-growing ants and their parasitoid wasps\n\nDuring the summer program, students also participated of seminars and workshops on data analysis and presentation, and scientific techniques.  Seminars were provided on a weekly basis by visiting faculty researchers at the field station.  Presenters provided information on their research projects as well as opportunities for undergraduates in that particular field of study.  Workshops included data analysis and presentation, scientific writing, and application to graduate school, among others.  An ethical component was focused on issues likely to be encountered by students in their careers and discussions on the role of scientists in society.  Overall, we expected to positively impact student careers by providing them with the tools needed to conduct scientific research in any area of science, with emphasis on Tropical Ecology and Evolution, and by stressing the impact that scientists could have in our society if they take active roles. \n\nOverall the program trained 40 students from a diversity of backgrounds, including minorities and student at institutions with limited access to research opportunities.
