 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nThis proposal is for the acquisition of a laser scanning Multi-photon Confocal Microscopy Facility\r\n(MCMF) that will support a core group of faculties at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) spanning eight\r\ndepartments and two colleges. The MCMF facility will include a point-by-point standard and resonant\r\nscanning module capable of acquiring images with high spatial and temporal resolutions, a multi-photon\r\nsystem consists of Coherent Chameleon XR Ti-Sapphire pulsed laser, and a fluorescence lifetime imaging\r\nmicroscopy (FLIM) module. Acquisition of a laser scanning multi-photon confocal microscope will fill a\r\nvoid in the existing imaging facilities at CMU by providing experimental capabilities that include\r\nfluorescence recovery after photobleaching, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and will have an\r\nimmediate impact in numerous established and nascent research projects of senior and junior faculties\r\ninvestigating the structure and dynamics of soft materials. For example, MCMF will allow (a) direct\r\nvisualization of phase transitions, self-assembly, defect dynamics, and morphology evolution in synthetic\r\nsoft materials, (b) real-time imaging of cellular and sub-cellular localization of native and synthetic\r\nmacromolecules related to fundamental biological discovery and disease therapy in biological soft\r\nmaterials, and (c) development of adaptive algorithms for efficient acquisition and analysis of complex\r\nbiological images. The MCMF will also offer a unique opportunity for integration into classroom\r\ninstruction and outreach activities by offering the possibility for students to gain direct, \"hands-on\"\r\nexperience with microscale and smaller systems including cells, macromolecules and microdevices. Our\r\ngoal is to use the proposed MCMF to bring together scattered and diverse researchers at CMU and local\r\nindustry who will exchange ideas and expertise while working in close proximity and as a potent catalyst\r\nfor nucleating new multi-disciplinary research and education.\r\n\r\nNon-technical Abstract\r\n\r\nLaser scanning multi-photon confocal microscopes allows for the imaging of microscopic objects and their\r\ndynamics deep within a three dimensional sample with very little photo-damage. As a result, confocal\r\nmicroscopes have become indispensable tools to perform state-of-the-art measurements in soft materials.\r\nVisualizing the structure and dynamics of soft materials at the microscopic scale allows for better\r\nunderstanding of their self-assembly and macroscopic properties. The proposed laser scanning Multiphoton\r\nConfocal Microscopy Facility (MCMF) will enable an exciting array of diverse research across the\r\nCarnegie Mellon University (CMU) campus. For example, MCMF will enable the development of better\r\ncomposite materials, increase the understanding of cellular mechanisms related to aging and embryonic\r\ndevelopment, improve drug delivery studies, etc. We also plan to develop a course on Advanced\r\nMicroscopy for graduate and undergraduate students that would utilize the proposed facility. The highly\r\nvisual nature of the research and education enabled by the facility will attract and inspire undergraduates\r\nand high-school students to high-level science by making complex ideas more tangible. Using the MCMF\r\nwe will develop age-appropriate modules intended to communicate concepts of visualization of microscale\r\nsystems via established outreach programs at CMU that target K-12 students and teachers particularly in\r\nschools with large under-represented groups. The MCMF will also increase ties with industry, other\r\nuniversities and the public.",
