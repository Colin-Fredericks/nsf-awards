This project aims to build a program transformation system called DIRA that can automatically embed into network applications a comprehensive cyber defense against control-hijacking attacks, which allow remote attackers to hijack a remote program and eventually its underlying system. Control-hijacking attacks have been used as building blocks for many recent Internet worms, and include such attacks as buffer overflow, integer overflow and format string attacks. Given a network application's source or binary code, DIRA can convert it in such a way that the resulting program can automatically detect any incoming control-hijacking attack, repair the memory damage left by the attack, derive the corresponding attack signature and inform the front-end firewall accordingly, and create a permanent patch that seals the security hole being exploited, all without requiring any modifications to the operating system or hardware. To extend these security-enhancing program transformation techniques to commercially distributed Win32/X86 binaries, the DIRA project will develop a novel binary analysis and instrumentation infrastructure using a combination of static and dynamic disassembling.\r\n",
