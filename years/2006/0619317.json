 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's propose to establish a noble gas geochemistry laboratory at Oregon State University. They will purchase a new, state-of-the-art noble gas mass spectrometer and associated hardware for sample processing. This new laboratory will be unique to the Pacific Northwest and will foster the integration of research and education in a research-intensive environment. The new instrumentation will enhance the research programs of a large number of investigators, allow development of collaborations with outside users, enhance education programs in oceanography, geosciences, and other fields, and contribute to the continuing development of analytical geochemistry as a core area of excellence at OSU. \r\n\r\nThe noble gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon and radon) are unique for their utility in addressing fundamental questions about the history and dynamics of Earth systems. The range of scientific applications of noble gas measurements is very broad, touching many fields of interest to investigators at OSU, including origin and evolution of the Earth, oceans and atmosphere, dynamics of Earth's interior and crust, geochronology, hydrothermal circulation and degassing, formation of ore deposits, earthquake and volcanic hazard assessment, ocean circulation, the flux of cosmic dust, air-sea gas exchange, surface exposure dating of rocks and sediments, erosion rates, thermochronology and tectonic uplift of mountain belts, groundwater dating, and radionuclide transport, fallout and nuclear waste disposal.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe purchase of a noble gas mass spectrometer will stimulate a variety of interesting scientific endeavors for both OSU groups and others in and beyond the Pacific Northwest. It should also allow the development of collaboration with other institutions both national and international. The facility will provide an excellent hands-on training and teaching environment.\r\n",
