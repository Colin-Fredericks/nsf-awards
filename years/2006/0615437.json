 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peak power dissipation and the resulting temperature rise have become the dominant limiting factors to processor performance and a significant component of its design cost. Expensive packaging and heat removal solutions are needed to achieve acceptable substrate and interconnect temperatures in high-performance microprocessors. Current thermal solutions are designed to limit the peak processor power dissipation to ensure its reliable operation under worst-case scenarios. However, the peak power and ensuing peak temperature are hardly ever observed. Dynamic thermal management (DTM) has been proposed as a class of micro-architectural solutions and software strategies to achieve the highest processor performance under a peak temperature limit. When the chip approaches its thermal limit, a DTM controller initiates hardware reconfiguration, slow-down, or shutdown to lower the chip temperature. Possible response mechanisms include micro-architectural adaptations e.g., fetch toggling, register file resizing, and issue width reduction, and/or on-the-fly performance adjustment e.g., dynamic voltage and frequency scaling and functional unit shut-down. The proposed research aims to develop a new DTM solution that takes a global, predictive approach based on constructing and utilizing a continuous-time Markovian decision process model of the microprocessor chip and the application programs. The offline algorithms developed in this framework are provably optimal whereas the online versions of these algorithms are easily deployable and highly flexible. The project thus produces temperature-aware policies and techniques for ensuring that the microprocessor chips operate within the allowed temperature zone, having maximum possible performance yet not being over-designed.\r\n\r\n",
