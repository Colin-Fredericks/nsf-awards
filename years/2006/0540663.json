 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the continued development of several atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometers (APIMS) for airborne measurements of a suite of sulfur compounds, including dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and several of its oxidation products. The intent is to deploy these instruments in the near future in a field study of sulfur chemistry and aerosols. The oceans are the main source of DMS, which is oxidized in the atmosphere through pathways that are still poorly understood. Among the products of DMS oxidation are sulfuric acid and other low vapor pressure sulfur compounds, which can lead to the formation of new particles, or growth and transformation of existing atmospheric aerosols, including cloud condensation nuclei. The importance of these processes is in their role in aerosol and cloud formation, which in turn have significant direct and indirect impacts on climate.\r\n\r\nThis project will support important infrastructure in the field of atmospheric chemistry, and will also provide a training opportunity for an undergraduate student.",
