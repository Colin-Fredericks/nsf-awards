 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop and integrate the building blocks of a nanowire sensor system using a well-coordinated and interdisciplinary effort in design, fabrication and functionalization to form a nanowire sensor array for the label free electrical detection of target biomolecules. The approach is to use top town silicon nano-fabrication to form the nanowires and use a novel thermally mediate exchange reaction as attachment scheme for site specific functionalization of capture bimolecular at different sensor sites. The proposal focuses on the detection of microRNAs (miRNA), which are usually 21-23 nt in length and occur in abundance in cells. These molecules have recently been found to be critical cellular components whose levels of expression correlate with disease states.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The detection of miRNA sequences in itself has significant scientific and commercial implications. In addition, the proposed work will develop the framework by which individual sensor components, perhaps developed in different laboratories, may be efficiently integrated into sensor arrays. Also, the design platform, fabrication techniques, functionalization schemes, and integration approaches developed in the project have many generic features that can easily be adapted not only to other nano-bio systems, but also to nano-electronics, DNA-computing, nano-mechanics and nano-composites. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Finally, this integrated design approach will involve non-traditional interdisciplinary interactions, with important implications for graduate and undergraduate education, research, and the practice of engineering. We will develop a senior/graduate level course entitled:  Introduction to Bio-Nanotechnology.  It will be taught to students from many departments.  Our program in collaboration with NCN has graduate and undergraduate components as well as outreach to the research community and the public.\r\n\r\n",
