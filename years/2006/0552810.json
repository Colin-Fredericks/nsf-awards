 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Chemistry  Division supports Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) and Research Experience for Teachers (RET) sites at the University of Rochester for the summers of 2006-2008. The program director is Thomas Krugh. Eight students and six high school teachers each year will conduct full-time hands-on scientific research as a member of an established research team. Each participant will have a specific research problem, a specific faculty adviser, and a specific graduate student or postdoctoral mentor to provide day to-day advice. A weekly REU/RET Group Meeting provides a forum for the participants to report their research to each other early in the summer, and thus to learn from each other and about other areas of chemistry, to discuss graduate education and scientific careers. Recruiting will build on established relationships with more than thirty undergraduate colleges and give special emphasis to the participation of underrepresented minorities, woman, and lower division students. The Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate Office of Multidisciplinary Affairs provides support for the RET component of this site.",
