 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nNano-Methods for Understanding how \r\nMatrix Elasticity Controls Stem Cells\r\nNormal tissue cells are not viable when suspended in a fluid.  They must adhere to something solid, but a solid can be thick or thin, as rigid as glass or softer than a baby's skin.  It is hypothesized that tissue cells sense matrix elasticity down to the nanoscale, and that this will direct how stem cells differentiate and develop into tissue.  A hierarchy of mathematical models will also complement the use of modern cell biological and biophysical approaches.\r\nWhile the research seems likely to influence developmental biologists and tissue engineers, broader impact is only achievable through education and outreach. An educational thrust in Nano-Scale Systems Biology will be developed, with student exposure to key nano-tools (e.g. AFM) as well as various mechano-chemical properties that carry over from soft materials. Efforts will extend to the education of science students from Philadelphia Central High School as well as Penn Undergrads.  \r\n\r\n",
