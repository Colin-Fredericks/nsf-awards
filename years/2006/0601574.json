 "awd_abstract_narration": "Terahertz Plasmonic Subwavelength Photonics\r\nWeili Zhang\r\nOklahoma State University\r\n0601574\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project focuses on fundamental investigation and development of two-dimensional plasmonic photonics with subwavelength microstructures functioning at terahertz frequencies. The combination of surface plasmons and terahertz spectroscopy will be a fruitful field in fundamental understanding of both the properties of terahertz surface plasmons and their optoelectronic applications. This program encompasses multiple research objectives: (1) The PI continues his focus on resonant terahertz transmission of subwavelength plasmonic structures and the surface effects of terahertz surface plasmons. A proof-of-concept study will be undertaken to test the capability of using terahertz surface plasmons in biosensing applications. (2) Tunable terahertz surface plasmons will be investigated. These would be unique in that semiconductors will be optically gated to exhibit instantaneous metallic properties, which in turn support the resonant excitation of surface plasmons. (3) Localized terahertz surface plasmons will be investigated in a number of subwavelength plasmonic structures. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Advances in terahertz plasmonics will enable development of novel terahertz optoelectronic and photonic devices that will impact a broad range of disciplines. The PI will seek collaborations with companies in developing terahertz-based plasmonic sensors and optoelectronic devices, and pursuing commercialization opportunities. The educational component consists of new course development and training for graduate, undergraduate and high school students. A new graduate level course on plasmonic photonics will be developed for students involved in the photonics program at the Oklahoma State University. A cleanroom open house will be offered regularly to high school students and their parents, particularly the Oklahoma Native American students and parents in order to attract excellent undergraduate students. \r\n\r\n",
