 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe PI proposes to work on a series of projects that incorporate \r\ntechniques from algebra, geometry, and topology, with a view to \r\napplications in all three of these fields.  More precisely, the PI \r\nproposes to work on the following four circles of ideas:\r\n(1) Answering various classical questions in topology (such as the Novikov \r\nconjecture, the Borel conjecture, computation of the algebraic K-theory) \r\nunder suitable geometric hypotheses on the spaces.\r\n(2) Working on problems related to the quasi-isometric classification of \r\nfinitely generated groups.\r\n(3) Exploring the boundary between the space of CAT(-1) metrics and the \r\nspace of negatively curved Riemannian metrics on a fixed manifold.\r\n(4) Studying the topology (cohomology, bounded cohomology, submanifolds) \r\nof locally symmetric spaces.\r\nThese projects are intended to exhibit the interdependence of methods and \r\nresults between the three fields of algebra (primarily group theory), \r\ngeometry (negatively curved spaces) and topology (both geometric and \r\nalgebraic).\r\n\r\nGroups are sets equipped with a \"multiplication\", and classically arose as \r\nsymmetries of underlying geometric objects.  Geometry is the study of \r\nproperties of spaces equipped with some additional structure, usually of a \r\nmetric nature (i.e. allowing one to measure distances in the space).  In \r\nthe field of topology, one forgets about the underlying distance, and only \r\nretain the notion of points in the space being \"close together\".  While \r\nthese three fields have always had some overlap, research from the last \r\ntwenty years have led to an increasingly fertile exchange of ideas and \r\napplications amongst them.  The PI's research is intended to further \r\ndevelop the links between these three fields.\r\n\r\n",
