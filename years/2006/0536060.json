 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Electrical (55)\r\nThis project is developing learning materials for an upper level undergraduate electric power quality course.  The motivation for this course development is the need for improvement in power quality at a national level.  This activity is designed to produce learning materials that are knowledge, learning, assessments, and community-centered.  The learning materials are organized into six modules in the most important subject areas related to power quality.  Student learning outcomes involve developing student analytical and synthesis skills by solving power quality problems in the form of case studies.  Both formative and summative methods are used to evaluate student learning outcomes and to continually improve the learning materials.  These materials will be disseminated to faculty through publications, conference presentations, and electronic media.  Faculty members have been identified from a variety of institutions to serve as a dissemination target audience and will test the prototype materials as well as provide feedback about the quality of the prototype. \r\n\r\n",
