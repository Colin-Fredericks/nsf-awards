Knopf\r\n\r\nThe broad goals of the investigator's research program are to find and\r\nclassify optimal geometries using curvature flows. This subject is\r\ncurrently enjoying a period of intense interest and rapid progress,\r\ninspired by Perelman's landmark results in Hamilton's program to\r\nresolve the Poincare and Geometrization Conjectures by Ricci flow. In\r\napplications of Ricci flow, one evolves a Riemannian metric on a\r\nmanifold to simplify and improve its geometry. In many cases, these\r\nimprovements involve changes in topology that are triggered by\r\nsingularity formation. Such improvements are possible because\r\nsolutions of Ricci flow (like many other nonlinear PDE) are expected\r\nto exhibit very special, highly symmetric profiles in a space-time\r\nneighborhood of a developing singularity. A thorough and deep\r\nunderstanding of singularity formation is therefore of critical\r\nimportance for extracting topological and geometric information from\r\nRicci flow behavior. The investigator's immediate objectives focus on\r\nsingularity formation for curvature flows, particularly (1) analytic\r\naspects (asymptotics) of singularity formation, (2) the structure of\r\nsingularities in dimension four, (3) singularities of Kaehler-Ricci\r\nflow, (4) the structure of Perelman's entropy and reduced distance,\r\nand (5) applications of geometric flows to problems in\r\nphysics. Progress toward these objectives will lead to new\r\napplications of Ricci flow in the geometry and topology of manifolds,\r\nproductive insights into parallels between various geometric flows,\r\nand new applications of curvature flows to problems motivated by\r\nmaterials science and physics. These objectives are well suited to\r\ncollaborations with other researchers in geometric evolution equations\r\nand in related fields like comparison geometry, low-dimensional\r\ntopology, and nonlinear analysis.\r\n\r\nThe partial differential equations that arise in curvature flows are\r\nremarkably similar to equations used to model heat propagation, the\r\nmovement of oil in shale and thin films, combustion in porous media,\r\nand certain effects in plasma physics. By increasing our understanding\r\nof singularity formation for such equations, the research elements of\r\nthis project may contribute to progress in these applications. The\r\neducation elements of the project are very tightly integrated with its\r\nresearch focus. The cornerstone of this integration is a series of\r\nannual workshops: each will contain a graduate education component, a\r\nresearch component, and an undergraduate outreach component. The\r\neducation component includes an organized seminar to prepare graduate\r\nstudents for participation in the research component. The outreach\r\ncomponent includes invitations to local undergraduate students to\r\ninteract with the visiting researchers with the goal of attracting\r\nthose students to further studies in mathematics. The project will\r\nbenefit undergraduate education in two other ways: the investigator\r\nwill develop a new course in optimal geometry and integrate it into\r\nthe liberal-arts honors curriculum at the University of Texas, and the\r\ninvestigator will organize and direct an undergraduate\r\nlearning-by-discovery project in which students investigate\r\ncombinatorial curvature flows.\r\n",
