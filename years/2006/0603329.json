 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference ``Affine Hecke algebras, Langlands program, \r\nconformal field theory, and matrix models'' will bring together a diverse group of leading mathematicians and physicists and young researchers, to discuss striking recent\r\ndevelopments in these fields, and allow experts in one of them to\r\nlearn about the others. The conference will consist of three parts: \r\n1) Affine Hecke algebras (1 week) 2) Langlands program (1 week)\r\n3) conformal field theory and matrix models (2 weeks).\r\nThere are numerous and deep connections between these areas, some of which\r\nwere found quite recently. To explore these connections is one of\r\nthe main goals of the conference. Some of the topics to be\r\ndiscussed in the conference are: representations of affine and double affine Hecke algebras; \r\ncyclotomic Hecke algebras; Macdonald theory; geometric representation theory; representations of double loop groups; representations of affine Lie algebras at the critical level;  \r\nrepresentations of p-adic groups; geometric Langlands conjectures\r\nand their connections to string theory; Seiberg-Witten theory; AdS-CFT\r\ncorrespondence; relations between matrix models and string theory. \r\n\r\nThe Langlands program, formulated by R. Langlands in 1967 in his\r\nletter to A. Weil, is a far-reaching program deeply connecting\r\nrepresentation theory and number theory. It is crucial for\r\nunderstanding central number-theoretic objects called automorphic\r\nforms. Affine Hecke algebras are algebraic structures which play\r\na crucial role in the Langlands program. Conformal field theories\r\nare physical models for the behavior of quantum particles, which are \r\nespecially tractable mathematically, because of presence \r\nof a large amount of symmetry, called conformal symmetry. \r\nSuch theories (in two spacetime dimensions) are also important\r\nin formulating the basics of string theory. Matrix models is \r\nessentially a branch of probability theory, dealing with\r\nproperties of random matrices. However, it recently turned out \r\nthat they have deep applications to string theory. \r\nIn the last 10 years, there has been significant progress in all\r\nfour areas, and it became clear that they are intimately\r\nrelated. The conference is designed to help experts and young\r\nresearchers (including many women and minorities) to explore\r\nthis progress and connections. \r\n",
