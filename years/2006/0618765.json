 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Civil (54)\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is refining and expanding a computer-based teaching/learning tool that was piloted under a previous CCLI grant.  The prototype version is effective in improving problem-solving skills of undergraduates in a fluids mechanics course.  The prototype will be refined for use in a statics course by incorporating recent research findings that have the potential to improve learning, assessment, and teaching.  The refinements include: developing a bank of problems to map the 2-dimensional Taxonomy Table to assess the cognitive processing of different knowledge forms; incorporating dynamic and adaptive assessment for improved learning as well as teaching; and providing repeated opportunities for students to make multiple connections between different concepts in different contexts to improve problem-solving in new contexts.  Eight faculty members from civil and mechanical engineering departments in five institutions are collaborating to develop the bank of problems and to implement the refined system in their courses at their respective institutions. Accepted procedures are followed to demonstrate the reliability, validity, portability, and effectiveness of the system.  Dissemination efforts include packaging the product as a CD-ROM accompanied by a textbook.\r\n",
