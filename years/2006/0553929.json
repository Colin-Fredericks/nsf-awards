 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is examining science and mathematics teacher learning in the context of an alternative certification program (designed for individuals with baccalaureate degrees in science or mathematics) employing two different models of field-based preparation.  In one model pre-service teachers are participating in an eight-week summer session and will become independent full-time teachers with complete responsibility for instruction.  In the second model pre-service teachers are participating in the same eight-week summer session followed by a guided yearlong internship under the mentorship of a veteran teacher.  In both models interns are continuing to enroll in university courses.  To examine teacher learning in these two models the researchers are collecting longitudinal data from 72 participants at five transition points in their programs.  Using a data collection cycle that includes lesson planning, observation, stimulated recall and reflection, the researchers are building a rich data set about teacher knowledge.  The intellectual merit of the project is derived from the qualifications and commitment of the investigators to advance knowledge concerning teacher learning in different models of alternative certification.  The findings are enhancing the science and mathematics education research literature where data on science and mathematics teacher learning in alternative certification programs and in field settings is scarce.  The project's broader impact is based on:  (1) its potential to inform the research community about science and mathematics teacher learning; (2) its implications for the design and implementation of alternative certification programs; (3) its implications for the design and implementation of field-based internships in science and mathematics teacher preparation; and (4) its potential to impact policymaking concerning teacher certification/licensure.  The ultimate beneficiaries of such research on teachers are K-12 students whose learning opportunities in science and mathematics will increase as the quality of the teaching workforce increases.   \r\n\r\n",
