The ACM SenSys conference is an emerging one covering all aspects of wireless sensor networking, with participants from the USA, Europe, and Asia.  This grant offers support to graduate students since they are an important part of the research community and they often have limited resources of funds to travel to conferences. It intends to help increase the representation and participation of US-based graduate students in ACM SenSys. This conference travel support insures that deserving graduate students will be able to participate in the conference, thereby nurturing the next generation of researchers.\r\n\r\n",
