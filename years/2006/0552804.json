Marchant\r\n\r\nThis REU award for a Site at the Case Western Reserve University supports 12 undergraduate students for 10 summer weeks each year for three years.\r\n\r\nThis REU site provides research experiences for undergraduates in the area of biomedical engineering.  The objectives of this program are to: (1) immerse students in the research experience, so they gain confidence in their own abilities and in their potential for conducting scientific research; (2) introduce students to the research process of forming a research hypothesis, obtaining and analyzing data, determining results, and presenting results; (3) involve them in team work and collaboration; (4) encourage them to consider careers in biomedical engineering and continuing study at the post-graduate level. \r\n\r\nThe summer research experience has 3 components: (1) a research project, in which students will work with faculty, postdoctoral, and graduate student mentors; (2) a seminar series, and (3) social and cultural activities in the Cleveland area.  The seminar series consists of a variety of topics including laboratory safety and general procedures, student presentations about their research, and guest speakers discussing career paths.  The program provides not only stimulating research opportunities, but is also provides opportunities for formal and informal interaction and collaboration between the students and their faculty mentors, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and with other undergraduates.  \r\n",
