 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fort Berthold Community College proposes to develop a Learning Community of 60 STEM students during the next 3 years. Each student will receive financial incentives, special seminars, enrichment and cultural activities with an emphasis on research resulting in advancing knowledge and understanding in the various STEM disciplines. The students will experience a structured first year including a specialized team of instructors comprised of math, science, technology, and tribal studies. This team, lead by the Academic Dean, has the requisite qualifications based on experience acquired from the previous TCUP grant and will design research based instruction utilizing the constructivist teaching strategies perfected in the past TCUP grant. The following second year will have students select their emphasis area: math, science, technology, or engineering. Each STEM student will be assigned to a cohort and will commit to continue their education past the two-year degree. The TCUP project will assist with the transfer process and transition to a four-year institution in a STEM field. \r\n",
