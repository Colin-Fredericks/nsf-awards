 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robert Silbey of MIT is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for research that is developing theoretical and computational methods for the study of the spectroscopy of molecules and molecular aggregates in the condensed phase.  The work builds on the PI's prior NSF-supported research.  Single molecule spectroscopy of multi-chromophoric systems is being investigated, along with energy transfer in these same substances.  Examples of systems being studied include the light harvesting complexes and other molecular aggregates.  The research is taking into account both quantum coherence effects, as well as disorder, both static and dynamic, that leads to decoherence and localization.  The results of this research are expected to have a broader impact on our understanding of molecular electronics, solar energy conversion and other application areas.\r\n",
