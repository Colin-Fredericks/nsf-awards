 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this U.S.-Brazil planning visit supported by the Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering, Richard G. Weiss of Georgetown University will explore research collaboration in the area of gel science with Prof. Teresa D. Z. Atvars of the University of Campinas in Brazil.  Professor Atvars has a fluorescence microscope that can follow the nucleation and subsequent aggregation steps leading to self-assembled fibrillar networks (SAFINs) of molecular gels.  This general research theme is part of a project currently being being pursued in Prof. Weiss's laboratory.  The information to be obtained from the proposed research is central to understanding a wide range of different nucleation-crystallization phenomena, an important area in sol-gel chemistry.  The approaches and training of Profs. Atvars and Weiss are quite different, and their areas of expertise are complementary.  These differences and complementarities are expected to produce results that would not be possible in either of their laboratories alone.\r\n\r\nThe prospective collaborative research project will provide a blueprint for those who are employing gels, including molecular gels, for applications in health fields (rates of drug delivery for implanted devices or dermal patches), enhanced oil recovery (at the shale cracking stage), and even art conservation. There will also be an important component of human resource development.  In addition to having both Brazilian and US graduate students work side by side to learn new techniques and approaches to problem solving, the US students will also learn how to adapt to a different culture.\r\n",
