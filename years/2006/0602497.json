 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for qualified undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers to attend the International Congress on Electron Tomography (ICET) in San Diego, CA, from November 5-8, 2006. This congress is the fourth in a series of workshops that was initiated in 1997 to begin to bring together practitioners developing and applying electron microscopic tomography. The meetings have provided a forum for intensive interactions and have catalyzed technical developments and an increased number of users. At this juncture, electron tomography is one of the most rapidly evolving approaches in multiscale 3D microscopy and is being employed for an increasingly broad range of applications, well beyond those envisioned at the time of the first conference. \r\n\r\nElectron Tomography is a new research area that produces 3-dimensional quantitative images from electron microscopy.  Electron tomography is moving from a specialized experimental technique practiced by a few laboratories to one that is delivering critical new information to cell biologists, structural biologists and neuroscientists. Because electron tomography has been identified as a growth field, it is anticipated that the graduate students and postdoctoral researchers being trained today will go on to become the next generation lead investigators. \r\n",
