 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a planning effort that will identify needed changes to facilities at the headquarters of the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest (HJA) and identify ways the station can improve access to its long-term data sets.  Since its establishment in 1948, the H.J. Andrews has been a continuous contributor to advancement of environmental science, natural resource management and policy, and education.  Both recent and on-going changes in various research and education programs at HJA have made it important to examine these programs from a strategic perspective.  This planning effort will include two workshops, one focusing on facilities and one focusing on data access issues, that will result in a plan for the next five and ten-year periods that is expected to benefit all HJA users, including academic and public sector research scientists, educators, and students.  A focus on ways to advance the integration of research and education will be included in both parts of the proposed planning process.  \r\nCurrently, several dozen university and federal scientists use the HJA to gain basic understanding of Pacific Northwest forest and stream ecosystems, and to apply this knowledge in a variety of contexts. The results of the planning effort are expected to improve site-based and information management support for existing and new research projects, and to encourage communication among researchers at the site.  Educational activities at the HJA extend from K-12 students and teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, and continuing education on many fronts.  Close working ties with US Forest Service staff enhance the science program and facilitate transfer of the information gained through research to potential users in the public and private sectors. The planning effort will focus on strategies to use the wealth of findings from the research program to inform the Andrews' educational and public outreach efforts, and on strategies to improve access to data gathered at the Andrews station.\r\n",
