The first workshop on machine learning and data mining, will be held in Beijing June 11-14, 2007, and the second, on bioinformatics, will be held in Hangzhou June 9-12, 2008.  Each workshop will follow a more widely attended Beijing-Hangzhou International Mathematics Summer School which has been convened by the partner organizations in this proposal for the past three years.  The respective U.S. Co-PIs for the workshops are Dr. Xiaotong Shen, Professor of Statistics at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, and Professor Zhiliang Ying, Professor of Statistics at Columbia University.  The Chinese counterpart organizers respectively are LI, Guying, Professor, Institute of Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, and LIN, Zhengyan, Professor of Mathematics at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China.   \r\n\r\nTopics for the first workshop in machine learning and data mining have the potential to lead to significant advances in large margin classification, boosting ensemble methods, sparse and semi-supervised learning clustering, text and data mining.   The second workshop on bioinformatics also has strong potential to address fundamental research issues in gene clustering and regulation, micro array in cancer genomics, and signaling.  Both workshops present U.S. researchers with a unique opportunity to develop collaborations and gain access to expertise in using recently aggregated, large databases in China.  The attendees include notable experts that will greatly benefit U.S. early-career statisticians participating in the workshops.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
