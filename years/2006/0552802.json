 "awd_abstract_narration": "The site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU Program.\r\n\r\nDigital technology has already moved from the machine room to the desktop, and is now embedding\r\nitself fully in our daily lives, becoming a designed artifact. Todays undergraduates love designed\r\ntechnology, and with justification: the outsourcing of purely technical work is more common every day,\r\nwhile creative technical design work remains truly value-added and secure. Yet oddly, there are few\r\neducational and research programs that train future professionals for this environment.\r\n\r\nThe three-summer Design Tech program will begin to address this lack, inviting exceptional\r\nundergraduate students in computer science and design to an interactive visual design hothouse. The\r\nprogram is organized around several principles common to design and technology: celebrating creativity\r\nfeeding the spark that motivates successful designers and researchers; embracing critique \r\nencouraging bold thinking and original work by making critique less threatening; focus on product \r\nincreasing the understandability of design and technical theory by placing it in an applied context; social\r\ncreativity  emphasizing the group dialog of successful creativity to improve teamwork and diversity;\r\ninterdisciplinary teamwork  using cross-disciplinary teams to improve research and design quality; team\r\ndiversity  bettering designed technology with broader ethnic and cultural participation.\r\n\r\nDesign Tech students will be recruited from local womens and historically black colleges, pass\r\nthrough an orientation, be formed into project-centered teams, and work with investigators in semi-weekly\r\nmeetings. Less frequent critique sessions inspired by design pedagogy will encourage independent and\r\ncritical thought. Projects will target delivery at a final session Showcase open to the public. Research\r\ntopics will emphasize interactive visual design, and be drawn from the existing research agendas of the\r\nfour investigators, who are experts in graphics, visualization, artificial intelligence and design.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nBy bringing together the design and interactive computing communities in a\r\nresearch and educational environment, Design Tech will generate powerful intellectual ripples. Obviously,\r\nthe research successfully performed by the undergraduates will have value, as will their learning about\r\nresearch and design. As researchers and designers work together on these research problems, they will\r\nfind new solutions and perhaps more important, generate new problems. Similarly, as they cooperate on\r\npedagogy, they will synthesize new techniques for making better designers out of researchers, and better\r\nresearchers out of designers.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nWith its emphasis on diversity, Design Tech will have a broad impact on the\r\ntechnical education of women and minorities. The investigators will publish their pedagogical successes\r\nand failures on the web and in print, disseminating the results of their experiment. PI Watson is already\r\norganizing a new SIGGRAPH course on graphics and design as well as an ACM campfire on interactive\r\nvisual design; his experiences in Design Tech will shape the thoughts he brings to and the content\r\ndisseminates at those events.",
