 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe newly created experimental HEP group at the State University of New York at Buffalo (UB) is developing a research program in collider physics, focused on the CMS experiment at CERN and the DO experiment at FNAL.  The program seeks to find answers to fundamental questions about the underlying mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and the origin of the mass. One approach is to directly search for Higgs particles at CMS and DO experiments.  Another is to measure precisely the top quark mass with CMS, which will provide an indirect constraint on the Higgs boson mass.  The groups technical responsibilities include participation in the construction, installation and commissioning of the CMS Forward Pixel detector, and contributions to the operation of the DO silicon detector.   The proposed research program enhances infrastructure for research and education by providing a choice for UB undergraduate and graduate students to pursue research in experimental high energy physics - an opportunity previously unavailable at the University. The outreach aspects of the program will foster collaboration between high school teachers, students and the UB group members including participation in QuarkNet. \r\n",
