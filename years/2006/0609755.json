 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first area of proposed research involves the study of compatible\r\ndiscretization schemes for partial differential equations, an approach that\r\nattempts to produce numerical approximations that inherit or mimic\r\nfundamental properties of a partial differential equation, such as\r\nconservation and symmetries.  Several problems, modeling phenomena in\r\nelasticity and fluids, will be studied from this point of view. The new\r\napproach taken is based on the construction of piecewise polynomial exact\r\nelasticity sequences, which are closely related to the development of stable\r\nmixed finite element schemes.  Other work in this area includes a new \r\napproach to the construction of hierarchical bases for scalar and vector-valued \r\nfinite element spaces in arbitrary space dimensions, and exact sequence \r\nproperties of rectangular and quadrilateral finite elements and their applications to the\r\nstability of mixed finite element approximation.  The second area of \r\nstudy is the approximation properties of several types of finite element spaces \r\ndefined on irregular hexahedral elements obtained by trilinear mappings from a\r\nreference cube. Such spaces are used to approximate three-dimensional vector\r\nfunctions and arise naturally in many applications, including the \r\napproximation of Maxwell's equations and the use of mixed and least squares finite element\r\nmethods for second order elliptic equations. Although it is often implicitly\r\nassumed that approximation results known for regular hexahedrons extend to\r\nthese spaces, in fact this is not the case.  The research is to determine\r\nprecisely what is needed for optimal order approximation and construct\r\nfamilies of finite element spaces that have this property.  The third \r\narea of research is to study convergence rates for discontinuous Galerkin \r\nmethods for linear hyperbolic problems.  Although optimal order convergence rates are\r\noften seen in practice, the theory guarantees such rates only for uniform\r\nmeshes, while a lower rate is known to be the best possible on specially\r\nconstructed meshes.  The proposed research is to classify the type of meshes\r\nfor which the optimal convergence rate is achieved.\r\n\r\nMathematical modeling of physical and biological processes using partial\r\ndifferential equations has become the standard method of studying a host of\r\nimportant problems. Such models capture in a concise and precise way the\r\nfundamental features of the process being modeled. Unfortunately, the\r\nresulting equations rarely have solutions that can be expressed by simple\r\nmathematical formulas.  Hence, the development of reliable and efficient\r\nnumerical approximation schemes are necessary to make this method into a\r\npractical approach and is central to progress in many areas of science and\r\nengineering.  Part of this development involves the investigation of the\r\ntheoretical underpinnings of numerical methods.  Such investigation can lead\r\nto a greater understanding of existing methods and to the development of new\r\nmethods with desirable properties. Thus, such study has the potential to\r\nimprove the accuracy of, or even make possible, essential computer \r\nsimulations performed by scientists and engineers.  This project is concerned with the\r\nstudy of numerical methods for approximating equations modeling phenomena in\r\nelasticity and fluid flow.  One central theme is to develop approximation\r\nschemes that preserve discrete versions of some of the fundamental \r\nproperties of the mathematical model, in order to more accurately capture the \r\nfundamental features of the underlying process being modeled.\r\n",
