 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has as its general objective the demonstration of a significant improvement in light to current conversion efficiency of solar cells. A successful demonstration of the approach that will be investigated in this project, namely, the combination of quantum dots and dyes, will provide new insights into energy capture and utilization. It seems a ceiling in module efficiency in the range of 5 -10% is being approached. Although this level of performance is quite beneficial and will find many useful applications for portable power and battery recharging, (even a module efficiency of 4-5% is commercially viable), widespread use of photovoltaics for power generation in homes and offices will not be realized until the efficiency reaches or exceeds 15-20% - the specific objective of this project.\r\n\r\nUsing photon-to-electron conversion efficiency as one criterion upon which progress can be measured, it is clear that these technologies have made great strides in recent years. Low cost solar material with efficiencies in the 15-20% range has the potential to transform the solar industry. Flexible, lightweight material relative to conventional heavy glass panels allows for easy incorporation into a wide range of products without notably increasing the product weight, and also facilitates large surface installations. Roll-to-roll manufacturing processes are compact and replicable, allowing for manufacturing facilities to be established regionally and near high demand areas worldwide.\r\n",
