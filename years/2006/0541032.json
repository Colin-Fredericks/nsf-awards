 "awd_abstract_narration": "The educational component is tightly integrated into the proposed research plan, that includes producing\r\nsoftware tools for shape modeling and visualization. We plan to use such tools in graduate courses on\r\nComputer Graphics and Geometric Modeling, and distribute them to the scientific community.\r\n\r\nThe intellectualmerit of the proposed research lies in enhancing the power of current tools for analyzing\r\nand visualizing time-varying scalar fields through innovative multi-resolution models. This will not only\r\nreduce the complexity and the size of the resulting representations, but will allow effectively focusing on\r\nsalient visualization features. An other important challenge is to enhance multi-resolution representations\r\nthrough the development of new multi-scale morphological models. This will allow designing new out-ofcore\r\nrepresentations for multi-dimensional scalar fields and it will also support a hierarchical approach to\r\nanalyzing, visualizing and understanding multi-dimensional scientific data sets.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed research lies in the analysis, understanding and visualization of large scientific data sets, and of dynamic 3D shapes, thus enhancing innovative research in visualization, computer graphics and visual data mining. Many application fields will highly benefit from this research, including scientific computing, biomedical engineering, surgical simulation, animation, and cultural heritage.\r\n",
