 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST-0613622\r\nChandran\r\n\r\nMagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is a critical unsolved problem in basic plasma physics.  Although major progress has been made in the theory of incompressible MHD turbulence, much less is known about compressible MHD turbulence, which is of great importance for physical applications. This research will lead to a comprehensive theory of weak compressible MHD turbulence in plasmas where the pressure is low compared to the magnetic energy density.  This theory will provide analytic and numerical results including kinetic effects, to investigate dissipation at collisionless scales and to determine the distribution of turbulent heating between particle species.  The results will be crucial for understanding the role that turbulence plays in accelerating particles in solar flares and in heating the solar corona.\r\n\r\nThe project will achieve a broader impact through a variety of training and outreach activities, including graduate and undergraduate students with a special effort to recruit women and other under-represented groups.  An introductory presentation describing elementary principles and important applications of plasma physics, aimed at the secondary school level, will help to increase understanding of science and to stimulate student interest in science careers.",
