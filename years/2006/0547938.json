The interest in answering fundamental questions runs in parallel with the technological drive to find new materials for use in spin-based devices. The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development project at Brown University is to investigate the quantum nature of novel magnetic materials using magnetic resonance techniques. At very low temperatures, a strong magnetic field can be effectively used to manipulate the quantum states in such systems. Non-invasive microscopic techniques, such as magnetic resonance, sensitive to both spin and charge of an electron can be very powerful in elucidating nature of these new states of matter. The ultimate goal of this project is to answer fundamental questions regarding quantum magnetism and to discover new collective phenomena. The educational value of these projects arises from the extensive participation of both graduate and undergraduate students. Conducting research at the high magnetic field facilities will be of particular benefit in training students. In addition, short seminar courses on spectroscopic techniques used in modern condensed matter studies will be offered. Furthermore outreach will be targeted at younger children with the goal of eventually increasing the diversity of the physics profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n****** TECHNICAL ABSTRACT*****\r\nThe goal of this Faculty Early Career Development project at Brown University is to investigate strongly correlated magnetic materials using magnetic resonance techniques. One of the challenges of modern condensed matter physics is to understand the nature of quantum phases and phase transitions in matter. This project will focus on the study of frustrated quantum magnets. These materials are of particular interest since they can be used to test theoretical predictions on quantum phase transitions and the effects of competing quantum interactions, tunable by the application of an external magnetic field. The ultimate goal of the research is to clarify the nature of the ground states in frustrated quantum magnets and provide important constraints on the theoretical understanding of strongly correlated condensed matter systems. The educational value of these projects arises from the extensive participation of both graduate and undergraduate students. Conducting research at the high magnetic field facilities will be of particular benefit in training students. In addition, short seminar courses on spectroscopic techniques used in modern condensed matter studies will be offered. Furthermore outreach will be targeted at younger children with the goal of eventually increasing the diversity of the physics profession.\r\n",
