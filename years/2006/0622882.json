 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives: The objectives for this project include reducing the achievement gap between the\r\nperformance of students with learning disabilities and their non-disabled peers in math;\r\nenhancing the math preparation of individuals with LD to enter postsecondary institutions to\r\npursue programs and degrees in math, science, engineering, and technology; and the national\r\ndissemination of instructional resources in the form of lessons and online tutorials aligned with\r\ncurriculum standards that have been validated to improve the achievement of students with LD .\r\nThis proposal builds from a major internally funded project identified as the Blending\r\nAssessment with Instruction Program (BAIP) that is comprised of two validated interventions in\r\nthe form of lessons for teachers to employ in their instruction and online tutorials for\r\nindependent use by students with LD. Both interventions are aligned with curriculum standards\r\nin math. The research initiative is designed to investigate the effects of the lessons and the\r\ntutorials on the achievement of students with LD in math.\r\nSignificance and Intellectual Merit of Research: National Center for Educational Outcomes\r\nreported in 2004 that not only were students with LD performing below all students across the\r\ncountry, but also that the gap actually grew significantly larger as students got older (Thurlow &\r\nWiley, 2004). Research has found that students with LD typically function two to four grades\r\nbelow expectancy across the mathematics curriculum (Parmar & Cawley, 1997). Many students\r\nwith LD perform poorly on assessments that are tied to state standards (Thurlow, Albus,\r\nSpicuzza, & Thompson, 1998). Thurlow et al determined that only 34% of students with LD\r\npassed a state test on basic math skills, versus 83% of their non-disabled peers. This is of\r\nserious concern given that students with LD are held to increasingly higher standards and will\r\nneed higher-level math and reasoning skills to meet the demands of high school and beyond. In\r\nless than 20 years, one in every four jobs will require technical skills (Tarlin, 1997, as cited in\r\nJarrett, 1998), and many careers require a strong basis in math. If students do not experience a\r\nstandards-based curriculum at an early age, they will be disadvantaged when being assessed\r\nvia a standards-based assessment as required by NCLB. To focus only on postsecondary\r\ninterventions to increase the presence of persons with LD in math, science and technology\r\ncareers fails to recognize what research demonstrates as the contributor to the underrepresentation\r\nof persons with LD in the math, science and technology fields.\r\nResearch Strategy: We propose to research the effects of BAIP in aligning local curricula with\r\nnational curriculum standards and statewide assessments as a model for improving the\t\r\nperformance of students with LD. The lessons and tutorials are developed for grades 3, 4, 5, 6,\r\n7, 8, and 10 in compliance with NCLB. Two distinct empirical approaches are planned. First,\r\nlesson tests will be directly tied to content. These tests will be piloted to assure their validity and\r\nreliability. Once quality tests are available, they will be administered prior to and following\r\nlesson use with targeted students. In concurrence with this \"experimental group\" testing, we will\r\npre and post test other comparable students with the same measures. As we will not be able to\r\ncontrol for group equivalence due to the absence of randomization to intervention, and also\r\nconsidering that the pre and post test measures will not be equivalent, analysis of covariance\r\nprocedures will be used to control \"pre-lesson\" instructional group differences. This method will\r\nbe used within schools and as numbers of participants increase will carry out more robust\r\nempirical studies relying on hierarchical linear modeling. Thus in six months we will quasiexperimentally\r\nresearch the impact on learning of the lessons. Finally, student item score\r\nresults will be evaluated descriptively to guide us regarding needed lesson changes.\r\nComparisons will be made across students with LD who experience (a) the lessons taught by\r\nteachers, (b) tutorials, (c) lessons and (d) tutorials with disability and non-disabled peers.\r\nBroader Implications of Proposed Research: The vast majority of students with LD receive\r\ntheir math instruction in the general education classroom. Thus, the project has the potential to\r\nbenefit all teachers and, ultimately, all students.\r\n",
