 "awd_abstract_narration": "The after-school project,  \"Science in the City:  A Proposal for Developing Future Scientists\" proposes to implement several cohesive programs to assist approximately 120 at-risk students learn mathematics and science.  The focus is not on a single scientific discipline, but rather the significance of science in everyday activities ranging from art and music to the solution of crime.  The project uses the inquiry approach to advance the research component in the activities and will advance discovery and understanding and challenge students to become active learners by engaging them in these challenging STEM experiences.  The students will be recruited from low-income minority populations that are performing below grade level.  This focus addresses the real challenge of science education in schools and reaching those students who may not be considering a career in science.  The project serves as a model mechanism for effective learning interactions among teachers, students, informal science organizations and the  business community in the development of an educational workforce.  The in-school experiences augment the out-of-school experiences.  The method for involving parents in this project is unique and will assist in supporting the goals of the program. \r\n\r\n \r\n",
