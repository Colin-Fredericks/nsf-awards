 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator proposes to study questions\r\ndealing with the algebraic structure of the Stone-Cech\r\ncompactification of a discrete semigroup and the combinatorial\r\napplications of that structure.  Some of the questions,\r\nwhile easy to state, are notoriously difficult.  For \r\nexample, is there a nontrivial continuous homomorphism\r\nfrom the Stone-Cech compactification of the positive\r\nintegers to its remainder? Equivalently, is there a\r\nfinite subsemigroup of the remainder whose elements\r\nare not all idempotents?  Among the applications\r\nof this algebraic structure have been results establishing\r\nthat certain infinite matrices are image partition regular.\r\nIt is hoped that progress will be made on the difficult\r\nquestion of characterizing which infinite matrices are\r\nimage partition regular.\r\n\r\n     The study of the algebraic structure of the Stone-Cech\r\ncompactification of a discrete semigroup is important\r\nfor two main reasons.  First, many of the questions that\r\nremain open are very simple to state and quite natural.\r\nSecondly, experience has shown that information about\r\nthis algebraic structure has significant applications\r\nto the field of mathematics known as Ramsey Theory.\r\nThe first such application was the algebraic proof in 1975 by \r\nFred Galvin and Steven Glazer of the \"Finite Sums\r\nTheorem\", which asserts that whenever the positive\r\nintegers are divided into finitely many classes, one\r\nof these classes contains a sequence and all of its\r\nsums of finitely many distinct terms. After this\r\ninitial application  many other applications have been found. For example\r\nvery easy proofs of van der Waerden's Theorem (which asserts that\r\nwhenever the positive integers are divided into finitely\r\nmany classes, one of these must contain arbitrarily\r\nlong arithmetic progressions) and some of its\r\nextensions have been found. The principal investigator\r\nintends, with some of his students, to continue\r\nthe investigation of this algebraic structure\r\nand its applications. \r\n",
