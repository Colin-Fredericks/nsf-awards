 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research of the investigator is on the timely study of the\r\nfluid dynamics of non-Newtonian fluid flows. The investigator\r\nwill examine systematically the design and development of an efficient\r\ncomputational modelling package that can handle various\r\nmacroscopic models of complex fluids and also a wide spectrum of\r\nphysical parameters that have been elusive for  conventional\r\nnumerical methods. In addition to general algorithmic developments\r\nincluding the fast solution method like the multigrid methods, the\r\ninvestigator aims to study and understand proper mathematical\r\nmodels for a great variety of new physical phenomena arising in\r\nthe area of experimental rheology. In particular, the investigator\r\nwill tackle an important challenge of modelling a continual\r\noscillation of falling sphere in  worm-like micellar fluid flows.\r\nIn contrast to the Newtonian fluid or the polymeric fluids, the\r\nfalling sphere in a worm-like micellar fluid undergoes a continual\r\nand sustained oscillation as it falls. This part of the project\r\nwill involve testing various macroscopic models that are relevant for\r\nthe worm-like micellar fluids and will lead to  identification of the right\r\nmathematical models for a falling sphere experiment. The\r\ninvestigator will also address a mathematical foundation for\r\nthe so-called  high Weissenberg number problem. Despite  recent\r\nsignificant progress, the successful computations are still\r\nconfined to very restrictive size of the Weissenberg number for a\r\nlarge class of non-Newtonian fluid models including the well-known\r\nOldroyd-B model. The investigator will implement the new numerical\r\nmethods for the computer simulations of highly elastic fluid\r\nflows, namely, models with high Weissenberg number to simulate and\r\nunderstand another newly observed intriguing physical phenomenon,\r\nthe elastic turbulence.\r\n\r\nFluids comprised of large macromolecules, known as non-Newtonian\r\nfluids or complex fluids, can generate many new physical\r\nphenomenon. Examples of non-Newtonian fluids can be found\r\nthroughout our daily lives,  including molten plastics,\r\nengine oils with polymeric additives, paints, and many biological\r\nfluids such as egg white and blood. The design, implementation,\r\nand the use of numerical methods for the computer simulation of\r\nsuch physical phenomena requires full grasp of non-Newtonian\r\nfluids and the results of the investigator's  research are\r\nexpected to have significant applications, for example in industry.\r\nNamely, a polymer engineer could perform elaborate\r\nComputer Aided Design (CAD) studies in which the link between the\r\nmolecular architecture of the raw material and the final\r\nproperties of the product would be established, at least\r\nqualitatively. Production problems would be predicted and\r\npartially overcome through improved design. One could also think\r\nof using an on-line computational rheology model in concert with\r\nappropriate control algorithms to provide for intelligent,\r\nphysics-based process control techniques. There are many more\r\nopportunities that the investigator's  research results\r\ncould generate.\r\n",
