 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this effort is to provide a number of routes for making silicon solar cells more efficient by the clever use of self-assembly to nanostructure the surface of silicon, thus allowing for more light to be trapped and converted to electricity. In this proposal, we outline a number of possible solutions including micro and nanotexturing. Nanotexturing offers advantages in efficiency since the collection efficiency of such a device can be 100% even if the surface is half-covered since the surfaces do not reflect a significant fraction of the incident light (i.e., 0.1-0.2%). A method for producing microlens arrays that can concentrate the solar energy using a novel bubble array technology will also be pursued. The educational objective of this effort is to train graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in area of research that is quite interdisciplinary dealing with methods of self-assembly in area of nanomanufacturing that will find use in energy related issues, in particular in the manufacturing of silicon solar cells.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this work include advancing research that supports solar energy as an alternate energy source as it promises the most in terms of renewability, i.e., non-reliance on fossil fuels, and widespread availability. To achieve widespread utilization of solar cells will require breakthroughs in manufacturing costs and in conversion efficiency. This work, if successful, will provide a means of manufacturing silicon solar cells at a lower cost so that this technology can compete with conventional sources of power by making them an attractive alternative for power generation in the US. Regarding education, collaboration with the Center for Excellence on Photovoltaics (UCEP) at Georgia Tech in their outreach activities will provide support to the high school communities (students and science teachers) regarding technologies that will address the energy issues facing our nation and the world. \r\n",
