 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:\r\n\r\nThe goal of this proposal is to establish a framework for model based simultaneous topography and parameter estimation in the amplitude modulation atomic force microscopy (AFM). Parametric models of tip-sample interaction that are amenable to real-time identification will be developed. Harmonic balance and power balance tools will be incorporated towards the estimation of the model parameters. The amplitude and phase dynamics based on the model will be developed, which will be used to validate the model with experimental data and subsequently used for control design purposes. These methods will be used to study yeast cells. A framework for non-parametric reconstruction of tip-sample interaction potential will be researched. Limitations on how well amplitude modulated AFM can decipher different sample interactions will be studied. The PI will continue to push the synergistic transfer of know-how between the physics and engineering communities by exchanging student visits and presenting specialized workshops. A web based remote operation of the AFM will be developed and integrated into a course on nano-interrogation.\r\n\r\nMicro-cantilevers are being used in diverse areas with increasing impact and have influenced science in a fundamental manner. Indeed, they provided a significant impetus to nanotechnology. The amplitude modulation atomic force microscopy method to be researched in this proposal is by far is the most used AFM mode as it can image samples with atomic resolution and is non-invasive and is thus particularly useful for biotechnology related investigation. The methods proposed are enabling and therefore will open doors for investigating basic science. .The PI has strong collaboration with leading biology related scanning probe microscope companies. This collaboration is expected to foster transfer of the theory and technology developed in this program between the academic institution of the PI and the SPM industry. The web-based remote operation of AFMs to be developed under this proposal will help excite interest in science and will form a instructional tool.\r\n",
