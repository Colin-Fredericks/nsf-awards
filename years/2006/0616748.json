 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Michael D. Raftery of Purdue University is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to conduct research that focuses on the development of methods for enhancing the NMR signal from surfaces.  One approach involves the use of polarization transfer from hyperpolarized xenon to surface nuclei, and another approach involves the development of dynamic nuclear polarization methods for surface NMR experiments.  In situ surface experiments at low temperature will be performed to investigate the surface structure of low surface area diamagnetic materials. In addition, polarization transfer to frozen volatile organic compounds, which can then be transferred to a surface after warming, will be used to probe reaction dynamics.\r\n\r\nThere is a critical need for the chemical characterization of surfaces, and sensitivity-enhanced NMR is one of the most promising avenues for obtaining this information. The project should result in additional tools for the study of surfaces by NMR.  Additionally, important information about the solar-hydrogen conversion materials is likely to be obtained.  The project will provide excellent opportunities for graduate student teaching and training, in NMR, materials synthesis, and instrument-development.\r\n",
