 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project demonstrates the feasibility of producing stearidonic acid from microalgae for human consumption to combat cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The cardiovascular benefits of fish oil enriched in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are well-documented. Despite overwhelming evidence and strong recommendations supporting the health benefits of n-3 PUFAs, the consumption of n-3 PUFAs remains low in the American population, due mainly to unpleasant odor and taste of fish oil and persistent questions about environmental contaminations. A natural alternative to fish oil that could supplement the intake of n-3 PUFA would be predicted to reduce the overall incidence in CVD. Stearidonic acid (SDA) has been identified recently as the most promising alternative to fish oil for preventing cardiovascular diseases. However, the natural source of SDA is limited only in a few plants. The feasibility of growing mass quantities of these plants is questionable and the toxicology profile of these plants remains to be a concern. This research solves this problem by exploiting SDA-rich microalgae as an alternative source of natural SDA for human consumption. This research will be able to produce SDA-rich microalgae as nutraceutical products for Americans to improve health. \r\n\r\nCommercially, this project aims at production of dietary stearidonic acid from microalgae. This project will establish a commercially viable microalgal biotechnology for production of SDA, targeted at competition with the multi-billion dollar fish oil market.  \r\n",
