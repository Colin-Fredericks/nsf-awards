Specifically, the project comprises the synthesis of alumina- and silica-based nanocomposites which incorporate a wide range of metal nanoparticles; the investigation of the formation of the ceramic and metal nanoparticles and their interaction during nucleation and growth; and the reactive characterization of these materials at realistic reaction conditions for several energy-related high-temperature catalytic reactions.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the work is based on the fundamental challenge posed by the multiscale nature of catalytic reactions.  The research will contribute a detailed understanding of how catalyst structures interact across different length scales. It will emphasize the crucial role of catalyst stability and transport inside nanostructured catalysts, rather than aiming mainly at activity and selectivity as targets for the catalyst development. Finally, the project will demonstrate a flexible and widely applicable multiscale approach towards an increased control over composition, structure, and function of nanocomposite catalytic materials.\r\nThe broader impact of the research will address the improved technological costs and catalyst stability, which are among the main limiting factors in the development of state-of-the-art fuel processors. The successful demonstration of highly active and stable nanocomposite catalysts for these environments will therefore have significant impact on future energy technology, including the possible realization of a \"hydrogen economy\".   The project will feature an intensified participation of undergraduate students in research.  Local high school students will also be involved in the research program, which will provide a basis for a new department-wide outreach effort.  \r\n\r\n",
