 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes a new approach to the problem of creating and editing premium quality computer-generated character animation that will dramatically reduce the labor penalty associated with animation techniques and software tools currently available. The specific technical innovation consists of a generic animation framework that produces high-quality motion through a reduced set of input parameters (compared to keyframe techniques) while providing a high degree of \"directability\" for the user. Additionally the proposed innovation affords the ability to generate, capture and reproduce stylistic motions with a high level of fidelity and repeatability. Style is encoded in both physically- and behaviorally-based time-variable parameters supporting smooth transitions between styles. \r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of this project will lead to a product that increases the productivity of experienced animators by simplifying the CG animation process, and enables novice or non-animators to quickly and easily create animated content.  The solution will allow animation to be used for applications where it was not previously feasible due to budgetary constraints opening up new commercial opportunities. Furthermore the successful development of this innovation will expose a much broader consumer market to the art of computer animation, allowing educators to develop more creative and visually effective course materials. \r\n",
