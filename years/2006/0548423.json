 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Uwe Bunz, of the Chemistry Department at Georgia Institute of Technology, will synthesize novel heteroacenes with single and double pyrazine-substructures. Using suitable synthetic condensation techniques, tetraazapentacenes, tetraazahexacenes, tetraazaheptacenes and their antiaromatic dihydro-congeners will be made. To kinetically stabilize and solubilize these tetraazaacenes, suitable alkyl and alkynyl substituents will be appended to the core. The attachment of these substituents will allow manipulation and the solid-state ordering of the aromatic core. This solid-state ordering will significantly alter the electronic properties of these species in thin films and microcrystalline preparations and allow their application in n-semiconductor devices. Due to their fluorescence and substituent patterns, these multiazaacenes will be useful as materials for sensory applications.\r\n\r\nWith the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Bunz will pursue the synthesis of novel materials that will lead to novel n-semiconductors, which will have a significant impact in the fabrication of thin film transistors and photovoltaic cells. The proposed activities that will train graduate students, undergraduate students and postdoctoral researchers will be broadly based and will include synthesis, spectroscopy, and materials science.\r\nOutreach activities involve teaching at Clark Atlanta University (an HBCU) and mentoring high school students in collaboration with the GRAD Atlanta Program. Professor Bunz will involve minority high school students from inner city schools in scientific activities and interest them in careers in science. \r\n",
