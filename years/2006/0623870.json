When large populations of bacteria collectively swim, many interesting fluid flows can be generated and these counter-flows produce feedback on the swimming behavior of the bacteria. Therefore,\r\nstudying the coupling between collective swimming of bacteria and the associated hydrodynamics will lead to a more complete understanding of colony development in\r\nlarge populations of swimming micro-organisms, such as can arise during biofilm formation.\r\nRecent experiments on dense populations of swimming Bacillus subtilis have revealed a volume fraction-dependent transition from random swimming to transient jet and vortex patterns in the bacteria/fluid mixture. This proposal will develop a model that treats the\r\nswimming bacteria as one phase of a multi-phase fluid and the surrounding water as a\r\nsecond-phase. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: Even modest progress will greatly increase our understanding of\r\nthe multiphase fluid dynamics that arises in bacterial populations, which will have\r\nconsequences for other important areas of bacterial behavior such as biofilm formation.\r\nIn addition, this project may provide new insights for nano- and micron-scale mixing,\r\nwhich could be applicable for chemical reactor applications. The project is intrinsically\r\ninter-disciplinary, drawing on ideas from fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, soft\r\ncondensed matter physics, and biology.\r\n\r\n Broader impact: The results will be broadly disseminated at interdisciplinary\r\nconferences and in interdisciplinary journals. In addition, the PI will teach methods and\r\nresults from this project in an interdisciplinary upper level undergraduate/graduate class\r\nthat he has developed entitled.  An Introduction to Biophysics, which is cross-listed\r\nbetween biomedical engineering, physics, mathematics, and molecular and cellular\r\nbiology. This course is taught between the Health Center campus and the main campus\r\nof the University of Connecticut.\r\n\r\n",
