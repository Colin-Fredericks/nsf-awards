 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cumaceans are small crustaceans that live in marine sediments, commonly \r\nencountered in marine sampling programs, fish and bird stomachs, and night \r\nplankton samples.  The density and diversity of cumaceans tends to increase \r\nwith depth and decreasing sediment grain size, although cumaceans can also \r\nbe abundant in shallow sandy sediments.  Many specimens are never \r\nidentified beyond the level of the order Cumacea, due in large part to a \r\nlack of synthesizing works and identification tools such as monographs and \r\ndatabases.  Of the eight recognized families of Cumacea, only one has been \r\nmonographed.  The objective of this proposal it to complete a monograph and \r\ndatabase for the family Lampropidae.  A monograph collects and synthesizes \r\nall the available knowledge about a group of organisms and includes \r\nidentification keys, making it possible for non-specialists to identify \r\nspecimens with accuracy.  DELTA is a package of programs that includes a \r\ntaxonomic database and an interactive, illustrated identification program, \r\nwhich can be web-disseminated and facilitates species \r\nidentifications.  Both the monograph and database will be disseminated \r\nthrough a website, which will include general information about the \r\nCumacea, in addition to information for systematists.\r\n\r\nAs human impacts on the oceans increase, it is widely \r\nrecognized that marine bio-diversity is significantly under-recorded.  This \r\nproject will increase knowledge about the diversity of marine life directly \r\nthrough the description of new genera and new species.  Three undergraduate \r\nstudents who are future teachers will be trained in the practice of \r\nsystematics.  The students will come away with an understanding of the \r\nimportance of biodiversity and recognition of how much remains unknown, as \r\nwell as experience in the process of scientific research, which will \r\nenhance their own teaching about science in the future.  In order to remain \r\ncompetitive globally, the U.S. must enhance the science education of our \r\ncitizens, and improving the science education of future teachers is \r\nexpected to enhance their ability to teach science effectively.\r\n",
