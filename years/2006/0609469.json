The research will be carried out by an interdisciplinary team that includes members from the Physics, Chemistry, and Materials Science Departments of U.C. Berkeley and Harvard, as well as the Microscopy group at the IBM Almaden Research Center.  New magnetic molecules will be synthesized that have electronic and spin properties tailored for particular device characteristics.  New techniques will be developed to control these molecules and incorporate them into surface and interface configurations for device applications. Investigations will be made into the fundamental properties of magnetic molecules interacting with inorganic surfaces in various device geometries.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit of these activities lie in the fact that completely new nanoscale spin systems will be explored, providing access to new physical regimes and new device possibilities.  Molecular analogs to giant magnetoresistance, spin-valve behavior, and spin-torque switching will be explored, as well as new molecular phenomena that has not yet been observed or evaluated in a device setting.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of the research lie in education and outreach, as well as in the impact on other scientific fields and the engineering community.  Training will be provided to graduate students, undergraduates, and postdoctoral fellows in an interdisciplinary environment that includes a strong exposure to industry through direct collaboration with researchers at the IBM Almaden Research Center.  Outreach and educational efforts by senior investigators will include the creation of new educational materials in nanoscience and technology.  The development of new classes of magnetic molecules and new techniques to create coupled molecular nanostructures with tunable magnetic properties will impact a broad range of scientific and engineering activities, including spintronics, information storage, quantum information processing, and molecular electronics.  \r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n      This project supported research into the fundamental behavior of new nanodevice configurations utilizing the quantum spin of molecules as the active element in combined magnetic molecule / inorganic heterostructures.  Nanodevices are small devices whose size is on the order of a nanometer (one billionth of a meter).  Quantum spin is an intrinsic angular momentum that fundamental particles (such as electrons) possess, and which leads to magnetism.  In macroscopic magnetic structures (like a refrigerator magnet) the quantum nature of spin is not so evident, but in devices and structures at the nanometer scale the quantum nature of spin becomes more important and relevant to device properties.  This research was aimed at helping to determine how quantum spin might be used in future devices having improved size, speed, and energy efficiency.  More specifically, this project focused on the control and understanding of spin in molecular systems.  Controlling magnetism in molecular form offers many potential advantages over traditional device materials due to the tremendous amount of control that exists for optimizing molecular size, spin, and chemical properties through the use of chemistry-based techniques.        \n\n      The research performed in this project  was carried out by an interdisciplinary team that included members from the Physics, Chemistry, and Materials Science Departments of U.C. Berkeley and Harvard, as well as the Microscopy group at the IBM Almaden Research Center.  New magnetic molecules were synthesized having electronic and spin behavior tailored for particular device characteristics.  New techniques were developed to control incorporation of these molecules into surface and interface configurations for device application. Fundamental properties of magnetic molecules interacting with inorganic surfaces was investigated (including at the single molecule level) for different interface environments in order to understand how these properties might impact nanodevice performance.  Different device geometries were also explored that contained magnetic molecules as the nanoscopic active element, and these were tested for novel magneto-transport behavior. \n\n      The intellectual merit of these activities lies in the fact that completely new nanoscale systems were explored, providing access to new physical regimes and new device possibilities.  New magnetic molecule structures were fabricated using atomic manipulation, allowing individual metallic spins in vanadium atoms to be linked across individual organic TCNE molecules.  This allowed direct observation of how spins couple through a single molecular linker for the first time.  New molecules having engineered spin properties (such as magnetic anisotropy) were fabricated within the manganese oxide molecule class, and tested using magnetization and electrical transport techniques.  Novel structural properties (i.e., such as Jahn-Teller transitions) and spin properties (i.e., such as extraordinarily high spin reversal barriers) were discovered.  These molecules were incorporated into tiny electrical devices and novel device properties were explored that will have impact on future magneto-electronic technologies.  This includes development of a deeper understanding of how flowing electrons in nanoscale devices interact with molecular spins in the presence of electron-electron interactions.  These properties were measured at low temperature and high magnetic fields, where the true quantum nature of the spin degree of freedom could be readily observed.  We additionally explored the behavior of individual spin structures incorporated into ultra-thin metal films and graphene sheets (graphene is a single-atom-thick membrane of carbon).  This provided new information on how the presence of localized spin structures can scatter electrons in a thin conducting film and radically change the film's electronic properties.\n\n      The broader impact of this work lies in the ..."
