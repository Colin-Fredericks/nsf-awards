 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 52-month research project is designed to study the Partnership for Reform in Secondary Science and Mathematics (PRiSSM) professional development model that began in summer, 2004 with 45 lead teachers from 22 schools across six Washington state school districts.  Mathematics and science teachers from feeder middle and high schools were supported in forming cross-district, cross-discipline professional learning communities (PLCs).  The PLCs first developed a common vision of high quality teaching and learning, then collaboratively developed and pursued an inquiry question focused on instructional practice.  Approximately 100 \"Expanded Team\" teachers will join PRiSSM in both 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 to establish school-based PLCs, led by the lead teachers and supported by PRiSSM facilitators.  Teacher activity in this school university collaboration includes 1) participation in the year-long PLC collaborative inquiry and, 2) forty hours of summer coursework or other PD related to the area of inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe research on this model will contribute to the knowledge base on professional development through an empirical investigation of the model of supported teacher collaborative inquiry described above.  Specifically, the research addresses how the interactions amongst PLC teachers contribute to new understandings about teaching, learning, and disciplinary content, and whether this translates into changes in classroom practice.  A mixed methods research design will be used.  Four PLCs will be purposely selected to provide in-depth understandings of the relationships amongst supported teacher collaborative inquiry, changes in classroom practices and improved student learning.  Individual teacher case studies will be conducted inside these larger contexts.  Teacher learning in relation to PD implementation will be determined with a variety of instruments including classroom observations, participant interviews, surveys and audio/video records of PLC meetings.  Student achievement relative to national science and math content standards will be assessed through researcher-designed, classroom-based assessments as well as standardized state assessments. \r\n\r\n",

Based upon extensive data, we developed a detailed framework to describe the nature of the activities teachers engage in when undertaking a collaborative inquiry process.

These phases include data exploration, collection, analysis, and derivation of implications for teaching.

Most groups spent their time determining or developing assessment tools, and then making sense of the results obtained from the assessment. Often they found that the assessment did not provide the information they desired.
