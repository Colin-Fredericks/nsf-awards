 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL EXPLANATION\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop novel strategies for design and synthesis of rigid porous materials with large and tunable cavities from molecular building blocks. A metal-ligand directed assembly approach will be used to order rigid directional tetrahedral building units and organic linkers with commensurate geometries into expanded zeolite-like metal-organic frameworks (ZMOFs) possessing large cavities. The proposed porous ZMOFs are typically anionic with ion exchange capacity, a property formally only seen in inorganic zeolites and rare in conventional MOFs. Their hybrid nature and extra-large cavities suggest they may be useful in applications pertaining to large molecular entities, where purely inorganic zeolites are ineffective. The resulting design principles will pave the way for the incorporation of molecular structure and functionality into extended solid-state materials. The results are anticipated to aid in developing materials with additional functions such as chiral separation, separation of large molecules, selective catalysis, and host-guest chemistry.  The work will serve as a medium to train students in cutting-edge solid-state materials synthesis and characterization techniques. Furthermore, Research Experience for Teachers and Academic Research Experience for Undergraduates programs have been initiated and will broaden the impact of the proposed work. The scope of the work will aid in educational outreach toward a diverse group of undergraduate students and pre-college teachers in order to promote advanced education, increase research awareness and achieve broad societal impacts.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION\r\n\r\nTechnological advances in areas such as environmental technologies, super-catalysts, chiral separations, and gas storage depend primarily on the discovery of novel materials, as well as the enhancement of existing materials. There is a mounting consciousness and pressing need to develop logical strategies toward design and synthesis of materials with specific and tunable functions. The ability to construct solid-state materials from molecular building blocks (MBBs) offers great potential toward this objective. This project investigates novel strategies for the design and synthesis of rigid porous materials having large and tunable cavities, from MBBs, their evaluation for potential applications, and their integration into educational outreach. Rational assembly and preparation of porous materials with accessible large cavities that are readily functionalized is of exceptional scientific and technological interest, and offers great potential for innovative applications pertaining to large molecules, nanotechnology, optics, sensors, medicine, etc. The PI will participate in Research Experience for Teachers to help bridge pre-college schools and universities by involving teachers in knowledge transfer from the university to local middle/high schools, and has initiate Academic Research Experience for Undergraduates to encourage undergraduates to pursue graduate studies by engaging them in research experiences at the early stages of their academic careers. Students involved in this interdisciplinary project will be trained in a variety of advanced techniques in materials synthesis and characterization preparing them for industrial and academic careers. \r\n\r\n",
