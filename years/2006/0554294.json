 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL: The grant will partially support the Fifth International Conference on Processing and Manufacturing of Advanced Materials (Thermec'2006). The conference schedule is July 4-8, 2006, and the conference venue is Vancouver, Canada. The primary focus of Thermec'2006 is on the processing and manufacturing of advanced materials, primarily for metals. The conference will focus on the emerging trends in processing and properties of metals for structural and adaptive applications. NON-TECHNICAL: Four of the earlier conferences were held in Japan, Australia, US, and Spain in 1988, 1997 and 2000, and 2003, respectively. Cutting-edge research is being carried out in academic, government, and industrial laboratories throughout North America; hence the choice of Vancouver as the conference venue for Thermec'2006. Funds for the conference are being raised mainly through registration fees (primary source), in addition to government and industrial support. The requested NSF funds will be used to support graduate students' participation and faculty in the US at the early stages of their professional career. Vancouver being an expensive city, the travel cost and registration fee would otherwise make student's participation quite difficult financially. This NSF support would enhance their chance to attend Thermec'2006 to make scientific presentations.\r\n",
