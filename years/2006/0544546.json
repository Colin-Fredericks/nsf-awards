 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry and Molecular and Cell Biology Biochemistry programs supports work by Professor Chuan He at the University of Chicago to study the selective recognition and regulation of lead(II) ions in Ralstonia metallidurans CH34.  This microbe possesses the only known lead-specific resistance pathway in nature.  This unique pathway appears to be regulated by three PbrR proteins, which were identified by the PI's research group.  These proteins, which are members of the MerR family metalloregulatory proteins, bind lead(II) ion almost 1000-fold more selectively than other metal ions and are among the most selective lead(II)-binding molecules known.  The lead(II)-specific recognition by the PbrRs activate the defensive system against toxic levels of lead in R. metallidurans.  \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this research are to reveal the underlying mechanism for the high selectivity exhibited by the PbrR proteins towards lead(II) ion and to understand the lead(II)-specific resistance pathway in R. metallidurans.  The fundamental knowledge acquired during the course of the research will provide guidance to design selective lead(II) chelators or probes.  Research will be integrated with education at different levels; graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students will be involved in the interdisciplinary research training.  The program will be presented through various outreach efforts organized by the PI and the University of Chicago.",
