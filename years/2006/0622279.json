CODATA is concerned with all types of quantitative data resulting from experimental measurements or observations in the natural and social sciences and in the engineering disciplines.  \r\n\r\nThe overall objectives of CODATA are to: improve the quality and accessibility of data, as well as the methods by which data are acquired, managed, and analyzed; facilitate international cooperation among those collecting, organizing, and using data; and promote an increased awareness in the scientific and technical community of the importance of these activities and issues. \r\n\r\nThe USNC/CODATA proposes to continue to advance these data management and policy objectives by organizing in-depth studies, national and international data conferences, bilateral symposia, federal data forums, Committee meetings at the National Academies, and related Web sites.\r\n\r\nThe USNC will also identify and suggest ways in which the rapidly changing technological capabilities for creating, manipulating, disseminating, and using digital scientific and technical (S&T) data can address new opportunities and challenges. The opportunities arise primarily in data-intensive research and applications, in the integration of heterogeneous data for new results, and in making vast amounts of factual information available for a broad spectrum of users. The inherent challenges are in effectively managing these data resources for optimal access and use, and for developing the appropriate policies and institutional models.\r\n\r\nThe Committee will: coordinate its activities within the National Academies with other data and information technology groups; build on its established relationships with federal and academic data centers, and professional organizations and experts in the United States; and promote U.S. data policies and practices internationally through its many contacts with foreign and intergovernmental scientific umbrella organizations and data activities.\r\n\r\n",
