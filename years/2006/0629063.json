 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Clubhouse Network, based at the Museum of Science in Boston, has developed a successful model for engaging youth ages 10-18 in technology-related activities.  This planning grant will build on the best practices acquired over the 12-year history of the Computer Clubhouse and identify materials and resources to support professionals at community sites and after school centers with similar goals.  The planning activities will inform the creation of professional development workshops and resources to improve the quality of technology programs for youth.  Project partners include the MIT Media Lab; Fairfax County Department of Community and Recreation Services (Fairfax, VA); Westside Youth Technology Entrepreneur Center (Chicago, IL); Little Haiti Housing Association (Miami, FL); and Youth Opportunities Unlimited (Los Angeles, CA).  The project deliverables include an analysis of existing programs; a staff needs assessment; examination of effective professional development strategies, pilot workshops and online resources, and a matrix to measure program effectiveness.  Strategic impact will be realized through the design of resources that support content-rich programs and improve sustainability in community technology programs nationwide.\r\n\r\n",
