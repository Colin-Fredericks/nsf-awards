 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop an efficient, accurate, and low-cost laser direct-write process for fabricating a sub-micron dent array on precision components to enhance fatigue performance. A synergistic experimental, theoretical, and computational study will be conducted. The research approach is to develop a massively parallel laser direct-write process for fabricating a sub-micron dent array on precision surfaces, and create a finite element analysis model to capture mechanical behaviors at pertinent small scales to understand the mechanisms of laser/material interactions and predict dent geometry, transient and residual stress, and surface material properties. Surface integrity will be comprehensively characterized, including surface finish, dent geometry, residual stress, micro/nano hardness and modulus, and microstructures. Rolling contact fatigue tests at both lab and production scales will be conducted to determine the effects of a sub-micron dent array on component fatigue life. Finally, a physics-based finite element simulation model of rolling contact will be developed to elucidate fatigue damage mechanisms in the presence of a sub-micron dent array.\r\n\r\nThis project will create a new knowledge base of laser processing for manufacturing precision components. The broad impact includes an efficient and cost-effective surface treatment process for making micro surface structures with high efficiency, high accuracy, and low cost to meet production needs. The research supports the economy by improving the U.S. position in the manufacturing industry. This collaborative research will enrich the education infrastructure, promote facility sharing, disseminate research results, and enhance collaboration and technology transfer between researchers and educators at academia and industry. In addition, this research fosters ongoing outreach activities, including Shelton State University and Stillman Community College in Tuscaloosa, Alabama and Austin Community College in Austin, Texas, to undergraduates from groups that are underrepresented in science and engineering.\r\n",
