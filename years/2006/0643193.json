 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe primary research emphasis in this proposal is the development of novel microcoil sensors for measurement of moisture in Natural Gas. The sensors developed in this proposal can be extended to other targets by interchanging molecular receptors or coatings. An important component of basic research aimed at developing sensors and sensor system is the rapid assimilation of novel concepts into the commercial sector.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: This project is to develop an innovative microsensor for measurement of moisture level in Natural Gas. This will provide a sensor platform with a rapid dynamic response time, better sensitivity, and integration of micromechanical components with on-chip electronic circuitry. In this proposal, it is proposed to validate the high stability and sensitivity of a microcoil based sensing device for measurement of moisture in Natural Gas and to optimize the dimensions to obtain the best sensing performance of microcoil sensors. The significance of work ranges from fundamental research to practical applications. The fundamental studies in this work could be used for developing microsensors for many chemical and biological species by exchanging the coatings or molecular receptors. The general concept and methods developed here will have applications for clinical, food safety, industry, and homeland security.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project will provide excellent practical training for the graduate students in an industrial environment that is a significant component of a graduate education. The undergraduate students will be able to effectively contribute to the research project since they will have the guidance and assistance of other team members. Women make up about 51% of the enrollment at LA Tech. LA Tech also maintains close ties with the neighboring Grambling State University, a well-known HBCU institution. The project is expected to have a broad and lasting impact on the education and training of the next generation of scientist and engineers, and in increasing the number of under-represented minorities and women in the science and technology. The academic/industrial collaboration between Louisiana Tech and Sensidyne is central to both the scientific and educational components of this research.\r\n\r\n",
