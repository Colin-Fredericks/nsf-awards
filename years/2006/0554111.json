 "awd_abstract_narration": "0554111\r\nHill  \r\nThis is an International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) award to US PI Frank Hill and co-PI John Leibacher, National Solar Observatory (NSO), Tucson.  It will enable 12 graduate/undergraduate students from the U.S. to conduct experimental and theoretical research on topics in astronomy, solar physics, and helioseismology at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bangalore.  During successive summers, students will work for 8 weeks on a selected research projects mentored by IIA faculty.  This will strengthen practical skills in theory, data analysis, computer programming, numerical modeling, laboratory techniques and communications.  Astronomy, solar physics and helioseismology are fields that have broad influence on physics, technology, and society and can lead to greater understanding of the universe as well as the effects of climate and space-weather on technology.  \r\n\r\nIndia has several world-class astronomy research centers other than the IIA, namely the Udaipur Solar Observatory, the Inter-University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics, and the Raman Research Institute.  These facilities and the IIA observatories located in close proximity to Bangalore will be available to IRES students.  The NSO has numerous established collaborations with IIA staff and a great deal of experience in developing educational outreach programs for various student target groups.  For the US students, this is a unique opportunity to develop skills for contemporary research and gain exposure to Indian scientists and to its tradition of scientific achievement in mathematics, physics, and astronomy.  Expected too are new opportunities for professional growth resulting from international cooperative research training, networking and mentoring.  The Division of Astronomical Sciences is cofunding this award with the Office of International Science and Engineering.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
