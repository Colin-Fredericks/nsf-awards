 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lakota, one language of the people often called Sioux, is now endangered. Only about 14% of the Sioux population now speak Lakota, and the average age of Lakota speakers is about 65. Although there is considerable print documentation of the language, no archive of conversational data exists. This project will record, annotate, and archive for electronic access videos of Lakota conversations. Two or three native speakers will be trained to become ethnographers and linguists, who, as cultural insiders, will have access to natural conversation in settings where speakers interact in unselfconscious ways. In addition, as trained researchers, they will provide professional quality data for research. The results of this research and training will contribute substantially to revitalization efforts. Language revitalization programs depend crucially on the existence of materials that document the language in everyday interactions and on there being dedicated and capable leaders who can inspire the community to use these materials.  By training native speakers to be researchers, this project will prepare highly qualified people to undertake these leadership roles.",
