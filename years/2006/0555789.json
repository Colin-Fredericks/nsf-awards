 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\n\r\n  The main goal of the project is to find the conditions on an\r\nalgebraic variety that guarantee good estimates for analytic functions\r\non the variety in terms of their values at real points.  Particularly,\r\nit is concerned with estimates analogous to those of the\r\nPhragmen-Lindelof theorem which gives uniform upper bounds for\r\npluri-subharmonic functions that are bounded above at the real points\r\nof the complex Euclidean space and satisfy an asymptotic linear growth\r\nrate.  A new geometric condition, that the variety is nearly\r\nhyperbolic, is proposed to characterize such properties.  The new\r\ncondition gives a precise sense in which the variety has many real\r\npoints, and is intermediate in strength between having a full\r\ndimensional set of real points and admitting a projection map with\r\nreal fibers over real points.\r\n\r\n     The project aims to determine the geometric properties of\r\nalgebraic and analytic varieties in Euclidean space that determine\r\nwhen the analytic functions on the variety have properties similar to\r\nthose of entire functions on Euclidean space.  It is motivated by\r\nconnections with the properties of solution operators for systems of\r\nconstant coefficient partial differential operators and convolution\r\noperators on global smooth functions.  The goal is to give algorithms\r\nfor deciding whether or not specific operators admit solutions and\r\nsolution operators on spaces of infinitely differentiable functions\r\nand distributions.  The study uses methods from and contributes new\r\nresults to pluri-potential theory, the area whose relationship to\r\nanalytic functions of several complex variables is the analogue of the\r\nrelationship of classical potential theory to the theory of analytic\r\nfunctions of one complex variable.\r\n\r\n",
