The facility is used for elemental analysis by a wide variety of academic and government scientists, many of whom are engaged in time-sensitive projects, and lack reasonable analytical alternatives.  The USM facility is used particularly for low-level analysis of trace elements in natural waters.  It suffered from possible water damage and power problems in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, for which funds are provided here for repair.  Support is also recommended for a power conditioner to prevent further damage from unstable power in the region, particularly as repair and rebuilding of hurricane-damaged buildings and infrastructure continues.  Repairs will allow continuation of analysis of the existing backlog of samples, as well as analysis of samples related to impacts of Hurricane Katrina being collected under NSF and other agency support.  \r\n   Broader Impacts:  Support provided here will enable research on impacts of Hurricane Katrina, especially on natural waters.  It will support graduate student research projects, as well as ongoing national and international collaborations between the PI and colleagues around the US and in China.\r\n***\r\n",
