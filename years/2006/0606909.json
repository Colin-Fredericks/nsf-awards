We propose to build the cyberinfrastructure necessary for defining and accessing the plant gene space. Our PlantGDB resource (www.plantgdb.org) will serve as a portal to plant genomic sequence data. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from all species will be presented in a uniform format and will undergo a standard procedure for clustering, assembly, and tentative annotation. The resulting putative unique transcripts (PUTs) will be mapped to their native and closely related genomes using specifically trained tools for spliced alignment. Predicted gene structures will be viewable on dedicated Web-based genome browsers, which also provide the opportunity for users to refine existing and contribute novel gene structure annotations. Confirmed gene structure\r\nannotations will be the data source for detailed studies of transcriptional regulation, including alternative splicing and the interplay of multiple types of mRNA processing. These data will also enable detection, display, and analysis of synteny among plant genomes. Through novel Web-interfaces, users will have a large range of query options to the underlying relational database. The PlantGDB-associated BioExtract Server (www.bioextract.org) tool provides simultaneous access to other remote data sets and capabilities to analyze selected data sets in user-defined workflows. Extensive development of Web services will integrate PlantGDB as a node in the emerging network of plant databases and resources.\r\n\r\nThe PlantGDB resource is widely used and would continue to provide valuable data and analysis capabilities to the plant research community. A number of collaborative projects rely on PlantGDB for large-scale analyses and display of their data. PlantGDB hosts the Plant Genome Research Outreach Portal (PGROP, www.plantgdb.org/PGROP), a Web site providing access to a large number of resources and successful outreach programs. We plan to work with outreach coordinators from our campuses and nationwide to increase content and visibility of PGROP. We will also be working with colleagues in community and tribal colleges in South Dakota with the goal of increasing participation of their communities in plant genome research and building a bridge between plant genomics and ethobotany.\r\n\r\nAccess to project outcomes:  The primary web sites for this project are www.plantgdb.org and  www.plantgdb.org/PGROP.\r\n",
