 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inverse problems like parameter estimation, data assimilation, and optimal\r\ncontrol for large scale systems governed by partial differential equations\r\n(PDEs) are of considerable importance in many fields including atmospheric\r\nscience and oceanography, optimal flow control, and homeland security.\r\nState-of-the-art solvers for large scale PDEs adaptively refine the time\r\nstep and the mesh, and adjust the computational pattern in order  to\r\ncontrol the numerical errors and to preserve the qualitative features of\r\nthe solution. In contrast, most inverse problems to date have been solved\r\nusing non-adaptive methods due to the considerable challenges associated \r\nwith obtaining gradients for adaptive simulations. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to advance the fundamental algorithms needed\r\nfor solving inverse problems in the context of adaptive models. The\r\nintellectual merit of this work is substantiated by the following research\r\nelements: \r\n(1) understand the discrete adjoints for methods that use adaptive mesh\r\n    refinement, adaptive time stepping, and adaptive computational patterns\r\n    (e.g., upwinding or flux limiting);\r\n(2) develop techniques to minimize the inconsistencies between the\r\n    discrete adjoint scheme and the (continuous) adjoint PDE;\r\n(3) develop apriori adjoint error estimates;\r\n(4) assess the impact of different adjoint approaches on the performance of\r\n    several numerical optimization schemes; and\r\n(5) apply the new algorithms to real data assimilation problems in\r\n    oceanography.\r\nThe general algorithms and methodologies for solving inverse problems with\r\nadaptive forward models are expected to have a broad impact on many fields\r\nincluding atmospheric sciences, oceanography, environmental sciences,\r\noptimal control of flows, structural mechanics, homeland security, etc.  \r\n",
