The students will receive partial travel support to offset hotel, transportation, registration and some meal related expenses. No indirect charges will be included.\r\n                          \r\nStudents attending this conference will gain insight into current research that is being conducted in climate studies as well as in other topical areas being covered at the 86th Annual Meeting and how they may be able to utilize their education to make further advancements in these fields.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts.\t The conference will not only focus on the scientific aspects of climate variability and change, but also the impact that these areas have on human health.  Students will benefit from learning how their future research will impact mankind.\r\n",
