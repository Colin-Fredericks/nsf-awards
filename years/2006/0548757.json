 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project targets development of an innovative membrane for separation of hydrogen.  These membranes are based on an innovative nanostructured architecture and a unique fabrication process.  The proposed approach enable an ultra-thin Pd separation layer, which can support a 10X or greater increase in hydrogen flux over the state of the art, with no reduction in hydrogen selectivity and superior reliability.  The performance of the prototypes will be thoroughly validated in actual operating environments. \r\n\r\nThe expected result of the proposed work is a viable technology for the production of robust hydrogen separation membranes with advanced performance, superior reliability and lower cost. Such an enabling technology could facilitate a variety of current applications, such as hydrogen separation for fuel cells and point-of-use hydrogen purification. With further research and development, hydrogen could also serve as an alternative source of energy for heating and lighting homes, generating electricity, and transportation. \r\n",
