The proposal also addresses the creation of fake fingerprints to make hosts run on OSes with services that are not attractive targets for malware.   Deterrence is another closely related technique that will be explored, for example in the form of resource restriction and counter-characterization to make what should be attractive targets uninteresting to worms.  The work will focus on polymorphic and evasive worms, the kind that are likely to appear soon.\r\n\r\nThe key idea is to trick those evasive worms into thinking they are being actively checked by detection algorithms they want to avoid. By deliberating imitating the environments that stealthy worms want to evade, the proposed worm defense system will prevent many stealthy worms from infecting important hosts.\r\n\r\nThis is the first work aimed at exploiting the evasive nature of stealthy worms so that such worms will neutralize themselves.  \r\n",
