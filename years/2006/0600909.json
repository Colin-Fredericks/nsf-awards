 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research program centers around topological questions in algebraic\r\ngeometry and representation theory. The focus is on the categorical\r\nstructure of sheaves on singular algebraic varieties. Particular emphasis\r\nis placed on loop spaces and other varieties arising in the geometric\r\nLanglands program. Several directions of study are considered.\r\nThe first project applies ideas from the geometric Langlands program to\r\nthe representation theory of real groups. It develops a geometric form of\r\nharmonic analysis for moduli spaces of real bundles on a Riemann surface.\r\nThe main goal is to further open the representation theory of real groups\r\nto the powerful tools of algebraic geometry. The second project seeks to\r\nextend the representation theory of loop groups to noncompact groups.\r\nPotential applications include the geometric quantization of spaces of\r\nflat connections on Riemann surfaces, and the resulting construction of\r\nnew topological 2+1 dimensional quantum field theories. The third\r\nproject aims to develop an ``elementary\" microlocal theory of perverse\r\nsheaves. As a first step in this direction, it seeks an obstruction theory\r\nfor local systems on the complement of a singular divisor.\r\n\r\nRepresentation theory is the mathematical study of symmetry. Some of the\r\nmost important phenomena involve places where there is a breakdown of\r\nsymmetry. For example, many surprising combinatorial formulas result from\r\nwriting a highly symmetric quantity in terms of contributions from\r\nasymmetric pieces. In geometric representation theory, one of the primary\r\ntools to measure the breakdown of symmetry is the theory of perverse\r\nsheaves. These are complicated objects which detect dynamic aspects of\r\nsingularities, the locus where symmetry breaks down. The research program\r\ndescribed here aims to understand perverse sheaves and their role in\r\nrepresentation theory. It seeks to apply perverse sheaves to forms of\r\nsymmetry which arise in physics. In particular, it aims to develop a\r\ngeometric version of harmonic analysis and representation theory for\r\nsymmetries involving loops on a space. The project also seeks elementary\r\nways to think about perverse sheaves from a dynamic perspective.\r\n",
