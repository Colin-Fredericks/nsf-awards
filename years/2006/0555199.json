 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on the testing of basic symmetries,\r\nand determination of fundamental constants, of the standard model.\r\nThe proposed research involves the muLan/muCap experiments at\r\nthe Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland, and expt. 869 at the\r\nTRIUMF facility, Canada. The experiments will determine the Fermi\r\nconstant of the electroweak interaction to part-per-million\r\naccuracy, the induced pseudoscalar coupling constant of the\r\nproton's weak interaction to six percent accuracy, and test isospin\r\nsymmetry in pion-nucleon interactions to high precision. Both the\r\nmuLan experiment and the muCap experiment at PSI involve high\r\nprecision measurements of positive/negative muon lifetimes and\r\nutilize new technologies including an intense pulsed muon beam,\r\nnovel detectors, and high-speed electronics and data acquisition.\r\nExpt. 869 utilizes a reconfigured RMC spectrometer as a pi0\r\nspectrometer for the investigation of the elementary interaction\r\nbetween pions and nucleons. Both muCap and expt 869 will address\r\nthe realization of two important symmetries of quantum chromodynamics\r\n-- chiral symmetry and  isospin symmetry -- in low energy interactions\r\nof protons and neutrons. The determination of the Fermi constant\r\nby the muLan experiment will both determine a fundamental parameter\r\nfor all electroweak calculations and facilitate the precision testing\r\nof the standard model.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project includes several areas for broader impact. The PI will\r\ncontinue his involvement of physics majors, computer science graduate\r\nstudents and physics graduate students  in both the experimental program\r\nand the related development of high-speed electronics and data\r\nacquisition. The PI will  also continue his efforts in the teaching of\r\nsymmetry principles  and conservation laws in classes for physics\r\nand engineering majors. Moreover, the measurements themselves are\r\nof textbook  quantities (e.g. the Fermi constant and the muon magnetic\r\nmoment) and have broad impact in their own right.\r\n",
