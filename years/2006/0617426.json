 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI), jointly supported by the NSF and Department of Energy (DOE), will take place in Renaca, Chile in January of 2007, on the topic of materials for micro- and nanoelectronics.  Organized by Dr. Torgny Gustafsson of Rutgers University, the institute will involve approximately 35 participants from the United States and Latin America including graduate students and junior and established investigators, and about 15 instructors (internationally recognized scientists, active in the field, selected from six different countries in the Americas).   The activities will consist of a combination of tutorial lectures, advanced-topic presentations, round table discussions, and poster sessions, with the goal of providing the participants with an up-to-date review of this field of research.  The development of an ability to design and control materials at the atomic level is one of the main factors that will determine the future of electronic devices.  The goal of this institute is to present to a group of young scientists the very recent developments in this rapidly changing area of micro- and nanoelectronics. \r\n\r\nThe wide range of applications and materials will impart a significant interdisciplinary nature to the Institute, and should foster the cross-fertilization of new ideas to advance the field and, ultimately, increase relations between Latin American junior and senior investigators and their counterparts in the U.S.  Materials presented at the Institute will be published on a CD-ROM and its availability will be posted in a designated web site for further dissemination to the scientific community and the public at large. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
