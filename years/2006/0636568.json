 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute for Mathematics at North Carolina State University (I'm at State) will support U.S. students through their transition to graduate school in mathematics.  Its goals are to increase the number of students going to graduate school and to improve the retention of graduate students in the first two years.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe programs are designed to engage students in research early and to encourage them to continue in mathematics.  Research for Early Graduate Students (REG) is designed to sustain the enthusiasm for collaborative original research that attracts students to Ph.D. programs, by providing students with research experiences during the early years of graduate work.  Research and enrichment experience for undergraduate students belonging to groups under-represented in mathematics (REU+) is designed to provide a supportive REU experience for students who may not usually consider an REU program.  An important feature is the participation in the Institute of accomplished mentors of students from under-represented groups.  These programs will develop the students' sense of belonging and enthusiasm as undergraduates and reinforce it through the early graduate school years.\r\n \r\n",
