 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis award supports the Georgia State University's Center for High Angular Resolution\r\nAstronomy (CHARA). The CHARA Array consists of six 1-m aperture telescopes\r\noperating in the optical/near infrared and arranged in a Y configuration which provides\r\n15 baselines from 33 to 331 meters in length. In terms of the number and aperture size of\r\nits telescopes and the length of its baselines, the CHARA Array is among the most\r\npowerful facilities of its type in the world.\r\n\r\nBuilt with funds provided by Georgia State University (GSU), the NSF, the W.M. Keck\r\nFoundation, and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the CHARA Array has\r\nundertaken several extensive observational programs with a broad impact on stellar\r\nastrophysics. These include measuring the oblateness and other physical parameters\r\n(including gravity darkening) for the rapidly rotating stars Regulus, Alderamin, and\r\nVega; checking the Baade-Wesselink method for calibrating the Cepheid periodluminosity\r\nrelation; detecting the circumstellar envelopes of Delta Cephei and Polaris\r\n(two Cepheid variables) and showing that emission from these envelopes must be\r\nmodeled to avoid biases in the Baade-Wesselink method; discovering that solar\r\nmetallicity M dwarfs are larger than similar mass but lower metallicity M dwarfs which\r\nimplies an additional opacity source not included in current models; and measuring the\r\nangular separation between the components of the binary star 12 Persei to an accuracy of\r\n0.05% their separation thereby improving the accuracy of their derived masses.\r\n\r\nDuring the award period, several science programs will be carried out which continue to\r\ncapitalize on CHARA's unique capabilities. These include the measurement of stellar\r\nangular diameters of brighter stars to better than 1% accuracy. This will allow the critical\r\ntesting of stellar atmosphere codes (including effective temperatures and brightness\r\nprofiles) at temperatures from M to B. Evolved stars will be included as well to\r\ncharacterize the scale heights of their atmospheres. Pulsations of more Cepheid variables\r\nwill be measured to further calibrate the Baade-Wesselink method. The properties of\r\ndisks surrounding Be stars will also be characterized. With regard to binaries, CHARA's\r\nhigh angular resolution will be used to resolve spectroscopic binaries, which will in turn\r\nallow high quality measurements of stellar mass, luminosity, and radius for stars across\r\nthe Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram. Known extrasolar planetary systems will also be\r\ninspected to ensure face-on binaries are not contaminating the samples.\r\n\r\nThe training of the next generation of scientific and technical experts in interferometry\r\nwill also continue. CHARA is enhancing scientific awareness through the incorporation\r\nof its results into the large undergraduate courses taught at Georgia State. Thousands of\r\npublic visitors to Mt. Wilson will also have the opportunity to interactively learn the\r\nprinciples of interferometry through a display at the CHARA Exhibit Hall on Mt. Wilson\r\n(which also houses the 20-foot Michelson Stellar Interferometer used at the 100-inch\r\ntelescope).",
