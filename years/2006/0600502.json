 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary theme  of this project is to study the interplay between \r\ntopology, geometry and combinatorics.   Four areas  will receive \r\nspecial emphasis:  triangulations  of compact manifolds, Cohen-Macaulay \r\ncomplexes,  finite linear quotients of spheres, and matroids. It has \r\nbeen over 100 years since the introduction of the Euler-Poincare \r\nformula, yet the combinatorial properties of triangulations of compact \r\nmanifolds remain largely unknown.  Indeed, a complete characterization \r\nof all possible f-vectors (which record the number of faces in each \r\ndimension) is not known for any manifold of dimension five or more.   \r\nThe possible f-vectors of Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complexes have been \r\nknown since the foundational work of Hochster, Reisner and Stanley in \r\nthe 1970's.  However, the classification of face counts for important \r\nsubclasses, such as spheres and doubly Cohen-Macaulay complexes, \r\nremains a fundamental open problem in algebraic and topological \r\ncombinatorics.   Even though the representation theory of finite groups \r\nis an extremely well developed subject, tools for computing many \r\ntopological invariants, such as Betti numbers, for the corresponding \r\nspherical quotients are practically nonexistent.  Matroids are a \r\ncombinatorial abstraction of linear independence which can be modeled \r\nthrough a variety of topological spaces.  Their enumerative properties \r\nhave    many applications including coloring and flows on graphs, \r\nnetwork reliability, and the topology of hyperplane arrangements\r\n\r\nTwo recurrent and complementary ideas in mathematics are the \r\napproximation of continuous phenomena using discrete data, and modeling \r\nthe latter with smooth objects, such as spheres or polyhedra.  The \r\nguiding principle of this project is that the combination of these two \r\ntechniques  is a powerful method of approaching both situations.\r\nFor instance, compact manifolds, which are frequently presented as \r\nsolutions to nonsingular polynomial equations in several variables, can \r\nalso be examined by using simplicial complexes which are easier to \r\nencode into a computer.  In turn, this allows a deeper study of the \r\nshape and geometry of the original space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
