 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Symposium on Plasmid Biology will be held at Fallen Leaf Lake, South Lake Tahoe, CA, September 23-27, 2006.  Information is available at http://conferences.ucdavis.edu/plasmidbiology . The goals of this international gathering are to bring together scientists working in all the areas of plasmid biology to discuss the latest progress and advances in the field.  Plasmids represent a unique group of genetic elements found in lower and higher organisms that provide the major source of genetic diversity through horizontal gene transfer.  Plasmids are responsible for the spread of a variety of genes in nature, including those encoding antibiotic resistance and those involved in secondary metabolism and bacterial pathogenicity.  Since many plasmids are conjugative or mobilizable, they contribute to the evolution of organisms that are resistant to a number of antibiotics, produce toxins or have increased virulence.  Plasmids also serve as models for basic biological studies such as replication, genome segregation, gene expression, and recombination, to name a few.  Plasmids are also important tools in industries related to biotechnology, agriculture, medicine/genomics and the environment.  Vigorous studies on plasmid biology are necessary for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in their persistence and spread in nature and how they take part in evolution.  This international conference represents a continuation of the bi-annual symposia held to discuss the highlights of major advances in this field.  The meeting will include a discussion of all aspects of plasmid biology such as their replication and maintenance, transfer, their role as a source of horizontal gene pool, including antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, involvement in bacterial pathogenicity, evolution, ecology and biotechnology.  Approximately 200 participants that include members of minority groups are anticipated. This meeting serves the international plasmid biology community and provides an excellent forum for exchange of ideas that are critical for the continued advances in the field.  Participants in the past meetings have included leaders in the field as well as younger scientists, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and under-represented students.  The meeting will include invited speakers as well as speakers selected on the basis of submitted abstracts. The abstracts from the meeting will be published in the journal Plasmid.",
