 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe University of North Carolina will implement a comprehensive, year-round project focusing on physics and astronomy for youth in grades 6-8.  Project partners include the North Carolina Mathematics and Science Education Network (NC-MSEN), Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute (PARI), North Carolina Technology Association Education Foundation, Tyco Electronics, IBM Center for Advanced Studies, the North Carolina Museum Collaborative, and the following seven school districts:  Charlotte-Mecklenburg, Cumberland, Forsyth, Guilford, Orange, Pasquotank, and Wake. Participants will have electronic access to a 4.6 meter remote controlled radio telescope, robotic telescopes, and optical solar telescopes as they are immersed in robotics, physics, and engineering design. Students will receive 200 hours of contact time as they participate in after school e-mentoring sessions, Saturday academies, and a 15-day intensive summer program. E-mentors from the professional and educational community provide support for students as they advance through middle school and make the critical transition to high school. Students also participate in job shadowing, college tours, career counseling, robotics design competitions, seminars, and conferences.  Teachers from participating districts receive professional development to enhance their knowledge of science content and engaging pedagogical practices and are also certified to use the radio telescope.  Parents participate in workshops designed to provide information on careers in physics and astronomy. This comprehensive project will provide exciting science and technology experiences aligned with the school curriculum for 210 urban, rural, and suburban youth.\r\n",
