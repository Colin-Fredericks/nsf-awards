 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for the Space and Atmospheric Sciences (SAS) component of the cooperative agreement for the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC).  NAIC operates the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.  The observatory is used for both radio astronomy and space science research.  The SAS group uses the 305 meter telescope as an incoherent scatter radar to measure with extremely high accuracy the basic properties of the ionosphere, including electron density and temperature, ion temperature, and plasma drift velocity.  The research program within SAS is based on individually proposed observations and World Day experiments scheduled and coordinated by the International Radio Science Union.  The SAS staff will participate in experimental campaigns of upper atmospheric observations carried out in coordination with other NSF-supported upper atmospheric facilities.  With its unrivaled sensitivity, the Arecibo Radar can probe the atmosphere from 80 km to several thousand km altitude.  Research focuses on how atmospheric regions are vertically coupled and influenced by space weather related ionospheric disturbances.  The Observatory has an active visiting scientist program that enables other researchers, including students and young scientists, to stay at the site for extended periods of time, conduct experiments, and participate in on-going studies.",
