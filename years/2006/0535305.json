The workshop is a\r\ncomponent of the special trimester research program there on\r\n\"Phenomena in Large Dimensions\" and concerns properties of\r\nfamilies of finite-dimensional objects as the dimension grows\r\nwithout bound.  Particular topics that fit this agenda are\r\nmeasure transport techniques, concentration of measure,\r\nquantitative measures of convex bodies, isoperimetric\r\ninequalities, and large deviation inequalities.  Some of the\r\nimportant features emerging in these studies are threshold or\r\nphase transition effects, similar to those seen in statistical\r\nphysics or asymptotic combinatorics, and this work also seems to\r\nhave connections to problems in computational complexity.\r\n\r\nA mathematical description of a scientific or engineering\r\nquestion often requires lots of independent numbers, leading to a\r\ngeometric space of high dimension.  For example, if you want to\r\nspecify the location of one gas molecule in a room then you need\r\nto report the front/back, side-to-side, and up/down locations of\r\nthe molecule, using three numbers. The direction and speed of the\r\nmolecule's motion takes another three numbers, and so to describe\r\nenough of the molecule's current state to allow us to predict its\r\nfuture motion from position and velocity we would need six\r\nseparate numbers in all.  If you want to track 100 distinct\r\nmolecules of the air in the room then you will need 600\r\nindependent numerical coordinates to collect all of the relevant\r\nmeasurements.  As these dimensions increase then the difficulty\r\nof sampling and computation go up rapidly, a phenomenon\r\nscientists and mathematicians sometimes call \"the curse of\r\ndimensionality.\"  However, there are also patterns that emerge as\r\ndimension increases, and this grant for support of US travel to\r\nthe international workshop described above will study some of\r\nthese patterns that are recent discoveries.\r\n",
