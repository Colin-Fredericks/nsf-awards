 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) is designing an undergraduate CSUMS training program that will (1) build on and enhance the existing curriculum combining mathematics and scientific computation and (2) establish significant group research involvement for undergraduates majoring in mathematical sciences.   Specifically, the NJIT program will expose undergraduate mathematical science students to advances in scientific computing by creating new courses in stochastic computation, computing for inverse problems, and computational mathematical finance.   The NJIT CSUMS program will also immerse students in significant group research projects involving state-of-the-art computational algorithms and methodologies, including parallel computing.   Research projects within the NJIT CSUMS program canvass many different areas in the mathematical sciences, including the application of mathematics and scientific computing to the study of fluid flow, optical fiber communications, ecology, algorithms for curve drawing, and finance.  The program takes advantage of the wide range of interests of the DMS faculty and nearby industrial scientists.  An important component of the NJIT CSUMS program is the group focus of the proposed activities, including team projects supervised by multiple faculty, weekly group meetings, and workshops in scientific computation.   The scientific results obtained will be disseminated through publication and presentation at various conferences.  NJIT CSUMS students will be mentored closely by faculty and graduate students and will develop the leadership skills to become mentors of future CSUMS generations themselves.  With expertise in mathematical modeling and scientific computation, CSUMS students will emerge from this program with unique interdisciplinary skills and are expected to become the future leaders in the mathematical sciences both in industry and in the nation's graduate programs.  The benefits of CSUMS will be felt beyond the participants themselves.  New courses integrating mathematics and computation will be developed which will benefit all NJIT students.  The curriculum extensions will offer the diverse NJIT student body opportunities to gain insight into mathematical modeling and scientific computing that will enhance their careers in science and technology.",
