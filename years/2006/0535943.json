 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nChemistry (12)\r\n\r\nRecognizing the intellectual merit of interdisciplinary studies to undergraduate students, the departments of chemistry, environmental engineering, and biology, have joined together to create an interdepartmental collaboration to promote environmental science studies in undergraduate education. New laboratory experiments for chemistry, environmental engineering and biology courses have been developed for measuring environmentally important samples. We are converting the existing instrumental analysis laboratory course into an interdisciplinary, environmentally-themed instrumental analysis course.  To develop more relevant experiments that involve metal analysis (e.g., lead), an instrument with low detection limits for metal content was required.  Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) has gained wide application for environmental analysis because of its versatility in the measurement of trace quantities of most elements in water and soil samples.   Based on this grant, we acquired a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer, which increases the types of environmental analyses that can be carried out and further strengthens the collaboration between faculty in the three departments by providing a common analysis technique that can be applied to a variety of metal-containing samples.  The broader impact of this grant is two-fold.  First, at UDM, faculty members have a significant opportunity to promote STEM education to a diverse student body.  Secondly, the interdisciplinary nature of the program is well-suited for application at community colleges and small universities.  An evaluation process is monitoring success of the proposed interdisciplinary approach used to teach environmental science.  TEST, Incorporated, a program evaluation consulting firm assisted in the preparations for evaluation of this project.   Dissemination is planned through publication of developed laboratory experiments and assessment of the project, as well as presentation at local, regional, and national meetings in all three disciplines participating in this grant.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
