 "awd_abstract_narration": "Models based on partial differential equations are widely used in\r\nscience and engineering, and numerical methods for their solutions are\r\nof central interest. In the last several years, there has been steadily\r\ngrowing interest in two such methods: Generalized Finite Element\r\nMethods and the closely related Meshless Methods. They have become a\r\nfocus of development and application -- especially in the engineering\r\ncommunity. These methods generalize the Finite Element Method, and are\r\nof interest mainly for two reasons: (i) they are not based on a mesh,\r\nor use a mesh only minimally, and hence avoid some of the problems in\r\nmeshing complicated domains; (ii) they permit the use of non-polynomial\r\napproximating functions, and hence are applicable to problems with\r\nspecial features, whose solutions are not accurately approximated by\r\npolynomials. This flexibility has, in the past few years, been effectively\r\nused in handling certain important problems. But a deep and precise\r\ntheoretical understanding of these methods is needed to broaden their \r\napplicability, in particular their efficiency and robustness, to complex \r\nproblems in engineering that otherwise cannot be solved with existing \r\nmethods, for example, the Finite Element Method.\r\n \r\nThis project involves careful and precise mathematical study of various\r\naspects of Generalized Finite Element and Meshless Methods. The broader\r\nimpact of this study will be reflected in the applicability of these\r\nmethods to a wide range of complex problems of technical and societal\r\nimportance; for example, problems with multiple scales. Multiscale\r\nproblems are increasingly important; they include the problems of\r\ncomposite materials and flow through porous media. Finding robust,\r\nefficient, and reliable approaches to solve these problems is one of\r\nthe challenges of modern technology. Another impact of the proposal is\r\nthe training of graduate students in a vital, cutting edge area. Their\r\ninvolvement in this project will not only help them become experts in\r\nthe mathematical underpinning of these important methods, but will also\r\ngive them the rare first-hand experience in working with practical\r\nengineering problems.\r\n",
