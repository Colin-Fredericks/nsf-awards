The topics considered\r\naddress a range of problems in engineering and science using a\r\ncombination of approximate analysis, computation, and experiments. \r\nThe investigator and his colleagues conduct the following projects:\r\n(1) A mathematical analysis of ion beam sputtering, aimed at both\r\nimproving understanding of the surface patterns produced\r\ntechnique (e.g. why do particular morphologies form for given sets \r\nof conditions?) and at understanding whether ion beams can be used \r\nto create and control prespecified surface morphologies;\r\n(2) Studies of the self-assembly of two-dimensional elastic\r\nsheets into three-dimensional structures.  Here there are\r\nimportant issues both with respect to assembly kinetics and in\r\ndetermining the shape of the sheet that leads to the lowest\r\nenergy structure, when folded into a given topology;\r\n(3) An analysis of the shapes of pollen grains, and the\r\nmechanisms through which they dry up; and\r\n(4) A mathematical analysis of droplet impact on a solid substrate \r\n-- in particular, whether or not a droplet produces a splash \r\ndepends on an as yet unknown event that occurs immediately after \r\nthe impact. \r\nThe educational activities center around the general issue of how\r\nthe concepts of applied mathematics should be taught, given the\r\nprevalence of computation.  The two main issues addressed are:\r\nHow can computers be used to increase the mathematical (as opposed \r\nto computational) sophistication of students?  And secondly, how \r\nshould mathematical modeling be taught, in order to clearly \r\ndifferentiate modeling (which produces understanding of a\r\nphenomenon) from computer graphics (which produces a picture\r\nreproducing it)?  The investigator is developing new courses (and\r\nmodifications of old courses) to address these issues. \r\n\r\n     Over the past decade, computers, and computer simulations,\r\nplay an ever increasing role in science and scientific arguments. \r\nIt is clear this trend will continue.  On the other hand, for\r\ncomplicated systems there are serious issues in understanding\r\nwhen to judge whether a computer simulation is correct.  This\r\nproject addresses this general question both in the context of\r\nspecific research projects and also through the development of\r\neducational courses and tools to help students learn how to\r\nanswer this question.  The research projects include analyses of\r\ncomplex, technologically important phenomena for which both\r\ncomputer simulation and mathematical analysis can be combined. \r\nThese project include a study of ion beam sputtering, a complex\r\nprocess that occurs when surfaces are irradiated with high energy\r\nions.  The investigator and his colleagues study this problem\r\nusing both computer simulations and analytic methods, coupled\r\nwith experiments, in an effort to understand whether ion beams\r\ncan create specific, technologically useful, patterns in a\r\nsurface.  Another project studies the self-assembly of elastic\r\nsheets, in an effort to understand whether it is possible to\r\ncreate small objects which self-assemble into useful components\r\nin three dimensions.  A third project studies the process when a\r\ndroplet of liquid splashes on a solid substrate.  Despite the\r\nubiquity of this phenomenon it is not known why a droplet creates\r\na splash.  On the educational front, the project aims to develop\r\nmaterial to teach students both how to carry out computer\r\nsimulations, and equally importantly how to evaluate whether they\r\nare correct.",
