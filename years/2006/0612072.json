 "awd_abstract_narration": "The R/V HUGH R. SHARP is a state-of-the-art, coastal research vessel which is\r\nowned and operated by the University of Delaware. The vessel can carry fourteen to\r\ntwenty scientists on cruises up to eighteen days in duration, and supports projects from all\r\ndisciplines of oceanography. The vessel is a regional asset, serving researchers from\r\nmany institutions throughout the mid-Atlantic. The vessel typically operates in the\r\ncoastal waters from Long Island, New York, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as well as\r\nthe Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. Projects occasionally require the vessel to work as\r\nfar north as the Gulf of Maine, as far south as Florida, and as far offshore as Bermuda.\r\n\r\n In 2006, the R/V SHARP is scheduled for 201 days at sea. The National Science Foundation funded projects account for over 50% of the total days.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The R/V HUGH R. SHARP provides direct field support to NSF\r\nfunded science programs. For example, Bauer (VIMS), will be starting a collaborative research project investigating the impact of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and photooxidation on carbon cycling in estuaries.The intellectual merit of the proposal lies in the funded science program.  This proposal is for support of a research platform.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The science projects supported will directly improve scientific\r\nunderstanding of the marine environment, which may in turn improve the health and well\r\nbeing of people living in the mid-Atlantic and beyond. To provide exposure to this\r\nimportant role, the R/V HUGH R. SHARP is an integral part of the public outreach\r\nprogram at the College of Marine Studies. When not at sea, it will be a focal point on the\r\nwaterfront during Coast Day, an annual open house at the College which draws nearly\r\nten thousand people. \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n",
