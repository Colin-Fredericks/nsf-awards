Jackson, Purdue University\r\n\r\nRice feeds almost half the worlds population on a daily basis and is a model for crop and comparative genomics.  The USA, led by the National Science Foundation, was a leader in the sequencing of the rice genome, completed in 2004.  The rice community is now actively engaged in determining the function of the nearly 50,000 genes in the rice genome and deploying them for crop protection and production.  \r\n \r\nThe Fourth Annual Symposium on Rice Functional Genomics will be held October 9-11, 2006 in Montpellier, France.  Previous meetings have been held in China, the USA and the Philippines.  This meeting facilitates the sharing of current data and methods in comparative and functional genomics of rice, biochemistry, rice genetics and breeding and genetic approaches to rice protection from biotic and abiotic stresses.  The organization committee consists of 25 rice scientists from 17 countries.  This grant will defray costs for nine attendees by targeting developing countries and young researchers and those from under-represented groups.",
