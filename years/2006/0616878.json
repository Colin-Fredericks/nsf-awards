 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Julia Xiaojun Zhao of the University of North Dakota Main Campus is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to conduct research that focuses on the development of nanoparticle-based fluorescence sensors for the analysis of trace targets in cellular samples.  Professor Zhao will fabricate functional nanoparticles, which have silica cores and organic modified surfaces that switch from non-fluorescent to highly fluorescent upon binding to target ions.  The goal of this project is to develop multi-functional nanomaterials that will serve several simultaneous roles in the analysis of trace analytes in complex biological matrices.\r\nThe research program will integrate measurement science with problems that are currently at the frontier of biological research and will serve as an ideal platform for inter-disciplinary education. It will provide an excellent educational opportunity for trainees desiring work at the interface of chemistry and biology. In addition to her research activities Prof. Zhao will also develop and supervise an outreach activity at the University of North Dakota aiming to increase participation of Native Americans in chemical research.\r\n",
