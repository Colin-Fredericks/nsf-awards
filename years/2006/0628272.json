 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Seeds of Science/Roots of Reading:  Developing a New Generation of Research-\r\nbased Elementary Science Instructional Materials\" will develop and test three inquiry-based science units for 3rd-4th grades -- one each in life, earth and physical science.  The Seeds/Roots series is an integrated science-literacy instructional program based on a successful NSF-funded proof-of-concept initiative.  Seeds/Roots builds on revision of units in the Great Explorations in Math and Science (GEMS) Program; but updates and employs a new, multi-modal \"Do it, talk it, read it, write it\" learning model, with literacy used in the service of science inquiry.  The learning model capitalizes on natural synergies between science and literacy to the benefit of both domains, and emphasizes support for English Language Learners.  With other funding sources this proposal will leverage NSF's initial investment in this program and build on its success to enable the commercial launch of the entire grades 2-5 program.  The project will also develop an online guide to the entire series as well as materials for administrators and parents/caregivers.\r\n",
