 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives: The purpose of this research proposal is to test the hypothesis that present day\r\ncomputer-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems can be effective and costefficient\r\nalternatives to human-generated text generation systems or sign language interpreters,\r\nand that the method of displaying the information plays a crucial role in the learning process.\r\nThe Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf\r\n(NTID), one of eight colleges of RIT, together with a consultant from the Georgia Tech Research\r\nInstitute (GTRI), will test this hypothesis.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Working with Deaf and Hard of Hearing (D/HOH) student participants\r\nmainstreamed in baccalaureate programs at RIT, we will test three text-generated systems, and\r\nthree different text presentation systems, under realistic but well-controlled lecture-venue\r\nconditions. We will compare these systems for accuracy in rendering the lecturer's narrative,\r\nevaluate students' comprehension of lecture content, and analyze ease of use and deployment\r\nfrom both the student participants' and the lecturers' points of view.\r\nThe proposed research will be conducted in two stages. In Stage 1, we will evaluate three\r\ndifferent speech to text systems: (1) CART, a word-for-word real-time speech-to-text closed\r\ncaptioning service driven by a steno machine operator; (2) C-Print, a meaning-for-meaning\r\ndisplay and note-taking system driven by a captionist using abbreviation-expanding software;\r\nand (3) ASR speech-to-text transcription driven by the most powerful conversational speechrecognition\r\nsoftware available on personal computers (Dragon Naturally Speaking 8 Preferred).\r\nIn Stage 2, we will use the best text-generation system from Stage 1 to perform display tests\r\ncomparing three different methods of putting text and non-text content into close visual\r\nproximity: (1) a heads up display of the text generated by the text generation system; (2) a PCbased\r\nsystem developed at RIT that allows continuous broadcast of the text stream, a PowerPoint\r\ndisplay, and/or video stream of the lecturer to adjacent panes of conventional web browsers on\r\nthe participant's personal computer; (3) the same composite display projected on a screen.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Deaf and Hard of Hearing (D/HOH) individuals, as well as people with other\r\ndisabilities such as learning disabilities (LD), dyslexia or attention deficit hyperactivity (ADHD),\r\nare often denied full participation in educational, civic, cultural, medical and employment-based\r\nactivities. Some venue operators do provide sign language interpreters, real time display systems\r\nor note-taking systems, but the practice continues to be rare because logistics are challenging and\r\nexpenses are significant. Recent advances in ASR systems have the potential to expand\r\navailability of near-real-time display and/or transcription, and reduce communication and\r\neducational barriers that still distance D/HOH from the rest of society.\r\nOur findings will offer expanded strategic options and data-based guidance to people who\r\nare D/HOH and to providers and administrators of services to D/HOH people. The results from\r\nthis study will also be of great benefit to people who have other disabilities, and for people for\r\nwhom English is a second language.\r\n\r\n",
