 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is establishing a new program, Encouraging Careers in the Mathematical Sciences (ECMS), to support financially needy students pursuing majors and careers in the mathematical sciences. ECMS Scholars are being attracted from traditionally underrepresented groups and from the first St. Olaf family income quartile. Scholars are being recruited from both incoming and matriculated students, and if progress is satisfactory, being supported through graduation.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project builds on three existing St. Olaf resources: (i) a nationally recognized and acclaimed mathematics program; (ii) TRIO Special Students Services (SSS) program; and (iii) the Center for Experiential Learning (CEL). Project features include student-oriented instruction, special support in the transition from basic to higher mathematics, attentive faculty mentoring, expanded use of Supplemental Instruction (SI), and career-related activities led by the CEL.  A steering committee includes mathematics faculty and the directors of financial aid, admissions, the SSS program, and the CEL. The committee is guiding the program, recruiting and selecting ECMS Scholars, and overseeing program activities and mentorship.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Whether students enter the workforce upon graduation or continue to graduate studies, mathematics opens doors to countless career options in an increasingly quantitative world. Over 8% of St. Olaf graduates are mathematics majors, compared to around 1% nationally.\r\n \r\n\r\n",
