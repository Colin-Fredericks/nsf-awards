Tissue engineering presents a promising method for the development of cartilage tissue constructs for replacement or repair of native cartilage damaged by injury or disease. Bioreactors are utilized in this method to provide in vitro environments that mimic the in vivo biochemical and mechanical signals that regulate tissue growth and development. The goal of this project is  to optimize and characterize conditions in a novel, \"wavy walled\" bioreactor designed for cartilage tissue engineering. The long-term goal is to optimize the bioprocessing conditions used in developing engineered cartilage constructs in order to generate improved alternatives for cartilage repair. The hydrodynamic environment, oxygen availability during cultivation, scaffold spatial position within the bioreactor, and the use of growth factors, will be examined and correlated to scaffold tissue growth and development. The educational and outreach components include excellent leadership role of the PI among underrepresented groups and includes various levels, K-12 through faculty level.\r\n",
