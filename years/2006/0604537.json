 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the study of mathematical problems associated with \r\nthe control and analysis of stochastic networks.\r\nExamples of application domains for these stochastic models include \r\nmanufacturing, the service industry, telecommunications,\r\ncomputer systems and biochemical reactions. Some of the problems being \r\nstudied involve the development of general theory for broad classes of \r\nstochastic networks, while others focus on mathematical questions \r\ndirectly motivated by specific applications. The following five topics \r\nare considered:\r\n(i)   dynamic scheduling for stochastic processing networks,\r\n(ii)  analysis of processor sharing networks,\r\n(iii) congestion control for data networks,\r\n(iv)  input-queued switches, and\r\n(v)   biochemical reaction networks.\r\nThe stochastic network models associated with these topics are\r\nconsiderably more general than conventional multiclass queueing\r\nnetworks operating under a head-of-the-line (HL) service discipline.\r\nAlthough there is a fairly well developed theory of stability\r\nand heavy traffic diffusion approximation for the latter,\r\nthere are many challenging open problems associated with\r\nthe control and analysis of more general stochastic networks.\r\nSome stochastic process aspects of this project include the\r\nstudy of singular diffusion control problems, the use of measure-valued \r\nprocesses to keep track of residual job sizes,\r\nfoundational questions for reflected Levy processes,\r\nand the use of an infinite server queue\r\nto model biochemical reactions with non-exponential reaction times.\r\n\r\nThis grant funds research on mathematical problems motivated by\r\napplications in the disciplines of operations research, computer \r\nscience, electrical engineering and biochemistry.\r\nThe specific problems being studied concern the\r\ncontrol and analysis of stochastic networks which are models for\r\ncomplex systems involving dynamic interactions subject to uncertainty.\r\nTwo fundamental problems for such networks are\r\n(a) to understand the behavior of these systems under natural\r\ncontrol policies, and\r\n(b) to design 'good' controllers for these systems.\r\nThe networks under study are substantially more general than\r\nthose that have been rigorously studied to date. Through their\r\ncomplexity and heterogeneity, these networks present challenging\r\nmathematical problems. The project involves the development of new \r\ntheory for stochastic processes and uses techniques from a variety of\r\nmathematical disciplines. Collaborations with researchers familiar with\r\nareas of application, the training of graduate student researchers,\r\nand the dissemination of research results through publication in peer \r\nreviewed journals and presentations at cross-disciplinary research \r\nconferences are integral parts of the project.\r\n",
