 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed project is to build the capacity of Historically Black Colleges and\r\nUniversities (HBCUs) in the teaching and practice of evaluation, with a focus on STEM\r\neducation programs. The goal is to diversify and build leadership in the field, as well as\r\nstrengthen evaluator skills in assessing academic programs focused on STEM with multiethnic\r\nand underrepresented populations. This will be accomplished through three major activities: (1) a\r\nconference of HBCU faculty evaluators and evaluation consultants to assess their current program\r\nevaluation and related research and teaching activities and to identify effective models of\r\nevaluation capacity building and networking, (2) the creation of a communications network and\r\nmechanism for information sharing regarding evaluation instruction and practice among HBCUs\r\nand between HBCUs and other higher education institutions, and (3) a meeting with key leaders\r\nfrom agencies and organizations that promote diversity in evaluation across a variety of\r\neducational levels, disciplines and contexts to share the results of the discussions and networking\r\noutlined above (NSF, AEA, AERA and APA). The project outcome will be the development of\r\nan action plan with recommendations for building evaluation capacity at these institutions and\r\nincreasing minority faculty and students in the evaluation profession.",
