The PI for this project is Thomas Higgins, who will be assisted by Co-PIs Thomas Dowd, Gregory Ference, Yvonne Harris and Roger House. The collaborating partners in this project include: The seven campuses of the City Colleges of Chicago (Harold Washington College is the lead institution); William Rainey Harper College; Oakton Community College; and College of DuPage. Other partners are: Illinois State University, Youngstown State University, Chicago State University, and Hope College. Informal agreements to host summer students and/or build faculty collaborations have been made with DePaul University, Loyola University of Chicago, Northern Illinois University, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Case Western Reserve University. The DuPont-Northwestern-Dow Collaborative Access Team at the Advance Photon Source and the Chemical Engineering Division, both located at Argonne National Laboratory, are also working with the Collaborative. The goals of this project are to: (1) Identify and recruit promising young scientists from two-year colleges (2YCs) into the STEM disciplines, especially, from traditionally under-represented groups; (2) Train 2YC students to become effective practitioners of science; (3) Instill in 2YC students the confidence to pursue science as a profession; (4) Encourage 2YC students to complete their undergraduate and graduate STEM education; and (5) Transform the cultures of participating 2YCs by embedding intensive research experiences during the academic year and summer into their curricula and their courses. These institutions are located in the Chicago-metro area and collectively serve approximately 106,000 undergraduates annually, 42% of whom come from underrepresented groups. In City Colleges of Chicago, 70% of the 50,000 undergraduates are either Black or Hispanic.",
