It is also conducting comprehensive faculty professional development to ensure that teaching meets national standards and students arrive on the job with the skills needed by industry.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Information technology is currently responsible for at least 20,000 jobs in Nevada, and that number is expected to grow by 25% in the next 5 years.  By connecting Nevada's students to this tremendous opportunity, this project is directly increasing the state's workforce through improvement of high school and community college education.  The project is providing the statewide coordination for education systems and businesses which are developing a robust and diverse technological education capacity to ensure the workforce is capable of supporting the state's growing IT industry.\r\n",

Key personnel for the Planning Grant focused on creating a statewide Technology Education Business Alliance (TEBA) comprised of stakeholders from northern and southern Nevada business and industry, secondary and postsecondary educational institutions, economic development organizations, and the Nevada Department of Education (NDE).&nbsp;

&nbsp;This independent SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis report was commissioned by the Nevada Lieutenant Governor, ultimately making recommendations addressing the economic technology growth for Nevada during the next ten to 15 years.&nbsp;
