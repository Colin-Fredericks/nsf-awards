 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project is preparing Pacific Islanders to serve their home islands as informed leaders in natural resource management, protection, and restoration.  The primary focus is curriculum development and professional development of community college faculty.  Project objectives are to (a) provide community colleges with the tools needed to meet research needs, (b) provide students with skills to obtain employment in positions usually filled by non-islanders, (c) encourage students to transfer to four-year university programs, and (d) promote articulation between marine and environmental science programs at the following institutions:  University of Hawaii, University of Guam, Palau Community College, Northern Marianas College, College of the Marshall Islands, College of Micronesia, and American Samoa Community College. \r\n\r\nAnticipated outcomes include the development of courses in marine and environmental  science that are responsive to needs of local agencies, articulated with 4-year colleges, and incorporate training in modern technologies. Foot Locker workshops are being provided that address a range of topics including ocean currents, water quality studies, coral reef management,  molecular tools for pollution studies, and the taxonomy of coral reef organisms.  The project is also developing articulation agreements between participating universities and community colleges; professional development for community college faculty to enhance technical knowledge and research expertise; student research programs with supporting professional opportunities; and outreach to local high schools and community members. The project takes advantage of existing programs and laboratory resources including the NSF-Undergraduate Mentoring in Environmental Biology (UMEB), NSF Field Stations and and Marine Laboratories, Department of the Interior, Marine  Resources Pacific Consortium (MAREPAC), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) -Coral Reef Initiative.  \r\n",
