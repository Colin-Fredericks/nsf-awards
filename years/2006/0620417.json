 "awd_abstract_narration": "Charles Darwin was born in 1809. The bicentenary of his birth will be celebrated at the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge and elsewhere in 2009. I have been invited to spend 2006-2007\r\nat Christ's College, Cambridge (Darwin's alma mater) and at the Sedgwick Museum of\r\nEarth Sciences in Cambridge. My work in Cambridge would be directed towards the\r\nenhancement of scholarly and public understanding of Darwin's contributions to the earth\r\nsciences. The scholarly aspect of my work in 2006-2007 would involve a study of latenineteenth\r\nand twentieth century geology showing how Darwin's work became integrated\r\nwith the work of other researchers. The results of this study would be presented as a\r\npaper to the Darwin 2009\" conference in Cambridge to which I have been invited. To\r\nmake Darwin's geological work more accessible to scholars and to the general public I\r\nwould transcribe Darwin's geological specimen notebooks and arrange for them to be\r\nposted online. With others I would also work to organize an expedition to recreate\r\nDarwin's geological researches in the Galapagos Islands. In addition to these activities I\r\nwould work with others to shape an exhibit on Darwin as a geologist for display at the\r\nSedgwick Museum in 2009. Here I would hope to further cooperation among museums\r\ninternationally in displaying materials relevant to the history of geology, emphasizing the\r\npublic utility of such knowledge. This would include facilitating communication among\r\nhistorians of science, geologists, and museum curators in Cambridge and those in the\r\nUnited States.",
