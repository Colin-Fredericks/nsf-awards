To address this\r\nproblem, this project develops a distributed, federated platform\r\nfor secure, distributed computation over consistent, durable objects.\r\nThe platform is a universal system for managing structured\r\ninformation and securely computing on it, allowing allow very large\r\nnumbers of objects to be linked together on behalf of many mutually\r\ndistrusting users, while giving users control over where objects are\r\nstored. This enables organizations to cooperate in a fine-grained,\r\nlow-cost way, with benefits for many activities including education,\r\nmedicine, business-to-business transactions, corporate and military\r\ninformation systems, and large-scale cooperative information resources.\r\n\r\nThe project goes beyond previous distributed systems platforms in\r\nseveral ways. It provides integrated support for both distributed\r\nstorage and distributed computation, whereas previous platforms have\r\nfocused on one or the other.  It supports cooperative sharing of\r\ninformation and computation even when the cooperating entities do\r\nnot fully trust each other.  And it aims to automatically enforce a\r\nlarger class of desirable system properties: not just security or\r\navailability narrowly defined, but also properties such as consistency,\r\nconfidentiality, integrity, efficiency, and durability.  Replication,\r\nencryption, and distributed commit protocols make it possible to\r\nautomatically ensure the consistency, integrity, and availability\r\nof persistent information.  A high-level language with security and\r\nconsistency annotations enables programmers to easily write code for\r\nthis system, using a compiler that transforms code and data to produce a\r\nsecure, reliable, and efficient system.\r\n",
