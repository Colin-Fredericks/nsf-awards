This new kind of robot, not highly accurate, stationary, single task machine with sensing abilities as for typical industrial applications, is richly equipped with multi-model sensing, a high level of dexterity, compliance for safe operation, and mobility. Endowed with the appearance and behavior of a social system appropriate for human environments, it can perform a large number of assistive tasks, autonomously or in collaborative instruction with humans. A humanoid robot instigates a variety of original research. Developing humanoid behavior advances robotics and automation technology while promoting interdisciplinary interaction with natural sciences",

For instance, the European Union spends about 100-200 million Euros per year on robotics projects, Japan has spent billions of dollars in the last 10 years on assistive/humanoid robotics, and the US has just announced the National Robotics Initiative (NRI) that promises growth in funding. The focus of these programs is less on traditional industrial robotics research, but rather on on a new vision, called human-centered robotics (HCR). HCR is to develop the science and technology of human-robot interaction, with the aim of assisting broad populations in need, ranging in age, capability and context: in industry, hospitals, schools, elder care and other managed care facilities, inner city urban areas, and eventually homes. Targeted applications include assistance for the growing elderly population and for people with physical and cognitive disabilities, guidance of children and other at-risk populations on their commute, crowd and emergency response in densely populated areas, robotic rehabilitation and prosthetics, movement instructions for training, exercise, and entertainment activities, science education for children and minorities, search and rescue efforts in hazardous/disaster environments, and numerous others. These domains are typically understaffed due to the high cost of the number and/or training levels of personnel required for individualized assistance, or some domains pose significant health risks for humans. HCR opens a new chapter in robotics: it is not the highly accurate, stationary, single-task machine with minimal sensing abilities that is needed anymore, as in typical industrial applications.
