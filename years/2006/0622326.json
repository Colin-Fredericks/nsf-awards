 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is increasing the number of under-represented and low income students that graduate with degrees in science, engineering and mathematics.  There are three primary activities designed and implemented that are addressing freshmen students' 1) lack of specific knowledge skill sets, 2) lack of interpersonal and institutional skill sets, and 3) financial issues.  The pre-freshman residential summer experience is bringing entering students to campus for a three week intensive academic experience in math, biology and chemistry.  This summer program is providing students a head start in their science course sequences, effectively expanding the time they have to complete their majors and providing a strong foundation for the pursuit of college-level science or math.  The students are then participating in academic year workshops/study groups led by faculty and graduate students in chemistry and biology.  The program is also providing faculty and peer led mentoring for participants as well as enhanced advising and educational enrichment activities.  By providing scholarships the project leaders are addressing a significant barrier to gaining an education that many students are facing.\r\n\r\n",
