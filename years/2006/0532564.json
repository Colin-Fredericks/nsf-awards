 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 1981, the American Mathematical Society (AMS), the Institute for Mathematical Statistics (IMS), and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) have managed a program of research conferences, held during the summers at various locations and funded by the National Science Foundation. During this time, more than 9,000 U.S. mathematical scientists have participated in these conferences,  advancing their research and making connections with other scientists.  For many young mathematicians, these summer conferences have played a crucial role as they enter a specific area of mathematical research.\r\n\r\nThis project supports four additional one-week conferences in this series to be held during the summer of 2006 at the Snowbird Conference Center in Utah. These four conferences were the results of the traditional solicitation for the Summer Research Conferences (SRCS) proposals carried out during 2004. They were thoroughly reviewed in February 2005 by twelve-member Selection Committee jointly appointed by \r\nthe AMS, IMS and SIAM.\r\n\r\nThe four one-week conferences are:\r\n1.  Integer Points in Polyhedra: Geometry, Number Theory, Representation Theory, Algebra, Optimization,      Statistics\r\n2.  Representations of Real Reductive Lie Groups\r\n3.  Machine and Statistical Learning: Prediction and Discovery\r\n4.  Discrete and Computational Geometry-Twenty Years Later\r\n\r\nThese conferences play a major role in career development for junior mathematicians. They bring together senior and junior researchers in an ideal environment to establish connections, which often last for many \r\nyears after the conference itself. In this sense, the conferences help to train the next generation of researchers in various fields. This is especially true with the added emphasis on including recent Ph.D.s. The \r\norganizing societies are also keenly aware of the need to increase participation of under-represented groups, and all aspects of the conferences will reflect that awareness (as do most activities of the societies). Finally, the proceedings that grow from these conferences reach mathematicians throughout the world, in every part of the mathematical community. In this way, the work done at conferences can reach scientists who work in areas far from the specific conference topic, who are separated from the meeting in both place and time.\r\n",
