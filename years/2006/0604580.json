 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gilmer will continue the study of  topological quantum field   theories  defined over rings of cyclotomic integers.  He will   continue to study with Masbaum the associated mapping class groups   representations acting on modules over these rings and also over   their finite quotients. He will also study the related infinite   dimensional perturbative representation of the Torelli group that  Masbaum has defined.  Gilmer will study strong shift equivalence  class invariants of knots and other spaces which are equipped with an  infinite cyclic cover. He will use these structures to study questions in low dimensional topology. Gilmer will also study  invariants of  links that he has associated to collections of curves  in the real projective plane. This should lead to restrictions on topology of real algebraic curves.\r\n\r\nTopology is the study of intrinsic shape. It is sometimes called  \"rubber sheet\" geometry as frequently the objects one studies can be  twisted and stretched but not torn. Recently topology has had a   large influx of ideas from physics. Topological quantum field theory  (TQFT) is an area of topology with intimate connections to high  energy physics, quantum computing as well as other areas of  mathematics, for instance number theory.  The same topological  quantum field theories that Gilmer will be exploring have been  proposed by others for applications to quantum computing. Gilmer  would also like to use TQFT as a tool to study classical questions in  topology. Low dimensional topology is important for chemistry and  biology as it has implications for the mechanism of DNA, and other  molecular configurations.\r\n",
