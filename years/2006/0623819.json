 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computing Research Association (CRA) will coordinate a public town hall meeting for the National Science Foundation (NSF) to engage the broader research community in the GENI Initiative. This proposal seeks support for expenses related to the planning, advertising, registration, and reporting activities associated with this meeting. CRA is in a unique position to provide support to the Directorate for Computer and\r\nInformation Science and Engineering (CISE): our organizational mission is to strengthen research and advanced education in computing. We have a proven record of managing successful meetings for NSF on behalf of the computing community. The GENI initiative envisions the creation of new networking and distributed system architectures that, for example:\r\n\tBuild in security and robustness;\r\n\tEnable the vision of pervasive computing and bridge the gap between the physical and virtual worlds by including mobile, wireless and sensor networks;\r\n\tEnable control and management of other critical infrastructures;\r\n\tInclude ease of operation and usability; and\r\n\tEnable new classes of societal-level services and applications.\r\n\r\nThe GENI initiative includes a research program and a global experimental facility designed to explore new architectures at scale. CISE is encouraging broad community input and aims to engage other agencies, other countries, as well as corporate entities in the planning and execution of this new Initiative. To broaden community participation, CISE will hold, with the assistance of CRA, a pilot town hall meeting in spring 2006. The agenda for the meeting includes smaller group breakout sessions to provide input to CISE on specific topics regarding the facility such as: requirements for the experimental facility for networking and distributed systems research; implementation of the facility and its parts; and, the management of the process of defining and construction of a facility. Further, this meeting will inform CISE as to the value of such meetings and profitable agendas.\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests funds to pay for all meeting-related expenses, travel-related costs and staff time for organizing the meeting and for necessary follow-up activities.\r\nParticipant support is also requested to provide for meals for the attendees as well as travel-related costs for the session chairs.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The reports generated from the meeting will provide CISE with valuable input from a wide range of researchers from the computing community in the deployment of the state of-the-art, global experimental GENI Facility.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Special effort will be made to attract participants from a diverse population through the advertisement of the town hall meeting via established networks and communication tools of two of CRAs committees:  the Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research (CRA-W), and the Coalition to Diversify Computing (CDC).\r\n\r\n",
