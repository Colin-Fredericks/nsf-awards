These renewed efforts have been prompted by a number of distinct factors related to both opportunity and need.  Opportunities for more detailed research have been provided through advances in computational methods and power, the development and refinement of instrumentation, and the synthesis and fabrication of novel materials.  The need for a greater understanding of tribological fundamentals has been driven largely by technological applications requiring more stringent control of the tribological interface.  Examples of this need are prevalent in the microelectronics, aerospace, and biotechnology industries.  Equipped with the tools to model, design, synthesize, and measure the tribological interface with greater precision, scientists and engineers within the community have begun mapping out an understanding of tribological phenomena on an atomic and molecular (chemical) scale.\tNSF support of the ACS Chemical Foundations of Friction and Wear Symposium will bring together a diverse group of scientists from academia and industry to share their recent advances in the field, having a blend of applied and fundamental, experimental and theoretical work.  The opportunity provided through this support will allow the exchange of the most recent results and will impact society through advancing the fundamental understanding of a topic of widespread importance.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n",
