Whiplash injury and the more chronic repetitive stress injury associated with the neck are significant sources of morbidity and disability.   \r\n\r\nTissue mechanics and fiber organization for subfailure loading remain poorly understood.  The goal of the project is to describe a quantitative and experimentally verified relationship between facet capsule ligament micro-kinematics and the tensile load under subfailure conditions. The integration of structural mechanics, microstructural imaging and modeling of the relationship of these in the context of painful loading will be advance soft tissue biomechanics. The project would provide benefits to not only neck pain sufferers but for a broad range of painful orthopaedic injuries.\r\n\r\nThe educational component will serve students at different levels (graduate, undergraduate and K-12 students) and promote hands-on and discovery-based learning.  The outreach will include high school women in engineering opportunities through a hands-on research and educational program with Penn's Society of Women Engineers Student section.  \r\n",
