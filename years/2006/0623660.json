 "awd_abstract_narration": "0623660\r\nErdogmus\r\nThis award supports international research experience for students in a project by a team of scientists from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), Lincoln, Nebraska led by the PI, Dr. Ece Erdogmus, Department of Archeological Engineering in collaboration with Ms. Seher Turkmen, Department of Archeology, Alanya Archeological Museum, Antalya, Turkey. The research focus is the study of and restoration of ruins of an ancient Roman Temple in Southern Turkey.   The project presents a unique opportunity for the students of the UNL in the Architectural Engineering and Art History/Classics programs to supplement their education in two areas: 1) Getting a global outlook, 2) Working on a complex and extraordinary problem, which can only be solved by employing and furthering the current state-of-the-art in the disciplines of engineering, architecture, history and archeology.  The imperial Roman temple on the site of the ancient city of Antiocheia ad Kragum in southern Turkey has not been adequately studied nor documented previously, and it is no longer standing. All the marble blocks that once formed the walls, columns, and roof structure have collapsed and lie strewn about the platform. The research team is to assess the possibilities, and ultimately partially or fully reconstruct this ancient structure. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The key questions the research will focus on are: How can the deficiencies in the field of assessment, strengthening and preservation of historical (specifically ancient Roman) masonry structures be addressed? How can an ancient Roman temple be re-erected using the latest advancements in technology with utmost concern for authenticity, strength, and aesthetics? The research team's intention is to utilize and advance state-of-the-art engineering techniques to assess the current condition of the structure (use of nondestructive testing techniques utilizing ground penetrating radar and modal testing), to strengthen the existing elements (possibly using fiber reinforced polymers), and re-erect the structure (involving architectural engineers, architecture history and archeology experts). Such a comprehensive and high level merging of engineering and an ancient structure is novel.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project will contribute to the preservation of world heritage and revival of history.  It will help stimulate tourism in the area. The assessment and strengthening techniques to be researched within the context of an ancient masonry structure will constitute direct contributions to the field of historical preservation of masonry structures, regardless of the structure's architectural style and age. The study will fill a research gap in art history.  Undergraduate students will be involved in research and incorporation of research findings in classes. Recruitment is planned of female engineering students through the Society of Women Engineers, as well as international networking and high-school outreach. The results will be disseminated through journal and conference articles. Undergraduate students will be encouraged to present at conferences. A website will be maintained to announce the developments of this exciting project to academics and the public.\r\n",
