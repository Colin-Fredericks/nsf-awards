 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is awarded under the Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowships and Supporting Activities Program for 2006. \r\n\r\nFUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF BEHAVIOR-DRIVEN GENE EXPRESSION \r\n\r\n    Research with singing birds has shown that during singing a distinct pattern of ZENK gene expression emerges in their telencepahlon.  That is, hearing novel song induces ZENK gene expression within auditory telencephalon, and singing by normal hearing or deafened birds induces ZENK within specific nuclei of the vocal-control circuit.  The ZENK gene encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor that is believed to regulate the transcription of other genes.  But the signaling cascade initiated by ZENK expression remains a mystery.  Also, because song must be learned these findings hint at a role for ZENK in vocal-motor learning.  To date there is little experimental evidence to support such a hypothesis. Therefore, the functional significance of behavior-driven ZENK gene expression in the zebra finch songbird by manipulating its expression will be the focus of this project. The result will be insightful towards our understanding of the mechanisms and constraints underlying the dynamic changes required by plastic phenotypes such as vocal learning.\r\n    Completing this project at Duke University under the mentorship of Dr. Erich Jarvis will expand Dr. Whitney's previous research by exploring causal molecular mechanisms underlying learned vocal behavior. Specifically the training objectives are as follows: (1) to develop a broader knowledge and skills in regard to gene manipulation tools and animal behaviour; (2) to develop familiarity with the research literature on activity-dependent gene expression and transcriptional regulatory networks, so as to keep abreast of major developments; (3) to develop skill in the recognition of meaningful problems and questions for research in molecular neurobiology; (4) to develop technical skills in high throughput gene expression profiling; (5) to further develop oral, written, and visual communication skills; and (6)  to further develop the skill in designing experimental protocols and in conducting productive independent research. The overall career goal of Dr. Whitney is to establish a niche in the area of neuroethology, specifically towards understanding how the songbird brain perceives, generates, and learns vocalizations. This research is expected to generate broad insight to the neural mechanisms of vocal/social communication in vertebrates. Future plans include education and training of undergraduate and graduate students, with a special interest in encouraging minority and women students to reach their full potential.\r\n",
