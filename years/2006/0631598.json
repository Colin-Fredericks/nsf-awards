 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for students and young researchers to attend the 4th Pathways, Networks and Systems International Conference to be held October 8-13, 2006 at the Royal Myconian Conference Center, Mykonos, Greece. The conference uniquely blends experimental studies of complex multilevel systems with rigorous computational, bioinformatics, statistical and analytical approaches. Emphasis is on mammalian systems, but breakthrough discoveries in other species are included where they lead to new strategies, paradigms, analytical methods, and phenotyping methods. Attendance is limited to less than 100 to promote interactions. The conference is a balanced mix of formal and long platform presentations with ample time for informal discussions. Women, students, fellows and underrepresented individuals are encouraged to attend, will receive financial support from this award and placement in the presentation program. Feedback from previous conferences has been exceptional. Although there are other genomics, computational and systems biology conferences, none integrate computational and experimental so seamlessly or effectively.",
