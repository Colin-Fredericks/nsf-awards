Chrysanthis <panos@cs.pitt.edu>\r\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\r\n\r\nNSF Workshop on Data Management for Wireless Sensor Networks\r\n\r\nThis is the first workshop focusing exclusively on data management for mobile sensor networks and their applications. In the future, the digital and physical worlds are expected to be integrated and interoperated by a highly pervasive, highly mobile, and highly distributed information space which is entirely managed by sensors, static or embedded in mobile devices. Thus, the objective of the worskhop is to stimulate discussions on the data management challenges and suggest research directions facing the design, deployment, use, and fundamental limits of sensor networks with mobile nodes. By providing a forum for leading researchers from both industry and academia, this workshop will lead to a more cohesive research community and set the foundations for a wide range of new data management algorithms and techniques, focusing on quality of data (QoD) and quality of service (QoS), in the presence of resource which characterize the mobile sensor network applications that will impact all aspects of life (education, health, business, scientific exploration etc.).  Further, it will facilitate the development of new standards for mobile sensor databases and will provide the synergy necessary for the US technical community to become a dominant player in this field. The results of the workshop will be reported in periodicals (e.g., ACM Sigmod Record, Sigmobile MC2R and IEEE TCDE Bulletin), relevant conferences, workshops, or meetings and will also be made available online through the workshop web site (http://db.cs.pitt.edu/mobisensors/).\r\n",
