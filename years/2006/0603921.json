 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main theme of this proposal is to study the dynamics and\r\ngeometry of automorphisms of free groups via geodesic currents. In\r\nthe free group case the Teichmuller space of a surface is replaced\r\nby the so-called ``outer space\" of a free group, introduced by\r\nCuller and Vogtmann. Most of the existing work in this area\r\ninvolved topologically inspired methods. A ``geodesic current\" is\r\na measure-theoretic analogue of a closed curve.  The geodesic\r\ncurrents approach, that is being developed by the proposer in his\r\nrecent work, transfers the investigation into the setting of\r\nmeasure-theoretic and symbolic dynamics, which is ``native'' for a\r\nfree group. This setting allows the use of the powerful machinery\r\nof ergodic theory, measure theory and probability theory. The\r\nproject will concentrate on several specific topics where the\r\nproposer has already made progress. These include: the\r\nintersection form, generic stretching factors of automorphisms,\r\nextremal entropy problems, the new compactification of the outer\r\nspace obtained via the Patterson-Sullivan embedding, random length\r\nspectrum rigidity, ideal version of Whitehead's algorithm, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outer automorphism group of a finitely generated free group is\r\none of the most mysterious and least understood objects in\r\nGeometric Group Theory. This group is a (more difficult to study)\r\n``cousin'' of the modular group of a compact surface, that plays a\r\nfundamental role in many branches of Mathematics, such as the\r\nTeichmuller theory, low-dimensional topology, hyperbolic geometry,\r\ncomplex analysis, and so on. The proposal aims to investigate the\r\nouter automorphism group of a free group by exploiting new ideas\r\nfrom other branches of Mathematics, particularly the tools of\r\nmeasure-theoretic dynamics. The subject of the proposal is related to the\r\nstudy of patterns in infinite words, which is important in combinatorics,\r\nand the action of substitution-like maps on such words. As the proposer's\r\nwork shows, there is also a connection, particularly via\r\nthe study of Whitehead's algorithm, with the complexity theory and\r\nthe study of practical (as opposed to ``worst-case\" or theoretical)\r\nbehavior of various algorithms.\r\n",
