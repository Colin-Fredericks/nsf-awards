Weinstein\r\n\r\nA scientific symposium titled \"Geometry and Theoretical Physics\"\r\nwill take place at the National Meeting of the Society for the\r\nAdvancement of Chicano and Native Americans in the Sciences\r\n(SACNAS) in Tampa, Florida on October 27, 2006. Mirror Symmetry,\r\nQuantum Cohomology and Gromov-Witten theory lie at the heart of\r\nthe intersection of contemporary geometry and theoretical\r\nphysics. Great strides have recently been made in our\r\nunderstanding of these subjects, including a complete\r\ndetermination of the Gromov-Witten theory (and Donaldson-Thomas\r\ntheory) of local curves, and of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, and\r\nnew proofs of Witten's conjecture; announced results include the\r\ncomputation of the quantum cohomology of certain Hilbert schemes\r\nof basic importance, and a construction of the Equivariant\r\nVertex, determining the Gromov-Witten theory of all toric\r\nthreefolds. A number of important conjectures drive the field,\r\nincluding Chern-Simons/Gromov-Witten duality, the\r\nDonaldson-Thomas/Gromov-Witten correspondence, and the Crepant\r\nResolution Conjecture. The speakers at this symposium will\r\nannounce accomplishments and also discuss new directions of\r\nresearch. Specifically, Jim Bryan will discuss Topological\r\nQuantum Field Theories, Robin Wilson will discuss knots and\r\nthree-manifolds, and Vincent Bouchard will discuss the Standard\r\nModel of particle physics, and its relation to geometry.\r\n\r\nThis symposium will enable and encourage students and other\r\nscientists to pursue research in areas related to the interaction\r\nof theoretical physics and mathematics, provide the opportunity\r\nfor scientists to interact and foster collaboration and new\r\nresearch, and disseminate knowledge to a wide and extraordinarily\r\ndiverse audience.  While the reasons for organizing a scientific\r\nsymposium on geometry and theoretical physics are many, there is\r\nadditionally an acute need to do so for an audience of\r\nunderrepresented minorities. There is at this time significant\r\nunderrepresentation of minorities in the mathematical sciences;\r\nthis underrepresentation is evidently severe in Gromov-Witten\r\ntheory and other fields relating to the interactions of geometry\r\nand physics. There are very important questions that need to be\r\naddressed in Gromov-Witten theory, and it is necessary to attract\r\na broad and diverse audience to work on these\r\nproblems. Gromov-Witten theory and related fields have been\r\nextremely successful in solving outstanding problems, some over\r\n100 years old, in several branches of mathematics and physics. It\r\nis predicted that underrepresented minorities will become the\r\nmajority of United States Citizens; as such, it is in the long\r\nterm interest of geometry and physics to have increased\r\nparticipation from members of these groups.  Moreover, given the\r\nimportance of geometry and theoretical physics to mathematics and\r\nscience in general, it is in our National interest to work\r\nagainst the underrepresentation of minorities conducting research\r\nin these fields.  This symposium has been approved and scheduled\r\nby SACNAS. In addition, funding has been secured from SACNAS to\r\ncover the speakers' and organizers' travel, lodging and\r\nconference registration fees. The funding requested in this\r\nproposal will be used for student support.\r\n\r\nFurther information about mathematics at SACNAS in general, and\r\nabout this symposium in particular, can be found, respectively,\r\nat http://www.uprh.edu/~sacnas/ and\r\nhttp://math.berkeley.edu/~dkarp/sacnas.\r\n",
