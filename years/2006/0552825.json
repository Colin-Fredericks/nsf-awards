  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis five-year NSF-REU project provided funding for 15 summer research teams during the time period 2006-2010.  Each project involved one or two Lafayette faculty leaders and 2-4 undergraduates from other institutions.  These research projects included detailed studies of a wide variety of topics:  differential equations, number theory, graph theory, groups and symmetry, probability, mathematical physics, algebraic invariants, voting theory, 4-dimensional geometry, geometric group theory, derivative pricing models and statistical modeling.\n\n \n\nMany of the groups published their results in peer-reviewed journals, and many more publications are planned.  All of the research groups presented their work at the national American Mathematical Society Meetings held in January of the year following their summer programs.  The groups also presented their work at regional conferences and their home institutions. \n\n \n\nGuest lectures from outside speakers were an important part of the program, and there were 2-4 such talks each summer.  In addition, several Lafayette faculty members gave presentations of their own research as part of the program.  Finally, each group of students attended a research conference during their summer program.  These activities contributed to the student research experience of the REU.  The entire experience also encouraged and reinforced student interest in pursuing advanced study in math.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/16/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gary Gordon"
