 "awd_abstract_narration": "Windows of Opportunity is a scholarship program that assists academically promising, low-income students in obtaining Associate in Arts or Associate in Science degrees in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) at Miami Dade College (MDC). Since MDC has the largest enrollment of any college or university in the country, including the largest enrollment of Hispanic and African American students, the project provides Windows of Opportunity for underrepresented students as well. A minimum of twenty-five freshman- and sophomore-level students participate in the program each year.  Upon completion of the program, students are able to transfer to an upper-division school or enter the workforce directly in their chosen field.  This collaborative of seven MDC campuses brings together a diverse and experienced group of educators, business partners and students.  Program participants receive scholarships, mentoring by STEM faculty, intense academic and career planning activities, interactions with STEM professionals on and off campus, and internship experiences. The program evaluation encompasses student achievement, retention, and graduation rates compared to non-program participants, as well as student and faculty surveys each semester, and a final student exit survey.  The project is disseminated nationally by presentations of strategies, best practices, and student success rates.  The program's web portal is also publicly accessible. Upon completion of the program, participants help fill the critical shortage of scientists and engineers in Miami-Dade County. Participants not only make a contribution to South Florida, but also serve as role models to future STEM students. \r\n\r\n",
