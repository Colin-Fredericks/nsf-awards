 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2006 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Macromolecular Organization and Cell Function focuses on the essential functional role played by the internal organization of the living cell to provide a systems level understanding of how interactions between specific molecular constituents contribute to basic cell function.  Subcellular organization often is transient, as in dynamic interactions of molecular motors with the cytoskeleton, of macromolecules in signal transduction pathways, or of the enzymic components of metabolic pathways.  Many of these interactions depend on the unique conditions and compartmentation that exist within the intact cell that are disturbed or even destroyed using conventional in vitro approaches. Emphasis is placed on interpretation of biochemical and structural data in the light of known intracellular conditions including the spatial distribution of proteins and metabolites. Discussed are studies on macromolecular assemblies, non-invasive subcellular imaging, cellular topology of second messenger signaling pathways, and the global analysis of cellular proteins and metabolites. In addition, theoretical modeling, including the development and testing of mechanisms for handling large amounts of bioinformatics data, is a major emphasis of the conference based on the recognition that complex interactions are very difficult to study without computational tools.  In this respect, the topics covered at this conference are cutting edge, and address a unique need regarding integration of reductionist data into a broader and holistic understanding of the cell environment, and its effect on cell function.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThis conference is traditionally attended by scientists with a wide range of interests and expertise, ranging from experimentalists to theorists, and from a wide range of disiplines.  There is active cross-disciplinary discussion that has been greatly stimulating and valuable to the participants, and which has also fostered numerous documented collaborations.  The meeting itself has consistently been judged very highly by the participants, as documented via a questionaire distributed at the end of meetings.  The participation of women and minorites, as well as post-doctoral, graduate and undergraduate students is encouraged and promoted.  For the 2006 meeting, 40% of the speakers are women; at the meeting in 2004, an equal number of total participants were women and/or minorities.  A full 40% of participants also list themselves as junior scientists. NSF support is instrumental in acomplishing this high level of diverse participation This meeting has been unique with repsect to bringing together a growing community of scientists focused on cellular organization and biocomplexity by cutting across disciplines and areas of expertise to address diverse, yet overlapping, scientific questions, and goals.  Comments by attendees in the past support the notion that this diversity of ideas and approaches to questions with common origins is a primary benefit of this conference.\r\n",
