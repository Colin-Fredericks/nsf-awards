The temperature history of the injected material is critical in determining coating quality. However, the very high temperatures of the plasma process complicate local measurements. This research project will develop a laser fluorescence based temperature measurement that can be applied in these harsh environments and provide accurate and local instantaneous information about temperatures and heat transfer to the material particles.  It is believed to be the first such technique available for real time temperature measurements in these environments.  Particles that are doped with a temperature sensitive material will be produced in a novel spray facility at the University of Connecticut as well as partner laboratories at Oak Ridge National Laboratories and NASA. Once these particles and diagnostics have been developed, the temperature sensitive particles produced in this project will be injected into an operating plasma spray for local particle temperature measurements. Coatings are used to protect against these high temperatures, but measurement of actual conditions in operating engines is critical to improving design of components and coatings. Measurements of high temperature gas flows in gas turbine engine parts will be performed using facilities at our industrial collaborator Siemens Westinghouse Power. Their optically accessible engines permit unique opportunities to test the high temperature materials developed for applications to better temperature management. Siemens is also participating in the proposed work by hosting graduate students as interns to facilitate technology exchange.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The measurement of temperature of injected materials in the plasma spray process is a significant source of uncertainty in the quality of coatings produced. The proposed effort will enable local, high-accuracy measurements that can be used for improved plasma process design. The project takes advantage of previous development of existing fluorescence themographic sensors but uses unique facilities and instrumentation at the University of Connecticut to extend the measurement to much higher temperatures. The investigators bring significant experience in plasma spray coating technology and laser diagnostics in harsh environments to this multi-disciplinary project. This effort also impacts high temperature gas flows in industrial engines, and our partner Siemens Westinghouse brings considerable experience in non-destructive testing and thermographic measurements to the project.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project will support two graduate students who will have access to facilities and courses in both the Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science departments. The requested equipment will outfit our existing spray facilities with optical diagnostics capabilities that can be used for many measurement techniques. In addition to work at the university, the graduate students will work closely in conjunction with collaborators at Oak Ridge National Laboratories and NASA including research visits to fully characterize the new materials generated during the project. Finally, the students will have summer internship opportunities at Siemens Westinghouse Power to facilitate testing of the developed materials in their optically accessible engines.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTurbine blades and other components in the hottest sections of aircraft engines must be cooled to prevent damage from overheating.  Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are routinely applied to these components to insulate the material and protect them from the hot gases inside the engine.  These coatings enable the engines to run at higher temperatures which improves the engine efficiency.  Over time, these coatings fail by flaking off of the engine components and the coating must either be reapplied or the component must be replaced.  This research project aims to develop an instrument capable of estimating the lifetime remaining for a coating after it has been used in an engine so that premature failures can be better predicted and components with sufficiently good coatings can be reused in the engine.  A laser-based technique has previously been demonstrated that can estimate the remaining coating life by measuring the stress between the coating and the component.  However, once a component has been used in an engine, contamination from material ingested by the engine can accumulate on the coating and prevent the laser measurement from penetrating into the coating.  We have developed a method to use a pulsed laser to remove the contamination without damaging the coating itself.  A combined instrument has been developed under this project that uses two lasers to clean and inspect coated engine components.  The instrument was made portable and used to demonstrate on-site measurements at an engine manufacturer\u00c6s facility.  A coated turbine blade is loaded into the instrument and the first pulsed laser is used to remove contamination from the surface.  Light emitted during the laser removal is analyzed spectrally to determine that material being removed from the surface.  The composition of the TBC is known, thus once the measurement indicates that the coating has been reached, material removal stops.  A second low power laser is then focused into the cleaned spot on the blade and transmitted through the coating itself.  This laser excites atoms at the interface between the coating and the component.  These atoms then emit light that can be analyzed spectrally to determine the stress in the material.  Past work has shown that this stress is a direct estimate for remaining coating life.  The portable instrument can analyze several spots on a single blade within a few minutes and provide a prediction for the remaining life of the coating.  This instrument has the potential impact to identify inferior coatings prior their failure and to enable a more efficient use of components that have remaining life.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/18/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael W Renfro"
