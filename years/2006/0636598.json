Brandt-Pearce, University of Virginia\r\n\r\nOur society's demand for wireless bandwidth is clearly increasing at a rapid rate, yet our radio frequency resources are all but depleted. This seeming impasse can be resolved by communicating over the wireless optical domain with its nearly boundless bandwidth, using an RF link as a backup. The objective of the proposed research is to use channel modeling and adaptive modulation/coding to unleash the synergy between the two technologies, relying on multiple parallel links (multiple-input multiple-output, MIMO) to provide the needed throughput and diversity.  This is a collaborative effort between UVa and L-3 Communications, Communications Systems-West.  The work is approached as five overlapping tasks performed by the three PIs and two graduate students. The communication theory behind a hybrid FSO/RF system will be developed, including the acquisition of channel state information.  Data showing the correlation between channels will be collected.  Adaptive modulation and coding techniques for simultaneous MIMO RF and optical links will then be designed and tested on realistic implementations.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe results of the proposed work will be to understand the relation between the optical and RF wireless channels and to improve their concurrent use for transmitting broadband information.  The technique proposed is unique in that it relies on simultaneous communications over the two technologies, which is rarely done.  The synchronized multi-channel data collected will add to the general knowledge of communication channels.  The PI's have combined experience designing and evaluating optical and RF wireless systems, and MIMO systems in both technologies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe proposed research enhances the performance and availability of wireless links through better system modeling, modulation, coding, and channel state estimation. These techniques will be made available to other researchers in the field through dissemination at international conferences and in journals. The increase in wireless connectivity will stimulate economic growth, especially in urban areas that are often difficult to serve using new fiber.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this multifaceted research project. Students from diverse backgrounds will be sought. \r\n",
