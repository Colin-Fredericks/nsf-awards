 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nPI: Ahamad; CoPIs: Lee and Schwan\r\n\r\nCritical applications that range from operational information systems used in\r\ngovernment and commercial settings to those that run daily e-commerce\r\nweb services rely on distributed computing systems to produce, process, \r\nand disseminate information in a trustworthy fashion. Attacks on such \r\napplications and the underlying infrastructure can severely limit\r\ntheir ability to meet end-user needs. The inherent complexity of applications,\r\ntechnologies, and platforms in today's large scale distributed systems makes \r\nit extremely challenging to create services that can continue to behave in\r\na trustworthy manner in the presence of attacks. In this research project, \r\na new approach is proposed to meet the trust needs of applications by \r\nintegrating modern system virtualization techniques with new methods for \r\nruntime trust monitoring and assessment. This approach dynamically creates \r\nand maintains an abstraction called a trusted passage that encapsulates \r\nprocessing, storage and communication resources required by an application. \r\nSuch resources exist across distributed and potentially untrusted execution \r\nplatforms. Trust controllers, which monitor application execution, determine \r\nat runtime when some resources associated with a trusted passages may have \r\nbecome compromised and need to be replaced by others. Trusted \r\npassages leverage new capabilities soon to be part of most, if not all, \r\ncomputational and network platforms. Thus, even with an insecure Internet, \r\nour goal is to continually assess the distributed computational platforms \r\nbeing used by applications, and based on that information, provide trusted\r\nservices to critical applications. This research fosters close collaboration \r\namong security and systems researchers and strengthens ongoing \r\ninteractions with multiple industry research partners.",
