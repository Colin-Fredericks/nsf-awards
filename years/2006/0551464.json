 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, validating and extending work in sensor location and security, and MANET address allocation and reconfiguration, aims at building an infrastructure to service the development and evaluation of new algorithms and systems for\r\n\r\n-Localization of sensor nodes within an obstructed sensor network environment,\r\n-Security of sensor nodes and the maintenance of functional module integrity,\r\n-Autoconfiguration of network addresses within MANETs, and\r\n-Reconfiguration and address handoff of MANET addresses as nodes move and independent MANETs merge.\r\n\r\nThe planning work concentrates mainly in the localization, autoconfiguration and reconfiguration, while the security of sensor nodes and the maintenance of functional module integrity of the original work will be minimized. The researchers have obtained previous results via mathematical analysis and simulation and eventually would like to validate it on the originally proposed sensor and ad hoc research infrastructure, but at present will continue to simulate a large scaled sensor and ad hoc network.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Adding real system advances the research quality and attracts new students. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be able to use the infrastructure in their research endeavors. The PIs plan to work with the Diversity office to attract underrepresented students in these projects.\r\nMoreover, wireless and mobile ad hoc networks have significant potential to contribute to numerous societal advancements, including environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, vehicle-to-vehicle communication, emergency rescue operations, etc.\r\n",
