 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nGioev\r\n\r\nThe PI will work on four problems, all of which involve asymptotic \r\ntechniques developed in Random Matrix Theory (RMT). Problems I and II \r\nare concerned with the proof of universality for orthogonal and \r\nsymplectic ensembles of random matrices with varying polynomial weights \r\non the line, and with polynomial weights on the half-line, respectively. \r\nProblem III deals with the rigorous proof of the asymptotic expansion \r\nfor the partition function (free energy) for orthogonal and symplectic \r\nensembles with varying polynomial weights on the line which has \r\napplications in graph enumeration problems arising in 2D quantum gravity \r\nand string theory. Finally, Problem IV concerns proving various \r\nasymptotic formulae for the entanglement entropy of fermion systems on \r\nthe lattice and in the continuum (this problem has connections with \r\nRMT).\r\n\r\nOver the past fifty years it has become clear that Random Matrix Theory \r\n(RMT), initially introduced into the theoretical physics community by \r\nWigner in 1950's as a model for the scattering of neutrons off large \r\nnuclei, has a long and extraordinarily varied list of applications not \r\nonly in physics, but also in pure and applied mathematics, and in other \r\nsciences, such as cardiology. More precisely, it turns out that (the \r\nstatistical properties of) various seemingly unrelated objects, such as \r\nvibration frequencies of elastic plates, bus arrival times when the \r\ndrivers try to optimize the traffic flow, zeros of the Riemann zeta \r\nfunction, the distribution of phone numbers in a large phone directory, \r\nand heartbeat peaks, for example, are all remarkably well-described by \r\neigenvalues of a large random matrix (RM). The fundamental question is: \r\nWhy does RMT model such a broad variety of phenomena? The answer is that \r\nthere should be certain limiting distribution laws for the eigenvalues of \r\nlarge RM's that are independent of the precise distribution of the matrix \r\nensembles. This loose statement is known as the Universality Conjecture, \r\nand it can be viewed as an analog of the Central Limit Theorem in \r\nprobability theory, but now for certain classes of correlated random \r\nvariables (which are the eigenvalues of a RM). Universality questions \r\narose very early on in RMT, and universality is widely believed to be \r\ntrue. However, a mathematical proof of universality for the so-called \r\nunitary ensembles was found only in the late 1990's. The PI and Deift \r\nhave very recently proved universality in the remaining two cases, viz., \r\nthe orthogonal and symplectic ensembles, in great generality. Problems I \r\nand II, which deal with continuation and extension of these results, \r\nwill significantly extend our understanding of universality to the \r\nimportant case where the underlying equilibrium measure consists of more \r\nthan one interval. The asymptotic expansion of the partition function \r\nfor the three types of RM ensembles has important applications in \r\nmathematics and also in 2D quantum gravity and string theory. Very \r\nrecently, in the unitary case, the expansion was rigorously established \r\nby Ercolani and McLaughlin. In Problem III, the PI plans to prove \r\nrigorously the expansion for general orthogonal and symplectic \r\nensembles. This will have implications in 2D quantum gravity models \r\nwhich are not covered by the unitary case. In the emerging field of \r\nquantum computation, a subject currently of great interest, one of the \r\nbasic quantities of study is the so-called entanglement entropy which \r\nmeasures the number of maximally entangled pairs that can be extracted \r\nfrom a given quantum state. In Problem IV, the PI plans to prove various \r\nresults concerning asymptotic expansions of the entanglement entropy for \r\nfermions as the size of a subsystem becomes large. These results will \r\nconsiderably extend the understanding of the entanglement entropy for \r\nthe lattice and also continuous fermion systems in higher dimensions.\r\n\r\n",
