These moduli spaces are the\r\ncenter of many branches of mathematics and physics. Continuing\r\nhis previous works, the PI first proposed to prove the Mumford\r\ngoodness of several canonical metrics including the Ricci metric\r\nand the Kahler-Einstein metric on the moduli space of Riemann\r\nsurfaces. The goodness of these metrics will allow one to apply\r\nChern-Weil theory to these moduli spaces which are\r\nnoncompact. The PI hope to develop a method to study the\r\nintersection theory on the moduli spaces via differential\r\ngeometry by using the goodness. To study the goodness of the\r\nKahler-Einstein metric, except for the continuity method, the PI\r\nproposed to investigate the Kahler-Ricci flow on the moduli\r\nspaces. More generally, the PI proposed to study the Kahler-Ricci\r\nflow on non-compact and quasi-projective manifolds where the\r\npotential function of the initial metric is unbounded with mild\r\ngrowth. The PI proposed to prove that the Kahler class and the\r\ngoodness of the initial metric are preserved under the\r\nKahler-Ricci flow. Also, the long time existence and convergence\r\nof the Kahler- Ricci flow will be studied. Furthermore, the PI\r\nproposed to investigate the negativity of various metrics on this\r\nmoduli space and harmonic map theory which will lead to various\r\nvanishing and rigidity theorems. The PI also proposed to extend\r\nhis methods to the moduli space of stable bundles and study\r\nvanishing theorems by using canonical metrics.\r\n\r\nThe theory of moduli space of Riemann surfaces has many\r\napplication in mathematics, physics and computer graphics. The\r\nintersection theory on the moduli spaces is one of the key parts\r\nin the modern string theory. Furthermore, it leads to significant\r\nimprovements in image recognition, compression and\r\ndecompression. The traditional method is to triangulate a surface\r\nby picking millions of vertices and record the combinatoric\r\ndata. Thus a huge amount of calculations are needed. In\r\ndifferential geometry, the Torelli theorem tells us that the\r\ncomplex structure of a surface is determined by its Hodge\r\nstructure. Thus one only need to record the data of the Hodge\r\nstructure of a surface in order to reconstruct the surface. The\r\nsize of the data of the Hodge structure is much smaller than the\r\nsize of the data from triangulation. Thus a numerically efficient\r\nmethod to link a surface and its Hodge structure will\r\ndramatically simplify the procedure of image processing and\r\nimprove its efficiency and accuracy.\r\n",
