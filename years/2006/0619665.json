 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acquisition supported by this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI)\r\ngrant consists of a modular wave tank and related wave making and data collecting\r\ninstrumentation to be housed in the new Fluids Lab at the University of\r\nNorth Carolina.  The proposed modular wave tank has been designed with\r\nmaximum flexibility in mind.  Much of fluid mechanics takes place across multiple scales, and their\r\nnonlinear coupling is arguably one of the most challenging features of\r\ntheoretical and experimental science. With this instrument the team of PIs and\r\nparticipants will be able to probe into phenomena, some of them newly discovered\r\nin the existing Mathematics Fluid Lab or in field experiments by Marine Science faculty, as never\r\nbefore. From mixing in stratified jets and their generation and\r\ninteraction  with internal waves, to sedimentation of particles in stratified fluids and their\r\nentrainment phenomena, to large internal solitary wave propagation from deep to\r\nshallow topography with forcing and breaking, to boundary layer sediment\r\ntransport  by surface wave motion, the host of experiments that the new instrumentation\r\nmakes possible is such as to guarantee intensive usage for many years to come.\r\nThe modularity of the new wave tank is designed so that each module can serve a different\r\npurpose, as well as allowing simultaneous experiments to take place in the\r\ndifferent modules. This will optimize time sharing as well as usage of resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe destructive powers of water, set in motion by large natural forces, have been painfully\r\nillustrated by the tragic events that marked the recent past. Tsunamis and\r\nhurricane surges have taken untold lives, and cost hundreds of billions of\r\ndollars in damage. The primary means to mitigate the effects of these uncontrollable\r\nnatural forces is accurate prediction and forecast, which in turn relies on fundamental\r\nunderstanding of the physical phenomena at play. Close integration of experimental\r\nand mathematical modelling is becoming more and more recognized as the most\r\nsuccessful approach to study this range of fluids problems. The proposed instrumentation\r\nis dedicated to the study of the relevant physical processes that govern the dynamics of\r\nwater emulating these natural events, with the ultimate goal of improving predictive capabilities.\r\nThe visual  appeal of fluid motion and the challenge of its mathematical modeling\r\nwill further extend the proposed instrumentation into a primary educational tool able\r\nto attract bright undergraduate students to careers in the sciences, thereby increasing\r\nthe competency of our workforce in these fields of national interest.\r\n",
