The symposium is co-organized by Professor Anne Kiremidjian of Stanford University, Professor J. Ou of Harbin Institute of Technology in China, Professor Y. Xiang of Zhejiang University in China, and Professor Y. Fujino of University of Tokyo in Japan.  The symposium will address a number of challenging topics, including: theory and technologies of structural vibration and control, smart materials and smart structures, devices and systems for structural health monitoring and control, and high performance sensors.  By bringing together leading researchers from the United States, China and Japan, this workshop is intended to identify areas for mutually beneficial research collaboration, and provide a forum to explore specific approaches for advancing such collaborations.  The participation of junior researchers and graduate students will expose them to cutting-edge research ideas in their field, as well as help them to develop a network of international contacts.  NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems are jointly supporting U.S. participants in the workshop.\r\n",
