 "awd_abstract_narration": "All multicellular organisms face the challenge of balancing cell proliferation with cell differentiation and patterning.  Defects in this balance can lead to malformed organs, to neural degeneration and to cancerous growth.  In plants, this coordination challenge is exemplified by the creation and organization of stomata, the epidermal structures that regulate the exchange of carbon dioxide and water vapor between plants and the atmosphere.  The overall density and distribution of stomata on the plant requires the integration of information from cell intrinsic factors, from local cell-cell interactions and from the environment.  The experiments in this proposal identify and characterize genes required to promote stomatal development. A series of molecular and genetic approaches will be used to address the role of a transcription factor, FAMA, in the repression of cell division and promotion of stomatal development and to identify its partners and targets.  Additionally, new mutations identified in a novel screen for stomatal promoting genes will be characterized and mapped.  These studies should contribute to an understanding of the developmental mechanisms by which plants control the density and pattern of stomata, and may lead to strategies for manipulating gas exchange for improved growth of crop plants and  biomass production. Portions of the project will be carried out by undergraduate students, several of whom are from groups traditionally underrepresented in science; this will expose promising young students to scientific research. Early exposure to the logic and methodology of basic research will facilitate their involvement in future scientific endeavors.",
