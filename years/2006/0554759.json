 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective and intellectual merit of this project lies in developing \r\na new paradigm and run-time system for distributed computing in sensor networks, \r\ncalled environmentally immersive programming. Environmentally immersive \r\nprogramming is an object-based paradigm that allows integration of objects \r\nthat live in physical time and space as components in the computational \r\nenvironment of an application. A new middleware, called EnviroSuite, is \r\nbuilt to demonstrate the first working environmentally immersive programming \r\nsystem. Geared for environmental monitoring applications, this programming \r\nsystem allows virtual objects to be dynamically instantiated and logically \r\nattached to selected external entities or conditions in the physical environment\r\nfor monitoring purposes. Each such object encapsulates the monitored entity's \r\naggregate state, performs entity-specific computation, and serves as the \r\nvirtual communication port of the particular physical entity in the application \r\nprogrammer's world. An important part of the proposed work is to address the \r\nproblem of unique representation of physical entities that are external to \r\nthe computing system, but whose presence is inferred via sensory input. The \r\ncomplexity of this problem arises from the need to maintain consistency and \r\npersistent state in the face of external object movement, message loss and \r\nsensor false alarms. The utility of the middleware developed in this project \r\nis demonstrated on realistic sensor network testbed using current sensor node\r\nhardware.\r\n",
