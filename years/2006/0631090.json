 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Research Scholars Program in Mathematics is to attract, retain, and graduate academically talented, financially needy students with degrees in mathematics. The program uses a multi-faced approach to provide a comprehensive educational environment for students in mathematics, especially traditionally underrepresented groups. The program integrates long established in-place campus support structures and academic initiatives with new and innovative approaches to provide a comprehensive, challenging, yet supportive, academic environment for students in mathematics. These include faculty mentoring, academic advising, and enrollment in special seminars focused on careers and graduate school. Special seminars are designed to help scholarship students better understand the range of career options, prepare academically for these options, and develop relationships with industrial people. The program includes an enhanced curriculum that incorporates new and innovative courses and research or internships experiences with dedicated faculty mentors and industrial partners to ensure excellent training of a new generation of mathematicians. Each year the program provides 8 scholarships to undergraduate students and 8 to graduate students. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: A major component of the project is the integration of research into the traditional mathematics curriculum through the utilization of existing courses augmented with new and innovative courses designed to guide students towards research and/or internships. The curriculum-research integration is boosted through interdisciplinary research seminars at the university as well as from local industrial partners and co-op opportunities. Scholarship recipients are encouraged and assisted by faculty mentors to make professional contacts, participate in tours of industry locations, attend professional conferences, and become members in student chapters of professional/academic societies. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The impacts of the program are multi-layered and directly relevant to the needs of the high technological society of today. Talented students with financial needs who are largely from traditionally underrepresented groups in mathematics are guided through a rigorous academic program toward a timely graduation. Graduates of the program who choose academic careers impact the philosophy of teaching mathematics and the culture of mathematics departments. Students who utilize their mathematics degrees in the high technological workforce fill the technical needs of employers and help diversify the workforce. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
