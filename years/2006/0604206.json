 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nProfessor Kuhn has a long record of developing homotopy and \r\nrepresentation theoretic methods to solve problems in both topology \r\nand algebra.  Recently, he has discovered some remarkable connections \r\nbetween two of the main strands of homotopy theory as studied over the \r\npast 25 years: homotopy as organized into its `periodic' layers (as in \r\nthe work of M.Hopkins), and homotopy as organized using sophisticated \r\nhomotopical algebraic decomposition techniques (as in the work of \r\nT.Goodwillie).  The largest part of this project concerns the \r\ncontinued exploration of these connections, and the continued \r\ndevelopment of tools for exploiting this.  A second part will focus on \r\nsome problems in finite group cohomology exploiting primitives \r\nassociated to central extensions. Specific older work of his to be \r\nbrought to bear on these questions include his work on the Whitehead \r\nConjecture, Bousfield--Kuhn telescopic functors, \r\nHopkins--Kuhn--Ravenel generalized characters, and unstable modules \r\nover the Steenrod algebra.\r\n\r\nHomotopy theory and group cohomology are mathematical subjects in \r\nwhich one is trying to discover, and ultimately classify, fundamental \r\n\"building blocks\" of structure: homotopy dealing with deformations of \r\ngeometric objects such as higher dimensional surfaces, and group \r\ncohomology being concerned with analyzing symmetries of both geometric \r\nand algebraic objects.  A sample homotopy problem is to understand the \r\n\"shape\" of all continuous functions from a surface to itself. A sample \r\ngroup cohomology problem is to understand the way in which very basic \r\nsubgroups of symmetries \"control\" the behavior of more complicated \r\nsymmetry groups. Professor Kuhn is studying these subjects by \r\ndeveloping a variety of state-of-the-art algebraic and homotopy \r\ntheoretic tools. By their very nature, many of these tools involve \r\n\"universal\" constructions of interest to researchers in other \r\nscientific disciplines ranging from computer science to robotics.\r\n",
