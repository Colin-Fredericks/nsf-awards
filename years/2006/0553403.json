 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies two topics: statistical\r\nhydrodynamics, and various combinatorial models with their\r\nconnections to random matrix theory.  With regard to infinite\r\ndimensional stochastic equations and statistical hydrodynamics,\r\nthe investigator focuses on three questions.  The first concerns\r\nthe structure of typical solutions for nonlinear stochastic\r\npartial differential equations such as the two-dimensional\r\nstochastic Navier-Stokes equations and the stochastic Burgers\r\nequation.  The second concerns the uniqueness of steady states for\r\ninviscid randomly forced equations on unbounded domains.  The\r\nthird concerns the mechanism of energy transfer from high to low\r\nmodes in stochastically forced formally conservative systems.  For\r\neach of these questions new analytic approaches and new phenomena\r\nhave been described.  A goal of this work is to more completely\r\nanalyze these phenomena.  In combinatorics, growth models, and\r\nrandom matrix theory the investigator studies basic questions of\r\nGaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) random matrix theory, focusing\r\non the connection of symmetrized combinatorial models to limiting\r\ndistributions of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble.  The questions\r\nconsidered include problems of random tiling that arise in\r\nphysics, polynuclear growth models that arise in the study of\r\nrandom interfaces, and percolation models that arise in condensed\r\nmatter physics and electrical engineering.  A goal of the work is\r\nto prove new central limit theorems in the context of GOE random\r\nmatrix theory. \r\n\r\n     Understanding the small-scale structure of stochastically\r\nforced hydrodynamic equations is related to turbulence theory and\r\nstatistical mechanics.  The small-scale structure of solutions is\r\nof both theoretical and experimental importance.  It is this\r\nstructure that matters in turbulent flows arising in many concrete\r\nproblems of aerodynamics and fluid mechanics.  The particular\r\nquestiuons studied here contribute to the current understanding of\r\nthis small-scale structure.  It has recently become clear that\r\nrandom matrix theory techniques answer a wide range of questions\r\nin a variety of seemingly unrelated fields.  Essentially, random\r\nmatrix theory affords a model that captures the fluctuations of\r\nmany distinct processes.  The questions studied in this project\r\nwiden this class of problems and processes and improve the current\r\nunderstanding of the various phenomena that lead to random matrix\r\nstatistics.",
