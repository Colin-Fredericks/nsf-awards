 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support is being provided for a conference on the representation\r\ntheory of p-adic groups that will take place at the University of Iowa\r\nfrom October 19, 2006 to October, 22, 2006. Professor David\r\nManderscheid, Principal Investigator on this grant and Chair of the\r\nDepartment of Mathematics at the University of Iowa, is the local\r\norganizer for the conference. The Scientific Committee for the\r\nconference consists of Prof. Colin Bushnell (Kings College, University\r\nof London), Prof. Guy Henniart (University of Paris - Orsay), Prof.\r\nFreydoon Shahidi (Purdue University) and Prof. Manderscheid. The\r\nconference will focus on the recent developments in the representation\r\ntheory of p-adic groups that are arithmetic in nature. In particular\r\nthe conference will focus on the use of the theory of types and covers\r\ndue to Bushnell and Kutzko.\r\n\r\nThe conference is particularly timely as the study of the\r\nrepresentation theory of p-adic groups has proved critical in the\r\nsolution of important problems in number theory through what is called\r\nthe Langlands Program. These results included the proof of Fermat's\r\nLast Theorem and, more recently, the proof of the Local Langlands\r\nConjecture for the general linear group. In awarding support for\r\nconference attendance, preference will be given to graduate students\r\nand recent Ph.D.'s. Approximately seventy mathematicians will attend\r\nthe conference. The conference will attract national and international\r\nattention and it will help set the research agenda for the field.\r\n",
