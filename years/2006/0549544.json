 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator plans to expand his recent research on treatment choice with partial knowledge of treatment response, which has developed out of his earlier work on partial identification. Part of the research will\r\naddress general methodological questions and another part will investigate specific substantive problems of\r\nsocial planning. He also will continue his longstanding program of research on partial identification per se.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The investigators research on identification is deliberately conservative. The traditional\r\nway to cope with sampling processes that partially identify population parameters has been to combine the\r\navailable data with assumptions strong enough to yield point identification. Such assumptions often are not\r\nwell motivated, and empirical researchers often debate their validity. Conservative analysis enables\r\nresearchers to learn from the available data without imposing untenable assumptions. It enables establishment\r\nof a domain of consensus among researchers who may hold disparate beliefs about what assumptions are\r\nappropriate. It also makes plain the limitations of the available data.\r\nThe investigators analysis of treatment choice is similarly conservative. His research shows how\r\nsocial planners and other decision makers can cope coherently with difficult problems of choice under\r\nambiguity induced by identification problems and the necessity of statistical inference from sample data,\r\nwithout imposing untenable assumptions. This is achieved using well-established principles of statistical\r\ndecision theory, particularly through application of the minimax-regret criterion.\r\nBroader Impacts: Many persistent public policy controversies reflect divergent beliefs about the effects of\r\ngovernment policy on society. Such divergent beliefs are often manifest in dueling policy studies that use\r\ndifferent analytical approaches or data sources to reach different policy conclusions. Each study may make\r\nsense in its own terms, each combining data with conjectures to draw logically valid conclusions. However,\r\nthere may be no way to determine which study (if either) makes realistic conjectures and which (if either)\r\ndraws empirically correct conclusions. The investigators conservative approach to empirical inference and\r\ntreatment choice can enable the public to better evaluate the credibility of existing policy studies, enhance\r\nthe credibility of future policy research, and improve the quality of policymaking",
