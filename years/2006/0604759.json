The ``Lagrangian Hodge Conjecture'' states that given an\r\nintegral lagrangian homology class in a Calabi-Yau manifold there is a special\r\nlagrangian cycle that represents this class. This conjecture is now known to\r\nbe false in a Calabi-Yau surface (a K3 surface). The failure of the conjecture\r\nis closely related to the existence of singularities (other than branch\r\npoints) on minimizing lagrangians.  This project aims to answer a related\r\nconjecture, the ``Deformation Lagrangian Hodge Conjecture'': Given a\r\none-parameter family of Calabi-Yau metrics whose associated Kaehler forms have\r\nfixed cohomology class and given a lagrangian homology class, suppose that the\r\ninitial metric in the family admits a special lagrangian cycle that represents\r\nthe lagrangian homology class. Then, we conjecture, that the metrics in the\r\none-parameter family sufficient close to the initial metric also admit special\r\nlagrangian cycles that represents this class. This conjecture has been\r\nestablished in the two dimension case (the case of special lagrangian surfaces\r\nin K3 surfaces) and in the case that the initial special lagrangian is an\r\nimmersion. It is known that the mean curvature flow of a smooth lagrangian\r\nsubmanifold preserves the lagrangian condition if the ambient manifold is\r\nKaehler-Einstein. The project intends to investigate various questions about\r\nthe behavior of lagrangians under this flow, in particular, to study examples\r\nthat can be used either to give counter-examples to the Thomas-Yau conjecture\r\nor show that any such counter-example must be global.\r\n\r\nVariational problems with geometric constraints, deformation problems and mean\r\ncurvature flow in codimension greater than one are on the frontier of\r\nmathematical analysis. These problems are natural in geometry but they are\r\nalso important in many different applied problems. For example, in material\r\nscience a model problem asks to find a minimizer of ``kinetic energy'' among\r\narea preserving maps between disks and to find the optimal smoothness of the\r\nminimizer.  Parts of this project are closely related to this kind of\r\nexistence and regularity question and therefore to developing techniques at\r\nthe foundations of the theory of non-linear elasticity. In string theory, a\r\nbranch of theoretical physics, well known work conjectures the existence of a\r\ncertain class of volume minimizing three dimensional surfaces called special\r\nlagrangian submanifolds. This project is a direct attempt to resolve this\r\nconjecture.  Mean curvature flow in various codimensions models many different\r\nphysical phenomena, including, for example, flame propagation. This project\r\nattempts to exploit the ``lagrangian'' constraint to get an understanding of\r\nmean curvature flow in higher codimensions. The techniques investigated in\r\nthis project hold the promise of enhancing the interaction between geometry\r\nand various fields of applied mathematics and engineering and in bringing new\r\nresults and techniques into these fields.\r\n",
