 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will attempt to modify biocatalysts so that they can catalyze industrially relevant reactions.  The first objective is to identify and extend the essential catalytic elements in epoxide hydrolases in order for them to accept external nucleophiles.  Ability of the epoxide hydrolases to accept external nucleophiles could lead to non-natural but synthetically useful reactions.  The second objective is to identify and extend the essential catalytic elements in hydroxynitrile lyase in order for them to accept carbon nucleophiles other than cyanide.  This objective could also lead to non-natural but synthetically useful reactions.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Romas J. Kazlauskas of the Department of Biochemistry at University of Minnesota-Twin Cities.  Professor Kazlauskas's research efforts revolve around the modification of biocatalysts to catalyze non-natural but synthetically useful reactions.  Such reactions are environmentally friendly, as they reduce costs as well as pollution.  These reactions could improve the preparation of fine chemicals, which are needed in chemical and pharmaceutical industries.",
