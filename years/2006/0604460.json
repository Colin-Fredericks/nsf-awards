 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a workshop scheduled for July 10-14, 2006 in Boulder, CO.  The workshop is entitled \"Expanding the Use of Models as Educational Tools in the Atmospheric and Related Sciences.\"  The primary goals of the workshop are to: 1) provide a means for faculty to expand the use of computational models in traditional undergraduate and graduate courses, which will serve to help familiarize students with numerical models, display software, and web-based scripting languages, while allowing a hands-on, visual approach that have been developed by the faculty in our community; 2) promote the sharing of existing resources that have been developed by the faculty in our community; this sharing will allow us to learn from one another as to how to best package simple models as educational tools; 3) levels (i.e., freshman to senior undergraduate students, and graduate students).  That is, what concepts are essential to integrate into our courses, and what knowledge and proficiencies should we realistically expect in our graduates with regard to numerical modeling?  Related objectives include (i) assembling a collection of models (and accompanying educational packaging) designed for use in teaching fundamental concepts of atmospheric science to undergraduate and graduate students; (ii) identifying and developing creative uses of computational and visualization technology for use as \"hands on\" instructional tools to be made available to workshop participants.",
