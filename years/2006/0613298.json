 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Kenneth W. Hedberg and Prof. Alan D. Richardson of Oregon State University and their undergraduate research students will study the structures of a variety of interesting and unusual molecules using the technique of gaseous electron diffraction, combined with sophisticated theoretical chemistry methods.  Some of the molecules to be studied include molecules with internal hydrogen bonds, six- and eight-membered ring systems which undergo pseudorotation, and fullerene fragments, to name a few.  The ultimate goal of this research is to enrich our understanding of the structure and dynamics of complex molecules.\r\n \r\nProfs. Hedberg and Richardson and their students will benefit from rich collaborations with international colleagues, both at Oregon State and overseas, where a smaller number of the senior research students will have the opportunity for an extended research visit with collaborators in Norway or Scotland.  The undergraduate students working in the Hedberg laboratory will also have the opportunity to participate in organized activities offered by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute-Sponsored Summer Undergraduate Research Program, further enriching their research experience.\r\n",
