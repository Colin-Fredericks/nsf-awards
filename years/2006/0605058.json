 "awd_abstract_narration": "Luc Rey-Bellet works in several directions in statistical mechanics,\r\nboth in equilibrium and non-equilibrium. (a) The construction and the\r\nergodic properties of stationary states for stochastic partial\r\ndifferential equations arising from a model of a nonlinear\r\nKlein-Gordon equation coupled to one or several heat reservoirs.  (b)\r\nThe validity of the fluctuation theorem for entropy production in some\r\nclass of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems, such as billiards. This\r\ninvolves the development of large deviations techniques for such\r\nsystems. (c) The validity of the fluctuation theorem for the entropy\r\nproduction in classical and quantum open systems.  (d) The development\r\nof higher-order coarse-graining numerical schemes for Monte-Carlo\r\nmethods.  Many fundamental problems in non-equilibrium statistical\r\nmechanics remain poorly understood, both at the conceptual and\r\nmathematical level: for example the characterization of non-equilibrium\r\nstationary states of driven open systems. The fluctuation theorem of\r\nGallavotti and Cohen is a new universal property of these states and\r\nits study in various systems (deterministic, random and quantum) will\r\nbe one of the main theme in the work of the investigator. Multiscale\r\nnumerical methods and the general question of extracting the relevant\r\ndegrees of freedom out of complex systems is a problem of paramount\r\nimportance in modern applied mathematics.  The investigator proposes\r\nto use probabilistic techniques from statistical mechanics (cluster\r\nexpansion and renormalization group) to develop efficient numerical\r\nschemes for the coarse-graining of Monte-Carlo methods.  The proposal\r\nof the investigator, besides its theoretical aspects, has a number of\r\napplications to various concrete physical models. These applications\r\nare integrated (via numerical or analytical work) into graduate\r\nresearch projects.  The project involves several collaborations with\r\nresearchers in U.S. institutions and abroad. The project also helps to\r\nthe dissemination of modern mathematical tools, in particular\r\nprobabilistic ones, into applied sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe field of statistical mechanics is the physical and mathematical\r\ntheory which attempts to link the microscopic and macroscopic worlds.\r\nThe microscopic world, the world of atoms and molecules, is described\r\nby the laws of Newtonian or Quantum mechanics which involve a huge\r\nnumber of equations. The macroscopic world on the contrary is usually\r\ndescribed by a few parameters or equations, such as pressure,\r\ntemperature, electrical and thermal conductivity, etc... This\r\nreduction comes from the fact that a very large number of particles,\r\nseen from through macroscopic lenses, behave in a very regular\r\nfashion. For example, in a well isolated room, the temperature\r\nthroughout the room will be nearly constant. Another example is a\r\npiece of metal heated at one end and cooled at the other end: there\r\nwill be a flow of energy from the hot part to the cold part but\r\n(almost) never in the opposite direction. This phenomena are similar,\r\nboth in spirit and in mathematical terms to the following: if one \r\nthrows an unbiased coin very many times then the proportion of head\r\nwill be extremely close to one half and (almost) never exhibit\r\nsignificant deviations. It turns out that to study this typical\r\nbehavior it is very useful to study and characterize the rare events\r\ncorresponding to untypical behavior, i.e., \"large deviations\". Having\r\na detailed understanding of the atypical behavior of a very large\r\nnumber of particles is in fact the clue to a fundamental understanding\r\nof what is really typical. Theses ideas, which go back to the founding\r\nfathers of physics and probability theory, and their implementations\r\nin various physical situations form the core of the proposal.\r\n",
