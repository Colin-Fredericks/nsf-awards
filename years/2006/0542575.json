 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been award to Dr. Daniel Graf of the Academy of Natural Sciences in collaboration with Melanie Stiassny of the American Museum of Natural History to survey the diversity of freshwater mollusks (clams and snails) in the Lower Congo River of Western Africa. These organisms are of interest to biologists not only because they have interesting evolutionary histories but also as intermediate hosts of disease-causing parasites. The lowest reach of the Congo is punctuated by numerous powerful rapids, and it is expected that these cataracts constitute barriers to aquatic dispersal and therefore contribute to the endemic diversity of the area. Through sampling expeditions to the Lower Congo, the specimens collected for this research can be used to test hypotheses of evolutionary relationships and biogeographic processes, both at the population level and among species on a continent-wide scale. The result will be a clearer understanding of the origin and maintenance of biological diversity in western Africa.\r\n The data and conclusions generated by this research will not only be made available through traditional media but will also take advantage of modern means of dissemination, especially the internet (http://www.mussel-project.net/). An important component of the internet presence for this project will be the use of powerful database technology to provide searching and browsing interfaces into the data and conclusions, with multiple points of entry. The target audience for this research is not only scientists and conservation officials; these results will also serve teachers, students and all members of the public interested in better understanding their world. Besides providing a novel scientific perspective on an interesting, important but poorly known fauna, this study will also serve to train up-and-coming biologists  including Congolese faculty and students  through hands-on research experience.\r\n",
