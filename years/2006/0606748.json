The principle tool to be employed is high resolution spectroscopy which here\r\nwill be developed and calibrated through \"fine analysis techniques\" for obtaining\r\nfundamental parameters of single very low mass objects. These will in turn be applied to\r\na broad set of both field objects and objects in star forming regions. Moreover, these\r\nderived parameters will be used to calibrate and improve evolutionary models of very\r\nlow mass objects, both to understand their early evolution and to place the use of\r\nevolutionary models in understanding star formation on a better footing for very low\r\nmasses. Observations of low mass objects in binaries will be used to gain a better\r\nunderstanding of the binary frequency and separation distribution of very low mass\r\nobjects as a means of testing models of their formation modes and to help in\r\nunderstanding the process of multi-object formation itself in a new parameter regime. In\r\naddition, studies of studies of rotation and activity in low mass objects will be continued\r\nby pursuing actual magnetic field measurements as well as a broader sample of different\r\ntypes of objects. Finally, the study of the effects of composition on the atmospheric\r\nchemistry and spectral formation in very low mass objects will be begun as part of the\r\neffort to calibrate the fundamental parameters of M and early L stars.\r\nThis project will support the thesis work of a new graduate student as well as contribute\r\nto the training of the next generation of scientists in working in this group. Dr. Basri\r\nregularly engages in public outreach through talks and through the media and his\r\nactivities in these areas will continue.",
