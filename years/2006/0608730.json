 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate the influence of nanoelectrode atomic structure on the stability and electronic transport properties of molecular tunnel junctions.  The approach is to use atomic layer engineering to control the nanoelectrode microstructure and to measure electrical properties of the molecular tunnel junctions.  Experiments will control the atomic structure and chemical bonding in metal-molecule-metal junctions and measure physical, chemical, and electrical properties of the molecular junctions.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merits of the proposed research are the science and engineering of active nanostructures.  The engineering of molecular devices requires the understanding and control of charge transport through molecules at electrode-molecule junctions.  Previous studies have contributed much understanding, but a rudimentary knowledge of how molecules position between nanoelectrodes, and the influence of atomic structure is lacking.  The proposed research presents a novel experimental approach that will advance the knowledge of molecular devices.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed research include technology impacts and the integration of education and research.  Technology impacts of the proposed work include the invention of new technologies based on molecular devices.  Such technologies may enable active nanostructures that extend computing, electronic memory, bio-chemical sensing, or energy harvesting beyond the limits of modern technologies.  The proposed research will generate new scientific understanding that will benefit society through active nanostructures that protect us from threats and improve our quality of living.  Education impacts include the integration of undergraduate students in nanotechnology research, and curriculum development to build an educated workforce skilled in the area of nanotechnology.",
