 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nFaced with model uncertainty, model selection methods are commonly employed in applied empirical\r\nresearch. Improved estimation and inference can be obtained by model averaging, replacing the\r\ndiscontinuities implicit in selection by smooth averaging. An econometric methodology for model\r\naveraging is undeveloped. Bayesian model averaging methods have been developed, but frequentist\r\nmethods are missing, with the notable exception of the recent contribution of Hjort and Claeskens (2003).\r\nThe latter contribution is concerned with likelihood-based models. There are no model averaging\r\nmethods appropriate for the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), which is arguably the most\r\ncommon estimation framework in econometrics.\r\nThe PIs proposal is to develop model averaging methods for GMM. The PIs follow Hjort and Claeskens (2003)\r\nby using a local-to-zero parameterization to develop an asymptotic mean-square-error calculation which\r\ncontains a bias-variance trade-off. Using this framework, the PIs can calculate the asymptotic MSE of modelaveraged\r\nGMM, and propose bias-corrected estimates of the MSE. Estimates of the model average\r\nweights are functions of these MSE estimates, and are computed using quadratic programming. The\r\nresult is the PIs proposed GMM model average estimates. In simulations, these estimates are found to possess\r\ngood finite sample MSE properties.\r\nThe research suggested in this proposal is at a preliminary stage of development. The theory needs to be\r\nfully worked out. Broader conditions and assumptions need to be incorporated to make the analysis more\r\nbroadly applicable. Model averaging can be extended to include average over instrument sets (averaging\r\nover moment conditions). The theory should also be extended to incorporate large instrument\r\nasymptotics. A particularly thorny issue will be inference. Similar to model selection, model averaging\r\nproduces estimates whose sampling distributions cannot be consistently estimated. Robust inference\r\nmethods will need to be developed which are sensitive to this issue. These topics and issues will be\r\nexplored in the execution of this proposal.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nModel averaging methods are growing in popularity in applied econometrics. The proposed methods will\r\nhave broad potential empirical application. It is expected that the theory and methods uncovered by this\r\nresearch will find productive use by applied economists both in academics and the public sector.",
