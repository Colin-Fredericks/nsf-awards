 "awd_abstract_narration": "Great Science for Girls: Extension Services for Gender Equity in Science through After-School Programs (GSG Extension Services) will use 21st century technologies in combination with in-person professional development, customized consulting services, and evidence-based, gender-equitable curricula to create a unified program of change around girls and STEM. The project will bring together the Educational Equity Center at the Academy for Educational Development (EEC/AED) and two AED Centers that have worked extensively in the after-school field: the Center for Youth Development and Policy Research (CYD) and the National Training Institute for Community Youth Work (NTI) as partners. In addition, the project will work in partnership with regional intermediary organizations that provide training and technical assistance to after-school centers; and after-school centers directly serving girls and other underserved youth.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit-- GSG Extension Services will build the capacity of after-school centers to deliver evidence-based programming that provides a learning environment for girls that includes opportunities for leadership; active, intelligent engagement with concerned adults and other students; inquiry-based, hands-on experimentation; risk-taking; challenges and problem-solving; cooperative learning; and fun.  Integral to this project will be EEC/AED's Science, Gender and After-school On-Line Community of Practice (COP).  The COP will serve as an online virtual support system for program implementation, and an important follow-up tool for program participants. In addition, the COP will provide ongoing, cutting-edge information and services to a national client base, and act as a continuous link between researchers and practitioners.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: During the five-year project period, GSG Extension Services will make significant impact by building the capacity of 16 national intermediary organizations to implement the unified program of change with 10,880 youth workers in the 2,720 centers they serve, ultimately reaching 162,800 girls.  Through this comprehensive approach, GSG Extension Service will advance STEM opportunities for the large number of low and moderate-income girls and other underrepresented students who attend after-school programs.",
