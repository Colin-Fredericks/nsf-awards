However, to-date, the intrinsic self-assembling nanoscale structure of wood lignocellulose, as well as the versatility of its three key biopolymers, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, largely have been overlooked in nanoscale science and engineering.  This technical conference will provide researchers a forum to share state-of-the-art information on lignocellulosic biopolymers as nanomaterials and will provide a research pathway by which these lignocellulosic biopolymers will become the cornerstone of innovative structural and nonstructural nanoscale biomaterials that will contribute to the next generation of nanobiocomposite materials based on nature's preeminent renewable and sustainable resource.\r\n\tNSF support for the TAPPI \"2006 International Conference on Nanotechnology for the Forest Products Industry\" will enable a path-breaking research conference directed at visionary new opportunities for using nanoscale, lignocellulosic-derived biomaterials.  Specifically, this international technical conference will identify new and important avenues for nanoscale lignocellulosics as structural and nonstructural materials and will provide a forum for the reporting of recent state-of-the-art advances in nanoscience and engineering related to utilization of lignocellulosics from wood.  In addition, discussion panels and individual presenters will report on and identify key fundamental research and development challenges and knowledge gaps in using lignocelluloses and other materials in nanocomposites.  This conference will bring together world experts in lignocellulose and nanotechnology science and engineering to share information and foster collaboration nationally and internationally.\r\n",
