 "awd_abstract_narration": "A program of theoretical research on the interaction of light with cold, optically\r\nthick, atomic ensembles is proposed. Quantum control of the interface between light\r\nfields and atomic matter is essential for future scalable quantum network systems which\r\nhave application to the secure sharing of information between remote parties. The success\r\nof the implementation of atomic ensembles in that context depends on achieving high\r\nefficiency and long-lived coherence in their interaction with the light input and output\r\nchannels. The properties and characteristics of the interactions in such a multi-mode and\r\nmulti-atom system will be thoroughly addressed by means of the analytical and numerical\r\nmethods of atomic physics and quantum optics. The collective enhancement of the\r\ninteractions between the light field and multi-atom states of the ensemble provides an\r\norganizing principle for their understanding, as well as a mechanism for strong,\r\ndirectional coupling between light and matter. Another characteristic of light propagation\r\nin optically thick media, the mixed light/multi-atom excitation known as the dark state\r\npolariton, will be investigated as a means to perform controlled storage, and subsequent\r\nretrieval, of light pulses down to the single photon level. The research will focus on\r\nrealistic experimental scenarios including the study of relevant states of preparation of the\r\natomic ensemble, and the incident light fields. In this context, the coupling of ambient\r\nmagnetic fields to the spins of the atomic nucleus and electrons provides the primary\r\ndecoherence mechanism. This process and its impact on the overall storage and retrieval\r\nefficiency of the light field will be investigated in detail.\r\n",
