 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators develop numerical algorithms for simulation of \r\nincompressible deformable membranes interacting with Stokesian fluids, \r\nother membranes and rigid walls. The goal of this work is to enable \r\nhigh-accuracy fast simulations of systems consisting of large numbers \r\nof interacting vesicles. Investigated numerical methods are based on \r\na boundary integral formulation which only uses fields defined on the \r\nsurface and therefore eliminates the need for discretization of 3D \r\nspace, which considerably simplifies simulation of deformable \r\nboundaries. The dense linear systems of equations resulting from \r\ndiscretization and linearization of the boundary integral formulation \r\nare solved using extensions of kernel-independent fast multipole \r\nalgorithms previously developed by the investigators. The work \r\nincludes two main directions: discretization schemes for deformable \r\nsurfaces, based on constructive manifold structures on meshes and \r\nlocalized spectral bases, and boundary integral and membrane-fluid \r\ninteraction linear and nonlinear solvers. \r\n\r\nThe investigators aim to create efficient computational tools for \r\nsolving problems arising in a variety of biological and biomedical \r\ncontexts. Potential applications include simulation of blood cell \r\nbehavior in blood flow, formation of membranes in a fluid and design \r\nof targeted drug delivery mechanisms based on vesicles. Development \r\nof efficient tools for such problems makes it possible to test \r\nscenarios involving complex boundaries, large numbers of deforming \r\ncells or vesicles. \r\n",
