Through collaboration of three research groups, two based at universities  The University of Pittsburgh and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, and one from industry  The Dow Chemical Company, talent and experience will be pooled to explore the frontier of plug structures, providing a unique collaboration for linkages between industry and academia.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThe proposed study will delve into the plug-flow behavior and structure by applying experimental and modeling efforts to developing the breadth and depth of the information base on the plug, investigating the frictional distribution around the circumference of the plug, and coupling the associated normal load of the plug to the frictional distribution. The pick-up forces for particles being conveyed, the internal structure of the plug and the friction that is exerted between the moving plug and the stationary deposited layer of particles will be compared to predictions from a force balance model.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThis GOALI award will provide the opportunity of interaction between academic researchers and an industrial partner. It can have a significant impact on the design of pneumatic conveying transport systems, both within the company and on a broader industrial level. The collaboration is a unique opportunity to use the industrial scale conveying laboratory for fundamental studies. The research will provide a rich environment for student learning, faculty enhancement and industrial enrichment through an intimate interaction in the fundamental understanding and design of dense-phase conveying systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
