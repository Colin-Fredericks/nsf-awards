The theory of C*-algebras will provide \r\nthe basic reference point and meeting ground for the various components.\r\nOne of the main objectives is to push forward the\r\ndevelopment of an abstract theory of C*-dynamics which, in the spirit of \r\ntopological dynamics, sees as its primary object of study the long-term \r\nbehavior of systems as captured by properties like entropy and mixing. \r\nThis project will be pursued by building on links to the\r\nlocal theory of Banach spaces and making novel use of the perturbation \r\ntechniques of C*-algebra classification theory, with a view towards \r\napplications in noncommutative metric and differential geometry, \r\nC*-algebra structure and representation theory, and operator space\r\ngeometry.\r\n\r\nOne way in which the notion of chaos manifests itself is through the \r\nunpredictability exhibited by many complex systems as they \r\nevolve with time. This unpredictability can be made mathematically precise \r\nin several distinct ways depending on the exact kind of behavior one wants\r\nto emphasize, such as mixing or sensitivity to initial conditions. Determining\r\nthe relationships between the various phenomena encompassed \r\nby and related to the term chaos, including most notably entropy, \r\nis a major ongoing project in the theory of dynamical systems, and has \r\npractical interest for example in the effort to gauge the accuracy of \r\ncomputer simulations. \r\nWhile there exists a vast array of results for the type of\r\nsystems which are used to model classical physics, the theory is much less \r\ndeveloped for quantum systems as described mathematically by operator algebras.\r\nThe broad aim of the proposal is to open up new perspectives on long-term\r\nbehavior in quantum dynamics and at the same time to shed new light \r\non classical dynamical phenomena by means of functional-analytic tools.\r\n",
