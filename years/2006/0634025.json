 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central premise of the proposed project is that a unique connection exists between analogical reasoning and scientific learning and innovation. The investigators explore the question of how it is that a particular type of analogy, cross-domain analogy, especially supports learning and creativity. First, they will attempt to identify the cognitive and neural components that make cross-domain analogy a powerful form of reasoning. Their analyses will include an examination of individual differences that covary with behavioral and neural markers of cross-domain analogical thinking. Second, they will examine how cross-domain analogies can be used as tools to enhance learning and retention. They will also test cross-domain analogy as a teaching tool by examining whether cross-domain analogies help students form and retain correct understanding of commonly misunderstood science concepts. Third, they will test the extent to which cross-domain analogy can be used to enhance creative thinking in an engineering education context.\r\n",
