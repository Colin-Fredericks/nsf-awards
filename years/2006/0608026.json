 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study to assess variation in DNA sequences of chloroplast genes to determine if morphologically indistinguishable populations of plants are genetically different enough to be recognized as new species and what has contributed to this difference. As a model, two groups of closely related alpine species in the genus Synthyris (Plantaginaceae) will be genetically evaluated. Synthyris chloroplast genes are variable within and among species and populations. By comparing the amount of variation in genes among the species with genetic change within a species, it should be possible to identify genetic change that occurred during and following speciation. The distribution of genetically distinct lineages should suggest processes of evolution related to geographic and climate change.\r\n\r\nResults of this study will contribute to an understanding of the evolutionary processes that have resulted in the plant diversity of the Rocky Mountains. Patterns of genetic diversity revealed can be used to manage species diversity on public lands. Results will be published in scientific journals and distributed to resource managers in areas where this study is conducted. This research will contribute to understanding the biodiversity and biogeography of the American West based on different patterns of genetic diversity in plants on the landscape.\r\n\r\n",
