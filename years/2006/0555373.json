 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThis project supports student travel to the 44th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) in Seville, Spain, December 10-14, 2005.  The IEEE CDC  is the premier annual international conference on systems and automatic control research.  The 44th CDC is being held jointly for the first time with the European Control Conference (ECC) with an expected level of participation over 1500.  The technical merit of the project is that it enables US graduate students to participate in a high quality, rigorously peer-reviewed event attended by many of the world leaders in systems and control.  Over 1400 reseach presentations, six plenary and semi-plenary lectures by renowned researchers, as well as numerous tutorial presentations, workshops and exhibits provide exposure to state-of-the-art in emerging areas of control research and technology.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the project is that it will help train the next generation of control researchers and practitioners.  Modern society is increasingly reliant on sensing and control technology, from control of the power grid, to the Internet, automobiles, aircraft, refineries, power plants, and automated manufacturing systems.  The future security and well-being of the United States relies on maintaining a pools of trained scientists and engineers in critical areas such as control technology.  The students supported under the present project represent the future technological leaders of the IEEE Control Systems Society, which is the world's premier professional society in systems and control.\r\n",
