The work will develop novel and effective methods to fabricate and control anisotropy to a variety of high aspect ratio, functional nanoparticles, which often have inherent chemical, electrical, magnetic, and optical anisotropy, and can interact with biomolecules such as proteins and cells in fundamentally new ways. Molecular self-assembly and nanofabrication methods will be used to optimize the nanobio-functionalized particle systems on electrodes. Novel nanobio-electronic interfaces based on the nanoparticle system will be constructed by electrostatically or covalently networking the particles onto electrodes. The physical, chemical and electrical properties of the novel bio-electronic interfaces will be studied using optical measurements; electrochemical measurements; and physical measurements. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThe proposed high aspect ratio nanoparticles made of functional polystyrene nanoparticles, gold, silver and nickel can be easily functionalized with alkane thiols, silanes, and polyelectrolytes. The resulting functional nanoparticles are expected to exhibit unique and valuable properties due to their nanoscale dimensions and diverse shapes. Combining these functional nanoparticles with proteins and functional nanobuilding blocks could yield revolutionary new technologies, including new classes of high-performance biosensors biological fuel cells, biocatalysts, and biofunctional nanomachines for medical research. The proposed effort will leverage existing courses by providing MBL research projects each semester the course is offered. Multidisciplinary teams of MBL students will be assigned to PIs and co-PIs research laboratories to conduct a semester-long research projects under the direction of a faculty advisor and a research mentor (i.e., a graduate student).\r\n\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nProposal Number:\tBES-0609164\t\r\nPrincipal Investigator: Lee, Ilsoon\r\nAffiliation:  Michigan State University\t\r\nProposal Title: NER:Novel and Effective Fabrication of Anisotropic Functional Nanoparticles and Their Uses in Biosensors\t\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop novel elongated, functional nanoparticles in a simple fashion and use them in nanostructured bioelectronic interfaces that electrically couple biofunctionalized nanoparticles to electrodes.
