 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop a series of Active Learning Modules in which students are engaged in their own inquiry-driven exploration of the structure and function of specific proteins.  The modules use physical models of proteins and other compelling visualizations that make the molecular world real to students.  Each of six carefully chosen proteins is explored within the context of a case study in which the students are challenged to solve a problem that is presented against the backdrop of a current social issue.  As the final component of each Module, students encounter evidence that related proteins from different organisms share a similar amino acid sequence.  This recurring theme of \"evolution in action\" emphasizes the interrelatedness of living organisms and demonstrates the power of this fundamental concept in the molecular biosciences.  \r\n\r\nThe Modules are initially piloted by the project PI and coPIs in five undergraduate institutions, and later by a larger group of undergraduate educators, many from minority-serving institutions, who are trained in the use of the Modules at two summer workshops.  Assessment of student learning gains includes pre- and post-tests that include questions addressing the four major learning objectives of the Modules: (i) general concepts of protein structure and function, (ii) concepts that are specific to the topic of each module, (iii) concepts addressing the relatedness of similar proteins across different organisms, and (iv) students' attitudes toward science and its perceived importance in their lives.\r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit.  The project investigates the value of using innovative physical models and other compelling visualizations to stimulate active student exploration of the invisible molecular world.  Additionally, the project measures the impact of a learning progression that first builds a deep understanding of the molecular nature of proteins and their critical role in life processes, and then presents students with data demonstrating the amino acid sequence homology of similar proteins from different organisms. \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts.  The project contributes to the growing body of education research on the use of active teaching methods to engage students in meaningful and long-lasting learning.  It also seeks to change students' attitudes toward the biological sciences, especially regarding the issue of evolution, by providing examples of \"evolution in action.\"",
