Cell walls constrain the\r\nfinal sizes and shapes of plant cells, and therefore the stature and form of plants. Plants\r\ninvest over 10% of their genomes in building their cell walls.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThis conference will address the major advances in our understanding of the composition,\r\nsynthesis, and architecture of plant cell walls and their dynamics during growth and\r\ndifferentiation. It will bring together international scientists from academia, industry and\r\ngovernment labs to share the latest fundamental scientific breakthroughs in plant cell wall\r\nbiology. As cell walls are an enormously important source of food, feed, fiber and\r\nmedically active compounds for humans and animals, a special session will focus on the\r\nadvances made in the medical and practical uses of plant cell walls for human society.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nTo foster interdisciplinary research, a special effort has also been made to invite speakers\r\nfrom outside the field of plant biology. This award will be used to support participants with emphasis on younger scientists, minorities and underrepresented scientists to participate in the meeting and to advance their careers in plant biology.  \r\n\r\nIn the tradition of Gordon Conference, material presented is considered priviledged, for discussion among participants but not for publication.  This policy stimulates creative interchange at the conference.",
