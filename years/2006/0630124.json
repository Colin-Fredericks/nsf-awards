 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will evaluate the robustness, resolution, and required \r\ncomplexity of global seismologic and geodynamic models of upper \r\nmantle azimuthal anisotropy in order to improve our understanding of \r\nmantle dynamics.  Recent years have seen a refinement of \r\nseismological models of anisotropy, presumably indicative of shearing \r\nin mantle flow. Particularly surface wave inversions have been linked \r\nto models of mantle circulation with some success. Such findings make \r\nit appear feasible to test hypotheses for regional tectonic models \r\nusing sophisticated synthetic data sets in the near future. However, \r\nwhile several questions about the implications of anisotropy remain \r\nunanswered, it is also true that comprehensive and quantitative \r\nmodels with thorough estimates of uncertainties are still lacking. \r\nThis project addresses some of the relevant issues of seismological \r\nanalysis and improved geodynamic models, such as: How stable are \r\nazimuthal anisotropy patterns with respect to data selection and \r\ninversion methods?  How well constrained is anisotropy under \r\ncontinents and oceanic regions? What are the characteristic   to \r\nconvection models, from Newtonian to power-law rheology, from \r\nlaterally constant to varying viscosity, and from finite strain to \r\ntexture modeling. A range of resolution and synthetic model tests \r\nwill be performed to evaluate the robustness of the seismological \r\nmodels. Such a combined seismologic and geodynamic research program \r\nwill lead to new insights into upper mantle structure, anisotropy \r\nformation, and mantle convection. The aim is to formalize our \r\nunderstanding of lithospheric and upper mantle deformation based on \r\nmantle flow, in order to develop models with specific regional \r\npredictions that are useful for the design of field campaigns and \r\ngeologic hypothesis testing.",
