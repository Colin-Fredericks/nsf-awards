Ten hands-on laboratory modules are being used to teach engineering principles of sports for engineering courses at Rowan University, Drexel University and Gloucester County College.\r\n\r\nThis project is educating a large population about a variety of engineering topics such as aerodynamics, mechanics of materials, dynamics, vibrations, and transport as well as design and product development in the exciting context of sports. Larger goals include: 1) fostering new collaborations in education and research between Engineering and Health Science as well as cross-institution collaborations between the 4-year universities and 2-year college, 2) integrating education and research as well as enhancing the infrastructure for these activities, 3) introducing many undergraduate and K-12 students and K-12 teachers about engineering and sports through the widespread outreach and dissemination activities, 4) broadening participation of underrepresented groups through proposed use in outreach activities, 5) and potentially benefiting society at large by increasing the technical workforce and encouraging their interest in working on sports projects. The project evaluation is focusing on student learning.\r\n",
