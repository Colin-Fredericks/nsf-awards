She develops a rigorous\r\nstochastic description of filament structures, studies filament\r\ndynamics, and examines mean field limits for interacting vortex\r\nfilaments and their relation to the Euler equations.  While\r\nBrownian semimartingales are the stochastic processes that have\r\nreceived more attention in other studies of random vortex\r\nfilaments, here extension to stochastic processes with\r\nmultifractal structure or intermittency features is considered. \r\nThe underlying problem of turbulence is fundamental.  Students\r\nare involved in the project.  \r\n\r\n     Random vortex filaments -- roughly speaking, vortical tubes\r\nof fluid moving under the influence of a random process -- are a\r\nmodel for the motion of fluids that could shed some light on the\r\ndevelopment and evolution of turbulence in fluid flows.   The\r\ninvestigator studies random vortex filaments, considering their\r\nstructure, their dynamics, the behavior of large collections of\r\nvortex filaments, and their relationship to the Euler equations,\r\na well-known model of fluid flows.   Students are involved in the\r\nproject.  Better mathematical models of turbulence in fluid flows\r\ncould lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of\r\nturbulence.  This in turn would improve our understanding of\r\natmosphere and ocean circulation, with possible consequences for\r\nweather prediction, and of fluid flows in engineering\r\napplications, such as the design of faster and more economically\r\noperated ships, planes, and vehicles.  \r\n",
