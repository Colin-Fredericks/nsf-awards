 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project intends to explore the notion of overlay transmission as an alternative design criterion in wireless networks involving multiple transceiver pairs, i.e., the classical interference channels (IFC). Overlay transmission refers to the communication mode where the signals from multiple users superimpose in time and frequency. It is envisioned that, facilitated by the theory and technologies to be developed under this effort, more efficient spectrum utilization can be achieved by allowing concurrent transmissions without compromising each users Quality of Service.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project lies in its pursuit of the novel MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) overlay transmission concept in wireless network design. This differs with existing overlay transmission, such as the code division multiple access systems, whose interference resistance comes at the cost of bandwidth expansion. Instead, we demonstrate that the interplay between spatial diversity and multiuser diversity in MIMO IFC enables overlay transmission to significantly outperform orthogonal transmission. This is also in sharp contrast to the single-input single-output system where overlay transmission has no tangible advantage in spectral efficiency over orthogonal transmission for IFC.\r\nThe proposed MIMO overlay transmission has broad applications in wireless networks. For cellular networks, prudent use of MIMO overlay transmission will enable novel frequency reuse schemes to\r\nimprove channel resource management. In ad hoc networks, incorporating MIMO overlay transmission\r\ninto the networking protocols will help enhance both the network and end-to-end throughputs.\r\nMIMO overlay transmission, with its superior spectral efficiency and its potential to enable novel\r\nnetworking protocols, has the promise to bring relief to the spectrum scarcity issue encountered in\r\ntodays wireless systems.\r\nAlong with the proposed research project, the PI has designed a set of education initiatives.\r\nThese include promoting active learning through innovative classroom teaching, enhancing graduate\r\nand undergraduate curriculum through course development, and involving undergraduate students\r\nwith diverse background in this project.\r\nThe broader impacts of this project are multi-faceted. By engaging students at both graduate\r\nand undergraduate levels in intellectually challenging activities, the students will assume a more\r\nactive role in various education activities. Encouraging and facilitating graduate students participation\r\nin professional meetings and conferences will help instill enthusiasm in scientific research into the\r\nstudents. Involving undergraduate students in carefully designed research projects will help foster\r\ntheir interest in scientific activities. The curriculum development plan caters to the increasing needs\r\nof students in the area of communication and signal processing. At the graduate level, it will provide\r\nan important venue for many local industries and research institutions for the continuing education\r\nof their employees. The PIs enthusiasm in developing and teaching undergraduate courses will ensure\r\nthe success of the ongoing undergraduate curriculum reform in the Department of Electrical\r\nEngineering and Computer Science at Syracuse University.",
