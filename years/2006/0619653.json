 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to augment the MEMS and micro/nanotechnology research programs at the University of South Florida through the acquisition of a Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) tool (configured for deep silicon, dielectric and SiC etching) and a surface profilometer. The approach is to leverage: (a) on numerous USF research and training awards, (b) an interdisciplinary research culture that has a broad social participation of faculty and students. The instrumentation described in this proposal will provide the impetus to drive research in micro/nanotechnology as well as serve as an educational spring-board for engineers and scientists of tomorrow.\r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit: The requested instrumentation will be a major addition to the infrastructure of the research center - NNRC and the university. They would embellish the existing assortment of tools at the researchers' disposal. Proposed research will integrate developments in different research areas in a novel approach that will advance the knowledge and understanding in diverse fields, from understanding to sensing.  The research tool will provide a basis for fabrication of systems for quantitative diagnosis in diverse environments.\r\n            \r\nBroader Impact:  This research will train students in emerging cross-disciplinary areas. The current research activities will have continued participation of undergraduate students and underrepresented groups (minority, women). It is anticipated that over 30 minority students will benefit from the acquisition in the first year. The results of the research will be widely disseminated through inclusion in courses and modules developed by PIs, demonstrations and outreach. \r\n\r\n",
