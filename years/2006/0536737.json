 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\nGraphic format books, similar in form to comic books, are proven pedagogical tools for facilitating student learning of complicated subject matter. As a biologist and cartoonist, the Principal Investigator is producing a prototype chapter of a non-majors biology text in comic book format.  The resulting chapter: 1) is visual, humorous, conceptual and context rich, 2) connects biology and neuroscience to the humanities, 3) portrays science within an historical perspective and 4) is being assessed for effectiveness in aiding student learning.  Nonscience students in six different introductory biology courses who are using the chapter as a supplement are being evaluated for improved conceptual understanding and attitudes about science.  Comics are a visually stimulating, often overlooked means of explaining difficult concepts and improving student learning, forming the basis for the intellectual merit of this project.  The prototype chapter being developed is the first step toward a fully developed nonmajors biology textbook that uses pop culture and the humanities to make science less intimidating for non-majors. By employing the universally engaging medium of comics, this prototype will broaden the participation of all students in science.\r\n\r\n",
