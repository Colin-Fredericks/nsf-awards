 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to explore a connection between the type-A affine \r\nWeyl group and symmetric functions called k-Schur functions.  The \r\nk-Schur functions arose in a study of the Macdonald polynomial basis, \r\na basis for the symmetric function space that plays an important role \r\nin geometry, representation theory, and physics.  As the k-Schur \r\nfunctions were investigated more deeply, it came to light that these \r\nfunctions may not only offer an approach to difficult problems in the \r\ntheory of Macdonald polynomials, but also provide a fundamental \r\nbasis for a subspace of the symmetric space.  A wealth of beautiful \r\ncombinatorial conjectures that extend and refine classical ideas in \r\nsymmetric function theory came out of the study of k-Schur functions.\r\nThis proposal is to work on these conjectures and to further investigate\r\nthe k-Schur functions.  For example, recent work with the k-Schur\r\nfunctions suggests a connection between the Macdonald polynomials and\r\nthe affine symmetric group.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCombinatorics is a vast area of mathematics loosely described as \r\nthe study of counting collections of objects that satisfy specified \r\ncriteria.  As such, combinatorics plays an integral role in \r\nthe development of many fields, and combinatorial methods are employed \r\nby scientists ranging from biologists to theoretical physicists.\r\nThe PI seeks to understand a natural refinement for the beautiful \r\ncombinatorics that arises in the theory of symmetric functions - \r\na classical part of mathematics with a wide variety of applications in \r\nfields including physics, engineering, and computer science.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
