Przytycki\r\n\r\nThis award provides partial support for participants of the 21st\r\nconference in the very successful ``Knots in Washington''\r\nseries. This meeting is devoted to Skein Modules, Khovanov\r\nHomology and its relation to Hochschild Homology. ``Khovanov\r\nhomology'' is a new development in quantum topology that emerged\r\nin the last several years. It is a generalization of the Jones\r\nand Homflypt polynomials of links to homologies of certain chain\r\ncomplexes.  These homologies turn out to be significantly\r\nstronger than the original invariants. Khovanov's ideas were also\r\napplied to the polynomial invariants of graphs, as well as\r\nKauffman bracket skein module of some 3-manifolds. One of the\r\nmost recent developments is Przytycki's observation that Khovanov\r\nhomology (or its comultiplication-free variant developed by\r\nHelme-Guizon and Rong) can be interpreted as Hochschild homology\r\nof underlying algebras. This shows how seemingly distant branches\r\nof mathematics can be put together.\r\n\r\nLow dimensional topology studies shapes of three and four\r\ndimensional spaces. These dimensions are of particular interest\r\nto us because they are the dimensions of our space and our\r\nspace-time. Knot theory is a subfield of low dimensional\r\ntopology, which studies the knottedness in our space. One of the\r\nmain goals of knot theory is to distinguish knotted objects. This\r\nis often done by means of the so called \"knot invariants,\"\r\nfunctions that replace geometric objects, such as knots, with\r\nthose that are easier to compare. Over the past two decades,\r\nthere have been a flourish of new invariants in low dimensional\r\ntopology, boosted by ideas from gauge theory, quantum algebras,\r\nand mathematical physics. In particular, a new invariant for\r\nknots, developed by Khovanov using ideas from homological\r\nalgebra, has sparked a great deal of interest recently. The\r\npurpose of the Knots in Washington Conferences is to bring\r\ntogether the researchers of the field, including established\r\nmathematicians as well as graduate students and recent PhDs, to\r\ndiscuss the state of the art of the subject.\r\n",
