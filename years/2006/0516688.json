 "awd_abstract_narration": "During a cell or organism's lifetime, multiple stresses such as temperature, drugs, viral infections, and chemicals are encountered.  The onset of these stresses can be rapid and cause damage or even death.  In order to survive and prevent damage, cells and organisms must be prepared to respond.  Recent evidence has shown that changes in which proteins are produced helps the cells mount a response to certain stresses such as viral infections, amino acid starvation, osmotic stress and heat shock.  Specifically, a component of the protein synthesis machinery, the eEF1B-alpha-gamma protein complex, has been determined to play a crucial role in responding to stress caused by oxidants, such as cadmium and hydrogen peroxide. Utilizing a eukaryotic model system, the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the project focuses on the hypothesis that the eEF1B-alpha-gamma protein complex plays an important role in sensing and responding to oxidative stress.  This can occur by altering the activity or composition of the eEF1B-alpha-gamma protein complex and the resulting specific production of proteins responsible for preventing the damage caused by chemicals and oxidants. This project uses genetic approaches to identify how the eEF1B-alpha-gamma proteins respond to and are affected by stress.  Genome wide approaches are integrated to determine which cellular proteins are produced in response to the eEF1B-alpha-gamma signal following stress.\r\nThis project provides research opportunities for students at differing stages in their educational careers including high school, undergraduate and graduate students.  Undergraduates are prepared for research through a molecular biology and biochemistry laboratory course and the work-study program provides an initial gateway to research laboratories.  The peer tutoring program, a part of the interdisciplinary graduate program, allows graduate students to further develop their teaching skills as well as receive support to enhance their retention and success in the program.  K-12 outreach activities are important not only in helping the public to become more scientifically literate, but also in providing an opportunity for young scientists to explore beyond the regular science curriculum.",
