Hyperpycnal flows and fluid muds have been recognized as important modes of sediment transport on some shelves, relatively little is known about how they operate. The proposed study includes a comprehensive set of water column measurements and seabed sampling campaigns designed to capture the events anticipated to follow from dam removal. The proposed work will also complement field studies and modeling work to be carried out by USGS. The work will also provide physical evidence on the influence of waves, tides, and currents on high concentration sediment discharge.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: Working in coordination with the USGS and other DOI agencies will help improve predictions as to the future fate of this coastline and will thus have considerable societal impact. The study is also planned for student training and as an example in oceanography course curricula.\r\n\r\n",
