 "awd_abstract_narration": "A highly publicized report by the American Cancer Society noted that cancer has surpassed heart disease to become the number one killer of adults under the age of 85 in the United States today. At the top of the list was lung cancer, a disease that is eminently preventable. Addressing public health threats like cancer are acute, system-wide challenges that would benefit from network-centric approaches. For example, when the tobacco research community realized it had taken over a decade to discover that they had already collected substantial empirical evidence, distributed across its network of tobacco researchers, indicating that 'light' (low-tar/low-nicotine brands) cigarettes reduced neither exposure to nor risk of cancer, researchers began to understand the importance of effectively sharing resources and information across the entire community. In response, government agencies involved in public health have made a substantial foundational investment in developing a digital government cyberinfrastructure--Tobacco Systems integration Grid (TobacSIG)--to enable collaboration within the Tobacco Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Evaluation Network (TSEEN). While such an underlying cyberinfrastructure is a prerequisite, delays in discoveries (such as the carcinogenic effects of 'light' cigarette mentioned above) have prompted the TSEEN community to underscore the need for social network referral tools as a crucial component of any effort to enhance the efficacy of their collaboration system.\r\n",
