 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is an attempt to understand the effect\r\nof small noise on bifurcations in dynamical systems.\r\nWhile bifurcations involve sharp changes in behavior, noise has a smoothing\r\neffect (the probability density function solves a parabolic PDE,\r\nrather than a transport equation).\r\nIt is this competition between dominant bifurcative behavior\r\nand small noise which is of interest to us. We seek to illuminate\r\nthis competition by considering a number of specific problems.\r\nWe in particular seek to study canard phenomena (which is\r\na combination of bifurcation and multiple scales), two-point\r\nmotion near a homoclinic orbit, and behavior of certain higher-dimensional\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nOne of the central themes in applied mathematics is the problem\r\nof modelling evolving behavior.  One of the main\r\ntools for doing so is differential equations; the theoretical\r\nunderpinnings of differential equations are mathematically\r\nattractive, and it is fairly simple to convert qualitative\r\neffects into the vector fields which govern ODE's.\r\nAn honest assessment of any behavior must, of course, also include\r\nnoise.  Usually this noise is small enough to have negligible effect, but in certain\r\nsituations, even small noise may dominate the behavior of a system.\r\nOur interest is in these situations where noise causes macroscopically\r\nvisible random transitions in a dynamical system.\r\nBy means of certain carefully-chosen examples, we seek to\r\nunderstand a number of different phenomena where such\r\nrandom transitions occur.  The specific equations we study\r\nappear in a number of areas: biology, the study of ocean currents,\r\nand materials science.\r\n",
