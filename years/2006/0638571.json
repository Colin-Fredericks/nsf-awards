The molecules to be targeted are arylene-ethynylene macrocycles (AEMs), which possess unique features (such as large p-surfaces and shape-persistence) suitable for 1D self-assembly and optoelectronic applications.  The major effort of this project will be made on fabrication of individual nanowires with controllable sizes and coordination with C60, as well as the basic optoelectronic characterization with regard to photonic sensing.  The toroidal shape of AEM enables formation of tubular columnar structure with C60 encapsulated inside, leading to formation of spatially segregated N- and P-channels. Such a nano-coax structure possesses intrinsic high efficiency of photoinduced charge separation, which is desired for optoelectronic applications.  The proposed research will also be tightened with the PI's ongoing education initiatives in nanoscience. \r\n",
