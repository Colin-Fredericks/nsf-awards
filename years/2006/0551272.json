 "awd_abstract_narration": "Structural econometric models are essential tools for many empirical studies in fields such as\r\nindustrial organization, labor and public economics, and development economics. The analysis\r\nof identification is a first necessary step in any such studies. In many of these models, such as\r\nthose involving multidimensional optimization or equilibrium conditions, the variables of interest\r\nare determined simultaneously. A recent result by Benkard and Berry (2004) has shown that\r\nidentification results that were used for a long time to determine identification, in simultaneous\r\nequations models, are incorrect. Hence, other than in the restrictive linear specification models\r\nwith additive unobservable random terms, studied decades ago, little is known at present about\r\nthe conditions for identification in structural simultaneous equation models.\r\nIn this project, the PI will develop correct conditions for identification of systems of simultaneous\r\nequations, in parametric and nonparametric models, with additive and nonadditive unobservable\r\nvariables. Since a large body of previous work in econometrics has relied on the previous incorrect\r\nconditions, the PI will also analyze under what additional conditions in the structural models, those\r\nprevious results still hold.\r\nThe identification conditions that will be developed will be used to guide the discovery of\r\nnew methods for estimation in nonparametric simultaneous equations, which will be consistent,\r\nasymptotically normal, and easy to compute.\r\nSince in many of the structural econometric models encountered in applied fields in economics,\r\none encounters situations where observations on the actual values of endogenous variables, such as profits or utility values, is limited, the identification and estimation results will be extended to such situations, where the endogenous variables is simultaneous equations models are latent.\r\nTo guide the PI in the development of the new methods, and to facilitate the adoption and\r\nunderstanding of the new methods, she will consider applications to several leading models in\r\napplied economics, such as models of consumer demand, discrete choice models, hedonic equilibrium models, Nash equilibrium, and models of survey response errors.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity\r\nThe results about identification of simultaneous equations that the PI will develop will allow\r\napplied econometricians to determine the elements that can be identified in an econometric\r\nmodel, given their available data. The results will be applicable to very general models, which\r\ndo not specify parametric structures either for the unknown functions or for the distributions of\r\nthe unobservable random terms, as well as to more restrictive, parametric models. The results\r\nabout estimation of nonparametric models will allow researchers to estimate such models without\r\nimposing parametric restrictions.\r\nSince structural econometric models where the values of the variables of interest are determined\r\nsimultaneously is widespread in most applied fields in economics, these results are predicted to\r\nhave a very wide impact. Moreover, by opening the road to new ways of analyzing identification\r\nand estimation in nonparametric simultaneous equation models, it is expected that a wave of new\r\ntheoretical results will follow, as a result of the research in this project.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nModels where several variables of interest are determined simultaneously are widespread in,\r\namong others, engineering and the social sciences. The methods that will be developed in this\r\nproject will be suitable for applications in these sciences, and through them, they will benefit society\r\nat large. With this aim, the results of the project will be disseminated widely. By involving a\r\ngraduate student in this research, it is expected that he/she will apply the new results in his/her\r\ndissertation and/or develop new related results.",
