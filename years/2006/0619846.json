 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate multifunctional nanoscale materials with applications in optoelectronics and biophotonics; the research involves fundamental and applied aspects of nanoscale research while investigating novel photonic materials with semiconductor, molecular, and/or biological elements. The approach is to acquire a Near-field Scanning Optical Microscope to allow UNT researchers to complement existing infrastructure of shared facilities and form a regional resource with a collaborative focal point in multifunctional nanomaterials.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The equipment sought will enable the fabrication and characterization of nanomaterials integrated into multifunctional components that include electrical, photonic, plasmonic, fluidic, chemical, and biological functions. The projects to be enabled include: (1) Nanofabrication and characterization of photonic crystals. (2) Hydrogel-based optoelectronic and biophotonic nanoscale systems. (3) Guanosine-based UV-Vis nanoscale photodetectors. (4) Molecular and macromolecular optoelectronics. (5) Single molecule imaging and manipulation of myosin. (6) Fluorescence spectroscopic diagnosis of oral cancer using 5-aminolevulinic acid. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed equipment will reside in shared facilities for use by the seven participating group leaders and their collaborators. The proposed equipment will serve as a focal point for the development of integrated nanosystems at UNT and the North Texas region by a rather broad and multidisciplinary user base involved in nanoscale research. The projects provide opportunities for trainees with diverse educational backgrounds (graduate and undergraduate students, high school students and teachers, postdoctoral trainees and visiting scientists) and traditionally-underrepresented groups to actively participate in multidisciplinary research. All participating group leaders have strong track records in recruiting such personnel into their research.\r\n",
