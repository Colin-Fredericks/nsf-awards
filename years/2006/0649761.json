 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for a workshop on the topic of  \"New Research Directions in High Confidence Software Platforms for Cyber Physical Systems\" to be held in Alexandria, Virginia, on  November 30-December 1, 2006.  This one of several workshops in a series of activities that focus on high-confidence and certifiable software and systems.  These workshops are sponsored in cooperation with the High Confidence Software and Systems (HCSS) Coordinating Group (CG) under the NSTC Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Subcommittee.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the workshop is to provide an open, working forum for leaders and visionaries from industry, government, research laboratories, and academia, who are concerned with systems software technology platforms for real-time embedded sensing and control systems.  The workshop will address challenges that are not resolved by current real-time embedded systems software:  real-time operating systems (RTOS), middleware (MW), and virtual machines (VM).  The workshop will assess the inadequacy of the current real-time technology base to support future complex physical and engineered systems.  The workshop also will assess research needs and develop a research roadmap for achieve fundamentally new approaches and cyber technology to support a new generation of cyber-physical systems.\r\n",
