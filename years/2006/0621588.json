 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\n\r\nInternational Group Travel: U.S.-Poland Workshop on Nanoscience and Nano-Structured Materials, Poznan, Poland, June 26-28, 2006\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to provide support for U.S. participants to attend a three day Workshop on Nanoscience and Nano-Structured Materials, to be held in Poznan, Poland on June 26-28, 2006, at the Adam Mickiewicz University.  The purpose of the Workshop is to encourage closer scientific contacts and longer term scientific collaboration between researchers in this area between the U.S. and Poland.  There will be a balance between junior, mid-career, and senior researchers, and with similar or complementary research interests on the two sides.  The Workshop participants will represent a broad spectrum of nanoscience and engineering interests, for example, soft materials, bio-materials, polymers, polymerization, self assembly, complex fluids, microemulsions, surface science, interfacial phenomena, catalysis, colloids, adsorption, adhension, rheology, computational nanoscience, and thin films.\r\nBroader impact: The proposed workshop is expected to initiate individual and institutional collaboration among the participants.  For example, we already know that the US participants interested in polymeric materials (Shen, Radosz, Matyjaszewski) plan to visit the Macromolecular Laboratory of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Lodz and the Macromolecular Physics Laboratory of Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan to discuss future projects.  Those interested in surface science (Gubbins and others) will likely visit the Cracow center of Catalysis and Surface Chemistry.  Similar visits to Warsaw and Wroclaw are planned for the other participants.  Future collaborative projects that are likely to result from such visits will enrich the research and education infrastructure of both countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
