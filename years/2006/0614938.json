 "awd_abstract_narration": "A symposium on Plant Receptor Signaling will be held at Iowa State University on June\r\n22-25, 2006. Receptors are key molecules in the perception and response to stimuli,\r\nincluding light, hormones and developmental signals, and biotic interactions such as\r\npathogens and symbionts. As such, this topic is of interest to basic and applied plant\r\nresearchers. This symposium is part of an ongoing series sponsored by the Plant Sciences\r\nInstitute. The symposium will feature 19 invited speakers of international renown, as well\r\nas approximately 16 short talks selected from submitted abstracts. There will also be a\r\nposter session and social activities to promote interactions. Session topics will include\r\nPhotoreceptors, Hormone Receptors, Receptors in Growth and Development, Receptors in\r\nBiotic Interactions, and Genomic / Proteomic Approaches to Studying Plant Receptors.\r\nEducational activities will include a 1-credit course for graduate students associated\r\nwith the symposium, and activities to assist undergraduates understand the science. Travel\r\ngrants will be made available to students, with particular emphasis on encouraging\r\nminority participation.",
