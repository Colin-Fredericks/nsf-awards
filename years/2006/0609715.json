 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator applies emerging computational methods in circle\r\npacking to study conformal structures on surfaces, with particular\r\nemphasis on complex, nonplanar surfaces.  The global realization of\r\nconformal structures which are local in nature is known classically as\r\nuniformization. Circle packing methods have led to notions of discrete\r\nuniformization which both mimic and approximate the classical notion.\r\nHowever, the geometric nature of the discretization raises\r\ncomputational issues outside traditional numerical mathematics. In\r\nparticular, uniformization is a self-assembly process which is\r\nextremely challenging in practice --- for instance, with circle\r\npackings containing millions of circles. In the central computational\r\nwork, the investigator implements a recursive framework for managing\r\nthis self-assembly which avoids global distortions while accommodating\r\nefficient parallel implementation. The computational issues are not\r\nconsidered in isolation, but rather in relation to ongoing\r\napplications by the investigator and his collaborators to topics\r\nincluding brain imaging, conformal tiling, dessins d'enfants, and\r\nconformal welding. Of the many theoretical issues raised in\r\napplications and experiments, the investigator pays special attention\r\nto the notion of ``flow uniformization'' and to its potential use in\r\ndiscrete conformal welding and shape analysis.\r\n\r\nSurfaces --- a smooth soap film, the convoluted gray matter of the\r\nbrain, a faceted crystal lattice --- are ubiquitous in the natural and\r\nphysical sciences, engineering, computer visualization, and scores of\r\nother areas. The tools for studying and describing surfaces\r\nmathematically came out of work in the nineteenth century, with a\r\nparticularly rich geometric vein associated with angular measure going\r\nby the name \"conformal structure\". Among the most celebrated results in\r\nmathematics is the Riemann mapping theorem of 1851 which proved that\r\nevery surface with a conformal structure, no matter how complicated,\r\ncan be identified with one of three very simple familiar surfaces\r\n--- a ball, a plane, or a disc --- in a way that preserves conformal\r\nstructure, that is, that preserves angles. Wonderful as this theory\r\nis, and despite the availability of huge computational resources, it\r\nhas been only in the last decade that new mathematics in the form of\r\ncircle packing has provided a practical means for actually realizing\r\nRiemann's theorem. The investigator develops the mathematical and\r\ncomputational aspects of circle packing in the context of several\r\napplications. Among these are the flattening of human brain cortical\r\nsurfaces to aid analysis by neuroscientists, the study of plane\r\nshapes through a process known as conformal welding for use in\r\ncomputer vision, and the construction of mathematical Riemann surfaces\r\nin various topics which are now amenable to experimentation\r\nfor the first time.\r\n\r\n",
