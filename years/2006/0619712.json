 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project will develop a 6 MW pulsed electron and photon 2-15 MeV accelerator converted from a donated medical (GE Saturne 43)  treatment linac, which is widely applicable since many hospitals are replacing them with more advanced models.  Intellectual Merit: If it can be demonstrated that these linacs can be converted to research even at a small university, then other teaching institutions will be able to acquire accelerator units to greatly enhance and stimulate STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) training. Full documentation, assessment, and publication of our development will improve and multiply low-cost conversion units to other universities and institutions.  The PIs also have proposed a Chemistry, Engineering Physics East-Central Indiana Consortium (EPIC) of universities and businesses including TU, BSU, AU, ITT-Space, and other that will graduate STEM students with an awareness of nuclear issues related to safety, science, energy, homeland security, and medical physics. EPIC will inspire undergraduate students, retaining and preparing them for graduate school and advanced careers. The proposal includes experienced accelerator personnel and radiation safety experts to ensure that the highest standards are met in safety, safety education, design, master file control, fabrication and operation.\r\nBroader Impact: In addition to hands-on education for undergraduates in the EPIC consortium, many research projects can be implemented on this machine, since Indiana's only other accelerator is <6MeV. Identified educational areas include science and engineering lab experiments, advanced labs, capstone projects, summer research experience and nanosatellite radiation studies. Identified engineering research includes microelectronics dose effects, flue gas NOX & SO2 cleaning, sterilization, and polyethylene material property studies. Identified science research includes nanotechnology etching, CdZnTe sensor calibration, irradiation of rad-hard extremophiles, study of dislocation diffusion, CASINO Monte-Carlo modeling validation, impulse studies of fast chemical reactions, and PSME dusty ice plasma charging. Identified commercialization includes educational conversion linacs and automated radiation testing of parts and materials (ITT and NASA), and technology development e.g., crosslinked caustic oil well pump with ASI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n",
