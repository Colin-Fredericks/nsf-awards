 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project is developing theoretical and practical\r\nfoundations for communicative agents that overtly exhibit\r\nself-awareness. Such agents are aware of what they know\r\nand do not know, what they can and cannot do, and what\r\nintentions and assumptions underlie their inferences\r\nand actions, and they show \"presence of mind\" in dialogue\r\ninteractions, recalling past experiences and reasoning\r\nabout the ongoing interactions. The theoretical ideas\r\nunder development for this purpose center around theories\r\nof autocognitive knowledge and inference (knowing what\r\none knows and does not know, and how one acquires\r\nknowledge), a new approach to integrating uncertain\r\ninference with logic (quasi-probability theory), and\r\na form of \"syntactically aware\" metainference that\r\nfacilitates reasoning about a system's own knowledge\r\nand special capabilities. The project uses the EPILOG\r\ninference engine as a basis for experimentation, while\r\nbroadening that engine's capabilities. The knowledge\r\nrepresentation (episodic logic) used by EPILOG nearly\r\nmatches the expressive capabilities of ordinary language\r\nand is thus well-suited to the inferential and dialogue\r\ngoals of this project. The results will include\r\ndemonstrable theories of self-awareness in artificial\r\nagents, new methods of general autocognitive, uncertain,\r\nand syntactically aware inference, and an improved\r\nEPILOG engine. The results will be disseminated in major\r\nconferences and journals for AI, agent and dialogue\r\nresearch, and the improved EPILOG engine will be\r\ngenerally available. In the longer run, the work will\r\nhelp pave the way for a new generation of more human-like\r\ninteractive AI agents, in such areas as software support,\r\nadvice, tutoring, games, etc.\r\n",
