 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyber Systems: Closed-Loop Control of Brain Dynamics in Epilepsy\r\n\r\nScope and Intellectual Merit. The objective of this research is to develop feedback controllers for the suppression of epileptic seizures by altering the brain dynamics through the use of electrical stimulation. It is motivated by prior work indicating qualitative similarities between spatial synchronization in networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators and the transition to seizures in the epileptic brain. The approach is to use feedback decoupling control that has been demonstrated in simulation studies to achieve desynchronization of the oscillator dynamics and prevent seizure-like behavior. It relies on suitable for control mathematical models that describe the key input-output relationships between administered electrical stimuli to the brain and selected measures of spatial synchronization of brain dynamics. Systematic experimental and computational procedures will be developed for the design and testing of seizure prevention controllers in animal subjects (epileptic rats). \r\n\r\nBroader Benefits. Expected broader benefits range from the solution of nonstandard problems in the control of chaotic systems, to nonlinear signal processing, to yet untapped applications in bioengineering and electrical engineering. Results from this research, if successful, will contribute to new modalities for treatment of epilepsy. Furthermore, this research may provide data for new applications in medicine and neuroscience, and prove to be one essential step towards the control by deep brain stimulation of Parkinsons tremors, migraines, sleep disorders and other brain dynamical disorders. Therefore, the proposed research has the potential to make essential contributions to biomedical technology and the associated economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
