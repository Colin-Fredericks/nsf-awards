First, the number of underrepresented students at the Alliance institutions\r\nmajoring in STEM fields is relatively small. In Fall 2004, only 820 Alliance\r\nundergraduates were enrolled in a STEM major, 12% of the total. Of the students who do\r\nenroll in a STEM major, far too few graduate--only 99 STEM BS degrees were awarded to\r\nunderrepresented minority students by Alliance institutions in 2004. Finally, there is a\r\nlack of alignment between courses and programs offered by community colleges and the\r\nfour-year institutions to which the majority of their students transfer. Lack of\r\nalignment also often greatly increases the amount of time it takes students to progress to\r\ndegree completion.\r\nThe Urban Massachusetts LSAMP (UMLSAMP) will aggressively recruit underrepresented\r\nminority students from local high schools and partner community colleges who have an\r\ninterest in STEM. The UMLSAMP will implement new and expand existing bridge programs for\r\nincoming freshmen and for community college transfer students where students will take\r\nintensive math courses, interdisciplinary STEM courses and work part-time in research\r\nlabs. The UMLSAMP will implement facilitated study groups for the gateway courses to\r\nfurther ensure success. AMP students will be provided mentored research experiences and\r\nother scholarly activities, including opportunities to attend research seminars, talks,\r\nand conferences. AMP students will have access to a drop in center and will receive\r\nintensive mentoring from peers, faculty, advisors focused on making sure the students,\r\nespecially during the first two years, successfully progress into and through college and\r\nhelping them develop and define their academic and career goals. Finally UMLSAMP members\r\nwill focus on articulation and alignment of STEM courses and degree programs between the\r\ncommunity colleges and the four year institutions.\r\nThe Alliance members value the synergy that results from working collaboratively and, in\r\naddition to joint governance of the Alliance, have planned several activities to\r\ncapitalize on the group?s collective wisdom and energy, including joint planning and\r\nimplementation of activities, common data metrics and benchmarks and identification of\r\ninstitutional obstacles that impede the progress of underrepresented students in STEM\r\nmajors, and an annual research and best practices conference will be rotated among the\r\nAlliance Institutions. We expect to achieve the following outcomes by the end of five\r\nyears:\r\n1. 50% increase in the number of Black, Hispanic, and Native American students majoring in\r\nSTEM fields.\r\n2. 150% increase the number of BS STEM degrees conferred on Black, Hispanic, and Native\r\nAmerican students\r\n3. 150% increase the number of students who successfully transfer from Alliance community\r\ncolleges into BS STEM majors.\r\nEach of the Alliance members have extensive experience in minority student development and\r\nPROJECT SUMMARY\r\nPage A\r\nhave drawn upon the literature on the retention of low income, first generation, and\r\nunderrepresented students and studies of best practice in minority student development in\r\nthe sciences (intellectual merit) in designing the proposed LSAMP. The Alliance will\r\nimplement activities with intellectual merit which will have several broad impacts. First,\r\nthe impact of project activities on student success in gateway math and science courses\r\nwill be carefully evaluated and those that are most effective will be institutionalized.\r\nSecond, because the project has a particular focus on underrepresented students and on\r\ntransitioning community college students to baccalaureate degree programs, it will\r\ncontribute important knowledge to the field. Finally, project results and effective\r\nstrategies will be disseminated to other institutions through an annual report on \"Lessons\r\nLearned\" and \"Best Practices.\"",
