 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to work on problems relating combinatorics with geometry \r\nand representation theory.  Together with co-workers, the PI aims to \r\ndevelop a theory of Schubert calculus on the affine Grassmannian from \r\nboth a combinatorial and geometric perspective.  This includes the study \r\nof affine Schubert polynomials in both homology and cohomology and \r\nassociated formulae such as Pieri rules.  In the combinatorial side, \r\naffine generalizations of classical algorithms such as Schensted \r\ninsertion will be studied.  On the geometric side, the PI will focus on\r\n   understanding different positivity properties geometrically and to \r\nconnect the affine Grassmannian with Macdonald polynomials.  Another \r\npart of the PI's work will focus on questions related to Schur \r\npositivity. The PI with collaborators have recently resolved several \r\nopen Schur positivity problems that attracted a lot of attention, \r\nincluding conjectures of Fomin-Fulton-Li-Poon and of Okounkov. They plan \r\nto apply their techniques to prove several other prominent conjectures \r\nconcerning Schur positivity.  In another direction, the PI with \r\ncollaborators, aims to study the Kazhdan-Lusztig cells in type B with \r\nunequal parameters using the combinatorial algorithm known as domino \r\ninsertion.\r\n\r\nThe PI's research is in the area of combinatorics.  Combinatorics is an \r\narea of mathematics concerned with counting and has received a lot of \r\nattention recently due to its applications to probability, cryptography \r\nand computer science.  The PI's research is concerned with connecting \r\nthe discrete (or finite) problems in combinatorics with complicated \r\nstructures in geometry and algebra.  In geometry, infinite and \r\ncontinuous objects are studied together with a notion of space and \r\ndimension.  In algebra, symmetries are studied using systems of \r\nequations.  The PI's research should reveal deep relationships between \r\nthese areas and is likely to have an impact on all three fields.\r\n",
