 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gartland\r\nDMS-0608670\r\n\r\n     The investigator carries out numerical modeling of problems\r\nin two important new areas of the physics of liquid crystals: (1)\r\nmean-field theories for phases of biaxial and bent-core\r\nliquid-crystal materials, and (2) numerical solution of\r\nmacroscopic models for the dynamics and statics of point defects\r\nin liquid-crystal systems (in the absence or presence of fluid\r\nflow).  The investigator uses techniques from modern numerical\r\nbifurcation analysis together with the theories of singularities\r\nand bifurcations in the presence of symmetry to study the full\r\nbifurcation and phase behavior of recent mean-field models for\r\nbiaxial materials, along with models that he and collaborators\r\nare developing for the important new class of bent-core\r\nmaterials.  The investigator adapts and extends methods from\r\ncomputational fluids with moving and deforming bodies (\"moving\r\noverset grid methods\") to provide effective techniques to\r\naccurately model challenging problems involving the dynamics and\r\nstatics of point defects in macroscopic liquid-crystal director\r\nmodels, with application to surprising recent physical\r\nexperiments on defect-pair annihilation in capillaries filled\r\nwith a liquid-crystal material. \r\n\r\n     Liquid crystals are complex fluids that possess partial\r\nmolecular orientational order.  They can be used to control\r\nlight, and this feature underlies many of their significant\r\ntechnological applications.  In recent years, new liquid-crystal\r\nmolecules have been synthesized that exhibit certain special\r\nphases.  These new phases are termed \"biaxial,\" because they have\r\nsecondary ordering properties in addition to those of the more\r\ncommon \"uniaxial\" materials.  The liquid-crystal community has\r\nhigh hopes for potential new applications of these new materials. \r\nThe theoretical and experimental study of biaxial liquid crystals\r\nis at a relatively early stage.  In this project the investigator\r\nanalyzes a mathematical model for such materials that\r\ncharacterizes the bulk equilibrium state of the system and\r\nassociated transitions, as a function of control parameters such\r\nas temperature.  This study requires both mathematical and\r\nnumerical techniques.  In addition, the investigator and\r\ncollaborators develop new models for the special sub-class of\r\n\"bent core\" liquid crystals, which are of high current interest. \r\nThe merits of this work are two-fold: (1) validation of the\r\nmodels and (2) the development of predictive tools to aid in the\r\ndesign of experiments and in the identification of parameter\r\nranges for technological applications.  The second main topic of\r\nthe project concerns the numerical modeling of the dynamics of\r\ndefects in liquid crystals (isolated singularities in the fields\r\nthat characterize the orientational properties of the medium). \r\nDefects are ubiquitous in liquid-crystal systems, and they cause\r\nconsiderable difficulty both from mathematical and numerical\r\npoints of view.  The investigator and co-workers apply numerical\r\nprocedures from other areas of computational fluid dynamics, both\r\nto model numerically a target problem involving the annihilation\r\nof a pair of point defects in a capillary tube filled with liquid\r\ncrystal and to compare these numerical results to recently\r\npublished experimental data.  These techniques (new to the area\r\nof liquid crystals) should open the door to a number of other\r\nnumerical-modeling problems involving defects that have\r\npreviously been hampered by unphysical numerical artifacts. \r\n",
