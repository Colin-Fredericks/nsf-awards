 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been tremendous success in studying Dehn surgery on knots \r\nthrough the use of taut foliations and essential laminations.  For \r\nexample, the property R conjecture, and the property P conjecture for \r\nsatellite knots, have been proved using the methods of taut foliations.  \r\nThe principal investigator plans to study Dehn surgery on knots and links \r\nin 3-manifolds using laminations and branched surfaces.  The success of \r\nthe project will advance the understanding of the topology of 3 and 4 \r\ndimensional manifolds and contribute to the ultimate solutions of some \r\ncentral problems in this area.  The investigator also plans to study tight \r\nlaminations in 3-manifolds.  A tight lamination is an essential lamination \r\nwith a very nice transverse structure and many remarkable properties.  One \r\ngoal of the proposed research is to prove that if a 3-manifold contains an \r\nessential lamination then it contains a tight lamination.  The \r\ninvestigator will also continue his work on the classification of \r\nessential laminations in hyperbolic punctured-torus bundles, and on the \r\ntopological rigidity of laminar 3-manifolds.  \r\n\r\nThree-manifolds are objects modeled on the 3-dimensional space that we are \r\nliving in.  For instance, the universe is a 3-manifold and recent study \r\nshows that the universe may have an interesting topological structure.  A \r\nnatural geometric way of studying 3-manifolds, which has been proved \r\nextremely fruitful, is to view a globally complicated 3-manifold as a \r\ncollection of simple 3-dimensional pieces glued together along a \r\n2-dimensional object.  The tools used in the proposed research, including \r\nlaminations and branched surfaces, provide such useful 2-dimensional \r\nobjects.  The proposed research is related to some central questions in \r\nlow-dimensional topology and knot theory, which impact not only \r\nmathematics, but also physics and other scientific research.  A better \r\nunderstanding of 3-manifolds may help us understand the shape of the \r\nuniverse, and knot theory is used to study the structure of DNA and its \r\nbiological effect.\r\n\r\n",
