 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project focuses on development of\r\nnovel high-temperature annealing system for processing for advanced silicon on insulator\r\n(SOI) devices. The present rapid thermal annealing (RTA) systems, lead to substantial\r\nprofile broadening because of their large time constants. The company proposes the\r\ndevelopment of a novel Hybrid Rapid Thermal Process (HRTP) system which combines\r\nall the advantages of RTA and laser annealing while at the same time eliminating its\r\ndisadvantages. The use of SOI wafers can further extend annealing times by significantly\r\nreducing heat flow to the substrates. In the Phase I we plan to conduct simulation and\r\npreliminary experimental studies to establish the viability of this concept and obtain the\r\nnecessary design parameters to construct a prototype system during Phase II of this\r\nproject. Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP) systems are a critical part of semiconductor\r\nmanufacturing operations and are used to form gate oxides, silicides and annealed ionimplanted dopants for formation of ultra-shallow junctions. \r\n\r\nCommercially, the market-size for these applications exceeds $500 M/year. With the rapid miniaturization of the devices, there is a strong need to develop higher ramp rate and higher temperature annealing systems to achieve the formation of ultra-shallow junctions. The proposed HRTP system is expected to fill this niche The HRTP system can also be used in thermal annealing of wide band gap semiconductors such as GaN and SiC as they require extremely high temperature, which cannot be achieved by traditional systems.\r\n",
