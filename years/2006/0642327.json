 "awd_abstract_narration": "Katrina SGER: Power System Security Assessment, Monitoring and Control in Emergency Conditions due to Hurricanes such as Katrina\r\n\r\nHsiao-dong Chiang\r\nCornell University \r\n\r\nCritical infrastructures are vital for the well-being of our society, the economy, and national security. Among the critical infrastructures, electric power is the most critical infrastructure upon which other infrastructures depend. This proposal seeks to develop a framework for power system security assessment, monitoring and control in emergency conditions due to hurricanes such as Katrina. Intellectual Merit: The proposed framework includes a damage prediction subsystem, a subsystem for avoiding system collapse and cascading outages during emergencies, via a comprehensive security assessment and system monitoring, and a subsystem for emergency control development. This framework will provide a platform on which detailed schemes and procedures for security assessment, monitoring and control in emergency conditions can be developed as early as possible and updated as the system topology evolves. Broader Impacts:  There has been very little systematic work on approaches to emergency supply of power during extreme events but there is growing interest in the aftermath of recent natural disasters, such as Katrina. Moreover, the increasing critical need in modern society for a reliable power supply make this research of vital importance. Advances in this area for the power grid will help lay a foundation for other critical infrastructures to develop emergency modes of operations. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
