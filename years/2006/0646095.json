 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal we briefly describe high-level image primitives and adaptive frameless sampling in more\r\ndetail, along with our preliminary results in each. We then lay out our research plans for investigating\r\nthese two strategies for change-focused imagery in the context of our primary and secondary application\r\nareas: rendering, and display. In both areas our focus is on enabling technology for hyper-resolution\r\nimagery, but we also argue that the other benefits listed above (more accurate, more portable, and more\r\nflexible) will emerge from our efforts. Our goals are ambitious but grounded: we do not propose to\r\nactually build new rendering hardware and monitors, but instead to lay the necessary intellectual\r\ngroundwork. We also have active collaborations with partners in industry capable of taking these ideas to\r\npractice, including Microsoft Research, Intel, and Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs.\r\nIntellectual merit: This research will involve a fundamental rethinking of computer imagery, opening\r\nnew avenues of research in well-established fields such as image processing, computer vision, robotics,\r\ncomputer graphics, and image display. Furthermore, the gigapixel displays enabled by our hyperresolution\r\nrendering has great potential as a tool in many other scientific fields. In human-computer interaction, many view such displays as the platform of the future, and our work will make research on this platform possible. Visualization researchers will also be able to study the obvious potential of gigapixel displays for improving understanding of complex data from a wide variety of fields.\r\nBroader impacts: Microsoft and Mitsubishi are convinced that large-scale and high resolution imagery\r\nwill be an important part of the consumer technology market. We agree and are targeting interactive,\r\nprinter-resolution rendering and display in the home and office. We believe such technology could\r\ntransform the business and personal imaging industries. Moreover, the bandwidth improvements for such\r\nrendering might also be easily applied to mobile graphics on phones and PDAs. Our active research\r\nrelationships with Microsoft, Mitsubishi and Intel will keep us grounded and ensure that our ideas have\r\nreal-world impact. Our proposed research will also have direct educational impact. We plan to develop a\r\ncomputational photography course. We also have a strong history of educational collaborations, including\r\noutreach with museums as well as instruction with urban designers and architects. Hyper-resolution\r\ndisplay, and the improved accuracy and scalability it promises, will benefit these efforts and enable new\r\nopportunities.",
