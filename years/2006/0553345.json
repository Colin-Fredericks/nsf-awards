 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will combine a unique combination of boundary layer radar (BLR) and large eddy numerical simulation (LES) approaches to the study of the planetary boundary layer. These two approaches will be synthesized through the development and implementation of an advanced radar simulator. This simulator can be used to develop new radar configurations and capabilities, and to better interpret BLR observations.\r\n\r\nMethod: An LES code will be used to generate data representative of a clear convective boundary layer (CBL) under various meteorological conditions. Output parameters of the LES include three-dimensional fields of velocity, subfilter turbulence kinetic energy, potential temperature, and specific humidity. The LES will form an integral component of the radar simulator to be developed. A virtual BLR will be programmed that will be capable of probing the LES-generated atmospheric fields using a variety of radar configurations, including multiple beams and frequencies. Convective boundary layer data, including atmospheric properties determined from in situ instrumentation as well as radar observations, from several field experiments, will also be collected. Actual and virtual radar observations will be compared for the same boundary layer situations. These experiments will be conducted at the central facility of the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program Southern Great Plains site located southeast of Lamont, Oklahoma. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The consolidation of LES and radar approaches will provide a unique opportunity to investigate the effectiveness and applicability of both LES and various other means of characterizing the CBL, especially those designed to work with BLR observations. Once developed, the radar simulator can be used to address research objectives beyond those outlined in the study, such as development of more sophisticated radar observing techniques, and interpretation of BLR observations in more complex boundary layer situations. The virtual BLR will become a tool that can be used by the radar and boundary layer community at large involved in studies around the world for a wide range of applications. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Cross-fertilization between the LES and radar communities will be encouraged by making the results readily available to the research community via the Internet and by widely presenting findings of the study at professional meetings and through journal publications. The investigators are taking the lead in developing a new cross-disciplinary curriculum at the University of Oklahoma on weather radar and instrumentation. Results from this study will be incorporated into the curriculum, which provides an in-depth education in radar and instrumentation with emphasis on a hands-on experience. This aspect of the program directly addresses a major concern among leaders in the meteorological community concerning the lack of expertise in the use of instrumentation. Finally, to help address the needs to incorporate more underrepresented groups into meteorology and engineering, the investigators on this project have been actively interacting with programs on campus that offer assistance in recruiting women and minorities.",
