With the 2004 reauthorization of NEHRP (PL 108-360), NIST was established as the lead agency for NEHRP.   In order to coordinate NEHRP activities among the four agencies as required by this reauthorization, NIST has established the NEHRP secretariat.   This award provides partial support for the NEHRP secretariat housed at NIST.  The secretariat will help facilitate the intellectual merit of NEHRP through various activities, including updating the NEHRP strategic plan, coordinating the annual NEHRP report, and facilitating the NEHRP advisory committee. The broader impacts of NEHRP are to advance knowledge and understanding for earthquake hazards reduction. The four agencies work together to improve understanding, characterization, and assessment of hazards and vulnerabilities; improve model building codes and land use practices; reduce risks through post-earthquake investigations and education; improve design and construction techniques; improve the capacity of government at all levels and the private sector to reduce and manage earthquake risk; and accelerate the application of research results. \r\n\r\n",
