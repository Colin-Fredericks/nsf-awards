LaBean\r\nDNA nanostructure self-assembly is being developed as a \"bottom-up\" approach for the\r\nfabrication of desired patterns and structures with feature sizes smaller than achievable with conventional\r\nlithography techniques. The exploratory research proposed here aims to increase the stability of DNA\r\nnanostructures by incorporating isoG/isoC base pairs within and between DNA building blocks, by\r\nfacilitating ligation between abutting oligonucleotides, and by exploring interstrand chemical crosslinking.\r\nThe long-term goal of the proposed project is to develop methods for stabilizing DNA and\r\nbiomolecular nanostructures to increase production yields, improve the halflife, and diversify the physical\r\nand chemical conditions under which the structures are useable. In addition, it has been noted, that\r\nattachment of nanomaterials, for example metallic nanocrystals or large proteins, to the component DNA\r\nstrands prior to assembly into lattices can result in assembly difficulties and decreased size of the\r\nresulting superstructures. Stabilized lattices may help to overcome these issues.\r\nSummary of Proposed Research Tasks: 1). Develop DNA self-assembly materials and techniques\r\nfor formation of larger addressable arrays and lattices. 2). Incorporate stabilizing strategies, including\r\nisoG/isoC and ligation into DNA tile lattice designs. Perform nanoscale structural characterization. 3).\r\nInvestigate interstrand cross-linking via chemical bridges within DNA building blocks. 4). Test the\r\nstabilized nanostructures as templates for metal deposition and scaffolds for immobilization of\r\nconducting, semi-conducting, and dielectric nanomaterials.\r\nThe proposed project fulfills the goals of the CCF Division and of the Emerging Models and\r\nTechnologies Program by advancing fundamental capabilities in computer science and engineering using\r\nadvances and insights from areas as diverse as biological systems and molecular engineering. The\r\nproposed research innovations enable fundamentally different ways of approaching the fabrication of\r\ncomputing and communications hardware. The intellectual merit of the proposed activities is high\r\nbecause the project brings together cutting-edge research in DNA self-assembly with new synthetic\r\nbasepair options and chemical cross-linking procedures, and from the fact that the PIs lab is uniquely\r\nqualified and poised to execute the proposed study at this time. There is a high likelihood that the research\r\ntasks will be completed as described and very high scientific and technological payoffs when they\r\nsucceed. Broader impacts of the proposed work include the possibility of stabile DNA nanostructures for\r\napplication not only to computing but also to biomedical uses, as well as the certainty of establishing\r\nresearch training opportunities for the next generation of creative experts in bioinspired design, molecular\r\nengineering, self-assembly, and nanostructure templated chemistry.",
