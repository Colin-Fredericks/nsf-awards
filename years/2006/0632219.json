 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together polar researchers, science centers and broadcast media reporters to tell the story of four polar research expeditions to the general public, teachers and students.  The four expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic were chosen based on their relevance to the three primary IPY research emphasis areas defined by NSF.  A science writer and a professional photographer/oceanographer reporting on each expedition will do daily webcasts on the \"Polar Discovery web site (http://polardiscovery.whoi.edu)\" as well as several scheduled real-time phone patches to audiences at the Museum of Science, Boston, the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, The Field Museum (Chicago), the Houston Museum of Natural Science, the Pacific Science Center (Seattle), the Birch Aquarium (San Diego), National Public Radio stations, CBS News and to student \"reporters\" writing for Scholastic Online.  Programs will also be broadcast on University of California TV.  A museum exhibit at the WHOI Exhibit Center will highlight polar research.  Components of it will either travel to partner museums or be replicated in the partnering museums.  Photo archives of the expeditionary material will also be created and made available to interested users.",
