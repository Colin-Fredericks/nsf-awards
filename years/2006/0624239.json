 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nTraditional multivariate statistics focuses on the analysis of data that\r\nare vectors of finite length. However, modern data collection methods are\r\nnow frequently returning observations that should be viewed as the result\r\nof digitized recording or sampling from stochastic processes. These types of\r\ndata occur in the context of functional data analysis (where the\r\nobservation process has a one dimensional index set), image analysis and\r\nspatial statistics, for example, and arise from every aspect of the modern\r\nworld. Our ability to process and to make use of such data directly\r\naffects the way in which scientific inquiries are conducted and practical\r\nproblems are solved. Goals for analyzing this type of high dimensional\r\ndata include the detection of structure and dimensionality reduction and\r\nthese are the issues that will be addressed in the proposed project.\r\nSpecifically, a number of topics will be investigated concerning dimension\r\nreduction for data from stochastic processes including i) canonical\r\ncorrelations analysis for two or more processes, ii) mixed models methods\r\nfor analysis of data from multiple processes, iii) inverse regression and\r\niv) varying coefficient models. The unifying theme in all this work is the\r\nuse of reproducing kernel Hilbert space methods to formulate both the\r\nproblems and their proposed solutions.\r\n\r\nWith fast progressing modern technology in fields such as medicine,\r\nenvironmental science, and homeland security, the data collected in those\r\nfields today are frequently curved or spatial data, and may be even more\r\ncomplicated in terms of scope and structure. Traditional statistical\r\nmethods were created to primarily deal with\r\nlow-dimensional data, and are not suitable for the high-dimensional or\r\n``functional'' nature of the data described above. This research is aimed\r\nat addressing a number of fundamental issues in the emerging branch of\r\nmodern statistical data analysis that deals with high-dimensional data.\r\nThe results to be obtained will not only potentially impact\r\nhigh-dimensional data analytic methodology across a myriad of\r\ndisciplines, but will also provide a theoretical foundation and\r\ndirections for future statistical research.\r\n\r\n",
