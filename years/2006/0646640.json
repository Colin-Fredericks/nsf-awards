These issues require attention at these early stages of the explosive growth and implementation of nano-technology. The environmental issues could also present unprecedented opportunities for the application of nanotechnology in solving environmental and resource utilization problems of other industries and human activities. Organizers of the proposed Forum have proven track record of successfully organizing international symposia/conferences. Potential host organizations in Australia, USA, Singapore have adequate facilities for organizing international meetings/conferences.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\n\r\nThe environmental and sustainability issues are global and as such require global solutions, through global collaboration. The forum is hosted by selected universities and agencies that have well-established programs and reputation in this area. They also represent three regions/countries where the nanotechnology emphasis faces critical bottlenecks in terms of availability of natural resources that are needed to sustain its intended growth. The invited speakers are among the top experts from various sectors, selected to cover various angles of this topic from an international and multi-disciplinary perspective. Important outcomes of the proposed Forum include international research partnerships and collaborative team efforts in the theme areas of the meeting. Special emphasis will be given to recruit and facilitate the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering (e.g., underrepresented minorities, women and persons with disabilities). The results of discussion will be summarized in a final report which will consist of recommendations to sponsoring agencies, proposed roadmap and R/D needs and priorities in related areas, formation of task forces for follow up on action items and recommendations.",
