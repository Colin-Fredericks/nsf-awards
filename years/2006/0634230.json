 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, \"NUE: Integrating Nanoscale Systems and Design into the Undergraduate Engineering and Science Curricula,\" at  Duke University, under the direction of Dr. Jung-Hwa A. Gimm, has as its goal, to integrate fundamental knowledge regarding nanoscale systems, to design and incorporate learning modules into key introductory undergraduate general chemistry courses, and to develop a new upper division course that ties in exposure to engineering design principles and access to cutting edge research investigations in molecular engineering and nanomedicine.  Summer research opportunities will be created which specifically target first and second year students for participation in 12-week hands-on research projects in the labs of participating faculty members whose research focus on nano-scale science, technology, engineering, materials, or medicine.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The proposed program provides a mechanism for leveraging the collective knowledge of a group of faculty actively engaged in nanoscience and nanomedicine research into a high impact educational program.  The intellectual merit of the project derives from features that will extend active involvement in nanoscience beyond the research enterprise into a broad arena of undergraduate learning.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The project expands student awareness and understanding of nanotechnology and its relationship to biotechnology and biomedical science.  In addition, the project promotes training and learning of nanotechnology tools while advancing innovative design and challenging the students.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) Program Solicitation (NSF 06-538), and is being funded by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Design and  Manufactuing Innovation (DMI), Division of Bioengineering and Environmental Systems (BES), Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems (CMS), and Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC).",
