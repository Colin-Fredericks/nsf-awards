 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Coalition for Watershed Education, consisting of the Land Access Information Association, Great Lakes Children's Museum, Interlochen Public Radio and Northwestern Michigan College Great Lakes Studies Institute will implement a comprehensive science education project for youth and adults.  The major components include:  Watershed Discovery field experiences, Soundscapes radio broadcasts, Waterscapes exhibits, a project website, and the expanded Great Lakes Coalition for Watershed Education.  Watershed Discovery is a field-based experience for youth ages 11-17.  Teams of 6-10 youth will work with mentors who specialize in GPS, GIS, geology and geography to research and collect data on the Great Lakes watershed.  These students will also use their new knowledge to produce radio segments as part of the Soundscapes component.  Youth teams will be trained to interview sources, gather information and write scripts for use on the local National Public Radio affiliate.  The Great Lakes Children's Museum will design a permanent, interactive watershed of 1,500 square feet, as well as a traveling exhibit of 500 square feet for visitors ages 7-12.  Other deliverables include \"A Community Guide to Watershed-based Science Education\" (available in print and CD-ROM), a one-day regional dissemination conference, and an interactive website.  Strategic impact will be realized through the development of a novel model for watershed education, its subsequent replication and summative evaluation outcomes.  It is estimated that over 40,000 children will be reached by this community-wide initiative.\r\n",
