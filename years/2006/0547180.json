This grant will fund an experimental program to investigate the stability of viscoelastic wormlike micelle solutions in strong extensional flows.  At sufficiently high concentrations, surfactants solutions can spontaneously self assemble to form wormlike micelles. Like polymers, these wormlike micelles can entangle and impart viscoelasticity to the fluid. Unlike polymers, wormlike micelles are constantly breaking and reforming under Brownian dynamic fluctuations. Micelle solutions are currently being used extensively as rheological modifiers in consumer products such as paints, detergents and pharmaceuticals where careful control of the fluid properties is required.  In addition, micelle solutions have also become important in a wide range of applications including agrochemical spraying, inkjet printing and enhanced oil recovery.  A fundamental understanding of the behavior of these complex fluids in different flows regimes is therefore of critical importance.  This research program will experimentally and theoretically investigate the stability of wormlike micelle solutions in flows with strong extensional components.  This research has the potential to generate a wealth of new and fascinating fundamental science as well as applicability for tremendous commercial and industrial utilization and success. The education plan consists of targeted activities designed to promote the implementation and evaluation of active learning techniques and novel assessment techniques, the implementation of activities focused on the expansion of research opportunities for undergraduates and an outreach program to K-12 students designed to spark their interest in science by showing them the beauty within science using interactive fluid mechanics demonstrations and high-speed photography.\r\n\r\nCo-funded by the EHR Research on Learning and Education Program.\r\n",
