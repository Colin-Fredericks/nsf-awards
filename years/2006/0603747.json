 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introduction: With the goal to address the severe national shortage in the number of\r\ndomestic members of underrepresented populations (i.e., African Americans, Hispanics,\r\nAmerican Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders) pursuing\r\ndoctoral degrees in the STEM disciplines (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics),\r\nthe Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) Program was initiated by the\r\nNSF in 1998. During the last 7 years, the program has grown from few alliances in 1998 to 27\r\nAGEP alliances nationwide in 2005. While these AGEP alliances are required to collaborate\r\namongst themselves in order to better fulfill the program goals, transaction costs and financial\r\nconstraints prevent them from collaborating more effectively on a regional or national basis.\r\nThis limitation may hinder the full potential and growth of the AGEP Program because\r\nindividual alliances may miss out on opportunities for the identification and sharing of best\r\npractices and lessons learned from other AGEP alliances. The purpose of this project is to\r\nexplore the degree to which the strategic deployment of cyberinfrastructure can broaden and\r\ndeepen collaboration amongst AGEP alliances in NY State, as a pilot study, and to lay the\r\nempirical foundation for a larger proposal to strengthen the national integration of AGEP\r\nalliances.\r\nIntellectual Merit: To accomplish these goals for enhanced collaboration and sharing of\r\nbest practices and resources throughout the national AGEP community, we have designed our\r\nstudy to be implemented in two phases: The focus of Phase One will be to build a pilot\r\ncollaboratory for the emerging partnership of the New York AGEP alliances. This pilot NY\r\nAGEP Collaboratory will serve as the prototype of a National AGEP Collaboratory that may be\r\nproposed after evaluation of the pilot data. In Phase Two of the proposed project, we will\r\nexpand membership in the pilot collaboratory to the remaining three AGEP alliances on the East\r\nCoast. Again, this pilot East Coast AGEP Collaboratory will help us to learn valuable lessons as\r\nwe plan for a proposed National AGEP Collaboratory project. Guided by literature on the\r\ndevelopment of Cyberinfrastructure and Collaboratories, we propose to study the three\r\noverarching domains around collaboratory practices. We characterize these domains as: (1)\r\npeople-to-people; (2) people-to-information; and (3) people-to-facilities. Each of these domains\r\nis critical to the needs of the AGEP alliances. Formative and summative evaluation of the pilot\r\nstudy will be undertaken to provide the analysis that will help in making decisions about the\r\nsubsequent phases of the project, leading up to the national AGEP Collaboratory. Areas that will\r\nbe evaluated include administrative capacity, planning and research, affiliate capacity building,\r\nand enhancing outreach capacity.\r\nBroader Societal Impacts: In addition to the project's direct impact on the participating\r\nAGEP alliances in terms of building their capacities and increasing their efficiency to facilitate\r\nthe achievement of their objectives to support the development of more members of\r\nunderrepresented populations achieving the doctorate in the STEM disciplines and entering the\r\nprofessoriate, the project has broader impact at regional and national levels. The universities and\r\ntheir student populations in general will benefit from increased opportunities for collaboration\r\namongst the participating universities, including brown bags, courses, seminars, and research\r\nopportunities. These technologies will make it easier to engage local communities in research\r\nactivities where relevant. Nationally, the lessons learned form this project can be applied not\r\nonly to the future AGEP collaboratory, but to other loose networks and alliances of\r\ninterdisciplinary and multi-institutional actors.",
