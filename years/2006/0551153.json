 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two recent developments have revolutionized atomic physics: The observation of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), and a series of theoretical and experimental advances in quantum information. Atomic quantum fluids and quantum information theory are now among the most active and exciting areas of physics. Their common denominator is many-body quantum mechanics. Strongly correlated quantum systems realize some of the most fundamental states of matter, which are important for understanding phenomena in cosmology, condensed matter, nuclear and many other areas of physics. Ultracold atoms have become a test bed to tackle old and unresolved, and conceptually new questions in quantum systems of interacting particles.\r\n\r\nThe Center for Ultracold Atoms is building on the technical capabilities developed in its first phase and the advent of five new faculty members to focus on these areas. The deep questions that motivate this quest are the nature of high-temperature superconductivity, unresolved basic problems in quantum magnetism (e.g. antiferromagnetic frustration, spin liquids), and the desire to develop a deeper understanding and experimental control of entanglement. The quest is an exploration and control of the quantum world, uncovering and using unknown parts of the vast Hilbert space of possible wave functions. The ultimate pay-off could be the discovery of materials with novel properties, insight into how to increase the transition temperature of superconductors, and major advances towards the realization of quantum information systems.\r\n\r\nTo pursue this vision the Center is organizing its research program around two themes, strongly correlated states of ultracold atoms and quantum state control of atoms and photons.  The first theme is centered on many-body physics and strongly overlaps with condensed matter physics. The second involves the interactions of a few or several atoms and photons, their entanglement and quantum state manipulation. These topics will be pursued by a team of eight Senior Investigators. Five of these are new to CUA, and their interests are a major driving force for the new research program. They have joined the vibrant CUA community that consists of approximately 65 graduate students, 15 undergraduates, and 15 postdocs. All the research will be performed on campus in CUA facilities, and will be fully integrated with the teaching and education programs at MIT and Harvard, through research opportunities for undergraduates, lab tours, and by being used in lectures as illustrations for basic concepts in physics. The Center reaches out to the community through the organization of a summer school, sponsorship of workshops, an annual program to recruit new science teachers, the creation of a virtual journal for ultracold atoms, a weekly seminar, and a visitor's program.\r\n\r\nFunding for the CUA is provided by the Division of Physics through the Physics Frontiers Centers program and the Division of Materials Research through the Condensed Matter Physics program.\r\n",
