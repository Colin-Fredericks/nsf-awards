 "awd_abstract_narration": "A program of theoretical economic research will be used to model strategic interactions between agents who over time receive private information about the outcomes of different action combinations. The program has three components:  reputation games with changing types, joint liability contracts with moral hazard and adverse selection, and a folk theorem for games with unknown payoffs and private learning.\r\n\r\nIn the \"chain store game,\" a large incumbent firm faces potential challengers in a sequence of different markets.  Usually it is cheaper for the firm to accommodate entry by a challenger, but sometimes fighting is better.  In either case, the firm would like to establish a \"reputation\" for fighting entry, in order to deter future challengers.  The innovation relative to previous literature is that the firm's \"type\" (that is, its costs) changes over time.  Wiseman (2005b) shows that in the finite-horizon, i) stretches where challengers enter alternate with stretches where they are deterred, and ii) as the rate at which the firm's type changes shrinks, entry is deterred nearly all the time.  The current goal is to extend those results to the infinite horizon, and to more general games. \r\n\r\nThe second part of the project will examine learning and equilibrium when agents repeatedly play a stage game whose payoffs are uncertain. Initially, that uncertainty is symmetric--all players begin with a common prior.  In each round, though, players receive through their realized payoffs private signals about the state of the world. The aim of this part of the project is to extend the folk theorem of Wiseman (2005a) for such games with public signals to include imperfectly correlated signals.  \r\n\r\nThe project's final part looks at the problem faced by a monopolistic provider of insurance to a group of agents who are connected by an informal risk-sharing arrangement.  In particular, the focus of the project is on whether or not the monopolist can do better by offering joint liability contracts rather than individual liability contracts.  Paal and Wiseman (2005) show that in the absence of any informational asymmetry between the insurer and the agents, joint liability contracts can be superior when the agents collude, and not otherwise.  The next step is to make the model more realistic by introducing moral hazard and adverse selection.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The project will generate several broader impacts for society. The first part could provide a better understanding of how to regulate anti-competitive behavior by firms when one is much larger than the others.  The second would aid in designing repeated auctions for bidders who are uncertain about their valuations.  The third part could help explain how to make microfinance programs, which have been very successful in developing countries, work in inner cities in the United States, where they have failed.  Since the research questions can be phrased straightforwardly in terms that undergraduate economics majors can understand:  How does a \"big box\" retailer compete with local stores? Why is it difficult for a husband to get a bank loan without involving his wife as a co-signor?  The project will also yield positive spillovers for the investigator's teaching.\r\n",
