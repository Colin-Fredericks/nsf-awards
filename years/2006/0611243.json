 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)Phase I research project objectives include the development of the Optical Parametric Amplification of Cross Correlation of Frequency- Resolved Optical Gating (OPA XFROG) for LIDAR detection that entails the assessment of the minimum measurable signal and the application to known incoherent signals. The technique has shown compelling results, however the parameters of amplification, such as pump pulse energy and crystal thickness, need to be optimized before this optical technique can be integrated into commercial instrumentation. A second objective is the design of the LIDAR instrument equipped with the optical amplification apparatus (transmitter, receiver, and optimization of the backscattered light collection). \r\n\r\nThe ability to detect weak fluorescence and Raman signals using a LIDAR system has considerable impact on future remote sensing applications. Not only will remote sensing distances be significantly extended (a minimum gain of two orders of magnitude is expected) but species with spectral signatures that are too weak to be recognized against the background noise will be within the signal-to-noise ratio required for positive identification. Remote sensing of chemical and biological materials can substantially reduce the threat level to military personnel and civilians. \r\n",
