 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore the feasibility of production of high-quality hydrogen in remote, outdoor locations using locally generated wind power and excess water from coal-bed methane (CBM) wells.  After adapting wind survey data from several sources to a specific site in northeast Wyoming, the study will create a multivariate mathematical model to determine optimal ratios and types of equipment, including number and size of wind turbines, hydrogen generators, and water filtration systems. The core technologies to be used in this process are well established but have never been combined into a single, stand-alone process. \r\n\r\nSuccessful commercialization will benefit the national and local because it does not interact with the electric grid or with electricity customers.  It also profitably eliminates excess water from coal-bed methane wells, thus allowing CBM operators to comply with environmental regulations. By relying on wind power and electrolysis, this process dramatically improves the efficiency and environmental impact of hydrogen production as compared to traditional reformation of hydrogen from methane. It will create high-quality hydrogen with much less expense than current methods. \r\n",
