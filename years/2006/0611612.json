 "awd_abstract_narration": "A long-term partnership for research and education in nanomaterials will be established between the Center for Advanced Materials at Tuskegee University and the Cornell Center for Materials Research, a Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at Cornell University, under the Partnership for Research and Education (PREM) program sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The program, which builds upon a long-standing, productive relationship between the two institutions, has three principal components: collaborative research in nanomaterials, development of educational resources and curricula for undergraduate and graduate education in materials, and outreach to K-12 students and teachers. \r\n\r\nA cross-university research team will work collaboratively to develop fundamental understanding of both the chemical interactions between nanoparticles and polymers and the relationship between these nanoscale interactions and the mechanical properties of nanocomposite materials. This understanding will be used to rationally develop a new generation of nanocomposite structural materials that are amenable to conventional processing methods. The production of high performance textiles with improved strength and durability will be one focus of this effort.\r\n\r\n Faculty, graduate students and undergraduates from both institutions will be involved in all aspects of the research. This partnership will strengthen the undergraduate and graduate materials science education program at Tuskegee University. Educational materials, courses and best practices developed at Cornell University will be shared with faculty and students at Tuskegee University using a combination of distance learning, teleconferencing and cross-campus visits. Through a number of creative and effective outreach programs, the partners will introduce a pool of well prepared high school and community college students to materials research and inform the students of career opportunities in the field of materials science and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis partnership will have national broader impacts. By attracting and educating a considerable number of undergraduate and graduate African American students, the partnership will significantly impact the diversity of the field of materials science. By educating students in an interdisciplinary area of increasing national need  nanostructured materials  the program will help train the next generation of scientists and engineers, which is necessary for continued economic growth. By developing a new class of high performance materials, the research program will strengthen U.S. competitiveness in a rapidly expanding field of international interest. In addition, the program will elevate public awareness of materials research and reach out to the broader community, thereby helping to attract more students into STEM fields. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
