 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will improve theoretical predictions within the SM and \r\nits supersymmetric extensions. These improvements are necessary in \r\norder to fully exploit the potential of the LHC to unravel the origin \r\nof symmetry breaking and mass generation, and to search for and \r\ndisentangle signals of new physics, such as SUSY. The project involves \r\nthe calculation of higher order effects in quantum field theory \r\n(radiative corrections), and the incorporation of these into \r\nMonte-Carlo simulations of LHC processes, involving the Higgs and \r\nelectroweak gauge sector, the top quark, and SUSY particles. \r\n\r\nThe education and outreach component of this project consists of three \r\nparts: Firstly, a permanent, interactive physics exhibition will be \r\nestablished, which will integrate Art with Science, to engage the \r\ngeneral public in a dialog about physics in an inspiring and \r\nnon-intimidating setting. High-school students and their teachers, \r\nboth scientific and artistic oriented, will be actively involved in \r\nthe construction of new exhibition displays. Secondly, 'Peer \r\nInstruction' will be implemented in introductory college physics \r\ncourses, and its effectiveness will be measured. Finally, \r\nundergraduate students will be provided with an opportunity to \r\nexperience and contribute to particle physics research, allowing them \r\nto acquire skills applicable to areas within and beyond the scope of \r\nparticle physics.",
