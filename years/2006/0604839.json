 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phillips\r\nDMS-0604839\r\n\r\n     The investigator and his colleague analyze mathematical\r\nmodels, described by nonlinear partial differential equations, of\r\nsoft matter systems, namely liquid crystalline and\r\nsuperconducting materials.  They focus on electro-magnetic,\r\noptical, and mechanical interactions as well as thermo-mechanical\r\nexchanges within them.  They seek to identify qualitative\r\nfeatures in the solutions for these models including phase\r\ntransitions, the nature of defects, and their development. \r\nTechniques from mathematical modeling, partial differential\r\nequations, the calculus of variations, and finite elasticity are\r\nemployed.  The models are highly nonlinear and expressed in terms\r\nof nonconvex, second order energies.  Developing analysis and pde\r\nmethods to address these features is part of the project.  For\r\nliquid crystals a major goal is to carry out a mathematical\r\nanalysis for the event of electrically driven optical switching\r\nbetween bistable ferroelectric states in a smectic C* material. \r\nA second goal is to carry out an analytic study of the defect\r\nstructure that appears in liquid crystals brought on by applied\r\nstresses and phase transitions.  In elastomers the investigators\r\nstudy electrically and thermally driven mechanical deformations\r\nin dry and swollen elastomers.  In superconductivity they examine\r\ncurrent patterns characterized by the formation and evolution of\r\nvortex filaments within them.  For low temperature materials they\r\ninvestigate both stationary and dynamic features of vortex\r\nfilaments in three dimensional bodies, using the time-dependent\r\nGinzburg-Landau equations.  For high temperature\r\nsuperconductivity they study the vortex structure in stationary\r\nsolutions to a d-wave model as well as current patterns in\r\nsolutions for the layered Lawrence-Doniach model. \r\n\r\n     Understanding physical interactions in soft matter systems\r\nis central to the design process where one strives to make\r\nsmaller, faster, and more accurate devices.  Liquid crystals are\r\nused to make optical switches, nano devices, and displays. \r\nLiquid crystal elastomers have been proposed by physicists to\r\nmodel artificial muscles and other biological applications. \r\nSuperconductors are used for small scale sensors such as squids\r\n(superconducting quantum interference detectors) and to make\r\npowerful magnets.  The approach the investigators undertake is to\r\nanalyze mathematical models that describe soft matter systems in\r\nterms of nonlinear partial differential equations.  The work\r\nleads to predictions of qualitative features that the actual\r\nmaterials should possess and insights that should be useful for\r\nthe design process as well as for the implementation of numerical\r\nsimulations.",
