 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThis multidisciplinary Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a high precision scanning vibrometer-based motion analysis and control instrument, the MSA-400 Micro System Analyzer, to establish a centralized microstructures facility at Clemson University.  Using existing infrastructure and expertise, this MRI will advance research in i) nanotube-based actuators, sensors, and thin films-based electronic packaging; ii) surficial and interfacial films, fabrication of thin polymer films; and iii) microcantilever-based sensors for biological species detection, and nanoelectromechanical properties of biomolecules and their assemblies.  Due to multiple-technology feature of the MSA-400 that permits the exploration of new concepts at the edge of what is possible, students can receive intensive training in their chosen field, while concurrently developing knowledge in related disciplines.  This centralized microstructures facility, of which the MSA-400 is an integral part, will advance the collective efforts of 8 highly-qualified faculty members (3 of whom are NSF CAREER awardees) representing 6 departments and 2 colleges engaged in the characterization and fabrication of advance microstructures.  This collaboration will create a cross-departmental, well-equipped learning environment that integrates research with education in structural dynamics and control, surface engineering, MEMS fabrication and packaging, surface physics and topography, as well as biological materials and biosensors.  Building upon successful models used in past projects, this collective effort of scientists, teachers, and students will provide access to underrepresented and minority student groups to allow them to participate in this ongoing collaborative research effort.  The educational and outreach component of this program will attract undergraduate and high school students nationwide from these groups.  To increase public awareness of nano- and microsystem technologies, our ongoing NIH- and NSF-sponsored Bioinformatics and Bioengineering Summer Institute (BBSI) at Clemson will permit these underrepresented groups to participate in the research activities proposed in conjunction with this MRI. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
