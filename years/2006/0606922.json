 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing Activities for Conceptualizing Climate and Climate Change\r\n\r\nPurdue University is developing an innovative instructional program for educating high school students and teachers about climate and climate change, as well as the complex interface between science and society that forms the basis of management decisions related to climate change issues. A digital, standards-based instructional program that contains data rich case studies and visualization activities, as well as a visual library resource for teachers and students, are being developed as part of this project.  As part of this award, a research database on students' conceptualizations and misconceptions about climate and climate change will be compiled and used as the foundation for creation of the curriculum.  This model instructional program for enhancing teachers' pedagogy and improving students' geoscience learning is being assembled by a development team of science educators, climatologists, and Earth science teachers.  These resources will be disseminated through the project's web site and professional development on their use will be provided to teachers in Indiana by the College of Science Outreach program. This project is expected to not only improve student and teacher understanding about climate and climate change, but also enhance their visual literacy skills. \r\n",
