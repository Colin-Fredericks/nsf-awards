 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to investigate the behavioral and neuroendocrine mechanisms that propagate aggression across generations through epigenetic mechanisms in a highly paternal and aggressive mouse. Fathers may be particularly important for impacting aggression of offspring during development and perhaps more so than mothers. This process occurs through paternal behaviors such as retrieval of pups, which increases aggression levels of adult offspring. Furthermore the father's behavior causes long term changes in the distribution of the neuropeptide vasopressin in the nervous system that may influence both aggressive and paternal behaviors. A series of behavioral, physiological and neural mechanisms will be tested for involvement in the propagation of aggression and paternal behavior across generations. Hormones such as testosterone and progesterone are likely to be involved in responsiveness to the social environment and are likely to interact with the network of brain areas involved in aggressive and parental behaviors. This research will help us to understand some of the basic mechanisms that are involved in propagating social behaviors across generations at both a behavioral and cellular level. Overall, there is a dearth of knowledge about the behavioral and biological mechanisms through which parental behavior exerts long-term, non-genetic influences on the development of offspring behavior. Furthermore, in both human and animal studies, the effects of paternal behavior on offspring have received much less attention than maternal behavior. The proposed research offers an opportunity to receive broad training experience for students bridging animal behavior and behavioral endocrinology.  This project will offer undergraduate and graduate students unique research opportunities, and will promote training of underrepresented minorities.",
