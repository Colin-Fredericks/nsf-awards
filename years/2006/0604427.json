Talbot \r\nInstitution:  University of California-San Diego\r\nProposal Number: 0604427\r\nTitle: Academic Travel Support for the 2006 Joint International Meeting of The Electrochemical Society and the Sociedad Mexicana de Electroquimica\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThis is a travel grant ($25,000) for 25 U.S. chemical engineering professors and students to participate in the 2006 Joint International Meeting, October 29-November 3, 2006, in Cancun, Mexico.  This will be the first Joint Meeting of The Electrochemical Society (its 210th Meeting) and the Sociedad Mexicana de Electroquimica (21st Meeting) with co-sponsorship from the Sociedad Iberoamericana de Electroquimica.  An allocation of $1000 per person will be made for registration fee and partial airfare support.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroad Impact\r\n\r\nElectrochemical engineering has been a fundamental research area and an enabling technology for electrochemical processes, such as electrolytic materials, batteries, fuel cells, etc.  The advancement of electrochemical and solid state sciences can be enhanced by greater discourse and dialogue between those who are researching these topics.  The goal of the project is to help US academics and students to participate in this international conference to facilitate an exchange of scientific, intellectual and practical knowledge, in particular with engineers and scientists from Central and South American countries.  Students involved with this project will gain invaluable experience through participation in this event; and, in many cases, this will be their first opportunity to present and publish their work.\r\n\r\n",
