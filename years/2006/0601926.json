Each summer the Workshop will also sponsor a three day regional conference (SUMIRFAS), Concentration Weeks, and mini-conferences.  These conferences will include introductory lectures designed to acquaint junior researchers and non experts with the basics of an area as well as advanced lectures for experts.  All participants are invited to present seminars on their own work and past experience suggests that most participants will take advantage of the opportunity to disseminate their work. The resulting feedback from a wide range of experts is especially valuable for junior researchers and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe Workshop emphasizes supporting junior researchers, minorities, women, and graduate students.  As in its predecessor, the Workshop will support many researchers not on sponsored research grants who will benefit from being in an environment that is research friendly and from contact with participants who are leaders in the field. Travel support and Young Investigator awards are available only for graduate students and researchers who do not have grant support.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
