 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computational and Applied Mathematics (CAM) group in the Department \r\nof Mathematics at the University of California, San Diego is proposing \r\nthe purchase of a 64-bit, 33-node blade rack system, using NPACI Rocks \r\nLinux-based software, to improve and upgrade their current parallel \r\ncomputing capabilities.  The proposed equipment will support fundamental \r\nresearch and education in computational science.  The research of the \r\ngroup includes, but is not restricted to, five core projects:\r\n   (1) New algorithms for parallel computation with adaptive multilevel \r\n       finite-element methods.\r\n   (2) The level-set method in computationally intensive environments.\r\n   (3) Optimization with partial differential equation constraints.\r\n   (4) Finite element modeling applications in biochemistry and physics.\r\n   (5) Hybrid finite-element level-set methods for stress-driven\r\n       interface dynamics in materials science.\r\nEach of these projects is computationally intensive and requires the\r\nextensive use of parallel computation.  The Investigators have combined \r\nexpertise in applied mathematics, numerical optimization, numerical \r\npartial differential equations and parallel computation. Access to \r\nstate-of-the-art parallel computers has played a vital and formative \r\nrole in the research and educational program offered by the CAM group.\r\nThe proposed equipment will provide an order-of-magnitude improvement \r\nin the computing capabilities of the group and will allow them to \r\nconsider even more challenging computational problems and applications.\r\n\r\nThe Investigators are participating in a wide range of outside research \r\nprojects that include applications of computational science in off-shore \r\npetroleum exploration, protein modeling, the numerical modeling of \r\nblack holes, the modeling of crystal growth and biomembranes, the \r\ncapture of diffraction effects of waves, and path planning.  An important \r\ngoal of the CAM group is the development of software for computational \r\nscience and its dissemination within the manufacturing, engineering and\r\nscientific community.  Software developed as part of the project will\r\nprovide an effective method of technology transfer and will extend the\r\nscope and effectiveness of the existing codes PLTMG, FETK, SNOPT and \r\nIOTR that have been developed by the investigators at UC San Diego.\r\nThe software component of the project will have a substantial impact on \r\nresearch involving the modeling of complex systems as it will provide \r\nscientists and engineers with instant access to state-of-the-art methods.\r\nThe members of the CAM group offer a program of instruction and research \r\nthat emphasizes the role of computational science in the formulation, \r\nmodeling, and solution of problems from diverse and changing areas.  The \r\nresearch and educational activities supported by the proposed equipment \r\nwill help attract advanced graduate students into the area of computational \r\nscience, which plays a vital role in the study of systems arising in \r\nmanufacturing, engineering and the natural sciences.",
