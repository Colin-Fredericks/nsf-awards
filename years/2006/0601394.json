Kuga, University of Washington\r\n\r\n\r\nThis proposal is directed to the development of new technologies making use of our recent study of time-reversal techniques, correlation imaging techniques, and array coherence tomographic imaging.  We propose to develop an array network system of multiple sensors which transmit spatially and temporally modulated signals.  The received signals are correlated and adapted in space and time in order to obtain high-resolution images.  Signals are distorted due to the intervening medium, but we make use of our recent studies on correlation imaging through multiple scattering random media and array tomographic imaging technique to obtain improved image resolution, together with our recent studies on time-reversal, imaging, communication, and super-resolution in random media.  This study is aimed at the development of generalized theories of space-time-polarization wave interactions with complex media, both deterministic and stochastic.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity: This proposal addresses the development of theories of the interaction of waves with a complex environment, the use of distributed sensors, and the unified treatment of all information including space, time, frequency, and adaptive systems. This unified approach has not been fully explored in the past and is expected to lead to important advances in imaging and communication technologies. The goals of this study will be the development of a new discipline encompassing electromagnetic wave propagation, communication, detection, and signal processing.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nBroader Impacts Resulting From the Proposed Activity: The training and education of students is one of our priorities.  We have an undergraduate microwave laboratory, and we employ undergraduate and graduate students for conducting experiments in microwave measurements and verification of our proposed studies.  This will help students appreciate the importance of integrating experiment, theory, statistical considerations, sensors, and signal processing.  Collaboration with other researchers in academia and industry is also important and it will be pursued.\r\n",
