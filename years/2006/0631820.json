The research involves experimental evaluation of control algorithms for a novel mobile crane in the robotics lab of Dr. Shigeo Hirose of Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan. Current crane technology faces at least two significant limitations: payload sway and lack of mobility.  Mr. Vaugh's Ph.D. research aims to develop a rapidly deployable mobile crane and to test the effectiveness of command shaping on cranes mounted on mobile platforms. Four specific research objectives were formed to achieve this goal: 1) modify a portable tower crane at Tokyo Tech and mount it on a mobile platform; 2) experimentally evaluate methods of moving the mobile crane without payload sway; 3) study the operational effectiveness when both the mobile base and crane jib move simultaneously; and 4) study coupling between base crane motion and payload sway.  The research will be conducted during a four-month period in Japan from November 2006-Feburary 2007.\r\n",
