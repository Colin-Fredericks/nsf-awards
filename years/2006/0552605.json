 "awd_abstract_narration": "Duke University's Institute for Genome Sciences & Policy (IGSP) offers undergraduates research involving Explorations in the Genome Sciences. The interdisciplinary program involves IGSP faculty from the Departments of Biology, Cell Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Genetics & Microbiology, Biomedical Engineering, Statistics, and Biostatistics & Bioinformatics. The IGSP-wide emphasis on challenges represented by the Genome Revolution unifies faculty research interests and will create common themes for the individual student projects. Aside from an intensive research effort, student activities over the 10-week summer program include: (1) one-day orientation; (2) genome research ethics retreat; (3) weekly genome sciences research seminars; (4) weekly genome science career forums; (5) weekly student research discussion sessions; and (6) end of summer research forum for students to present their research results and conclusions. Facilities at Duke and the IGSP will provide students the necessary tools with which to engage and conceptualize their individual project within the developing area of genome sciences research. Undergraduates will be drawn from a national and diverse pool. Applications from women and under-represented minority students are encouraged. The integrated research experience will enable students from a broad range of disciplines to disseminate knowledge and appreciation of the interdisciplinary nature of genome sciences research. More information is available at http://www.genome.duke.edu/edexchange/programs/summerfellowships, or by contacting Dr. Huntington Willard at hunt.willard@duke.edu or Dr. Gregory Wray at gwray@duke.edu.",
