 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop novel composite nanomaterials with a structure similar to the dumbbell that has two different functional nanoparticle units with one being magnetic ferrite (MFe2O4), iron, cobalt, nickel, iron-nickel, or cobalt-iron, and the other metallic gold, silver, platinum, or palladium. These two functional units are physically linked by epitaxial growth of one crystal on another. The epitaxial linkage between two particles can be considered as a nanoscale junction, and electrons in one nanoparticle are capable of transferring across the interface to another nanoparticle. This junction effect can modify the electronic structure of both particles in the dumbbell structure, leading to novel physical and chemical properties that do not exist in the single component nanoparticles. The synthetic control in size, shape and interconnection of the composite nanostructures, achieved in this proposal, will allow the fine tuning of the junction effect in the dumbbell structures, facilitating the rational design and synthesis of advanced  composite nanomaterials with optimum properties for catalytic applications.\r\n\r\nNon-technical Abstract\r\n\r\nThe proposed research represents a new direction in the study of solid-state composite nanostructures. It will provide new contents for both Solid State Chemistry \r\nand Nanoscale Materials: Synthesis and Applications, two courses the PI has been teaching in Browns undergraduate and graduate classes. The composite nanostructure and the rational approach to it will further enrich the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology\r\neducation programs in Browns Chemistry, Physics, Engineering and Life Science\r\nDepartments. The proposed research will contribute an essential part to the education of\r\nScience and Engineering students to meet tomorrows challenge in Nanoscience and\r\nNanotechnology. Timely dissemination of the research results  will be to the\r\nScience/Engineering students at Brown during the class hours, and to the scientific community and general public through conference/seminar presentations and\r\njournal/patent publications.\r\n\r\n",
