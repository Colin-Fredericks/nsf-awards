Utilizing isotopic analysis of strontium, oxygen, and lead in tooth enamel from human remains the investigator will explore the paths of migration.  This project is interdisciplinary and international, in addition to isotopic analysis the research team will also do DNA analyses on the available research specimens.   The project will give new insights not only into the North Atlantic, but into fundamental questions regarding human exploration and colonization, the process of migration itself, and of course the movements of ancient Vikings.",
