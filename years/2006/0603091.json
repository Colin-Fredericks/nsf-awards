 "awd_abstract_narration": "LSAMP: Kentucky West Virginia Alliance for Minority Participation\r\nProject Summary\r\nIncreasing both the total number of STEM degrees awarded, and the number of STEM\r\ndegrees awarded to underrepresented students, are priorities in both West Virginia and\r\nKentucky. The 2000 Census reported that over 25% of the U.S. population was African-\r\nAmerican, Hispanic or Native American. These same minority groups made up only 9% and\r\n4.1% of the population in Kentucky and West Virginia respectively. These numbers represent a\r\nrecruitment challenge for the Alliance but have also served to strengthen the resolve of the\r\nparticipating institutions. The KY WV LSAMP alliance is a collaboration of ten academic\r\ninstitutions, the KY-NSF Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR),\r\nthe WV-NSF EPSCoR, two state agencies, and the initial stage of a developing industrial\r\nsupport base. The Alliance partners submit this Phase I proposal to significantly increase the\r\nquality and quantity of underrepresented students receiving baccalaureate degrees in STEM\r\nfields, and enhance their research career aspirations. The current baseline total number of\r\nminority STEM baccalaureate degrees annually for these Alliance institutions is 128. This value\r\nis derived from 5-year averages where available to more accurately establish an appropriate\r\nbaseline value. Current institutional databases are unable to individually distinguish Asian and\r\nPacific Islanders. Thus, the values reported for minority populations in this proposal consist of\r\nAfrican Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans. The 5-year target at the end of the Phase\r\nI project is to increase this number by 111%, achieving an annual minority STEM baccalaureate\r\ndegree production of 270.\r\nThe partners of the KY WV LSAMP submit this Phase I LSAMP proposal to reach the goal\r\nof creating diverse campus environments and increasing minority STEM baccalaureate degree\r\nproduction. The developed approach incorporates those six identified characteristics of\r\nsuccessful programs in a manner tailored for the Alliance institutions and the two states. The\r\nfocus areas for our approach are:\r\nRecruitment and retention\r\nResearch experiences\r\nTransitional experiences\r\nClimate\r\nCurriculum reform\r\nPostgraduate career aspirations\r\nRole models\r\nIn addition to individual campus activities in these areas, the Alliance will be enhanced by a\r\nbest-practices committee of partner institutions for each focus area. Alliance-wide activities\r\ninclude an annual student research symposium, and workshops on such topics as the benefits\r\nof graduate school, preparation for graduate school, research career options, incorporating\r\ndiversity into the curriculum, mentoring, and recruitment and retention of minority STEM faculty.\r\nThe potential impact of this program will be visible on both campus and state levels. The\r\nintellectual merit of the proposed activity is the increased knowledge base related to teaching\r\nand learning practices for STEM disciplines, the knowledge base regarding practices for\r\nimproved retention, and the development of improved curriculum materials and practices for\r\nSTEM disciplines. The foremost broader impact is the increase in minority STEM baccalaureate\r\ndegree production. This will broaden the math, science, and engineering participation of\r\nunderrepresented students in two states. The increase in skilled workforce has the potential to\r\nsignificantly stimulate the competitive position of the two states relative to that available with the\r\ncurrent educational levels, and in doing so, attract new jobs which diversify the economic base.\r\nImprovements in the faculty demographics add expanded research capacity to academic\r\ncommunity and broaden the participation of underrepresented faculty in STEM disciplines.",

Losing contributions from any group with talents to offer in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering, the sources of many of our most innovative technological breakthroughs, is wasteful.\n\nThe principal goals of the Kentucky-West Virginia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, KY-WV LSAMP for short, are to increase the quantity and quality of students from underrepresented groups earning baccalaureate degrees in STEM disciplines (including the Sciences, Technology, Mathematics and Engineering) and providing the knowledge and opportunities for continuing into a STEM-related graduate program or direct entry into the STEM workforce.
