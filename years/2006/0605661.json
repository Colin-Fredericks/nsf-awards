In the ultrafast pump-probe technique, a pulsed laser beam (pulses lasting less than one trillionth of a second) is split into two paths: a pump and probe. The pump beam perturbs the magnetic properties of the thin film under study, while the probe beam, delayed in time, measures the state of the film some time after the pump excitation. This technique, analogous to strobe photography, allows us to take \"snapshots\" of magnetic properties on the fastest timescales. The goal of this work is to determine and control the ultimate time scale of switching in ferromagnetic thin films, important for the ultimate speed of data storage, manipulation and retrieval in computer systems.  This work will provide graduate and undergraduate students opportunities to learn synthesis and characterization techniques for magnetic thin films as well as state of the art ultrafast laser optical techniques. The investigators are also developing lectures on technological subjects for the general public. \r\n\r\n*******TECHNICAL ABSTRACT*******\r\nThis award supports a collaboration between a researcher at the College of William and Mary and another at the University of Toledo. The experimental project will apply all-optical ultrafast pump-probe laser techniques to study anisotropy and magnetization dynamics in engineered ferromagnetic multilayer thin films. Anisotropy in the magnetic characteristics of thin films is an important property that determines the usefulness of magnetic materials in computer applications. For example, anisotropy affects the spin dynamics and can determine the ultimate read/write time for magnetic materials. Ultrafast laser techniques allow for the measurement of magnetization dynamics and anisotropic properties directly in real time. In this project, one investigator will produce magnetic thin films with large anisotropic properties, while another will focus on the laser measurements. Besides studying anisotropy in some unique material systems and enhancing the use of ultrafast laser-based techniques for the measurement of anisotropy, the investigators will also use ultrafast laser pulses to permanently induce anisotropy. This work will provide graduate and undergraduate students opportunities to learn synthesis and characterization techniques for magnetic thin films as well as state of the art ultrafast laser optical techniques. \r\n",
