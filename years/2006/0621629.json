 "awd_abstract_narration": "The advancement of wireless technology has enabled Internet users to access all kinds of Internet services via their mobile devices. However, with the dramatic increase of Internet streaming media content, the existing Internet lacks sufficient support for efficient streaming delivery to heterogeneous mobile devices.  This is due to the resource constraints at both the sender side and the receiver side.\r\n\r\nIn this project, effective and fundamental computing techniques are being developed and implemented to address these limits, spanning from the system level to the application level. A new system model is being constructed for streaming media sources in order to guide the design of efficient transcoding algorithms.  The objective is to greatly reduce demand for CPU cycles and storage size through real-time transcoding. With these new transcoding algorithms, the capacity and throughput of the streaming delivery system are expected to significantly improve. Furthermore, through the analysis of the power consumption for a mobile device at the data receiving, decoding, and displaying stages, a comprehensive optimization model is being developed for efficient management of power consumption in mobile devices. Power-saving mechanisms developed in the project are expected to substantially prolong battery lifetime for mobile devices. Transcoding-friendly and power-aware schemes are being tailored and evaluated to support mobile Internet access. These schemes will not only support widespread mobile access to Internet applications, but also further conserve power at mobile devices.\r\n\r\nThe techniques to be developed in this project are expected to remove barriers that inhibit Internet streaming to mobile devices and make it significantly more efficient and pervasive.\r\n",
