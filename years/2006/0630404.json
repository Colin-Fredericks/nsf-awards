 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robert Noyce Scholarship Program\r\n\r\nGeosciences Educators for Texas (GEFT) is a model small-scale secondary teacher preparation program producing 20 highly qualified geosciences educators equipped to a) teach geosciences content in grades 8-12; and b) take leadership roles to improve geosciences education state- and nationwide. GEFT is recruiting 10 students in two cohorts from the approximately 450 enrolled in degree programs in the College of Geosciences and from potential geosciences major transfers in community colleges with high populations of underrepresented students. Texas A&M is engaged in a campaign to increase enrollment of underrepresented populations by targeting and supporting transfer students from community colleges. GEFT students are receiving two-year scholarships which may be applied to either the last two years of their undergraduate degrees or to the last year of their undergraduate degree and the year in which they complete the Texas A&M Post-Baccalaureate Certification Program. GEFT faculty are advising GEFT students as they participate in the program, developing a geosciences education course for the post-baccalaureate portion of the program, and are mentoring GEFT graduates in the crucial first five years of their teaching career through a combination of online and in-person programs and training events.\r\n",
