 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides fund for the acquisition of an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) to support current research and teaching activities in the areas of nano and biomechanics of materials at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (UMassD).  An AFM allows us to understand surface topography of various nanostructured materials and biological structures at sub-nanometer resolution.  With the use of ultra-stiff sapphire cantilever, it can also be used to perform indentation studies on polymers, carbon nanotubes and nanofibers.  The proposed system consists of PicoSPM II microscope and electronics with closed-loop capability, large multi-purpose scanner with X, Y, Z closed-loop circuitry, Picoscan controller with computer workstation and diamond tipped sapphire cantilever.  The acquired equipment will cover a wide spectrum of research programs in areas of Mechanical Engineering, Materials & Textiles Engineering, Biomedical Engineering & Biotechnology, Civil Engineering, and Chemistry & Biochemistry.  Research activities will focus on nano-scale investigation of various kinds of materials such as fiber-reinforced polymer composites, adhesive bonds, smart textiles, nanofibrous scaffolds, living cells, ion exchange fibers, and molecular mechanisms of Botulinum neurotoxin integration in nerve membrane.  The shared and well-coordinated use of the proposed atomic force microscope will expand the scope of the research activities and promote potential collaborations among the above mentioned departments in the emerging areas of nano and biotechnologies at UMassD.  Since the graduate programs at UMassD are in their infancy, it is necessary to establish a research infrastructure and build a reputation.  The AFM will be a key acquisition to bring the current strength of the faculty of all above departments to a new level in the areas of nano and biomechanics of materials.  The major impact of proposed multi-functional nanoindentation instrument lies in using it to provide research training and education opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students.  Undergraduate students will be given research opportunities by supporting them through research projects using the proposed equipment.  Graduate students will be involved full-time in research activities using proposed equipment and work towards their thesis. UMassD will incorporate the research programs resulting from the acquisition of proposed equipment into the Freshman Summer Institute (FSI), an existing preparatory and outreach program where promising local college bound high school graduates study with faculty members on working projects.",
