 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to study the joint determination of gender differences in labor\r\nmarket outcomes and the division of labor within the household. The PI's analysis is based on two sets of empirical observations. First, there are persistent gender differences in \"adjusted\" labor\r\nearnings and hours worked, at home and on the market. Second, there is a large variation in\r\ngender earnings differentials across industries and occupations. The PI's explore the hypothesis that these differentials arise endogenously from the interaction between the intra-household allocation process and labor contracting between firms and workers.\r\nThe PI's propose that incentive problems on the labor market, due to private information on\r\nhousehold decisions, play a crucial role in the emergence of unequal labor market outcomes\r\nacross genders. In turn, the differential labor market outcomes influence gender roles within the\r\nhousehold, thus generating a feedback mechanism. The presence of incentive problems implies\r\nthat the earnings structure, as well as the earnings level, should be different across genders. The PI's preliminary empirical work with aggregate data is broadly consistent with this hypothesis. The\r\nproposed new work will extend the analysis in a number of directions. Theoretically, the PI's plan to\r\nuse their framework to evaluate how technological progress in home production may influence\r\ngender differences in labor market outcomes and the household division of labor. Empirically, the PI's  plan to use micro data to directly evaluate the predictions regarding the interaction between the\r\nlabor market and the household, as well as the predictions on the earnings structure by gender.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe intended contribution of this project is twofold. The PI's propose the first, to their knowledge,\r\nequilibrium model of the feedback between the gender division of labor within the household and\r\ngender differences in labor market outcomes. Typically, supply side theories have been used to\r\nexplain gender differences in earnings and employment and their evolution over time. These take\r\nas given the division of labor within the household and emphasize its role in causing unequal\r\nlabor market outcomes. By contrast, in our framework, gender roles are endogenous. The\r\ncenterpiece of their hypothesis is to identify the incentive problem in labor contracting as a source\r\nof statistical discrimination on the basis of gender.\r\nThe PI's are also the first to rationalize the large variance in gender earnings and employment\r\ndifferentials across industries and occupations. The variation in the severity of incentive problems\r\nacross industries and occupations can be related to differences in the earnings structure and home\r\nhours by gender, and within households across spouses. The proposed empirical analysis will use\r\nmatched household and earnings data to directly evaluate these predictions.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe results of this research will potentially be of interest not only to economists, but also to\r\nsociologists, as well as to policymakers. One important implication of the PI's framework is that\r\ngender equality on the labor market is intimately linked to equality in the household division of\r\nlabor. Policies aimed at reducing gender disparities in earning opportunities are likely to fail if\r\nthey do not include provisions to reduce the expected contribution of women to home production.\r\nThe research will also be integrated with the PI's teaching, especially at the graduate level. It\r\nis expected that graduate research assistants will be introduced to important research skills and\r\npotential research topics to develop on their own.",
