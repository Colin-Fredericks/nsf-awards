 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\n\r\nThe workshop funded  under this proposal will bring together community groups anda academics to address \r\n\r\nHow effective have responses been to recent community crises generated by destructive hurricanes, viewed from the perspective of affected communities? \r\nWhat groups were most adversely affected by the hurricanes, and why? \r\nThe final question will be explored both from the perspective of selected academic institutions--particularly those in geographical areas most vulnerable to hurricanes--and from the perspective of community organizations. How can we relate issues related to the response to recent hurricanes to other types of community crisis? \r\nWhat types of response did these communities receive from national, state, and local agencies, nonprofit organizations, the private sector, and academic institutions? \r\nHow do these communities evaluate the responses from these respective groups? What are the recommendations of these communities for groups that respond to future community crises? \r\nWhat roles can academic institutions perform in responding to future community crises? \r\n\r\nThis project will strengthen relationships between academic institutions and community-based organizations by developing partnerships that can be activated to respond to community crisis situations. The publications that will be generated by the project will serve as guidebooks for the formation of partnerships between academic institutions and community-based coalitions in diverse geographical areas. The project results will also be diffused through the organizations that are working together to co-sponsor the symposium that will serve as a springboard for the project. The HBCU Faculty Development Network, which is housed at Tougaloo College, will have presentations related to this research project at its forthcoming (annual) HBCU Faculty Development Symposium. The Center for Civic Engagement & Social Responsibility, will also be developing a demonstration model of civically engaged classroom where faculty serve in a mentoring role and the students undertake the community-based research",
