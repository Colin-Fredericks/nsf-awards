The major innovation is to covalently couple the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to the liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) using a unique nanotube chemistry platform to achieve strong synergies among CNTs, mesogenic units, and LCE networks.  Systematic experimental and analytical work will be conducted to (1) rationally engineer the CNTs' surfaces with the designed functional groups that can facilitate their dispersion and form covalent bonding to the LCE network; (2) synthesize novel CNT-LCE composites with CNTs at different loading levels and interfacial structures; (3) systematically characterize the material properties of various types of CNT-LCE composites; (4) fabricate and characterize various CNT-LCE actuators via different external stimuli, including electrical field and remote IR irradiation; and (5) establish the composition-synthesis-structure-property-function relationship.\r\nThe strong synergies between CNTs with various characteristics and LCEs could generate many novel properties and functions. The advances in fundamental understanding of CNT-LCE composites will have a significant impact on the field of smart materials and lead to numerous potential applications ranging from actuators and artificial muscles to micro- and nano-machines. The resultant knowledge will be integrated into a new U/G course at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee to educate students about the growing importance of nanomaterials. In addition, students of underrepresented groups will be recruited through the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) supplement to participate in this research.\r\n",
