 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of biology is experiencing a major transition from a qualitative effort limited by available data to a data-rich, quantitative discipline that is governed by fundamental underlying principles. The advancement of theory, or conceptual frameworks, plays a critical role in this transition. Across the discipline of biology, there is an increasing need to describe, understand and predict the dynamics of systems that are more complex than those studied in the past. These systems are comprised of a very large number of players, many of which interact in non-linear or non-additive and distributed ways. To add to this complexity biological systems change continually as a result of short-term behavioral modifications and longer-term evolutionary changes. The workshop proposed will identify important current and future directions in theoretical biology and promote activities to catalyze the advancement of biological theory.\r\n\r\nResults from this workshop will have important implications for transforming the discipline of biology and for biological education. Advancement of biological theory will provide for a quantitative and predictive discipline with significant implications for society. The workshop itself will bring together theoreticians representing a broad spectrum of sub-disciplines, age, gender and ethnic background. \r\n",
