 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nArone is interested in the interplay between calculus of functors, \r\noperads and geometric topology. He is investigating the Taylor \r\napproximations to spaces of smooth embeddings, and he has found \r\nformulas for these approximations in terms of spaces of trees and \r\nspaces of graphs. He also intends to show (in a joint work with P. \r\nLambrechts and I. Volic) that the formality of the little cubes operad \r\nimplies quite strong rational splitting results for spaces of \r\nembeddings of a manifold into a Euclidean space. These splitting \r\nresults generalize to general embedding spaces some major theorems of \r\nknot theory (e.g., the collapse of the Vassiliev spectral sequence). In \r\nlonger term, Arone would like to extend this work to the study of \r\ndiffeomorphisms of manifolds. Roughly speaking, the first derivative of \r\nthe space of diffeomorphisms is given by Waldhausen's A-theory, or \r\nalternatively by topological cyclic homology (TC), and Arone would like \r\nto find the higher analogues of TC, corresponding to the higher \r\nderivatives. The role played by the circle group in the definition of \r\nTC should in higher degrees be played by a category of graphs a fixed \r\nhomotopy type, perhaps related to the outer space of graphs that has \r\nbeen used to study the groups of automorphisms of a free group. In a \r\ndifferent vein, Arone is also interested in developing further the \r\ngeneral theory of calculus of functors. For instance, he is interested \r\nin developing a theory of polynomial functors that would generalize \r\nGoodwillie's theory of homogeneous functor. Arone's understanding of \r\nthe subject was given a boost by the work of M. Ching, which made clear \r\nthe relevance of operads to this question. Arone is also interested in \r\napplying calculus of functors to mainstream homotopy theory. In a \r\nrecent work with K. Lesh, he discovered a new filtration of complex \r\nK-theory and a rather surprising relationship between this filtration \r\nand the calculus of functors. The paper ends with a series of \r\nconjectures about the precise nature of this relationship, and he would \r\nlike to pursue these conjectures.\r\n\r\n\r\nArone believes that the proposal will shed new light on active areas of \r\ncurrent research in mathematics and will lead to important new \r\ninsights. The proposed research should cast an important part of \r\ngeometric topology in terms familiar to algebraic topologists, and \r\nconversely bring the power of homotopy theory to geometric topology. \r\nThe proposed activity involves an exciting interplay of ideas from \r\nalgebraic topology, combinatorics, group cohomology and geometric \r\ntopology. The PI hopes that eventually it will impact the thinking of \r\nmathematicians from fields other than topology. It should also generate \r\nexciting new ways to introduce important topics in topology to \r\nstudents. It is already beginning to generate a number of PhD theses in \r\nmathematics.\r\n",
