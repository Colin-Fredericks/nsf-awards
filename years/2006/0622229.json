The proposed approach relies on three\r\nmethodologies: (1) Mathematical modeling; (2) Empirical studies to\r\nevaluate the predictions made by the models; (3) Development and\r\nevaluation of robotic systems.  \r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nInfomax control is a critical problem with applications to robotics,\r\nautonomous navigation, distributed control, automatic teaching\r\nsystems, and national defense. For example, the approach can be\r\napplied to develop tutoring automatic tutoring systems that ask\r\nquestions so as to optimize the material learned by the students.  It\r\ncan also be used to develop algorithms for data-mining large datasets\r\n so as to acquire the relevant information as quickly and efficiently\r\nas possible. It can also be used for developing robots that actively\r\nscan the environment gathering the information that is most important\r\nto achieve their current goals. Finally the approach will provide a\r\nmathematical foundation to help understand how the brain connects\r\nperception and action. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the funding of graduate students, research and\r\neducation activities will be developed in conjunction with the\r\nEngineering Course at the Preuss School in San Diego, a\r\ncharter School for low-income student in grades 6-12.  The proposed activities  will serve as an example of an approach to introduce and teach the latest technological and scientific research in local middle and high-schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
