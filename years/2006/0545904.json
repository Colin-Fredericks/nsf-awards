 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies the use of p-adic analytic techniques in \r\nseveral aspects of arithmetic geometry. One focus is on the p-adic \r\ncohomology of algebraic varieties over finite fields, including \r\ntheoretical questions like the stability of coefficient objects under \r\ncohomological operations, and computational problems like the \r\ndetermination of zeta functions of specific curves and surfaces. Another \r\nfocus is the classification of Galois representations over local fields \r\n(p-adic Hodge theory); goals of this include gaining insight into \r\nproposed Langlands-style correspondences between Galois representations \r\nand representations of p-adic Lie groups, as well as unifying the \r\ntreatment of Hodge theory in the complex and p-adic settings. These foci \r\nshare common (and recently developed) technical elements from the theory \r\nof p-adic differential equations, which again have strong \r\ncomplex-analytic analogues.\r\n\r\nThe use of p-adic analytic methods in arithmetic geometry, as in the \r\ninvestigator's work, has great significance within mathematics; for \r\ninstance, it is currently being used to pursue generalizations of the \r\ntechniques underlying the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. But it also \r\nhas surprising practical significance due to the appearance of systems \r\nof polynomial equations over finite fields (such as the integers modulo \r\na prime number) in combinatorics and computer science. For instance, \r\nelliptic curve-based cryptography has been adopted by NIST as a standard \r\nfor secure communications thanks to its balance of efficiency versus \r\nsecurity; p-adic methods can be used to select curves suitable for this \r\nconstruction. Geometry over finite fields also appears in the \r\nconstruction of many error-correcting codes; p-adic methods can be \r\ndeployed to search for codes which correct transmission errors without \r\ncarrying too much overhead. So far these applications rely on proven \r\nstatements in the theory of p-adic cohomology, but the theory is \r\nsomewhat unfinished and it seems likely that future applications will \r\nrely for their provable correctness on statements not yet proved. It is \r\nthus important to pursue theoretical and practical aspects in parallel.",
