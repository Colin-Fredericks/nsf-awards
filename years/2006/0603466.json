The institution and its partners are conducting a comprehensive assessment of industry's workforce needs and researching exemplary curricula for adaptation to meet these needs.  They are analyzing and improving educational pathways from high school to both 2 and 4-year institutions and identifying professional development activities for teachers and faculty who are teaching sustainable technologies.  The PIs are developing relevant internship opportunities for students and researching effective student recruitment and retention strategies with a particular focus on under-represented students.  \r\n\r\nTo support these goals, the PIs are hosting a one-day planning summit with the Planning Committee partners and other professionals from government, industry, education, and non-profits.  Building on the planning summit, a half day meeting of the education partners is focusing on collaborative opportunities for K-12 schools and 2 and 4-year institutions.  The project team is defining curricular needs aimed at both supporting the target industries as well as training students in sustainable development technologies.  The PIs are researching operational models of existing ATE Centers and developing a strategic business plan for implementing the proposed regional center.\r\n\r\nThe PIs are documenting and disseminating information on industry needs, existing programs and curricula, and other information through the planning summit and K-12 meetings.\r\n",
