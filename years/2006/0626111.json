This project will develop intelligent data mining tools and materials design strategies using the National Institute for Standards and Technology crystallographic and materials property data sources as an initial testbed.  This cyber-intelligent connection of well-validated experimental data will lead to correlations and patterns that can be fed back to the data source with the following objectives: 1) to develop a rational cyber-design for determining the nature and types of data equivalencies in the structural chemical information of inorganic materials; 2) to open a visual portal enhancing the use of intelligently organized correlations of structural chemical data for predicting new materials; 3) to develop a Web-based learning system for educational purposes; 4) to enhance and improve accessibility and query tools; and 5) to replace legacy point-to-point query systems in the chemical sciences by a system conveying global validated correlations across databases.\r\n\r\nSeveral communities in the chemical sciences will benefit from this Web-based intelligent system to query databases: solid-state synthetic experimentalists, theoretical chemical modelers and simulators, chemical educators, and instrument builders.  In addition, this cyber-system will be deployed and tested in several introductory chemistry courses.  Additional educational activities will include: 1) a battery of projects to be developed by chemistry undergraduates and incorporated into the intelligent system in order to search and discover structural knowledge of inorganic materials; and 2) the organization of groups of graduate students presenting their graduate projects (containing pieces of the Web-based system) in courses of the two summer workshops for undergraduates.\r\n",

The characteristic framework type of a zeolite is conventionally defined by combining information on its coordination sequences, vertex symbols, tiling, and transitivity information.
