 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues and expands the current related scholarship program (limited to computer science, enginering and mathematics majors)to provide more science educational opportunities for academically talented but financially disadvantaged students, especially students from groups currently underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. The project awards up to 30 scholarships per year to deserving students who want to transfer to a four year college or pursue an Associate of Arts degree in STEM fields. The expansion of majors in this project affords students the flexibility to develop different interests within the sciences and technology. The support system is being strengthened and expanded to allow many talented students from financially disadvantaged families who might not otherwise gain access to education the opportunity to successfully pursue career choices in the preceding fields. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits: S-STEM funds are being used to: 1. better prepare the selected students through careful mentoring and tutoring; 2. better assist the selected students in their transfer process by carefully planning and monitoring their educational plans; 3. familiarize the selected students with four year university programs, industries and research through academic trips, open houses, career days, professional meetings and visits to national laboratories; and 4. support all efforts that would aid program students in gaining scholarships, summer internships and employment. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: S-STEM funds are increasing the number of students from underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields at Contra Costa Community College, reducing the financial burden of our STEM students, and giving selected deserving students more time to concentrate on their studies.  The project is providing a long-term benefit to society and the local community by filling jobs in high demand, high wage areas and increasing the successful entry of women and minorities into these fields.",
