They\r\narise in symplectic geometry as reductions, in algebraic geometry\r\n(where they are called Deligne-Mumford stacks) as certain moduli\r\nspaces, and in topology as quotient spaces. Algebraic invariants\r\nof these spaces, such as stringy Betti numbers, twisted Hodge\r\nnumbers, and Chen-Ruan cohomology (also called orbifold\r\ncohomology) have recently gained interest because they are subtle\r\nenough to see the singularities, and in some cases describe the\r\ncohomology of a (crepant) resolution of singularities. This grant\r\nwill explore new methods to compute the Chen-Ruan cohomology of\r\nan orbifold, following work done by the PI and coauthors in the\r\ncase that the orbifold is a global quotient by a compact abelian\r\nLie group. These methods should produce a new combinatorial\r\nfomula for the Chen-Ruan cohomology of a hypertoric variety (a\r\nhyperkahler reduction of quaternionic n-space by a compact\r\ntorus), a formula for the K-theory of global abelian quotients,\r\nand the Chen-Ruan cohomology of non-abelian (Lie group)\r\nquotients. We hope to use these methods to discount or prove\r\ncertain conjectures about or bifolds and crepant resolutions. In\r\na separate undertaking, the PI is pursuing a general\r\ncombinatorial formula for questions about the equivariant\r\ncohomology of manifolds with circle actions and isolated fixed\r\npoints. We have found a topological formula for the restriction\r\nof certain canonical classes to any other fixed point, which has\r\nled to a kind of classification in 6-dimensions. In higher\r\ndimensions, we have found a \"positive\" restriction formula in the\r\ncase that the manifold is Kahler and carries an invariant\r\nPalais-Smale metric (or has other rather rigid structure, such as\r\nbeing a GKM space). This work should lead to combinatorial\r\nformulas for the product structure in the equivariant cohomology,\r\na topic of broad interest because it applies to flag manifolds\r\nand toric varieties, among other varieties. In a third project,\r\nwe propose to investigate different formulae for the structure\r\nconstants in Schubert calculus using methods developed on the\r\ncalculus of Bott-Samelson manifolds. This should also generalize\r\nto fixed-point restriction formulas in the case of a symmetric\r\ngroup (the fixed points of an involution on G) acting on G/B.\r\n\r\nThis research has roots in classical mechanics. Phase space,\r\nwhich consists of the position and momentum of a particle, is an\r\nexample of a symplectic space, with an action by the symmetry\r\ngroup, also called a Hamiltonian action. Symmetry arises from the\r\nfact that the physics is the same for all observers. By\r\n\"collapsing\" a high-dimensional symplectic space by the\r\nsymmetry, we can get a smaller space that is sometimes easier to\r\nwork with. In a broad sense, this grant is concerned with\r\ndescribing these spaces with group actions, and their\r\nquotients. It will have impact on certain questions in physics\r\nthat have arisen in string theory, as well as contribute to the\r\ndiscussion of how \"rigid\" our physical universe is by\r\nvirtue of symmetry.\r\n\r\n",
