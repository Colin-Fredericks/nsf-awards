The proposed workshop emerges from a project\r\ninitiated by Envirotech, a  group composed of environmental historians and\r\nhistorians of technology, to provide new concepts and approaches in our understanding of\r\nthe relationship between technology and nature.\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT\r\nThe intent is to reflect a more nuanced understanding of technology and the environment, one\r\nthat views them not as dichotomized, but rather as overlapping and interactive.Representing Envirotech, the PI, Professor Stephen Cutcliffe of Lehigh University and Dr. Martin Reuss, Senior Historian with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineeers (retiring next April), have signed a contract with the University of Virginia for a collection of essays with the same title as the workshop that will help delineate the intellectual parameters of this newly emerging field. The workshop will bring together the contributors to this volume, along with selected other provocative scholars, in a setting that will promote the cross-fertilization of ideas, thereby improving the focus of the volume. More specifically  this interdisciplinary, workshop will:\r\n1. Provide an opportunity for early criticism of drafts and conceptual approaches.\r\n2. Allow for input from non-contributors to the volume.\r\n3. Stimulate further thought on the subject and encourage the ongoing exchange of ideas\r\namong contributors.\r\nBROADER IMPACTS\r\nBroader impacts from the project will involve classroom use in both history of technology\r\nand environmental history courses. It should also be of use in American Studies,\r\ngeography, and archaeology classes. Thus, a primary audience is the college undergraduate\r\nand graduate student. However, other audiences are equally important. Academic historians\r\nof technology and of the environment should find this book stimulating. Indeed, it\r\nshould provide the basis for a re-evaluation of course syllabi and the ways in which the\r\nscholarly community approaches environmental history and the history of technology.\r\nFinally, the resulting book should do well in commercial bookstores. Engineers,\r\nenvironmentalists, public works officials, and government decision-makers will find a\r\nconceptual approach that challenges conventional thinking about the interaction of\r\ntechnology and environment, even influencing policy guidance and project designs.\r\n",
