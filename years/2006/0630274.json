In partnership, the Southeast Regional Clearinghouse (SERCH), the Lowcountry Hall of Science and Math (LHSM), and five Space Grant Consortia will build on NASA's investment of serving the needs of STEM educators working with students with special needs.  Two meetings will be facilitated at the College of Charleston (COFC), Charleston, South Carolina, in the Fall of 2006 and Spring of 2007 to share ideas and available resources for faculty and students with disabilities on the 46 member campuses of five Space Grant consortia in South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania.  These meetings will result in the sharing of ideas and collaborative planning of a Southeastern/Mid-Atlantic Regional Alliance for Persons with Disabilities in STEM Education (RAD).",
