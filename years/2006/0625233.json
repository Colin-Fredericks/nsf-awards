Lloyd, Institution: University of Texas at Austin\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\nThis project aims to understand effects of post casting conditions during membrane formation (i.e., solidification, extraction, and drying) on structures of microporous and nanoporous membranes using theoretical/simulational and experimental investigations. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will be the first systematic and fundamental study to relate the solidification, exchange, and drying steps of the membrane formation process to the membrane\r\nmorphology (size and size distribution of the cells and the pores connecting the cells). This  relationship will be established through the development of simulations based on fundamental concepts of materials science, transport phenomena, and surface phenomena. The simulations to be developed will describe the sensitivities of the late-stage or post-coarsening processes and thereby allow manufacturers to relate material structure and performance to the material formation process. Computer simulation of the processes will allow investigation into different\r\nprocessing conditions, diluents, and extractants without extensive and expensive laboratory research. The fundamental knowledge gained from this research will be applicable to membrane formation process that involves nonsolvent-induced phase separation as well as thermally induced phase separation.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will have a major impact in applications where a well-controlled structure is important for separation and selectivity. For example, the need for tightly controlled morphologies in battery separators, membrane distillation applications, and hemo-dialysis is well documented. Specifically, these applications need membranes with narrower pore size distributions and higher porosities. By tailoring the morphology of membranes, permeability, rejection, and selectivity, can be optimized for separations applications. This is particularly important in biochemical, pharmaceutical and biomedical separations. For example, recent advances in the field of molecular biology have increased availability of large molecular weight protein- and peptide-based drugs, and thus new ways to treat a number of diseases. The structure, physicochemical properties, stability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of these new biopharmaceuticals place stringent demands on the way they are separated during processing and the way in which they are delivered into the body. Proper control of cell and pore size in embranes used for the separation or recovery of these drugs, as well as the carriers used for delivery, could have significant beneficial impact. The PI's past record of collaborative research with industrial laboratories will facilitate the transfer of the knowledge gained in the proposed research. Broad impact will be significant where well-controlled membrane pore structure can affect membrane design for a variety of separation applications. Therefore, improved method of controlling pore size distribution can provide beneficial results in many industries. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
