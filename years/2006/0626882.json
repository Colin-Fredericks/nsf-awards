 "awd_abstract_narration": "NeTS-NBD: Distributed Algorithms for Optimal Control of Mobile Wireless Networks\r\n\r\nAward 0626882\r\n\r\nEdmund Yeh\r\n\r\nThis project establishes an analytical and design framework for optimally controlling mobile wireless networks. This includes the development of fundamental theoretical and design principles, as well as practical network control mechanisms, for optimizing performance metrics such as network delay.  The established framework uses a flow model of the wireless network, and relies on the theory of distributed convex optimization.  Within this framework, network functionalities such as power control, routing, network coding, congestion control, mobility control, and network self configuration are jointly optimized.  Moreover, distributed network control algorithms with limited computational and control overhead requirements are developed.   Expected results from the project include (1) characterization of the convergence rate and scalability of the distributed control algorithms, as well as the algorithms' adaptability to time-varying traffic statistics and changing network topology, (2) distributed algorithms which use controlled mobility to achieve network performance objectives, (3) optimal distributed algorithms for wireless networks with general coding/modulation schemes and network coding functionalities, and (4) the use of results on optimal power control and routing to obtain better characterizations of throughput scaling laws for wireless networks.  This project will (1) have direct and long-term impact on wireless network architectures used in national security, commercial enterprise, and scientific exploration, (2) impact undergraduate and graduate education through a jointly planned course, (3) enhance research and education infrastructure through partnering with other university departments, government research institutions, and industry, (4) enhance scientific and technological understanding by participation in multi-disciplinary conferences and workshops, and exposure to broader media.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
