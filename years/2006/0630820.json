 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is focusing on retaining students following the freshman and sophomore years who are likely to withdraw because of financial difficulties by awarding scholarships to academically talented majoring in biology, chemistry, mathematics or physics.  The scholarships are replacing loans to the neediest students.  The project is capitalizing on the close student faculty interaction possible in the small college environment.  To further increase the sense of community, students are meeting informally with faculty to discuss career paths and will select and invite a notable mathematician or scientist to deliver a formal presentation and meet with the students in small informal gatherings.  The program is evaluating if loan replacement is a valid retention tool for this group of undergraduates.",
