To close the global thermohaline circulation, which is important for climate prediction, there must also be small-scale oceanic processes which exhibit much higher levels of vertical mixing than that observed in the open ocean. However, capturing such vertical mixing is challenging for the current ocean general circulation models, which rely on mathematical models and numerical resolutions which are unable to resolve these processes. For a more realistic representation of ocean physics in such models, thorough numerical investigations of small-scale oceanic processes are urgently needed. The current numerical approaches, however, have a prohibitive computational cost for this geophysical setting.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of a new modeling framework based on modern multiscale turbulence modeling approaches and highly numerical models is proposed in order to explore small-scale oceanic processes. New mathematically and physically guided methodologies will be developed to handle characteristics prominent in stratified flows.  They will employ this framework for original investigations of two oceanic cases: (1) the Red Sea overflow, and (2) coastal flow near the Portofino Cape, in which stratified mixing processes are a critical component of the dynamics. This modeling framework will form the missing link between small-scale oceanic observations and the coastal and ocean general circulation models. Results from the proposed work will have implications for both global and coastal transport problems.  Novel mathematical solutions for the two-way coupling among different domains and accurate boundary conditions will be developed. All are challenging research topics in terms of mathematics, physics and numerical modeling. This blend of topics and expertise of the scientists involved will contribute to interdisciplinary training of students.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
