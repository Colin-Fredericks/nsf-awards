 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will study two different intersection theories in\r\nalgebraic geometry: the arithmetic Chow rings of varieties defined\r\nover the integers and the quantum cohomology rings of complex\r\nmanifolds. The varieties considered are homogeneous spaces of\r\nLie groups, and the goal is to understand the arithmetic and quantum\r\nSchubert calculus. This allows one to effectively compute numerical\r\ninvariants such as heights, on the one hand, and Gromov-Witten\r\ninvariants, on the other. A further aim is to answer related questions\r\nabout the combinatorics of modern Schubert calculus and the\r\npolynomials which represent degeneracy loci of vector bundles.\r\n\r\nThe study of the symmetries observed in geometric objects has been a\r\nmeeting point of mathematics and physics for a long time. The many\r\nexperiments and computations made in the 19th century eventually led\r\nto the cohomology and intersection theories of 20th century mathematics,\r\nwhich were applied to solve important open problems in both fields. At\r\npresent, we face a similar situation in modern number theory and string\r\ntheory, and computations of concrete examples are crucial to guide our\r\nintuition and to better understand the general theories. The investigator\r\nstudies two new intersection theories, Arakelov theory and quantum\r\ncohomology, in many examples which are good testing grounds for\r\nboth of them. The potential applications are a better understanding of\r\nDiophantine equations and approximation, used in coding theory and\r\ntheoretical computer science, and the enumerative geometry of curves,\r\nrelated to classical algebraic geometry and quantum field theory in physics.\r\n",
