 "awd_abstract_narration": "Northern Arizona University (NAU) will host an NSF-REU site focusing on environmental science research in the Southwest and the relationship of science to the Native American cultures of the region. Recruitment will focus on tribal and community colleges that have large Native American and Hispanic enrollments. Existing relationships with four schools (Dine' College, Crownpoint Institute of Technology, Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute, and Fort Lewis College) will facilitate the recruitment of students from these colleges. Students will be selected based on satisfactory performance in at least one science course, lack of access to research opportunities, attendance at a tribal or community college, interest in pursuing a scientific career, match of students' interests to mentors, and overall academic performance and potential. Eight students will participate in the 10-week research program. The first week is an intensive field-based workshop in the conduct of environmental science research. The workshop is designed to prepare the students for the individual research projects they will conduct under the guidance of a mentor. A mix of academic and social activities is scheduled to foster personal relationships among students and mentors, and encourage the explorations of relationships between Native American cultures and science. Research mentors have significant external research funding; therefore, it is anticipated that REU students who continue on to a 4-year degree program at NAU will be able to continue their research during the academic year. Moreover, because the research mentors are well established, it is anticipated that a significant number of participants will become co-authors on scientific publications. More information is available by contacting Amy Whipple, at 928-523-8727 or Amy.Whipple@nau.edu, or by visiting http://www.nau.edu/envsci/REU/index.htm.",
