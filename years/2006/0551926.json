R/V Langseth is presently undergoing conversion from its previous mission as an 8-streamer multi-channel seismic (MCS) survey vessel (M/V Western Legend) to a vessel more appropriate for conducting a broader mission of marine geophysical research including 4-streamer MCS, refraction using up to 100 ocean bottom seismometers, gravity, magnetics, multi-beam seafloor mapping, seafloor sampling, towed sonars, and deployment of other oceanographic instruments.  Testing will begin in winter 2006 in the Gulf of Mexico, and will include operation of all new and cross-decked science systems, emphasizing navigation systems, over-side handling equipment, the multi-beam seafloor mapping system and, particularly, the seismic instrumentation, including multiple source arrays and multiple streamers using paravanes.  Testing will also include recording seismic data to evaluate quality, and plans call for conducting a 5- to 6-day 3-D seismic survey to fully evaluate vessel and streamer navigation capabilities, software performance and overall seismic survey quality.  This data set will be available for researchers who desire to evaluate system capabilities and performance, and will serve as an initial guide for those preparing research proposals for future seismic research projects.  \r\n",
