 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative study between H.T. Harvey & Associates, Associated Scientists at Woods Hole, Inc., and R.G. Ford Consulting will combine and synthesize the distribution and occurrence patterns of highly mobile marine birds and cetaceans, as one of several data synthesis and modeling components that are based on the data obtained in the course of the field work of the Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (SO GLOBEC) experiment.\r\nSeabirds and cetaceans are long-lived, highly mobile, and highly visible top-predators that, except during breeding seasons, occur where prey is abundant and/or foraging efficiency is high.  Therefore, these highly visible, mobile predators have proved to be sensitive indicators of where the middle portion of food webs are rich and available.  This work will identify the degree to which the mesoscale integrative studies of the SO GLOBEC experiment apply toward interpreting patterns from a larger circumpolar perspective.\r\nSO-Globec is a multidisciplinary effort focused on understanding the physical and biological factors that influence growth, reproduction, recruitment and survival of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The program uses a multi-trophic level approach that includes the predators and competitors of Antarctic krill, represented by other zooplankton, fish, penguins, seals, and cetaceans.  It is currently in a synthesis and modeling phase. This collaborative project is concerned with understanding how the spatial distribution of top predators can be used to infer the distribution of krill and other mid-level prey, and will be integrated with other synthesis and modeling studies that deal with the hydrography, primary production, and krill dynamics.\r\n\r\n",
