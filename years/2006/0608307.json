 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first study to evaluate the utility of bone records for ecological analysis of large-mammal (ungulate) populations in temperate environments.  The surface bone accumulations (the remains of past generations) of four habitats of Yellowstone National Park (YNP) will be surveyed for species representation and state of decomposition.  This transect data will be compared to decades of census data on living populations for agreement in species composition and habitat occupation.  In addition, observations of carcasses with known years-since-death will illuminate bone decay rates and thus the time represented by skeletal assemblages.  These efforts will evaluate the use of bone assemblages as sources of historical information on mammal populations, thus aiding conservation and management efforts.  Given global warming and other anthropogenic threats to poorly studied systems such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, it is imperative to gain historical perspectives to properly evaluate ecological perturbations.  Understanding the ecological significance of temperate death assemblages will also enhance interpretations of Ice Age fossil assemblages.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this work include improved understanding of (1) the accuracy with which temperate death assemblages approximate source communities, and (2) the time represented by temperate, large-mammal bone accumulations.  Such insights are valuable to fields that base ecological conclusions on bone assemblages, including conservation biology, wildlife management, physical anthropology, and paleontology.  Additionally, undergraduate research is fostered through field assistantships.  Finally, with many public education venues, and 3 million annual visitors, YNP offers an excellent opportunity to share research outcomes with the public at the study site. \r\n",
