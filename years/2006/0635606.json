Vu\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, the PI addresses some of the deepest and most\r\nimportant issues in probabilistic combinatorics, including sharp\r\nconcentration inequalities and the semi-random method.  The PI and his\r\ncollaborators plan to develop new sharp concentration inequalities and\r\napply them, together with the powerful semi-random (Rodl nibble) method\r\nto attack several well-known and long standing conjectures in\r\ncombinatorics. Among others, the PI will study a series of minimax\r\nproblems in finite geometry, raised in the fifties. Another topic is the\r\nstudy of geometrical properties of random objects. Here is a typical\r\nquestion: how many points does one need to pierce n random d-dimensional\r\nboxes, where a random box is obtained as the Cartesian product of d\r\nrandom subintervals of the unit interval ?  The PI  also plans to use\r\nmethods from probabilistic combinatorics to attack problems arose from\r\nvery practical fields such as coding theory and the study of\r\n\"real-world\" graphs. For educational purposes,  he intends to write a\r\ntextbook on sharp concentration inequalities and its applications in\r\ncombinatorics and theoretical computer science. He also plans to design\r\nand teach a graduate course at UCSD on the probabilistic methods. \r\n\r\nIn the last twenty years, probability has become one of the most\r\npowerful weapons in discrete mathematics and computer science.  The\r\nfirst main reason is that randomness helps us to overcome algorithmic\r\nand existence problems which cannot be solved deterministic means. The\r\nsecond main reason is that many important real-life objects (such as the\r\ninternet) can be modeled by a random process.  On the other hand, in\r\nmany situations, the problems are so complex that traditional results\r\nfrom probability theory cannot be applied. The PI plans to develop new\r\nprobabilistic tools which would have a break-thought impact on many such\r\nproblems, some of them have been open for decades. Among others, these\r\nnew tools would help us to design very efficient randomized algorithms,\r\nto prove the existence of interesting objects, and to analyze\r\ncomplicated processes.   For educational purposes, the PI intends to\r\nwrite a textbook  on discrete probability and  its applications in\r\ndiscrete mathematics and theoretical computer science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
