Davis \r\nInstitution: UCLA\r\nProposal Number: 0645024\r\nTitle: Workshop on Cyber Infrastructure in Chemical and Biological Systems: Impact and Directions\r\n\r\nPROJECT SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the workshop are to (1) identify and exemplify major application impacts, directions and the potential for Cyber Infrastructure (CI) as it pertains to Chemical and Biological Systems, (2) identify and recommend research areas that aim toward the fulfillment of this potential, and (3) identify associated areas of needed emphasis with CI infrastructure, education and training, interdisciplinary development, and support and approaches to collaboration.\r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT\r\n\r\nThe workshop will encompass chemical and biological processes, systems biology, pharmaceuticals and metabolic engineering and involve energy, environmental, nano- and bioscience perspectives in the process context.  The thematic area will be generally defined by industries, applications, processes and systems primarily characterized by chemical and biological transformations and material, energy and information flows.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will bring together research and industrial communities in chemical and biological systems involved in smart plant technologies, supply chain management, product and production design and optimization, process management and control, simulation and modeling and data analysis with the CI infrastructure planning and operational community.  It will draw upon top talent from a diverse set of disciplinary areas as well as academic, laboratory, operations, and industrial viewpoints while maintaining the theme of \"chemical and biological systems.\"  The workshop anticipates research and practice leaders in simulation, multi-scale modeling, optimization, design, dynamics and control, sensing and interfaces, wide area data aggregation, large scale/wide area data management, analysis and visualization and network science.\r\n\r\nBROAD IMPACT\r\n\r\nThe workshop will foster collaboration across several key dimensions of the CI and chemical and biological systems combination.  These dimensions include technique and technical integration, academic and industry, infrastructure and application, current and future directions for CI, and current and future economic potential for CI. The workshop will look across a broad diversity of computation and networked-based technologies to make recommendations to NSF on future research directions and it will exemplify for the process and systems communities, the value of and their role in investing in CI and CI-enabled research.\r\n\r\n",
