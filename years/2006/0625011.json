 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research develops the next generation of high-sensitivity micro-fluid-structural sensors and enables radically novel sensing capabilities. The focus applications are bio-detection, label-free bio-chemical analysis, the measurement of micro-mechanical properties, the identification and characterization of micro-fluid-structural phenomena, and homeland defense applications. The novel sensing techniques developed are based on nonlinear vibrations by identifying and exploiting attractor and bifurcation morphing modes, and sensitivity vector fields, and by applying innovative pattern recognition methods to characterize attractor shapes. Also, this research raises the sensitivity of vibration- and acoustic-based sensors by enhancing nonlinearities and exploiting micro-fluid-structure interaction phenomena. \r\n\r\nFundamentally novel sensing capabilities are created, which provide high sensitivity, adaptivity, robustness, as well as multi-functional sensing capabilities. This research has broader impacts as it makes significant contributions to the field of structural dynamics, and has immediate potential impact because it addresses important problems in bio-detection, medical technologies, and homeland defense. \r\n\r\nHence, this research is a potential benefit to society at large, and is strengthened by a broad dissemination to enhance scientific understanding. \r\n",
