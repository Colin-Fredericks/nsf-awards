 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this collaborative workshop is to bring together researchers in the emerging fields of biomanufacturing and nanomanufacturing to explore synergies and opportunities at the interface of bio and nano manufacturing. Examples of nano-process techniques include surface modification, nanomanipulation, thermal, electrical and optical machining and deposition at nanoscale, electrospinning, synthesis and incorporation of nanoscale components and usage of biological life for the creation of nanomaterials. The workshop will identify, discuss and recommend possible collaborative areas for bio-nano manufacturing. It will invite and engage experts from the range of bio-nano manufacturing subjects areas such as\r\nfreeform fabrication based biomanufacturing, bio-printing and patterning, organ and cell printing, biomaterials designing and coating as well as nanodesigning and multiscale modeling, active and passive nano structures by designing, functionally graded hirachical nanointegrated systems, cellular sensory and actuator systems, multifunctional nano and micro metrology tools, targeted drug delivery, etc. In addition, this workshop will also discuss new opportunities for education curricula to train next generation workforce. Industry members will be an important part of this workshop where progress in small and well as large industries will be discussed and recommended to assure global competitivenss of US industries in this emerging field of bio-nano manufacturing.\r\n\r\nAs biological manufacturing and nanoscale manufacturing emerges parallel, it is becoming increasing evident that their intersections are critical pathways where new discoveries and inventions reside and where engineered nano scale structures, patterning tools and metrology means can be effectively applied for predictable, producible/reproducible, and productive 2D and 3D biomanufacturing at cellular engineering level. This workshop will provide nanomanufacturing the insight necessary to lead research with 2D and 3D active and passive nanostructures, self- and directed- assemblies, nanoscale patterning, 2D and 3D hierarchical cell and molecule printing and integration, and multifucntional metrology.\r\n",
