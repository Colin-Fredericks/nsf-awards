Topics considered in heterogeneous superconducting\r\nsystems include the effect of surface cold working or of contact\r\nwith semiconductors on the critical parameters (such as\r\ntransition temperature) that describe superconductivity in\r\nmesoscopic samples, the effect of interactions of mesoscopic\r\nmagnetic textures with superconductors on transition temperatures\r\nand vortex pinning, and surface nucleation in superconductors\r\nsurrounded by normal materials.  In high-temperature\r\nsuperconductivity, the investigator extends mathematical\r\ntechniques developed for low-temperature systems to the SO(5)\r\nmodel of high-temperature copper compounds. \r\n\r\n     Superconductors are materials that show zero or almost zero\r\nresistance to the flow of electrical current.  Usually this\r\nhappens at extremely low temperatures.  Some materials that are\r\nsuperconductors at higher temperatures are known, including some\r\ncopper compounds of recent interest.  But the theory that would\r\ndescribe their behavior is incomplete.  The investigator studies\r\nmathematical models of composite superconducting materials and of\r\nsuperconductors based on copper compounds.  A large body of\r\nexperimental data are available, but definitive models for\r\ncuprate compounds do not exist.  They are of special interest\r\nbecause materials based on these compounds show superconducting\r\nproperties at desirably high temperatures.  Superconductors are\r\nof commercial interest for building electronic sensing devices,\r\nenergy storage devices, magnets, and quantum computers.  Progress\r\nin nanotechnologies has raised the possibility of industrial\r\napplications of mesoscopic heterogeneous magnetic and\r\nsuperconducting systems.",
