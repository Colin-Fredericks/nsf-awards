Heinonen\r\n\r\nThis proposal calls for a research training program in geometry,\r\ntopology and dynamics at the University of Michigan.  Recent\r\nPh.D.'s and advanced graduate students will be the main\r\nbeneficiaries. The Mathematics Department at UM has one of the\r\nlargest and most vigorous post-doctoral and graduate programs in\r\nthe country with an excellent record of producing high-quality\r\nresearchers in geometry, topology and dynamics.  This proposal\r\ncalls to bolster the training of post-docs and graduate students\r\nin all of these areas by deepening and broadening it and\r\nproviding them with ample opportunities to excel in their\r\nresearch.  Five faculty members (Mario Bonk, Richard Canary, John\r\nErik Fornaess, Juha Heinonen and Ralf Spatzier) will lead this\r\nproject in collaboration with eleven other senior faculty.  The\r\nproposal calls for several specific innovations in the training\r\nprogram by: providing intensive exploratory seminars and\r\nworkshops, travel semesters to deepen the scientific training at\r\nother insitutions at the forefront of research, opportunities to\r\ndevelop lecturing skills, intensive mentoring and exposure to\r\nresearch in the three areas to undergraduates.\r\n\r\nGeometry, topology and dynamical systems are core areas of\r\nmathematics. Geometry investigates the shape of spaces, through\r\ninvariants such as curvature.  Topology explores the properties\r\nof spaces which remain invariant under deformations such as the\r\nnumber of holes in a surface.  Dynamical systems concern the\r\nevolution of a physical or mathematical system over time.\r\nEspecially in recent years, they have developed in mutually\r\nbeneficial interaction.  Case in point are topology, geometry and\r\ncomplex dynamics in low dimension which in many aspects mirror\r\neach other.  Many of the most exciting developments in these\r\nareas are truly interrelated, and benefit from each other either\r\nby idea, analogy or actual tool.  At the same time, connections\r\nwith other fields such as algebraic geometry and mathematical\r\nphysics have strengthened dramatically.  These developments have\r\nbeen amazing in their breadth and depth, and demonstrate the\r\nvitality of these areas.  This project will train young\r\nresearchers in these exciting and interconnected fields, and will\r\nhelp insure their future health and continued interaction.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis Research Training Grant focussed on the education and professional preparation of young mathematicians working in geometry, topology and dynamical systems.  Here are brief descriptions of these areas.  Geometry studies how spaces are shaped.  The central invariant is  curvature which measures how the space bends near a point.  Topology studies aspects of the shape of spaces that are invariant under continuous deformation, e.g., the number of holes in a surface  (consider a bagel versus a pretzel).  Dynamics finally studies the evolution of systems that change over time.  In particular, one wants to know if a typical orbit visits every part of the underlying space.  This is guaranteed by asymptotic properties  such as ergodicity or mixing, or their quantifications, entropy in particular.  \n\nIt has been known for about a century that geometry, topology and dynamics are closely linked. These three fields have developed in mutually beneficial interaction, especially in recent years. Many of the most exciting developments in these areas are truly interrelated, and benefit from each other either by idea, analogy or actual tool. For example, studying the topology and geometry of 3-manifolds is closely related to the arithmetic and dynamics of the fundamental group and the analysis of geometric PDE.  Old important conjectures, including the Poincare and geometrization conjectures, Ahlfors\u00c6 measure conjecture, Thurston\u00c6s ending lamination conjecture and surface subgroup problem, have been successfully resolved in this fashion.   In the latter case for example, all three areas come together and combine for the ultimate proof.  \n\nAt the same time, connections with other fields have strengthened dramatically.  Algebraic geometry and mathematical physics have close connections with symplectic geometry and algebraic topology.  Some recent advances in number theory draw on ideas from dynamics and ergodic theory.  These developments have been amazing in their breadth and depth, and demonstrate the vitality of these fields. \n\nCompletely new areas have arisen in the last two decades. Examples par excellence are symplectic topology, the recent geometrization of combinatorial group theory, and especially the geometric analysis of arithmetic, moduli and outer automorphism groups.  These areas abound with new ideas and offer tremendous opportunities for interaction between each other and areas outside.  \n\n\n\n\nWhile these advances have been tremendous, young researchers need to understand and master materials and techniques from several areas to be successful. This requires intensive  training broadly between several areas.   This RTG grant has been very successful in  this regard.  It was set up to be interdisciplinary between these three major fields which are closely connected and are all represented strongly at Michigan.  This led to successful interaction between advisors, postdocs and graduate students.  Most importantly, the grant freed up time for the participants by reducing their teaching loads so that these young investigators could concentrate on their learning and their research.  The department offers many opportunities for learning, e.g., advanced classes and many research and learning seminars.  In addition, we held thirteen RTG  workshops, six RTG lecture series, and partially supported three graduate student conferences.  Furthermore, we supported travel of trainees to conferences and to consult with specialists at other institutions.  \n\n\n\n\n\n370 students and post-docs learned from expository lecture series given by thirty-two experts at the RTG workshops.  Of those, 221 received financial support to come to the meetings. The workshops drew attendees both locally, from the Midwest and even both Coasts. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis RTG grant has trained 16 postdocs, 28 graduate  students and 19 undergraduates, the latter via Summer research opportunities.  Of the 28 graduate students, 17 finished their Ph.D.s, another five are expected to finish ..."
