 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to evaluate the accuracy and suitability of an in-situ ocean surface contact measurement instrument for ocean deployments in higher wind and sea state conditions. The device, called a multi-sensor float, measures the combined heat exchange due to evaporation, sensible transport and radiation. The current system is capable of performing air-sea heat flux measurements in relatively low wind conditions. Modifications to the existing design multi-sensor float to improve flux measurement accuracy and extend operating limits will be performed. A thorough test program, including a mixture of laboratory and field experiments, will characterize the new design. When fully developed, it is envisioned that multiple instruments could be deployed from ships or aircraft to provide ground truth for satellite-based measurements as well as support air-sea flux field experiments. Untended operation in the ocean and in lakes could provide longer-term, continuous measurement of heat flux, water surface temperature and solar irradiance for use in oceanic mixed layer, weather and climate studies.    \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nBecause the oceans cover a large portion of the Earth's surface, an improved characterization of air-sea heat exchange is essential to characterize variations in weather and climate. This instrumentation could provide this much needed data and could also be used to support validation of satellite-based techniques to derive global-scale surface fluxes. The PI will be assisted in this development effort by undergraduate students at this predominately undergraduate institution. This proposal would provide an excellent opportunity for a bright young scientist.\r\n",
