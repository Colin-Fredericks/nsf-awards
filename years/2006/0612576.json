 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will organized a conference on Markov processes and related fields on July 10-13, 2006 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  The conference will focus on Markov processes, their theory and applications.  Specifically, the conference will examine the general theory of Markov processes, limit theorems, stochastic equations in finite and infinite dimensions, stochastic control and filtering, queueing theory, mathematical finance, and applied probability.  The conference will feature approximately thirteen outstanding speakers and provide opportunities for approximately twenty-five additional researchers to speak.  A panel session on future directions for Markov processes will also be conducted, focusing on general trends in the discipline and current open problems.\r\n\r\nParticular effort will be made to include graduate students in mathematics and related disciplines.  The conference will support junior researchers, graduate students, and members from underrepresented groups.  A refereed conference volume is planned to further disseminate the research results.",
