 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42)\r\n\r\nThis program of research and development involves two sequential studies leading to the development and implementation of three-dimensional interactive animation (3DIA) modules in a college-level geology course. Study 1 involves the development and testing of a 3DIA prototype that supports instruction in the interpretation of topographic maps, a geosciences problem that requires high visualization skills. The design of the prototype reflects results from an earlier pilot study as well as feedback from a geology consultant. In Study 2 we are developing, implementing, and evaluating an instructional unit that uses 3DIA to teach students to do spatial problem solving tasks in an introductory geology course. \r\n\r\nThe results of these studies add to the knowledge base in the fields of cognitive science, multimedia learning, science education, and differential psychology.  From a practical standpoint, the animation modules developed are improving instruction in a college-level course in geology.\r\n\r\nThe project addresses the nationally recognized need to increase the participation of persons who are underrepresented in fields of science, mathematics and engineering by providing better understanding, from both a theoretical and technical perspective, of the role that technology plays in aiding persons disadvantaged by low spatial ability in domains where spatial problem solving is central.  As those domains are important in STEM disciplines, the outcome of the work is generally applicable to the improvement of delivery of undergraduate instruction in STEM. Because the work uses low-cost technologies, the potential for widespread distribution is high, particularly to students in two-year and four-year college settings. \r\n",
