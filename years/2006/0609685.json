 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will provide the platform to evaluate a novel application of radiation to affect an instantaneous chemical reaction in the bulk production of inorganic micro-components. The focus of this effort will be on eliminating agglomeration and other process malfunctions inherent in the water based coating process currently in use. The proposed work will develop a specific and commercially motivated interest in material for use in the efficient production of Plasma-spheresTM. Plasmaspheres are hollow gas filled dielectric spheres that act as capacitors. \r\n\r\nPlasmasphere arrays will be developed as a low-cost large-area flat panel display technology. Other novel applications of Plasmasphere arrays under investigation include phase array antennas and radiation detection. All three markets are emerging high-growth markets. The entire Plasma-sphere array production process is environmentally benign. It uses a minimum of materials, and eliminates harmful materials including lead, which is commonly used in the manufacture of electronics. Other advantages include longer life, smaller form factor, and a greater percentage of biodegradable materials. \r\n\r\n",
