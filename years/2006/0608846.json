 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to explore the emerging possibilities of using collective quantum dynamics in prospective active nanosystems. The concepts of efficient nanoscale detectors, sensors, measuring devices, quantum amplifiers, and coherent light-emitting devices will be proposed. Proofs of principles will be experimentally demonstrated with clusters of coupled nuclear spins. A structure-function relationship is much more complex for quantum systems than for classical ones. The approach is, therefore, in following the sequence: design of quantum dynamics - demonstration of feasibility with experimental nuclear spin dynamics - supercomputer simulations with modified Hamiltonians (for systems based on electrons, electronic spins, optical excitations, etc.) - proposed architecture of a device. \r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nFundamental quantum processes at the boundary between the classical and quantum worlds will be experimentally explored in this research, which will combine recent achievements in quantum information science and experimental techniques for manipulating very complex quantum systems. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe results of this work will reach broad audiences through publications in peer reviewed journals and electronically, and will contribute to establishing a new field of quantum engineering. There is an important educational component in this project. It is planned that both undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in this research at the frontier of modern science. The graduate and undergraduate students engaged in this project will be in a strong position to contribute to the continuous progress of technology and the U.S. economy.\r\n",
