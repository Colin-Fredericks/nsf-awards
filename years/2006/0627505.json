 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will address an issue of substantial importance: how\r\nto stop the rapid spread of malicious software that infects host\r\ncomputers.  The objective of this project is to develop fast methods of\r\nanalysis that accurately identify exploit code in network traffic.  These\r\nmethods should succeed even if the exploit is concealed by means of code\r\nobfuscation and metamorphosis (i.e., varying in form from one instance to\r\nthe next).\r\n\r\nWe statically analyze the control and data flow of code to characterize\r\nthe pattern of system calls executed by the code.  Both large and small\r\nexploit codes typically accomplish much of their function by such calls.\r\nThe use of code obfuscation techniques or metamorphic program\r\ntransformations will not in general change this pattern.  We use weighted\r\nmatching to compute the degree of similarity between two code fragments,\r\nbased on their system call patterns.  \r\n\r\nThe research project will include\r\n* extensive evaluation of the initial method\r\n* faster methods of control flow analysis and disassembly\r\n* improvements in the accuracy of static data flow analysis\r\nOther outcomes will include the development of a software implementation\r\nof our detection method, and standard benchmarks for evaluating and\r\ncomparing such methods.\r\n\r\nWe propose to integrate this research with education of undergraduate and\r\ngraduate students about software vulnerabilities, and how to prevent or\r\nremove them.",
