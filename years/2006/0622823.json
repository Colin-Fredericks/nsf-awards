 "awd_abstract_narration": "0622823\r\nGoel\r\n\r\nThe Conference brings together disparate bioengineering research specialties including cell and molecular engineering, tissue engineering, and functional tissue engineering - with a focus on biomechanical engineering. Sponsoring organizations include the American Society of Mechanical Engineers-Bioengineering Division (ASME-BED), the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES), the U.S. National Committee on Biomechanics (USNCB), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (IEEE-EMBS).\r\n\r\nThe Program Committee and the Plenary speakers list (from academia, industry, and health care) represent the leaders in the field. A booklet will provide program details to the participants of the conference. All technical presentations will be two-page extended abstracts in a CD format, to be distributed free to all registrants. Copies of the CD will also be provided to all sponsoring societies. The CD is to serve as the proceedings of the meeting.  \r\n  \r\nAll seven of the previous Summer Bioengineering conferences have had outstanding representation of women and minorities. This years organizing committee includes several women: Drs. Jennifer Wayne (Virginia Commonwealth University); Dawn Elliot (University of Pennsylvania); and, Michele Grim (Wayne State University). The large student representation, as well as the family-friendly atmosphere of the conference, has served to promote the involvement of women.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\n\r\nThis conference is the premiere meeting for bioengineering with a focus on biomechanical engineering. The planned lectures provide important cross-fertilization of ideas, concepts, tools, and approaches.   \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: \r\n\r\nIn addition to the direct impact this conference will have on the mainstream bioengineering community, this meeting will serve an important cross-fertilization role. Bioengineers, engineers from other disciplines, cell and molecular biologists, biochemists, biophysicists, and other scientists are expected to participate in the meeting. Therefore, the conference is expected to have a much broader impact than if it were to be attended by just the bioengineering community. And, approximately 40% of the attendees are expected to be students.  \r\n",
