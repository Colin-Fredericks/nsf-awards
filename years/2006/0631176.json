 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is resulting in 20 annual scholarships (~$5000/year) being awarded to financially-needy, academically-promising biology and chemistry undergraduates.  The results of related programs include increased enrollment of freshmen and transfer students in these disciplines, and increased retention and graduation of students within these majors.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merits:  As support for these students and to reassure their graduation and entrance into graduate school, industry or other biology or chemistry related career, the project features: three-day institutes to help students adjust to the demands of college; the formation of learning communities; bi-weekly seminars that include presentations on careers, research, and industrial applications, field trips to local businesses; and internship, employment; and undergraduate research opportunities both on campus and with local businesses. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts:  A partnership with South Puget Sound Community College, and presentations at other high schools and colleges, is helping to disseminate information about the program to other institutions. Project leaders are disseminating their findings in journals and at professional meetings (e.g. National Learning Communities). This project is serving as a demonstration of the progress that can be made when student centered projects are planned and implemented with strong faculty and student support staff collaboration.\r\n",
