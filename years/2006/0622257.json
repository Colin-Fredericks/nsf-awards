 "awd_abstract_narration": "To reduce the size of computer architecture and test a revolutionary new approach to computation, we will investigate fully self-assembled arrays of classical and quantum bits that are addressed by optical signals only. As bits we propose to use single electron spins in colloidal quantum dots (cqdots). Every cqdot has a specific resonance frequency at which the absorption of a photon can lead to the formation of a trion state (two electrons and one hole confined within a quantum dot).  Trion states have large electric dipole moments and can therefore interact over distances of the order of 10 nm. We will leverage the polarization of the illuminating light and the Pauli exclusion principle to control trion formation and subsequently detect the spectral effect of dipole-dipole interactions between cqdots spaced 5 to 10 nm apart.  In this manner, we have as a long-term goal the physical realization of theoretical schemes for quantum computing. On the way to this goal, we will explore simplified approaches that are also very interesting from the perspective of classical computation and data storage. \r\nFor the three-year period of the proposed research, our primary contribution to the quest for all-optical classical and quantum computation will be to address the challenge of nanometer positioning of colloidal quantum dots and to study their optical interactions. Our approach will be to combine self-assembled DNA scaffolds with site-specific binding elements to produce an array of optically active colloidal quantum dots.  Self-assembled DNA scaffolds leverage the intrinsic specificity of Watson-Crick base-pairing to organize millions of atoms into close-packed arrays of the familiar double-helical structure with nanoscopic precision. Modern synthesis methods allow decoration of specific atoms in the DNA structure with chemically reactive groups. These reactive groups can be chosen to form covalent links to molecules that stabilize the surface of colloidal quantum dots.  By placing the reactive groups at specific sites on the DNA scaffold, pairs of dots and linear or two-dimensional arrays of dots will be patterned, with a spacing that favors quantum mechanical interactions between dots.  The resulting structures will be characterized by scanning probe microscopy and the interactions probed by optical pump-probe measurements.\r\nThe research will be carried out by a cross-disciplinary research team at the University of California Santa Barbara that is anchored by expertise in self assembly of DNA, the synthesis of colloidal quantum dots and their attachment to functionalized elements at specific locations (Fygenson), and expertise in quantum-optics and solid-state experiments analyzing coupled quantum dots embedded in bulk semiconductor material (Bouwmeester).  We will collaborate strongly with Paul W. K. Rothemund, in the Department of Computer Science at Caltech, who recently invented an powerful new class of self-assembling DNA scaffolds that can template arbitrary complex patterns with 6 nm resolution. \r\n\r\n",
