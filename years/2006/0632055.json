 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Committee on National Statistics of the National Research Council proposes to\r\nconduct a two-phase study for the National Science Foundation's Division of Science\r\nResources Statistics. The study will address the issues involved in using the American\r\nCommunity Survey (ACS) to collect information necessary to improve understanding of\r\nthe education and employment status of the science and engineering workforce. In the\r\nfirst phase, the committee will appoint a panel of approximately 8 experts to design and\r\nhold a workshop. The workshop will have the specific objective of identifying issues for\r\nthe collection of field of degree information on the ACS with regard to goals, content,\r\nmethodology, data quality, and data products. The workshop will also review NSF's\r\nassessment of the potential of the addition of this information as a screening element for\r\nsubsequent inquiries such as the National Survey of College Graduates, which now uses\r\nlevel of degree information from the decennial census long form. In addition, the\r\nworkshop will consider the relevance and adequacy of ACS products for meeting current\r\nand emerging data needs for NSF/SRS. Following the workshop, the panel will\r\ndeliberate to prepare an interim report with its recommendations and information from\r\nthe workshop. The panel will remain in being through a second phase of activity, to\r\nfollow a planned test of collecting the recommended data on field of degree using a\r\nCensus Bureau methods test panel. When that activity is completed, the panel will\r\nreconvene to review the findings of the methods test panel and make final\r\nrecommendations regarding the collection of this information on the ACS.\r\n",
