 "awd_abstract_narration": "Judith Giordan, University of Southern Mississippi, is a Discovery Corps Senior Fellow for the 2006-2007 academic year.  Giordan plans to apply her industry expertise and leadership by offering a series of two-day workshops for young women in science (undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral and their mentors) interested in industrial careers.  Each workshop will include skill-development (communication, negotiation, presenting accomplishments), development of a personal growth plan, and networking.\r\n\r\nThis Discovery Corps Senior Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.",
