 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 04-043, category Nanoscale Exploratory Research (NER).  The objective of this NER research is adding a new degree of freedom to control the transition between the varicose and whipping instability regimes during the electrospinning of nanofibers.  The approach involves synthesis and functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles with controlled size, electrospinning experiments with and without applied AC and DC magnetic fields, modification of a custom-made electrospinning apparatus to achieve continuous fiber uptake, and characterization of individual nanofibers using DC magnetization and AC susceptibility, and modified scanning probe microscopy methods. \r\n\r\nThis collaborative project will enhance the participation of underrepresented groups in research activities as students from both institutions will work closely exchanging experimental data, samples and their unique expertise.  In addition, the results of this project will provide the basis to develop a debottlenecking strategy for the electrospinning process and new mechanisms to control the geometrical and magnetic distribution of particles inside polymeric fibers. If successful, this research would lead to increased throughput in nanofiber production via electrospinning and development of novel anti-counterfeiting measures for high-value products. The development of novel positive identification and anti-counterfeiting devices could protect American manufacturing industries from unfair and predatory trade practices such as interdiction of illegal technology exports, protection of intellectual property rights, counter industrial theft and curtailing of counterfeit goods.",
