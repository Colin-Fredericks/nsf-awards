Snodgrass <rts@cs.arizona.edu>\r\nUniversity of Arizona\r\n\r\nTowards a Science of Database Systems\r\n\r\nThis research takes a scientifically rigorous approach to an area previously\r\ndominated by the engineering perspective, that of database query\r\noptimization.  The goal is to understand cost-based query optimizers as a\r\ngeneral class of computational artifacts, to develop insights and ultimately\r\nwith predictive theories about how such optimizers behave.\r\n\r\nThe research focuses on one aspect, that of cardinality estimation. In\r\ndetermining the optimal query evaluation plan for a submitted query, the\r\noptimizer estimates the size of the output produced by each operator of each\r\ncandidate plan. An established DBMS has been observed exhibiting \"flutter,\"\r\nin which the query evaluation plans jump around or even alternate back and\r\nforth as inevitable cardinality estimate inaccuracies increase. This project\r\nevaluates the theory that the flutter arises out of unanticipated\r\ninteractions between components of the optimizer.  The prevalence of flutter\r\nwill be examined across this range of DBMSes, to see if that prevalence\r\n(measured as percentage of queries exhibiting flutter) is positively\r\ncorrelated to measures of optimizer complexity.\r\n\r\nIn terms of broader impacts, this research studies a previously unknown\r\nphenomenon of cost-based query optimizers, offering a scientific rationale\r\nfor new architectures for query optimization that explicitly take into\r\naccount uncertainty. In doing so, it introduces a new perspective (science),\r\nadding to the existing mathematical and engineering perspectives now used\r\nprominently in database research, helping to realize Herbert Simon's vision\r\nof \"sciences of the artificial.\" The results will be disseminated via the\r\nproject Web site http://www.cs.arizona.edu/soc/sodb.\r\n",
