 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal focuses on the development of an integrative system consisting of miniature wireless neuronal signal sensor and stimulator implants to provide accurate recording of neural activities and investigate the inhibitory effects of pain signals through neurostimulation. A neurostimulation implant delivers low electrical currents to the nervous tissues that affect the kinetics of ion transport across a neural membrane and produce electrical suppression of pain signals. However, the lack of an integrative recorder and stimulator system prevents us from physiologically documenting the pain activities in freely moving objects. This work involves integrating advances from four multidisciplinary areas of research: (1) flexible microelectromechanical system (MEMS) devices, (2) telemetry circuitry and wireless communication, (3) signal processing, (4) neuroscience and neurobiology.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits: Technological advances are the development of miniature implants on flexible substrates with wireless communication capability for an integrative system. Using the integrative sensor and stimulator system as an enabling tool, scientific investigation will be carried out to establish the knowledge of neuronal signals, propagation models, inhibitory mechanisms and their relationship to external stimuli, parameter databases for bioelectrical models and optimization algorithms in pain management.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The impacts of chronic pain relief will not only improve individuals life quality but also the family relationship and national economics. The database will benefit the basic understanding in neuroscience. The technologies developed will be useful for medical implants and data acquisition techniques in biology applications. This cooperative project between the Electrical Engineering and Psychology integrates the research efforts with education and outreach objectives. Graduate and undergraduate students will be working together in the same laboratories, and by hands-on experiences, they will be trained with integrated multidisciplinary knowledge. Three North Texas high-school education programs in disadvantaged communities are in place to provide high-school teachers and students involvement in the research works.\r\n\r\n",
