 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will work on problems in finite simple groups, lattices and vertex operator algebras (VOAs).  Work on VOAs is joint with Chongying Dong.  The main goal is to build moonshine-like VOAs for finite simple groups (as done for the monster in the mid 80s).  Lattice constructions and analyses support this goal  but recent  work on lattices has a life of its own due to new techniques and applications. \r\n(1) The PI plans to strengthen recent joint work on uniqueness for the important moonshine VOA by reducing hypotheses. \r\n(2)  The PI plans to give  new constructions of sporadic groups and VOAs which enshrine them. This will involve revisions of existing moonshine VOA theories and adaptions to particular sporadic groups, and other work with the more classic lattice type VOAs. \r\nThe result would be a new and uniform setting of most finite simple groups. \r\n(3) The PI's recent work on lattices has concentrated on spinoffs of the Barnes-Wall series.  The PI will continue this study.  The PI  will build new series of lattices with series of finite groups as automorphism groups.  Certain of these series and spinoffs will be used in part (2).  Some of these lattices have relatively high minimum norms (and could be extremal), so the PI  will try to settle those norms.  Automorphism groups of some of these lattices will be  determined.  Uniqueness theories will be developed. \r\n(4) The PI plans to do more work on automorphism groups of low rank VOAs and on the connections between nonassociative algebras and VOAs. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe PI hopes this proposal will help integrate sporadic groups into traditionally mainstream mathematics.  Sporadic simple groups are finite simple groups which are not naturally part of the infinite series (classical groups, alternating groups).   The program with lattices links certain infinite series of lattices involving classical groups over finite fields with those associated to sporadic groups.   The program with VOA theory will link finite groups, general algebraic groups and infinite dimensional Lie theory. Lattices, VOAs and simple groups are connected to many parts of mathematics and mathematical physics.\r\n\r\n",
