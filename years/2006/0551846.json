 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gordan Savin is continuing his work on algebraic aspects of analysis,\r\nwith applications in number theory. The main tools of this research are\r\nminimal representations (discovered\r\nby Kazhdan and Savin) which have been successful in dealing with certain\r\naspects of Langlands conjectures.\r\nIndeed, several instances of Langlands conjectures, out of\r\nreach of standard methods, can be obtained through\r\nuse of minimal representations.\r\n\r\nAnalysis, broadly defined, deals with\r\nfunctions satisfying certain differential equations. Analysis of\r\ndifferential equations, in general, is a very hard problem. For example,\r\ndifferential equations coming from the dynamics of fluids are notoriously\r\ndifficult. One possible reason for this is a lack of symmetries. On the\r\nother hand, if there are plenty of symmetries to work with, then\r\nthe corresponding analysis is easier, since algebraic tools can be used.\r\n\r\nThis research deals precisely with situations\r\nwhen a large group of symmetries is present. The main purpose\r\nof this research is to construct small representations of\r\ngroups of Lie type. Smallness, roughly speaking, refers to the fact that\r\nit is possible to combine together many symmetries acting on a\r\nrelatively small space.\r\nImportance of having small representations\r\ncan be illustrated  with the following example.\r\nOne of the most famous (and most notorious) groups is the Reisz-Fischer\r\nMonster. Yes, this group is huge and hence its name,\r\nbut the size is not the main difficulty\r\nhere. The main problem is the lack of small representations.\r\nIndeed, the group of permutations of 60 letters - nobody would consider\r\nthis group a ``monster'' - is in fact bigger then the Riesz-Fischer\r\nMonster. However, this group of permutations can be written down\r\n(i.e. represented) by means of\r\n60 by 60 matrices. The monster, on the other hand, requires use of\r\n(roughly) 2000 by 2000 matrices. It is our hope that the small\r\nrepresentations will be a fruitful tool that can be used to answer\r\nsome relevant questions in analysis and number theory.",
