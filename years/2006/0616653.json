 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Tennessee Space Institute proposes to host a national three-day workshop aimed at bringing together experts as well as government and industry leaders in technology and in science and engineering to share experiences, explore alternative approaches, and formulate a framework for planning and implementing advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) at the state and regional levels.  The objectives of the proposed workshop are (1) to develop a common understanding of CI, the components, and their relationships; (2) to identify the opportunities and benefits that creating advanced CI provides and issues that it raises; and (3) to develop strategies for planning and implementing CI within EPSCoR jurisdictions.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will consist of plenary and breakout sessions around key CI themes: (1) essential resources for shared use, (2) collaboration across boundaries, and (3) rapid incorporation of innovation.  The University of Tennessee Space Institute plans to host the workshop in Nashville, Tennessee on May 10-12, 2006.  The target audience will be users, infrastructure builders (e.g., from networking and computing/data centers), and research leaders who are helping to drive the development of CI in their states.  It is expected that up to 125 participants attend the workshop, including users and CI providers from each of the 27 EPSCoR jurisdictions, as well as invited experts to serve as speakers, panel members, and discussion facilitators.\r\n",
