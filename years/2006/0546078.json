 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project explores the use of the concept of students' science identities as a factor in evaluating the effectiveness of science pedagogies. The investigator aims to push evaluations of pedagogies beyond questions about what students know and can do to questions about how effective pedagogies are in producing students with long-term senses of themselves as science learners and participants. The objectives of the project are: 1) to determine what counts as meaningful scientific practice in standards-based classrooms at different grade levels through discourse analysis and surveys; 2) to chart the development of students' understanding of and attitudes toward science over time; 3) to identify specific teaching practices, at different grade levels, that those understandings and attitudes; and 4) to develop professional development materials designed to support teachers' efforts to foster those practices that improve student attitudes, practices, and understanding of science. This project will engage teachers, pre-service teachers, and graduate students in professional development experiences that dovetail with research objectives. \r\n",
