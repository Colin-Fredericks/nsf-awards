 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)  Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) describes part of the human thought process in which working memory is limited to a small number of items that can be used to solve a problem. Meanwhile, neural network analyses of student problem-solving pathways provide information about how students approach and work out a problem.  This project extends the use of CLT into chemistry and combines the use of CLT and neural network analyses in order to systematically explore factors that give rise to the challenges of introductory chemistry for novices in college. The goals are to (1) define qualitative and quantitative measures or factors of complexity in introductory chemistry problems, including the effect of background or preparation level; (2) assess the strategies used by students when they are confronted by the complexities, including the parsing of word problems and the textual and/or visual representation of data; (3) devise interventions to promote problem solving based on the findings from the first two goals and the literature; (4) provide and promote applications including examinations, test banks, and asynchronous testing; and (5) utilize the resources of the American Chemical Society Examinations Institute to disseminate questions and applications of the findings.  The intellectual merit of the project includes an understanding of how a basic theory of learning and cognition applies to student problem solving: (1) how the fundamental issues and effects relate to the discipline of chemistry, a new validation and application in another discipline, and (2) practical outcomes in the form of explicit rules and guidelines for the preparation of assessment materials. Additional merit comes from the acquisition of knowledge about the process by which students approach and complete problems that challenge them on the basis of cognitive load. The broader impacts of the project activities include additions to the knowledge base that provides for better student testing and evaluation, increased faculty expertise on assessment, and the promotion of teaching and learning. A team of four researchers combine their expertise in related areas and the resources of their institutions to accomplish the project's goals. The differences among the types of institutions and other partner schools assure a varied and broad set of data and outcomes.",
