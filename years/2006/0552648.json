 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site Program at the University of Nebraska is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. The Redox Biology Center offers qualified undergraduates an opportunity to pursue independent research projects in redox biology. Redox biology includes oxidation-reduction linked biological reactions, redox signaling and regulation, and cellular defense mechanisms that minimize oxidative damage/stress. The 10-week summer program, located at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, will enable students to explore fundamental redox processes related to biotechnology and the environment. The goal of this training program is to involve 10 undergraduate students in broad-based research and significantly impact their career decisions. REU participants will conduct individual research projects under the guidance of a faculty sponsor in the Redox Biology Center. The faculty sponsors offer a breadth of multidisciplinary approaches and share a common goal of understanding critical redox-active processes. Students will receive experimental training in a variety of areas including molecular biology, microbiology, biochemistry, biophysical chemistry, and protein crystallography and will utilize state-of-the-art equipment and facilities. In addition, students will attend journal club meetings, career development seminars, lunch discussion groups, and social activities. The program will conclude with students presenting their research findings at a poster session. Participant selection will be based on academic achievements, research interests, and career goals. Recruitment for this training site includes focused efforts to attract students at smaller institutions with limited research opportunities and students from underrepresented groups. REU participants receive a 10-week stipend, full room and board, and travel assistance. More information about this REU training site and the program application can be found at http://www.unl.edu/RedoxBiologyCenter or by contacting Dr. Donald Becker at dbecker3@unl.edu or 402-472-9652. \r\n\r\n",
