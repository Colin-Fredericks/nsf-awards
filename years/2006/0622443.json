 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within a new engineering degree approved in 2005, this project is building on the college's successful record of serving the needs of disadvantaged students. It is ensuring that all engineering students who transfer succeed at the four-year institution's engineering program and continue on to successful careers in research and industry. With the overarching goal of increasing the number of STEM students who earn credits toward transfer, graduate with an associate degree, and/or transfer to a four-year institution, the program is increasing the enrollment of entering engineering students by 10% each year and ensuring that 50% of students who enter the engineering degree program transfer to a four-year institution within the grant period. During the grant period, the project intends for at least 54 students to receive an A.S. in Engineering, 38 of whom transfer to a four-year institution; 54 to transfer before graduation; and 139 to be in the pipeline and earning credits toward a degree or transfer.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project is raising the visibility of the new engineering degree through established community events that are heavily promoted in the media, supported by area industries, and well-attended by high school students, parents, and industry representatives. The college is recruiting high achieving high school students through a coordinated series of events each spring and students who have been denied admission to four-year engineering programs. The college is also initiating a new pre-engineering curriculum for students arriving unprepared for the rigorous engineering program. This curriculum is being designed to reduce the number of semesters students spend in developmental education courses by instituting a Summer Academy to accelerate students' skills acquisition, so they are prepared for the engineering degree program in the fall. A dedicated STEM Student Liaison shepherds engineering students through the degree program, implements and maintains a new E-mentoring initiative, and connects students to industry. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: A comprehensive evaluation is being conducted, and results are being broadly disseminated. Students are participating in optional faculty-guided discovery projects that allow community college students to experience the excitement of investigation and to learn research methods. The college is negotiating new articulation or guaranteed admission agreements with several four-year institutions, continually refining current agreements, and continuing to update syllabi to maximize the number of credits that transfer.\r\n\r\n",
