 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this proposal is to investigate a series of fundamental\r\nproblems in constructive function theory which constitute  common ground\r\nof the analysis and applied mathematics. Our approach borrows ideas and\r\ntechniques from many fields of theoretical mathematics, such as real and\r\ncomplex analysis, topology, and Fourier analysis. Recently, Carleson,\r\nTotik, and the PI in a series of papers have found a new approach  to\r\nconnect  the continuous properties of the Green function and the metric\r\nproperties of the boundary of a domain where the Green function  is\r\ndefined. We believe that this approach can give a decisive impulse to\r\ninvestigation of a number of long-standing open problems in constructive\r\nfunctio theory. A major  component of this proposal is to study a new\r\nrepresentation of basic notions of potential theory (logarithmic capacity, the Green function, and\r\nequilibrium measure) in terms of a conformal mapping of the exterior of\r\nthe unit interval onto the exterior of the unit disk with finite or\r\ninfinite number of radial slits, presented in the recent work of the PI.\r\nWe analyze the geometry of Cantor-type sets and propose to find a new\r\nproof to and significant extension of the results by Totik and Carleson on\r\nsets possessing the Hoelder continuous Green function. The second part of\r\nour proposal concerns Markov- and Remez-type inequalities for polynomials\r\non subsets of the real line. We propose  to construct a general\r\n$2$-dimensional theory of Remez-type inequalities and illustrate their\r\npower by giving a number of applications. The last  part is  devoted to  study of well-known\r\nopen problems in polynomial approximation in the complex plane which have\r\na large number of applications in both pure and applied mathematics. We\r\nhope to find a complete solution of the Meinardus-Varga problem on\r\nstructure of an entire function with the geometric convergence on the\r\npositive real axis of reciprocals of polynomials to the reciprocal of the\r\nfunction. We intend to employ a new concept of Faber-type polynomials. Our\r\nprior reseach indicates that there exists a connection  between th\r\nNikolskii-Timan-Dzjadyk approximation theorem and the concept of uniformly\r\nperfect sets introduced by Beardon and Pommerenke. We propose to\r\ninvestigate the details of this connection.\r\n\r\n The major component of the broader impact of our proposal is to create a\r\nnew link between potential theory, geometric function theory and\r\nconstructive function theory. Another  component  concerns  the training\r\nof graduate and undergraduate students. Indeed, the problems addressed in\r\nthis proposal are stated in such a way that not only are they clear to the\r\ngraduate students but they are accessible to undergraduates as well. On\r\nthe other hand, the answers to many of those problems are quite\r\ncounterintuitive. This stimulates the interest of students to the subject\r\nand mathematics in general.\r\n\r\n",
