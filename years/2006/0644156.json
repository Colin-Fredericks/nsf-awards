For this project, the focus is on the Jakobshavn Ice Fjord because of both the rapid change it is undergoing and because of the logistical advantage of having a town located nearby.  The PI proposes to explore the use of two emerging technologies that may provide a capability for performing long-term observations in key fjords of Greenland and analogous locations in Antarctica.   First, he proposes to use an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) equipped with CTD (for hydrography) and side-scan sonar (for bathymetry) to evaluate its usefulness in terms of accuracy and its ability to make measurements in demanding physical environments.  Secondly, the appearance of airborne expendable CTD and current profilers offers the potential to gain basic hydrographic and bathymetric information by radio transmission between a helicopter and launched probes.  Each of these technologies will be utilized in a week-long field exercise.  There will be some data overlap for the purpose of cross-comparing the data quality and coverage of each technology.\r\n",
