 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ACM Sigact Committee on Funding for Theoretical Computer Science proposes to develop  a plan for a cross-cutting NSF initiative on theory of networked computation. This initiative would cover such topics as: the complexity theory of networked computation; security, privacy, usability and reliability; massive data sets; incentives;and network computation in the sciences. The initiative must be designed to attract the best researchers from both the theoretical computer science community and all the various software and systems disciplines that bear on networked computation. In preparing the proposal it is essential that we gain the advice and concurrence of the leading researchers in all these fields, as well as the representatives of these fields within CISE. For this purpose we wish to hold two two-day planning workshops, with thirty participants in each. About a third of the participants will be invited speakers, a third will be invited discussants, and a third will be selected from applicants in the computer science community. The Program Committee for the workshops will be drawn from our Sigact committee and will consist of Joan Feigenbaum (chair), Richard Karp and Christos Papadimitriou.",
