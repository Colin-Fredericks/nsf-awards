 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a continuation of the Environmental Science theme of a previous REU at the University of Idaho, with but  focus on water resources topics. The term \"water resources\" means: the study  of how water moves through and interacts with natural systems, and the physical, social, and economic  aspects of human and ecosystem interaction with the water cycle.  The overall goal is to involve 10 undergraduates each summer for  three years, with at least 70% from underrepresented groups (women and ethnic minorities), in a  nine-week summer research experience that inspires them to proceed into graduate study and to  enter water resources careers. To achieve this, the Site will provide undergraduates with water  resources research experiences that    develop students' skills in scientific methods, and equipment and instrumentation use;    lead students to greater independence in pursuing their research interests;    assist qualified students with under-realized potential in cultivating their capabilities;    offer students professional development and teamwork training through shared activities.  The project team includes several NSF-sponsored researchers who solve complex  problems of current significance in well-instrumented experimental watersheds using leading-edge tools  and techniques. Participants in this REU Site program gain first-hand insights into scientific procedures  while earning a competitive edge in entering and successfully completing graduate programs and  successful careers in water resources. They will achieve this by selecting and participating in research  projects under the direction of faculty competitively funded by NSF, USDA, USGS, and NOAA.  REU students participate as  team members in their mentor's research group. Students also develop collegial relationships as an REU  group by participating together in scholarly and recreational activities, such as weekly REU research  forums and lunches with professional and academic role models, an \"ethics-in-science\" workshop, and  weekend field trips led by faculty mentors. The students will rotate into other labs for a minimum of one day each to interact academically with  their peers. The plan is to have at least 70% from underrepresented groups (women and ethnic minorities), with 50% from ethnic  minorities (up from an overall average of 25% for the existing REU Site); at least 80% of the students in each year's cohort from non-PhD-granting institutions (up from the  70% overall average for the existing REU Site); at least 50% of each year's participants co-author publications and/or present their research at  national conferences.",
