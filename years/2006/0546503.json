 "awd_abstract_narration": "Yanhai Yin \r\n0546503\r\nCAREER:  Novel Signaling Components For Plant Steroid Regulated Gene Expression \r\nIn Arabidopsis \r\n\r\nPlant steroid hormones called brassinosteroids (BRs) control many diverse processes such as cell growth, senescence and stress responses. Application of BRs has been shown to increase crop yield and improve plant resistance to drought, high temperature and various diseases. Although significant progress has been made in identifying BR receptors and several other signaling components, little is known about how plant steroids regulate gene expression, thereby controlling different biological responses. Modern genetic and genomic approaches will be used to address this question. A BR-regulated transcription factor BES1 mediates many of the hormone responses and provides a powerful tool to study BR-regulated gene expression. To reveal the gene regulatory circuits, the functions of several BES1-induced transcription factors will be determined by over-expression and knock-out technologies. To identify other signaling components involved in BR-regulated gene expression, mutant plants with altered responses to plant steroids will be isolated, the underlying genes will be identified and characterized. The results from these studies will reveal the complex network through which BRs control growth and responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses. Broader impacts: Since BRs control many different biological processes, it is highly desirable to be able to manipulate individual responses. For example, it would be beneficial to promote BR-induced growth and stress responses and to reduce BR-induced senescence. The acquired knowledge from the proposed research can be used to achieve these goals. Several BR mutants will be introduced into an undergraduate Plant Physiology laboratory course to illustrate how steroids control plant growth. In addition, students from underrepresented groups will be recruited to work on the project through the Program for Woman in Science and Engineering (PWSE) at Iowa State University. The integrated research and teaching program will therefore provide ample training opportunities for high school, college, graduate and postgraduate students.  \r\n",
