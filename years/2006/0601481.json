The approach is to use emerging promising materials like ZnO having important surface and piezoelectric properties, study and improve the properties of the bio-ZnO interface, and the nanostructured ZnO-SiO2 system, and develop high quality epitaxially grown thin ZnO films on the technologically important dissimilar substrate of SiO2 and Si, as well as innovative surface acoustic wave based sensing technology, and ZnO nanostructured CMOS based pressure sensors.     \r\nIntellectual merit: The development of such advanced sensor technology will impact socio-economic areas crucial to the country. The area of health care by improving detection of pathogens and monitoring of illnesses at substantially reduced time and cost, the area of environmental monitoring of hazardous biomaterials in vivo and in the field by early warning detection for effective conflict resolution, protecting population and soldiers, the area of prosthetic limp and permanent nerve damage patients, by developing touch pressure sensor arrays for artificial skin in prosthetic limp patients, and provide the sense of pain to paraplegic patients. \r\nBroader Impact: This technology has a broad economic impact on two fronts. First by saving money and time on bio-analysis, and second on creating a new high tech industry for integrated sensor technologies providing a substantial number of jobs for college graduates. These engineering and science graduates will be highly skilled as they benefit from the educational development resulting from the fundamental knowledge of the interfacing of biomaterials with inorganic semiconductors, and the parameters involved in developing such integrated sensor technology. They will represent an important asset contributing to maintain the high technology leadership of the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
