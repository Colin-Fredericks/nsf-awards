 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to support writing papers for analysis of the data files from the Third (or Trends) International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).  The themes for the book include curriculum instruction, and school systems.  The book would focus on the learning of mathematics, with a specific focus on Algebra.  The papers would be presented at an international conference at Brookings Institution in 2006.  The International Association for Evaluation in Educational Achievement (IEA) would invite its members to attend a conference to present papers on the analysis of TIMSS.  The Brookings institution proposes to use this opportunity while hosting the meeting itself to write a book that conducts secondary analysis of the data sets for the studies that have been conducted in 1995, 1999, and 2003.  The proposal contains an outline of the papers that would appear in the final volume.  It would address topics related to student achievement such as student ability tracking, technology and instruction, curricular breadth, school size, teacher preparation, and effects of instructional reform.",
