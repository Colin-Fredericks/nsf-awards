 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes the development of advanced high-resolution ceramic micro-channel plates (MCPs). MCPs are used in many types of astrophysics photon detectors, as well as in scientific instrumentation, medical imaging and in low- and night vision devices. Requirements of many current and future astronomical spectroscopy and imaging instruments cannot be supported by conventional glass-fiber MCP technology that has reached its fundamental limits in spatial and temporal resolution, fixed pattern noise, high count rate capabilities, thermal performance, yield and reproducibility, stability and lifetime. Alternative technologies are needed to overcome these limitations. The company proposes an innovative approach to fabricate sub-microchannel plates (s-MCPs) from nanostructured ceramic with previously unachievable morphology, enabling channel diameter below 1 micrometer and open area ratio approaching 90%. \r\n\r\nThe expected result of the proposed work is a manufacturing technology for production of commercially viable sub-micro-channel plate intensifiers with better performance, longer lifetime and lower cost. This could open up new opportunities for a quantum leap in the development of the next generation particle and photon detection systems for the infrared, UV, x-ray and gamma ray astrophysics applications. \r\n",
