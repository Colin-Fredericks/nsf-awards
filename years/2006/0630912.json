 "awd_abstract_narration": "The energetics of geomagnetic storms and magnetospheric substorms continue to be controversial problems in the space community. Multi-point investigations of the physical processes responsible for these phenomena are especially timely due to the increasing availability of multi-point measurements from ground-based stations and distributed satellites within the magnetosphere. Understanding of these phenomena would answer fundamental questions on impulsive particle acceleration in space plasmas. Since magnetospheric substorms occur in other planetary bodies and may be akin to solar flares, understanding substorm process will also provide valuable insights into energetic processes occurring throughout our solar system and would assist space weather forecasting. This project is based on an extensive database from remote-sensing and in situ measurements of these phenomena in the magnetosphere. The project will examine: (1) the association between dipolarization and plasma flow, (2) the propagation of the pressure reduction front during substorms to differentiate whether the pressure reduction is associated with plasma bubble or a rarefaction wave, (3) the plasma flow reversals during substorms to determine whether or not the flows are indicative of f a single plasma source (magnetic reconnection site) or varying contributions from multiple activity sites, and (4) the transport characteristics of magnetic reconnection activity using a multi-component approach. The PI will continue to undertake outreach activity in mentoring high school teachers and students during the period of the program.",
