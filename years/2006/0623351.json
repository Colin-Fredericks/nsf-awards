The research focus is in the leading edge areas of acoustics and non-destructive evaluation.  This project will enable collaboration between Auburn and the IIT Madras where Auburn students will travel to India, team with local Indian students, and work in local industry research laboratories to solve engineering problems in acoustics and non-destructive testing.  They will return to the US and their experiences will be collected as case studies for other students.  The PIs have extensive experience in both international collaboration and case-study engineering education.  The Indian mentors are highly experienced in modeling industrial problems in their laboratories and have well developed linkages with the local industries.  This collaboration builds on the strengths of all involved in this project. \r\n\r\nIn addition to strengthening their research skills, students participating in this project will benefit by broadening their contacts and developing deeper insights into global R&D issues.  Collectively, these have the potential to positively impact international collaborative activities in the future.  Students not directly participating will gain from the experiences of their peers through case studies, which will be available for use in graduate and undergraduate classrooms at Auburn and potentially at other universities as plans develop for their inclusion in engineering curriculum.  \r\n",
