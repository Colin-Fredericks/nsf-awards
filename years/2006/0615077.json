 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal concerns the seventh annual Gordon Research Conference on The Cell Biology of the Neuron, to be held June 18-23rd, 2006. Funds are requested to support the participation of twelve neuroscientists/cell biologist, at this meeting, with priority given to applicants in underrepresented sectors of the scientific community. The conference program aims to illuminate mechanisms in neuronal function through its focus on recent insights derived from cell biological approaches, especially live cell imaging and recording techniques. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: Neurons share fundamental features with many cell types, but they are increasingly recognized for their array of specialized molecular mechanisms. The nervous system must adapt to the special needs of signal processing and information storage and find adequate solutions to balance the triad of processing speed, plasticity and stability. Recent developments in molecular biology and advances in novel optical techniques provide fascinating insights into how nature deals with these unique challenges. In this program, dynamic processes are highlighted in sessions on cell migration, axonal patterning, synapse assembly, membrane trafficking and receptor dynamics. The balance between change and stability of neuronal function is reflected in sessions on synapse formation, stability, scaling and plasticity as well as signaling mechanisms regulating network activity and behavior. The program features both simple and complex nervous systems, and includes contributions from non-neuronal systems that provide special insights into general mechanisms. \r\n\r\nOrganization and resources: The 2006 conference co-chairs are Dr. Craig C. Garner, Stanford University, an expert in synapse structure and assembly and Dr. Yukiko Goda, University College London, an expert in synaptic transmission and plasticity. The chairs were elected by attendees of the 2002 conference; both have prior experience in organizing scientific meetings. The conference site is the Colby-Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire, which has full conference facilities, including a fully equipped conference room, a nearby lobby that accommodates display boards for posters, on site housing an dining facilities. Ample free time is scheduled to facilitate informal exchange among attendees. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: This conference will broadly impact neuronal cell biology in three ways. First, it occupies a unique position among conferences in that it brings together cell biologists and neurobiologists within a single setting. There are several meetings that individually cover topics we plan to present, but few that merge such themes and attempt to identify unifying concepts. Second the informal nature of the conference will, as it has in the past, foster interactions among scientific colleagues that do not usually get a chance to exchange ideas. This often leads to the development of novel investigations, partnerships and collaborations. Third, because of the success in recruiting a diverse array of scientists to speak (including women and junior faculty), and because the organizers will strive to achieve diversity in the conference participants, this meeting will enhance the future representation of women, minorities, and undergraduate educators in the scientific enterprise. \r\n\r\n \r\n",
