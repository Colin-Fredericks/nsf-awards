The goal of the program is to increase the number of Native American students who earn degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics at OSU. The program is based on the proven faculty mentoring and peer-mentoring strengths of the Native Americans in Marine and Space Sciences (NAMSS) program which had a 15 year history of supporting Native American students. The students who participated in the NAMSS program had a 95% graduation rate and 55% of the students continued their education with graduate programs. This program will provide internships (in the form of hourly wages) for 10 students to conduct independent research projects under the mentorship of OSU faculty and other Native American students as they work toward degrees in science and engineering.  It strongly supports NSF efforts to increase diversity in the sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
