 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is design and development of a micro-nano\r\nIntegrated SMART water health monitoring and decontamination system-on-a-package\r\n(SOP). This objective will be met through the following specific goals of\r\nthis proposal: (a) to understand and address the challenges in measurement of\r\nflood water parameters, in particular Coliforms, continuously and rapidly\r\nthroughout large volumes and over large time spans, using micro-sensor system\r\nintegrated with wireless communication system; (b) another key objective is to\r\nembed specially engineered decontaminating surface activated nanoparticles\r\nreservoir coupled in a feedback-loop with the micro-sensor to release the\r\nparticles once a high Coliform count is detected in the contaminated flood\r\nregions in the instances such as after Hurricane Katrina.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit of the project will have far reaching implications in the areas of\r\n(1) fundamental science required to enable the development of integrated\r\nsensing systems that would be capable of rapid response monitoring of the flood\r\nwater affected area, (2) design considerations of such fusion of nano-micro\r\ndevices and materials and their survivability in the harsh environment, and (3)\r\ntesting of nanoparticles with sample contaminant, representative of what was\r\nobserved in the Katrina aftermath.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact of the project would facilitate the fundamental understanding\r\nand optimization of the science and technology of continuous water quality\r\nmonitoring as well as active environment specific remediation in case of\r\ncatastrophic events.\r\n",
