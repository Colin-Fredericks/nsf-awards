 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, testing and measuring for the fabrication of a microgripper development facility, contributes in the fabrication by resolving some difficulties encountered which involve\r\n\r\n-Cutting the Ionic Polymer Metal Composite (IPMC) as small as desired using the current mechanical methods; therefore, a laser cutting system,\r\n-Characterizing the performance of IPMC; hence, system identification techniques that measure true characteristics; measuring the response to develop a pole/zero model for the plant (microgripper actuator) and feedback (microgripper position sensor), and\r\n-Using load cells for accurate performance measurements. \r\n\r\nThe project examines the mechanical and electrical characteristics of the micro-sized IPMC; thus, the microgripper laboratory contributes to nano/micro manipulation. Although these characteristics have been studied in macro-scale, its micro-scale application has not yet been fully investigated. The infrastructure allows the development of the state-of-the-art microgripper system based on a new material patented at UNM and services projects involving blood cell property measurements, carbon nanotubes, fluid and flow visualization.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The facility serves as a recruitment tool for graduate school in pertinent areas in this minority serving institution. These students in turn motivate underrepresented students to follow a science/engineering career. Hence, the equipment creates an obvious link to engineering and may influence students to pursue careers in the field.\r\n",
