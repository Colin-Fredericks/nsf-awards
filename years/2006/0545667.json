 "awd_abstract_narration": "For almost all the applications of wireless networks, the central optimization goal is to maximize network lifetime. Since each node in wireless networks is battery powered, energy conservation at each node is the primary concern that will greatly affect network lifetime. For the optimization goal of maximizing network lifetime in wireless networks, this project will integrate research and education to investigate some novel approaches for the coverage problems and the dominating set problems in wireless networks. Furthermore, the relationships between the solutions to the coverage problems and the solutions to the dominating set problems will be studied. The research work will focus on: designing new distributed and localized approximations for the coverage problems, developing new methods of constructing stable backbones in mobile or static wireless networks with the consideration of maintenance, integrating the proposed approaches for the coverage problems and the dominating set problems into coherent schemes so that new models can be derived to solve both the coverage problems and the dominating set problems. The research will be conducted from both theoretical and simulation aspects. The research component of this project will have a strong impact on both theoretical and practical aspects of optimization theory as well as wireless networks. It will accelerate the realization of the optimization goal in wireless networks. The education component of this project is a starting point to integrate research and education for the purpose of attracting both undergraduate and graduate students to the areas of optimization theory and wireless networks. The approaches proposed in this project and the findings as a result will be used as additional teaching materials to excite the students and to attract more potential students to conduct research in these areas.",
