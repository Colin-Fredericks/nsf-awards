 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support a 3-year sequence of regional mini-conferences \r\nin Discrete Mathematics. The goals of the conferences are to encourage and \r\nstimulate research efforts of regional PhD students in mathematics and computer \r\nscience, and to foster collaborative efforts among senior researchers and students.  \r\nA tentative list of topics, and plenary speakers, is: First year Topic: \r\nRamsey Theory and Extremal Graph Theory Speaker: Maria Axenovich (Iowa State \r\nUniversity) Second year Topic: Designs, Codes and Applications Speakers: \r\nVera Pless (University of Illinois-Chicago) Qing Xiang (University of Delaware) \r\nThird year Topic: Combinatorial Matrix Theory Speakers: Richard Brualdi \r\n(University of Wisconsin-Madison) Pauline van den Driessche (University of Victoria)\r\n\r\nGraduate student involvement will be a high priority. Graduate students will be \r\nencouraged to present their research, and the schedule will be designed with \r\nbreak-outs and problem sessions so that faculty can offer suggestions and \r\ndirection to the students. Priority for travel funds will go to minority \r\napplicants and graduate students.  The proposed activity will (a) provide \r\nan encouraging environment for young researchers and graduate students, \r\n(b)inform researchers of some of the latest developments in discrete \r\nmathematics, and (c) strengthen collaborative, and interdisciplinary\r\nresearch ties among discrete mathematicians in the Rocky Mountain region.",
