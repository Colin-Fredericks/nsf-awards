Modern\r\nsoftware has characteristics that cannot be handled by traditional\r\napproaches: it typically uses multiple distributed components, and it\r\noften employs dynamic mechanisms that are hard to analyze statically.\r\nExisting analyses fail in the presence of such features, making it\r\nhard to provide sophisticated tool support for real-world software\r\nsystems. In turn, this reduces programmer productivity and leads to\r\nlower software quality. This project focuses on three challenges posed\r\nby modern software: reusable components, such as standard libraries;\r\ndistributed software; and run-time adaptation through dynamic class\r\nloading and reflection. This effort is a significant step towards\r\nbuilding powerful software tools that are truly usable and useful in\r\nthe software industry.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical foundations of dataflow analysis are generalized to\r\nachieve precision and scalability in the presence of reusable\r\ncomponents. Widely used analyses (e.g., points-to analysis, MOD/REF\r\nanalysis, constant propagation, and object naming) are adapted to\r\ndistributed component-based systems. The analyses are systematically\r\ngeneralized to handle dynamic language features. Dissemination is\r\nachieved through open-source analysis implementations and two program\r\nunderstanding tools. The broader impacts of the project include (1)\r\nresearch infrastructure which provides scalable off-the-shelf\r\nimplementations of several fundamental static analyses, (2) tools that\r\nsupply high-quality support for program understanding, which will\r\nimprove productivity and software quality, and (3) integration of the\r\nresearch with education, which will increase the students' proficiency\r\nin current methods and tools for software development, and will\r\naccelerate their career progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
