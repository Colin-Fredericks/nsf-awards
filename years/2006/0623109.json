The proposed research builds on theories of self-evaluations to explain the legitimation of inequality. Previous research in this area has yet to create situations where disadvantaged actors view their lower levels of resources as fair and legitimate. This project will provide a clearer understanding of the social psychological mechanisms through which existing stratification systems come to be accepted as right by those subject to them. The proposed research consists of two experiments. In both, university undergraduates will be recruited to negotiate over valued resources in stratified structures. The first experiment examines the effect of (high vs. low power) structural positions on self-evaluations. It addresses whether actors develop self-evaluations consistent with their structural power (and consequent level of rewards). The second experiment addresses the relationship between self-evaluations and legitimated structural inequality. For this study, participants will be placed in positions either consistent or inconsistent with their self-evaluations. When self-evaluations and structural positions are congruent, all actors are expected to view their level of resources as fair and the overall structure as legitimate.\r\n The broader impacts of this project are that it holds promise for providing a better understanding of the conditions under which those disadvantaged by stratified systems view their position as appropriate. The research should yield similar insights into inequality in groups and organizations.\r\n",
