 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kinematics and Mechanisms of Sonation in Birds\r\n\r\nThis project will explore how body shape and behavior co-evolve in  \r\nanimals, by examining how birds produce special communicative wing- \r\nsounds, or sonations.  One group of birds from the tropics, the  \r\nPipridae, produces particularly extreme and diverse sonations.   \r\nNearly a dozen species of piprids will be examined to better  \r\nunderstand how their wings produce sound. High-speed video will be  \r\nused to determine the limb motions used during sound production.  \r\nExperimental manipulation of specialized feathers will be used to  \r\ndetermine how the feather \"instruments\" are employed to produce a  \r\nunique sustained, harmonically-toned sound. Digitally-aided  \r\ndissections and CT scans of museum specimens will be used to model  \r\nhow changes in the shapes and sizes of wing bones and muscles have  \r\ninfluenced how the wing functions.  Because the relationships among  \r\nthe examined species are known, and because appropriate variation  \r\nexists among these species, this information will be useful in  \r\ndetermining the sequence of events that lead to the evolution of this  \r\nspecialized system of communication.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merits of this research come from generating new  \r\ndata on a poorly studied phenomenon, generating state-of-the-art  \r\nkinematic data from field subjects, lending insight to avian wing  \r\nfunction, generating functional hypotheses testable by  \r\nmacroevolutionary tests, and addressing Tinbergen's \"origin and  \r\ntransformation\" question by examining the interplay between the  \r\nevolution of behavior and morphology.\r\n\r\n             The impacts of this research will be made through  \r\ntraining students, introducing Latin American communities to the  \r\nprinciples behind this research, and the production of a high-quality  \r\nvideo documentary for distribution to museums nationwide.\r\n",
