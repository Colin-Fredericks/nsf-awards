The preliminary list of invitees/participants includes researchers from the US and Europe who are at the scientific forefront in the area of mechanics and materials. Under the theme \"Current Challenges in Mechanics of Materials,\" the four-day symposium will involve four major topics, one for each day. These topics are (a)Mechanics of Biological Materials, (b) Experimental Methods in M&M, (c) Theory and Simulation in M&M, and (d) Perspectives regarding the Future of M&M Research and Education.\r\n\r\nThe proposed symposium provides an excellent environment for the exchange of ideas and open discussions that allow for the presentation of the researchers' latest work, augmenting efforts to advance the research frontiers in this field. The meeting will serve as an opportunity to showcase the research performed at the University of Wyoming and UC Boulder. It will also provide the environment for valuable interactions between the UW and UC Boulder students with some of the best minds in the field. The organizers will archive the presentations in a form that can be easily disseminated to the community at large. With the permission of the speakers, the presentations will be available at the web site of the Mechanical Engineering departments at UW and UC Boulder, as well as the web site of the Elasticity Technical Committee of the Applied Mechanics Division of ASME.\r\n\r\n",
