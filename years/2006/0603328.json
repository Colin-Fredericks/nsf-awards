The curriculum is being based on specific training needs of regional power plants.  It is being designed for use in training both new and incumbent workers and includes modularized, on-line and hybrid course options.  Bismarck State, a national leader in power plant technology programs, is providing consulting services with respect to equipment needs, curriculum, personnel, and delivery methods.  This project is adapting the model curriculum to fit their educational needs, leading the way for national dissemination of the model.\r\n\r\nFormative assessment is focusing on curriculum and educational materials development providing timely feedback for product and process improvement.  Summative assessment is focusing on quantitative measures that address the amount and quality of student learning.  The project results are being disseminated via a website as well as through regional and national conferences.",
