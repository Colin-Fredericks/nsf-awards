 "awd_abstract_narration": "National Wildlife Federation is requesting a planning grant to support the development of a six-part television mini-series called \"Springwatch USA\" and related educational materials.  \"Springwatch\" will focus on phenology and engage viewers to report their findings of specific natural phenomena, via the web.  The goal is to educate children, families and self-appointed citizen naturalists of all ages on the core science concepts associated with phenology and ecology and the hallmark animal and plant responses to the seasonal transition from winter to spring.  A second goal is to familiarize the American public with broader, cutting-edge concepts of how longer term changes in climate may also be significantly shifting some of the accepted norms for the progression of spring in North America.  The proposed planning phase will include:  audience research, meetings of science and education advisors, development of episode plans, conceptual design of field identification and educational materials as well as the protocols that will serve to standardize the data and make it useful for scientific, education and interpretive purposes.  National Wildlife Federation will be collaborating with Animal Planet and Painless Productions to create the \"Springwatch\" series",
