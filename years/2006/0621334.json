 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Partnership in Securing Cyberspace Through Education and Service (PISCES 2010) scholarship program provides opportunities for students with diverse backgrounds to become computer security and information assurance (CSIA) professionals. PISCES is based at The George Washington University (GW).\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: GW has over 25 courses in the area of CSIA. Using traditional computing lab resources along with newly-developed resources such the portable educational network (the Internet in a box) developed at GW, students are exposed to hands-on demonstrations and experience on the cutting edge of CSIA education and to lectures by world experts in technological and policy aspects of CSIA. In addition to their existing track record of producing graduates with knowledge of CSIA issues and mechanisms, technical expertise to design and build secure information systems, and a global societal and ethical context within which to apply their technical expertise, GW plan to add another objective: establishing a peer and near-peer mentoring network among prospective SFS students, current SFS students and SFS students who have already completed the program and gone on to work for the federal government. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Students supported through this scholarship program help to improve the quality of the federal technical and management cadre being built and provide experiential and networking opportunities to leverage personal and professional relationships. In addition, through partnerships among GW, Marymount University, and the University of Hawaii, PISCES 2010 actively recruits and supports students from low-income families and other traditionally under-represented groups in CSIA.\r\n",
