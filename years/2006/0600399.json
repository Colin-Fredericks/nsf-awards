 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to investigate the effectiveness of a multilevel participatory\r\naction model to produce institutional transformation resulting in the full participation of\r\nwomen faculty in science, technology, engineering and math fields in the university. This\r\nmodel focuses on transforming departmental cultures (views, attitudes, norms and shared\r\nbeliefs), practices (what people say and do), and structures (physical and social\r\narrangements) as well as university policies through active participation of individuals at\r\nall levels of the university.\r\nFaculty in nine focal departments, chosen from the College of Engineering, the College\r\nof Liberal Arts and Sciences and the College of Agriculture, will form the core\r\ndepartment-level working groups. A three-step process for departmental transformation\r\nwill include focus group and needs assessment meetings, training sessions tailored to\r\nmeet the unique needs of individual departments, and collaborative problem solving\r\nsessions involving department faculty and ADVANCE program leaders. Developing and\r\nimplementing best practices for fostering cultures, practices and structures of inclusion\r\nwill be the goal at the department level. Department chairs and ADVANCE professors\r\nwill be key change agents. At the same time, the university-wide focus will be on\r\nidentification of subtle and overt impediments to equity and on policies that will help\r\ndissolve these barriers. The Provost, Associate Provost, Deans, College Equity Advisors,\r\nCollege Diversity Committees, Department Chairs, and ADVANCE professors will\r\ndevelop and transform policies to increase the transparency of decision making,\r\ninstitutionalize flexible career options, strengthen and expand mentoring efforts, increase\r\nawareness of administration, faculty and staff regarding issues for women in STEM fields\r\nand expand strategies specifically for advancement of women of color. Retreats and\r\nnetworking meetings will facilitate interactions within the university, building a\r\ncommunity of women STEM faculty which will reduce isolation. A national conference,\r\nhosted at Iowa State University, will bring leading experts to campus to share strategies\r\nfor change and provide a forum for dissemination of best practices, particularly in the\r\narea of flexible faculty careers.\r\nThe Iowa State University ADVANCE Leadership Team has worked together for three\r\nyears on institutional issues related to the advancement of women faculty in STEM. Led\r\nby the Associate Provost, the ADVANCE Leadership Team has hosted visits by national\r\nexperts on diversity, developed and revised key policies, and developed a network of\r\nfaculty and administrators who have participated in ISU STEM retreats for women.\r\nPartnerships with existing ADVANCE Institutional Transformation grantees will\r\ncontinue to be a key component of this on-going effort. The multidisciplinary\r\nADVANCE Leadership Team will be centrally involved in coordinating this project with\r\nindividual members serving in key roles as change agents throughout the university.\r\nData from focal departments, colleges and the university will be gathered and used to\r\nevaluate the effectiveness of this approach in institutional transformation. Successful\r\nstrategies and actions will be generalized to be implemented in other departments and at\r\nother universities. The results of this research, regarding the effectiveness of the\r\nparticipatory action model as a driver for institutional change, will be shared with other\r\nADVANCE institutions and presented nationally in journals and at conferences.",
