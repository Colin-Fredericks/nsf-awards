These phenomena are characteristic of current\r\nwireless systems driven by data-intensive applications such as\r\nmultimedia, WWW, and real-time interactions.  The heavy traffic\r\napproach is a powerful way to analyze queuing systems at near\r\ncapacity, yielding complex, yet tractable limit models that\r\nretain the essential features of the actual queuing system.  But\r\nmost of the existing literature on heavy traffic analysis,\r\nincluding wireless systems, is based on short-range dependent\r\n(Markovian-like) models and light tails.  In the case of heavy\r\ntails only, the focus is on extending the perturbed test function\r\nmethod, based on the martingale problem, for showing weak\r\nconvergence to a queuing model expected to be driven by stable\r\nLevy motion.  When long-range dependence characteristics are also\r\npresent, the focus is on developing a powerful alternative\r\napproach based on the Poisson random measure representation of\r\ntraffic processes.  In this case, weak convergence to a queuing\r\nmodel driven by fractional Brownian motion is expected.  The\r\npower control problem associated with wireless systems is studied\r\nalong with the convergence analysis to the limit queue model. \r\nThis is done for given controls, as stochastic control analysis\r\nfor stable Levy motion or fractional Brownian motion is currently\r\nundeveloped. \r\n\r\n     The focus of the project is on analyzing wireless systems\r\ncharacterized by high capacity applications such as multimedia. \r\nSuch systems are ever more relevant with an increasing number of\r\nwireless users (personal and military) and their demand for\r\ndata-intensive applications.  For example, military applications\r\ninclude the use of video in battlefield settings for conferencing\r\nand providing information to troops.  Personal applications\r\ninclude movies, real-time interactions, and WWW data.  In\r\nparticular, extensions of a developed approach, the heavy traffic\r\nmethod, are used in the analysis.  This approach supposes that\r\nthe wireless system is near its capacity, which is the case in\r\npractice where applications make high demands on a limited\r\nbandwidth.  This assumption allows obtaining good models that\r\nretain the essential features of the actual system while being\r\ntractable.  The models are useful for obtaining an understanding\r\nof system characteristics that is needed for the design of an\r\nefficient wireless network.  Furthermore, obtaining these models\r\nis an important first step toward developing stochastic control\r\nmethods for these emerging applications to optimize resource\r\nallocations (for example, power) to the queues for transmissions. \r\n",
