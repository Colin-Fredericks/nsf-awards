 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nProfessor Wainger expects the primary focus of his research to be on l(p) \r\nestimates for discrete analogues of a family of continuous operators. In the \r\ncontinuous situation one is given for each point, x, in n-dimensional space a \r\nvariety, V (x), of positive codimension passing through x. Given a function, \r\nf , on n-dimensional space one considers maximal or singular averages of f \r\nwhere the average of x is over the variety V (x). We then seek L(p) estimates \r\nfor these averages. In the discrete analogue we consider functions defined \r\nover the lattice points, m, in n-dimensional space, and the average is over \r\nan arithmetic set containing m. In the continuous problem alluded to above, \r\nmost of the work assumes the variety V (x) has finite order of contact with \r\nits tangent plane. Professor Wainger also plans to continue his investigation \r\ninto the case that V (x) has infinite order of contact with its tangent plane. \r\nProfessor Wainger plans to study averages of functions defined on lattice\r\npoints in n-dimensional space. (Lattice points are points with integral \r\ncoordinates.) For each lattice point, m, one considers averages over an arithmetic \r\nsubset containing m. The goal is to relate analytical properties of \r\nthese averages to arithmetic properties of these subsets. \r\n\r\nResults of this type have applications to problems of Ergodic theory. A corresponding \r\ncontin uous problem has received a great deal of attention in the last forty years. \r\nIn this problem one averages functions defined on n-dimensional space over \r\nsubmanifolds of n-dimensional space. The goal is to relate analytical esti mates\r\nfor these averages to geometric properties of the submanifold. This \r\nwork largely assumes that there is only finite order of contact between the \r\nsubmanifold and its tangent plane. Professor Wainger plans to continue his \r\nstudy of the situation in which the submanifold has infinite order of contact \r\nwith its tangent plane.\r\n",
