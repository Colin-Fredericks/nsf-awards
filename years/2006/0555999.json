 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on  a  new framework of models  that  have scheduling  features as well as   inventory  features.   The framework proposed contains a large class of models with  a number of  new models lying in between already well established inventory models  and scheduling models.  The  new models appear to be of real practical significance.   A model typically assumes a number of different product types. Of each \r\n product type there is a given  demand stream for a number of  units with given  delivery due  dates.  Each  unit of a given  product type  must be delivered by  a specific due date.  The due dates may be regular or irregular. The time to produce any  unit of a given  type  is  fixed.  Each  product type  has an earliness cost and atardiness cost. If a machine (or facility)  is being set up to produce a run (or batch) of products of a given  type a setup cost is incurred. The objective is to minimize all production costs including earliness costs, tardiness costs and setup costs.  The machine (or facility) environments to be considered include: \r\n (i) the single machine, (ii)  parallel machines, (iii) machines in series,(iv)  flexible flow shops.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work has various objectives.  First,  it is important to  determine which models in the proposed class can be solved in polynomial time and where the borderline lies between the problems that are solvable in polynomial time and the problems that are NP-hard. Second, it is of interest to design and test heuristics for the problems that are NP-hard.   Third,  we intend to apply the  heuristics developed  to  real world   data that will be  provided to us by   colleagues   in industry.   \r\n\r\n The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is based on  the fact that the models are  meaningful  generalizations  of existing, well-established models and that a number of the  new models   appear to have interesting new properties that  allow for  polynomial time solutions.  The polynomial time   algorithms  as well as the heuristics  for the NP-hard cases  are  expected to exhibit interesting new  structures.   \r\n\r\n The broader impact of the proposed activity is based on the  fact that the  research team has  strong ties with various companies that are genuinely interested in the models and in the solutions. The companies involved include Dash Optimization with which  the project team  has  very  close ties.  Furthermore, the research will be disseminated   at conferences to be held at the various  institutions of  the Principal Investigators;  these  conferences have, in the past,  typically been   attended by  academicians as well  as by people from industry.   \r\n",
