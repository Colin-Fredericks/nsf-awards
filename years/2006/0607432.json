 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this research is a better understanding of the nature of the Galactic\r\nmicroquasar SS 433 - an object which possesses many of the characteristics of a quasar\r\nsuch as a hot disk, a strong disk wind, evidence for a compact object, and relativistic jets.\r\nHowever, because it is a Galactic object, it is closer and is not obscured by a galaxy of\r\nmaterial surrounding it, thereby providing an opportunity to explore important but poorly\r\nunderstood physics. Specific goals here are to identify the nature of the compact object in\r\nSS 433 (is it a neutron star or black hole?), to examine the structure and origin of the\r\nrelativistic jets, and to accurately assess the system's evolutionary state. This will be\r\naccomplished through a multiwavelength campaign using simultaneous radio imaging\r\nand optical plus x-ray spectroscopy to study the disk and jet in SS 433. Through this, the\r\nmotion of the relativistic jet will be followed, the time and distance scale of jet\r\nfragmentation determined, the disappearance of optical jet lines monitored, and the true\r\nspace velocities of the jets will be found. In addition, optical spectroscopy will be used to\r\nstudy the jet, mass donor star, and the compact object. It is expected that the mass of the\r\ndonor star will be conclusively determined as well as its evolutionary state. Finally, the\r\nobservations should also provide the mass of the compact object thereby revealing\r\nwhether it is a black hole or a neutron star.\r\nThrough this award, the research infrastructure at Valparaiso will be improved in part by\r\ncreating new student research opportunities. Participating students will serve as research\r\nassistants during ten weeks each summer and will be trained in aspects of astronomical\r\ndata acquisition, reduction, and analysis. They will have the opportunity to present their\r\nresults at national conferences and to co-author referred journal articles. Dr. Hillwig's\r\nwork in SS 433 has also been featured in many popular articles and he will continue to\r\npursue public dissemination of the results in the press and through public talks.",
