The lack of pure cultures reflects repeated failures to isolate these microbes. Modern molecular tools now enable the analysis of the structure and function of mixed microbial communities in ways that were previously limited to pure cultures. Until recently, attempts to study the EBPR metaproteome (i.e., the proteome of the mixed microbial community responsible for EBPR) also were limited by lack of availability of its metagenome sequence. The objective of the research is to advance understanding of the microbiology of EBPR by analyzing its metaproteome. The project will use the newly sequenced EBPR metagenome and apply state-of-the-art mass spectrometry, specifically the new method of quantitative 2D-LC-MS/MS, in a first-time application of proteomics to an important wastewater treatment process. The project will demonstrate the usefulness of new proteomics techniques in understanding the behavior of mixed microbial communities responsible for important wastewater treatment processes like EBPR that typically are difficult to manage. A graduate student in Environmental Engineering will be trained as part of the project. The PI will feature this work in an annual visit to a middle school to introduce environmental engineering and science to sixth graders. This project fits the SGER criteria in that it is innovative and \"high risk-high reward\" and breaks new ground.\r\n",
