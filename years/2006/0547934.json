 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a five-year CAREER award. The research project is for the development of physics-based data fusion techniques for the analysis of multi-sensor observations of Magnetosphere-Ionosphere coupling. The focus of the study is the auroral transition region (80-1000 km) of the ionosphere. Three specific science questions will be addressed using the new technique: Which physical process is responsible for the electron acceleration in aurora?  Where and how does the magnetospheric convection electric field decouple from the ionosphere?  Which role does ionospheric ion outflow play in this context? The basic idea is to combine existing models for the processes under consideration and data from a large variety of sources, including in-situ satellites, incoherent scatter radars, and ground based optical measurements, to identify inconsistencies. These will point to areas that are either not well understood or where the current models do not include sufficient physics (e.g. time dependence in auroral acceleration). A specific feature of the proposal is that it is designed to take advantage of the advanced capabilities of the new Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) facility. Students, both undergraduate and graduate, will participate extensively in the research project. In addition, environmental remote sensing concepts, including the proposed research project, will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses that the Principal Investigator teaches.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project concerned the application of remote sensing technologies to the study of the Earth\u00c6s outer atmosphere and ionosphere, with a focus on how this air-space transition region is controlled by the magnetic environment surrounding the Earth (the magnetosphere).   The principal innovation of the project was the synthesis of optical and radar remote sensing measurements through the use of physics-based computer  models.\n\nMuch of our experimental work was done using the Advance Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) facility in Fairbanks, Alaska.  This electronically steerable radar is able to probe the ionosphere (100-500 km altitude) in many different directions simultaneously, providing three-dimensional views of the ionized gases (plasma) in this region.  The figures included below exemplify our work with this facility.  They show, from left to right, a photo of the facility, a representation of a 26-beam imaging experiment, and a composite image showing simultaneously recorded radar and optical measurements.  In this figure, the color contours show ion temperature variability at 300-km altitude, the arrows show the horizontal motion of the plasma in this region, and the black and white image behind is a photo of the aurora-borealis.  As an auroral arc element is activated (bright region), the electric field in this region is shorted out, causing a reduction in ion temperature, and a local attenuation of ionospheric motions.  This first ever multi-mode, multi-dimensional view of ionospheric dynamics was pioneered through this project.\n\nSeveral significant educational initiatives were also completed under this project.  A new graduate-level course was developed at Boston University, entitled \"Radar Remote Sensing.\"  This course lies at the intersection of advanced electromagnetics and advanced signal processing where the subject of radar resides..  The course focuses on environmental radar applications, including weather radar, synthetic aperture radar, ionospheric radar, and radar astronomy.   A second initiative was the development of a summer school on incoherent scatter radar, which is now in its fourth year.  The project also sponsored two PhD completions.  Both students are now in faculty positions at major international universities. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joshua Semeter"
