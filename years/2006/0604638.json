Most of the problems arise\r\nfrom differential or convex geometry, such as the semi-linear\r\nelliptic equations from prescribing Gaussian and scalar curvature\r\nand the Monge-Ampere equations from the well-known Lp- Minkowski\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nAccording to Einstein, the Universe we lived in is a curved\r\nspace, in which gravity is realized as a distortion or bending of\r\nspace-time in the neighborhood of a massive object and this\r\nchange of shape is measured by curvature. One of these projects is focused \r\non understanding when a given function can\r\nbecome a curvature. This is a challenging problem in global\r\nanalysis and has interesting consequences in Riemannian Geometry.\r\nThe other of the PI's major projects, the Lp Minkowski problem,\r\nis the central question of the Brunn-Minkowski Theory, which is\r\nthe very core of Convex Geometric Analysis. Results in this area\r\nhave been applied to numerous disciplines, including stereology,\r\nstochastic geometry, integral geometry, number theory,\r\ncombinatorics, probability, statistics, and information theory.\r\nThe nonlinear partial differential equations and integral\r\nequations and systems studied in this project also have various\r\napplications in physics, chemistry, and biology. One example is a\r\nmodeling of chemical reaction in rivers or in blood streams,\r\nwhich would provide useful information in controlling pollution\r\nin rivers.\r\n",
