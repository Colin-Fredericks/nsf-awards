Anonymous\r\nelectronic cash (e-cash) is used as a tracking mechanism to allow for\r\naccountability without sacrificing privacy.\r\n\r\nE-cash matches the untraceability properties of physical coins: the\r\nsame bank is responsible for dispensing e-cash to buyers, and for\r\nlater accepting it for deposit from sellers, and yet it cannot trace\r\nhow buyers spent their money.\r\n\r\nAs a result, e-cash is ideally suited for serving as a currency\r\nin p2p systems: privacy is a key feature of many p2p applications,\r\nsuch as onion routing and shared backup.\r\n\r\nThis project combines systems-building and cryptography work.  Our\r\nstarting point is compact e-cash, a recent invention of one of the\r\nPIs, which improves upon the time and space requirements of previous\r\nschemes.  In addition, primitives that allow sellers to quickly prove\r\nproperties of data that they offer for sale, without revealing the\r\ndata itself are being developed.\r\n\r\nThese cryptographic innovations are being deployed in real distributed\r\nsystems, including the e-cash bank and p2p applications such as onion\r\nrouting, shared downloads, data backup, and distributed computation.\r\nInnovations in these systems surround the development of contracts\r\nthat define the interactions of peers in these systems.  Contracts\r\nensure that buyers and sellers act honestly.\r\n\r\nThis project advances our understanding of distributed system with\r\nautonomous members. These systems require incentives for peers to\r\nrender services, yet these incentives must be provided without\r\ncompromising participant privacy.\r\n",
