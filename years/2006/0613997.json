To make the challenging problem manageable, the project focuses on the domain of scientific computing.  The chief technical approach is sketching, a new software synthesis approach where the programmer develops a partial implementation --- a sketch --- and a separate specification of the desired functionality.  The synthesizer then completes the sketch to behave like the\r\nspecification.   \r\n\r\nThis exploratory project will (a) investigate how to extend the applicability of a SAT-based synthesizer to increasingly larger programs; b) develop techniques for synthesizing programs that are currently beyond the power of the SAT synthesizer; and (c) develop a robust sketching synthesizer for a class of scientific programs.\r\n",
