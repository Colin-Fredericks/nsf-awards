 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research activities in quantum information science have advanced our understanding of quantum mechanics and proposed essential components used in quantum information processing. Quantum decoherence is a major factor affecting the quality of quantum information processing devices, including on-demand single photon sources and quantum nodes. The team conducts a collaborative and interdisciplinary research program for improving the quantum coherence of single-quantum-dot photonic-crystal-cavity systems with the help of state-of-the-art nanofabrication and computational modeling. On-chip solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics systems, to be constructed by the team, are compact and scalable on a semiconductor wafer. The hardware is essentially integrated optics consisting of compact cavities and planar waveguides, so photonic crystals will provide a practical means of constructing compact integrated quantum information-processing chips. Constructing such ultimate photon localization systems in photonic crystals will open up many possibilities in relevant fields in both science and engineering, much as engineering electronic bands in semiconductor crystals has done. The team's interdisciplinary efforts to resolve the computational and experimental challenges will facilitate the realization of the full potential of nanotechnology in the quantum information science field. The development of high quantum-coherence components will also advance technology of other applications including WDM chips, optical logic circuits, and sensors on a chip, and enhance the understanding of the nature of light.\r\n\r\n",
