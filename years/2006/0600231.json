 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this effort is to investigate a novel method for manufacturing microchannels for lab-on-a-chip and Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) applications. The method is based on controlled thin film buckling, forming delamination blisters. These mechanically active features form by a local loss of adhesion between the film and the substrate due to residual stress relief, and exhibit directional growth. The geometry and path of the blisters will be controlled with lithographically-etched adhesion-weakening layers outlining the desired in-plane blister configuration. The out-of-plane dimensions will be controlled by the film residual stress. Thin film and coating buckling delamination is a truly multiscale phenomenon, so features ranging from tens of nanometers to centimeters in width are possible. In addition, compatibility with conventional microelectronic processing is very promising from the standpoint of full-scale on-chip integration. Fluid transport mechanisms, as well as the device reliability will be considered. Plans include students working in laboratory with a variety of instrumentation and equipment to fabricate the microchannels. \r\nIf successful, the proposed research will greatly impact nano-manufacturing, MEMS, and medical fields. The proposed approach will enable cost-effective, multi-scale manufacturing of microchannels, leading to an ultimately robust manufacturing process. Possible applications include drug delivery, diagnostic devices and early cancer detection. The proposed work will also contribute to the experimental and analytical tools available for thin films processing. Students will gain valuable laboratory experience and knowledge of microfluidic fabrication techniques.\r\n",
