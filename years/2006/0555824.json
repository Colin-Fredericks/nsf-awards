 "awd_abstract_narration": "This experimental research program is directed toward producing nonclassical (e.g., squeezed and entangled) light by using radiation pressure effects in an optical cavity. Specifically, the investigators will use the optical nonlinearity of a Fabry Perot cavity in which one mirror is integrated into a micromechanical cantilever. For this nonlinearity to produce nonclassical light, the cantilever must respond not just to the quasi-static radiation pressure, but also to the radiation pressure shot noise. This will be achieved by using microfabrication techniques (developed in the investigators earlier work) to produce ultrasensitive cantilevers specifically designed for this purpose. Estimates based on the theoretical literature suggest that cavities incorporating these cantilevers should be capable of generating squeezed and entangled light with a performance comparable to, and for some applications superior to, currently available sources. The broader impact of the program involves education of students as well as overlap with a wide range of fields. \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly supported by the Optical Physics program in the Physics Division and the Condensed Matter Physics program in the Division of Materials Research of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.  \r\n",
