California, Irvine\r\n\r\nThis project aims at the development of innovative on-line damage detection techniques based on the event response data, such as the seismic response data. This research will overcome the drawbacks of traditional techniques and advance the state-of-the-art of on-line damage identification for structural health monitoring. The developed methodologies will have the following capabilities: (1) applicable to linear and non-linear structures (e.g., non-linear base-isolated structures), (2) capable of identifying and tracking the structural damages using a minimum number of response data and excitation measurements, (3) capable of detecting local damages based on finite element formulation, and (4) applicable to the health monitoring of rubber-bearing isolation systems. In addition to the theoretical/numerical development, experimental shake table tests using small-scale and almost full-scale building models, will be conducted to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the new methodologies developed. Finally, applications of the developed techniques to the health monitoring of non-linear rubber-bearing isolation systems for buildings will also be investigated.\r\nThis is a collaborative research among the University of California at Irvine (UCI), U.S.A., the Nangjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA), PRC, the Earthquake Engineering Research & Test Center (EERTC), Guanzhou University, P.R.C. and the National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE), Taiwan, under the US-China Protocol for Scientific and Technical Cooperative Research on Earthquake Engineering and Hazard Mitigation. The research proposed herein will have a significant impact on the state-of-the-technology in damage detections for the structural health monitoring system\r\n",
