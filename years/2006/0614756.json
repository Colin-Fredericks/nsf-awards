 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on the applications of reactive polymers in organic synthesis.  Four broad objectives will be investigated.  The first objective deals with the continued studies of functionalized polymers in a variety of microscopic and macroscopic formulations to define their different behavior and to exploit these differences for optimal reaction selectivity and catalytic utility.  Other objectives include the incorporation of dendrimeric structures into polymers to increase loading and to modify reaction parameters, the development of cleavable mass tag strategies for use in diversity-oriented synthesis, and the investigation of novel approaches to heterocyclic solid-phase synthesis.      \r\n                            \r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professors Mark J. Kurth and Neil E. Schore of the Department of Chemistry at University of California-Davis.  Professors Kurth and Schore's research efforts revolve around the investigation of reactive polymers in organic synthesis.  Their research could expand the scope of solid-phase strategies in multi-step organic synthesis and solve problems that cannot be readily solved in other ways.  Multi-step organic synthesis is required in the manufacture of many prescription drugs.",
