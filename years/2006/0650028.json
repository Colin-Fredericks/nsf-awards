 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental principles of non-linear single molecular devices as building blocks for future\r\ncomputing technologies\r\nThis SGER proposal aims at exploring theoretical foundations for new types of\r\nnanoelectronic single molecular devices. The major driving force for this effort is the realization\r\nof unique electronic properties of single organic molecules that can be exploited to implement\r\nnovel elements of electronic circuitry to be used as an alternative for traditional, silicon based\r\nCMOS technology. The main goal of this proposal is to develop computational tools and apply\r\nthem to perform device modeling and intelligent design of molecular architectures based on firstprinciples\r\nunderstanding of electron transport. A series of unique molecules that exhibit specific\r\nelectronic functions such as molecular diodes, transistors and switches will be explored. Charge\r\ntransport through single molecules and molecular arrays will be investigated. The fundamental\r\nunderstanding of electrical characteristics of such molecular building blocks will be used to\r\nexplore the intelligent design of molecular architectures. Simulation and prediction of electrical\r\nbehavior of molecular nanoelectronic components based on their atomic and electronic\r\nproperties will be ultimately extended to achieve the virtual integrated prototyping of molecular\r\ndevices  optimization of current-voltage characteristics of specific electronic devices by\r\nchoosing the most appropriate chemical composition that has desirable electronic properties.\r\nThe proposed research program addresses the goal of NSF EMT program to explore new\r\ncapabilities for future computing technologies, thus allowing to extend the lifespan of Moore's\r\nlaw beyond the lifetime of silicon technology.\r\nBroader Impact.\r\nThe broader impact of this SGER effort will be achieved by educating science and\r\nengineering graduates who will be the main driving force for future advances in future\r\ncomputing technologies. Students involved in this project will learn a broad range of knowledge\r\nin molecular engineering and first-principles device modeling. This project will serve to attract\r\nbrilliant minds, to train and promote young talented students with the aim to reinforce the science\r\nand engineering workforce.\r\nIn addition to educational activities, this synergistic effort in theory/simulation will advance\r\nour understanding the fundamental mechanisms of electron transport in molecular nanostructures\r\nand to establish predictive structure-property relationships between molecular structure and\r\nelectrical device characteristics. This knowledge base is important for practical implementation\r\nof the next generation of computing hardware based on molecular components aimed at\r\nachieving lightweight, flexible circuits with low energy consumption and high density\r\ninformation storage.",
