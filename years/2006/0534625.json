 "awd_abstract_narration": "Enabling Personal Privacy Protection Preferences in Collaborative Video Observation\r\n\r\nThis work devises automated methods to respond to many of the  privacy concerns raised as a result of the\r\nincreasingly pervasive use of video monitoring of public and  private spaces, made possible by\r\ninexpensive surveillance and storage technology and justified by  the need for greater security and\r\nvigilance in our society.  Furthermore, as a result of continuing  progress in the machine understanding of\r\nhuman behavior and event detection through machine learning and computer vision in well specified\r\ndomains,  many beneficial applications of continuous video and  sensor monitoring other than physical\r\nsecurity have been emerging.  However, research that depends  heavily upon clinical trials has been\r\nimpeded by natural reluctance on the part of subjects to  participate in studies where a video record of their\r\nactivity and behavior is created and made accessible to diverse  collaborating groups.  One example is the\r\ncontinuous monitoring of nursing home patients to enable early  detection of changes in behavior and\r\nperformance that may correspond to environmental or pharmacological changes in their regimen. Others\r\ninclude the study of child development and aberrant behavior in day  care, and the monitoring of\r\nindependently living senior citizens by their families and medical  providers.\r\n\r\nTo meet the associated concerns about ill-controlled access to such  data even by authorized users, this project\r\ndevelops and evaluates alternative control and access mechanisms  for both the capture and display of video\r\nand sensor data that enable a layered access to detail and identity in imagery in order to more appropriately\r\nreflect how the observations are intended to be used.  This is  accomplished through means largely enabled\r\nby computer vision and computer graphics research, for example,  from selectively identifying and\r\nobscuring faces, to alternatively substituting wire-frame and stick- figure surrogates, to complete removal\r\nwith substitution of background data, all without the need for  human identification and intervention in the\r\nprocess. The implemented methods recognize and implement the  privacy protections provided by law, by institutional policy, and now, most importantly, by the personal preferences of  the participating subjects of\r\nobservation, whether that be at work, at home, or in a hospital.   Different groups with differing\r\npurposes are allowed to collaboratively use the same recorded data,  but each being able only to observe and extract  the information that they need and to which they have been  selectively permitted.\r\n\r\nThis project enables significant research in social and medical settings, where automated observation and analysis can yield the keys to understanding change and managing  interventions.  It is important to alleviate the concerns of  citizens through trusted mechanisms.  Without such capability, the use of continuously captured and  automatically analyzed observation data in many fields of scientific, medical and social research, as well as  in providing protections for health and  safety, will be seriously impeded, if not prevented.  The outcomes  of this research will ameliorate or overcome these impediments by enabling meaningful access to video  observables while respecting the demands of individual privacy in the light of rapidly expanding  \r\npublic and private surveillance.  It is anticipated that these  mechanisms will enable a much broader comfort level for  participation in video- based applications and environments.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.caremedia.cs.cmu.edu/\r\n\r\n\r\n",
