 "awd_abstract_narration": "LIGO has now achieved its design sensitivity, and has begun a data run intended to collect one year's worth of coincident data from its two sites. The gravitational wave research group at Syracuse University intends to participate in LIGO's search for bursts of gravitational waves. The Syracuse team's research will focus primarily on ensuring that terrestrial glitches are not mistaken for true gravitational wave signals. They will extend previous work by the group and others to study ways in which environmental signals couple into the interferometers, to learn to recognize burst-like coupling events when they occur, and to eliminate such contributions from the data. They will also look for correlation between the interferometer output and the many diagnostic signals that are recorded, so that any cause of a false signal, whether from an external or an internal source, can be recognized and excluded from further consideration. In addition, they will help to validate the calibration of the interferometers, focusing on aspects of the calibration relevant to determining the strengths of burst-like signals. The P.I. will continue as a leader of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, remaining as Spokesperson through his present term which ends March 2007. In that role, among other things, he will focus on working with colleagues in other countries to help develop the global network necessary for confirmation and full exploitation of future gravitational wave\r\ndiscoveries. \r\nThe search for gravitational wave bursts holds perhaps the biggest possibility for surprising discoveries by LIGO. Thus, research aimed at distinguishing genuine bursts of gravitational waves from spurious indications could play a crucial role in establishing the validity of an important discovery. While engaged in this work, the Syracuse group will continue its long history of training undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs, a significant proportion of whom have gone on to make further important contributions to the field after they have left the group. The group will also continue the development of a set of teaching lab exercises that illustrate the experimental physics techniques of LIGO, and will use those lab exercises in conjunction with the lectures on related topics offered by the P.I. at the summer school on gravitational wave astronomy run by the University of Texas, Brownsville, as well as for undergraduates at Syracuse University. The P.I. will also continue a spectrum of outreach activities, including hosting a workshop on teaching general relativity to undergraduates, in conjunction with a meeting of the American Association of Physics Teachers.",
