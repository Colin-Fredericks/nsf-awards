 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this effort, we form a new interdisciplinary team, comprised of\r\ncomputational mathematicans and astrophysicists, to focus on the development \r\namd analysis of a new generation of simulation tools centered around \r\nspectral multi-domain methods. Initial tests have confirmed the potential \r\nof such techniques\r\nwhich, however, still require significant algorithmic developments,\r\ne.g., efficient nonlinear parallel elliptic solvers, stabilization\r\ntechniques, and novel parallel temporal integration methods, to mature\r\nsufficiently.  Simultaneously, attention will be paid to problems of a\r\nnature more specific to the Einstein equations, e.g., the initial data\r\nproblem, control of constraint violating solutions, and suitable\r\nboundary conditions.\r\n\r\nNew urgency has been injected into numerical relativity and the\r\ndevelopment of computational methods for solving the Einstein\r\nequations by the current deployment of gravitational wave detectors,\r\nLIGO and, in the near future, LISA.  To fully understand and analyze\r\nthe signals measured with such facilities it is essential that a new\r\ngeneration of computational tools be available for solving the dynamical \r\nEinstein equations over very long times. In this interdiciplinary\r\neffort we combine expertize in computational mathematics and\r\nastrophysics to reach this goal, with the aim of modeling the full\r\ndynamics of a binary pair of black holes, conjectured to be a strong\r\nsource of gravity waves as predicted by the general theory of relativity.\r\nThus the effort will not only lead to the development of new\r\ncomputational simulation techniniques but also lead to the ability\r\nto test the validity some of the most fundamental physical theories\r\nknown to mankind.\r\n",
