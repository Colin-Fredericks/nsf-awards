The \r\nobjective of this meeting is to provide a forum for the discussion of\r\nrecent advances in the areas of positive sectional curvature, Kaehler\r\nand Sasakian geometry, and their interrelation to mathematical physics,\r\nespecially M and Superstring theory. We intend to create and provide a\r\nplatform for the discussion of these fundamental ideas, the growth they\r\nhave experienced in the recent past, and the open problems of interest.\r\n\r\nThe conference plans to unite a range of worldwide experts, members of\r\nthe local group at UNM, and graduate students and young mathematicians\r\nfrom across the country and beyond, to create an interactive environment for the discussion and understanding of advances in these various branches of mathematics and theoretical physics, for the firm grasp of their many recent results, and for the discussion of plaussible approaches\r\nto attack a number of interesting open questions. Strong effort is to be made to encourage the participation of mathematicians from all over the nation, and in particular those belonging to the large minority population\r\nof the Rocky mountain area. The impact of this activity is expected to be made long lasting by the prompt dissemination of its results, presenting\r\nthe scientific community with the Proceedings of the conference shortly\r\nafter its completion.\r\n",
