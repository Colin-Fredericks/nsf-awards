 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nCOLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: UNDERSTANDING CLIMATE CHANGE DURING THE FINAL STAGES OF LATE\r\nPALEOZOIC GONDWANAN GLACIATION - AN INTEGRATED DATA-MODEL STUDY\r\nIsabel Montanez, University of California, Davis\r\nVladimir Davydov & Mark Schmitz, Boise State University\r\nChris Poulsen, University of Michigan\r\nNeil Tabor, Southern Methodist University\r\nRecently developed paleoclimate archives reveal a much more dynamic transition from the late\r\nPaleozoic Gondwanan ice age to a greenhouse world than previously considered - one characterized by\r\nconsiderable co-variability in climate and pCO2. Recently documented short-lived (1 to 4 m.y.) episodes\r\nof glaciation appear to coincide with large magnitude shifts in atmospheric pCO2, marine and continental\r\ntemperatures and relative sea-level suggesting a CO2-climate-glaciation link. This link, however, remains\r\nuntested. We propose an interdisciplinary study focused on significantly improving our understanding of\r\nthe evolution of the late Paleozoic climate system, and the mechanisms that triggered climate change\r\nduring the Earth's last period of transition from icehouse to greenhouse states. The research is designed to\r\ntest two hypotheses: (1) that atmospheric CO2 variability was the primary driver for repeated growth and\r\nretreat of continental ice sheets, and, in turn, (2) that late Paleozoic ice sheets strongly influenced global\r\nclimate, particularly in the tropics. Specific basins in central and eastern Europe and western Argentina\r\nhave been targeted given their stratigraphic and paleogeographic coverage, presence of marine, paralic\r\nand paleosol-bearing terrestrial deposits, and their existing biostratigraphy and potential for further\r\nradiometric dating (i.e., multiple intercalated volcanic tuffs) and biostratigraphic analysis. This research\r\nhas three major objectives:\r\n* To establish a radiometrically calibrated, chronostratigraphic framework (Gzhelian to early Middle\r\nPermian) through the integration of new and existing bio-, cyclo-, and chemo-stratigraphic (87Sr/86Sr)\r\ndata with U/Pb dating of volcanic tuffs, and the application of these integrated data to multiple\r\nquantitative tools (CONOP, RASC, CASP, GraphCor).\r\n* To further develop and calibrate high-resolution, quantitative proxy records of paleo-atmospheric\r\npCO2, paleo-precipitation, and marine and terrestrial paleo-temperatures. This includes critical\r\nevaluation and further development of new quantitative proxies as well as direct comparison of proxy\r\nrecords to sedimentologic evidence for glaciations and 'warmings' in southern Gondwanan\r\nsuccessions.\r\n* Development of a theoretical climate framework for the late Paleozoic glacial-interglacial oscillations\r\nusing three-dimensional climate models to quantify the sensitivity of ice sheets on Gondwana to\r\npCO2, determine the role of ice sheets in driving global climate change, and make climate predictions\r\nthat can be tested through comparison with the proxy records.\r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed research will offer four major contributions to the broader scientific\r\ncommunity: (1) a reconstruction of the late Paleozoic climate system at an unprecedented level of\r\nresolution and accuracy, (2) an important test of the pCO2-climate paradigm for climate evolution through\r\nEarth history, (3) documentation of marine-terrestrial climate linkages at unprecedented temporal\r\nresolution for the Paleozoic, and (4) the first test of proposed correlations of cyclothemic successions in\r\neastern Euramerican and North American basins, and of linkages to the Gondwanan glaciosedimentary\r\nrecord. In addition, to the planned cross-disciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students, the\r\nPIs will integrate their research efforts into three educational outreach programs designed to enhance the\r\nresearch and teaching opportunities of underrepresented undergraduate students and high school science\r\nteachers. We will make our data and model simulations available to the greater scientific community by\r\nimporting them into the CHRONOS System (and its partner website, PaleoStrat), a web-based interactive\r\nresource with which PI Davydov is directly involved.",
