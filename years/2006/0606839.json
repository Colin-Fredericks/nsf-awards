 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nThe Berkeley Infrared Spatial Interferometer is a unique system of three 1.65-meter\r\ntelescopes located at the Mt. Wilson Observatory. Its baselines range from 4 to\r\napproximately 75 meters and it is capable of 20 milliarcsecond resolution. The system\r\nuses heterodyne detection with a bandwidth of 0.2/cm and the resulting signals can be\r\nfilters to obtain arbitrarily narrow spectral widths. The recent addition of a third telescope\r\nhas allowed phase closure measurements to an accuracy of 1 degree, which allows nearly\r\ncomplete Fourier analysis of intensity patterns, including asymmetries.\r\nAn observing program of evolved late-type stars will be continued using the\r\ninterferometer. The sizes of such stars and select associated features (surrounding dust\r\ndistributions and asymmetries, water vapor envelopes, etc.) will be directly measured.\r\nThe narrow bandwidth capability will allow the atomic and molecular spectral lines of\r\nsurrounding gas to be avoided or selected yielding, among other characteristics, reliable\r\nand realistic stellar sizes. The observations will follow the changes in size of prominent\r\nMira variable stars as a function of phase and examine possible departures from\r\nsphericity of Miras and red giants. Previous studies with the interferometer have shown\r\nmovements of dust clouds surrounding late-type stars as well as deviations of the clouds\r\nfrom spherical symmetry. Studies of these variations will be continued to provide\r\ninformation on the motion of dust clouds around stars, and from this and Doppler\r\nmeasurements, also a determination of distances.\r\nThe work here will provide training for young scientists (a postdoctoral research\r\nassociate) and students (2 graduate students as well as undergraduates) who will have\r\nhands-on opportunities to learn optics, electronics, computer control systems, data\r\nanalysis, and scientific interpretation. Interferometry and instrumentation are two areas of\r\nhigh priority for the astronomical community and the education of the next generation of\r\ninstrument builders is critical the field's continued success.",
