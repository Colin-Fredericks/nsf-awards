While contemporary efforts are promising, most available undergraduate research experiences are either heavy on preparation or heavy on application. The hypothesis being explored in this project is that teaching the processes of scientific inquiry requires a comprehensive learning infrastructure that systematically carries students through the interconnected knowledge bases and practices of science. \r\n\r\nWe are implementing and assessing an approach that gives students the opportunity to both understand and do science. Our hypothesis is that we are facilitating the mastery of problem-solving skills and disciplinary socialization, thereby producing graduates who are well prepared to enter the community of scholars. The scientific core in our approach provides students with a complete research experience.  This experience is comprised of a sequence of five courses: scientific writing, research methodologies, statistical analysis, behavioral ethics, and a 32-week capstone research application where students become intimately familiar with scientific inquiry by participating in team-based, student-initiated, hands-on research projects. Guided by a faculty mentor, the capstone course culminates in a written scientific study that students present publicly. Courses are being designed to maximize the integration of research and education at each phase of the research experience.\r\n\r\nOur model includes building an infrastructure designed to teach all students how the scientific process unfolds when addressing complex social issues. This enhances the professional and academic credentials of our students, because success in the 21st century global marketplace hinges on scientific literacy.  Students earning a baccalaureate are also being prepared to apply the tools of science to resolve real-world problems seemingly unrelated to their immediate circumstances. This intellectual advantage extends the merit of the research experience beyond the individual to broader society. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nAll students selecting a major in criminology, psychology, or sociology are participating in the research experience, and other science departments may adopt the model. At the home institution, it is anticipated that about 155 students will be involved at various stages in the scientific core in any given year. Nine faculty members providing instruction/mentoring in the scientific core will also disseminate information about the model's inception, implementation, and outcomes at professional conferences over the grant period of three years.  Instructors from predominantly minority institutions are being invited to roundtable sessions to broaden our impact.  Results from testing our hypothesis will contribute to the knowledge base about the impact of undergraduate research through comparisons of the achievement of students required to complete the scientific core in this project, students in the department prior to the adoption of the scientific core, and students participating in the university's NSF-funded research experience for non-science majors.\r\n\r\n",
