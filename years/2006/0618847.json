The foundation of Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science (SOARS) is a ten-week summer research internship at the National Center for Atmospheric Research or at laboratories of other SOARS sponsors.  A strong, formal mentoring program and a vibrant learning community support all participants.  An ongoing writing workshop is also part of the summer program.",
