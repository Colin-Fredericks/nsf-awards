 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study explores the dissemination of scientific knowledge via peer-reviewed publication processes.  A number of recent developments are likely to bring about changes in scientific publication.  Among these are that the Internet lets researchers disseminate findings themselves rather than going through journals and that the journal review process has slowed in many fields.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to document changes that are already occurring and to improve understanding of how the structure of peer review affects the dissemination of knowledge.  One component of the study is an empirical analysis of a recent trend in the economics profession.  Preliminary data suggest that top economists are publishing less in many top journals.  Furthermore, detailed database will be analyzed to explore the extent of the change and why it is occurring.  Another component of the study is the development of theoretical models of the publication processes in which journals have a dual role:  they physically disseminate papers and they provide quality signals to potential readers.  The analysis includes discussions of the effect of review costs, dissemination costs, and the journal's standards on dissemination and social welfare.  Additional empirical work examines citations as an evaluation tool and the underrepresentation of women in the economics profession.\r\n\r\nThis study contributes to the economics literature in several ways:  it documents previously unknown facts about how peer review is functioning; it includes the development of new databases; it brings up new questions about peer review, including the thought that it may be subject to unraveling; and it develops a framework in which to think about the publication process.  This framework brings out several observations that call for further study. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  Peer review has played a central role in the allocation of resources and the dissemination of scientific knowledge.  Any changes could have huge effects on science and society.  An improved understanding of the changes that may be coming and of the principles governing the viability and efficiency of peer review is valuable.  The project brings a number of more concrete and certain benefits.  The databases developed for the project will provide insight into the underrepresentation of women in the economics profession.\r\n",
