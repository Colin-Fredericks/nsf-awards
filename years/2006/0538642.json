 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\nThis proposal describes a Track 1 project developed by the University of Wyoming in partnership with several schools with high Native American and Hispanic communities.\r\nThe goals of this project are to motivate and prepare students for self-directed learning and to nurture an appreciation for discovery that will lead to careers in science. The project seeks to engage communities to deepen understanding of contemporary STEM issues. The project will focus on the interdisciplinary nature, unifying concepts and ethical considerations of science from the perspective of  \"What is Alive?\"  In order to intervene in the prevalent socio-educational culture that now directs students into non-college curricular tracts in the 9th grade, the program will target 7th and 8th grade classes. Initially, communities with significant Native American and Hispanic communities will been targeted; however, the long-term goal will be to reach all school districts in Wyoming, in part, via distance delivery technologies and continuing education workshops. The broad program goals will be attained by meeting four specific objectives:\r\n*\tEnhance awareness and understanding of contemporary STEM issues, opportunities and ethics by offering motivational units to students and communities.\r\n*\tPromote STEM knowledge and skills by delivering interdisciplinary curricular units that align with state standards.\r\n*\tAdvance graduate student learning and outcomes.\r\n*\tIncrease sustainable STEM expertise of 7th and 8th grade science teachers. \r\n\r\nKnowledge of the nature and relevance of scientific discovery will provoke sustainable student learning, achievement and career choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
