 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project increases the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce by recruiting, mentoring, and supporting academically talented but financially needy students through degree completion, and partnering with employers to facilitate placement. This is accomplished by four objectives: Improve educational opportunities for students by awarding 40 scholarships annually for $2,500 each over a four-year period; Increase retention of students to degree achievement by creating supportive environments through changes in organizational culture and practices; Improve student support programs by providing mentoring, tutoring, study-groups, career counseling, internships, and placement services; Increase the STEM workforce by implementing the project collaboratively with industry partners to increase the number of well-educated and skilled employees in technical areas of national need. The Intellectual Merit of the project is to advance knowledge of effective practices that prepare students to pursue STEM careers from community colleges, by innovatively integrating student support and placement and providing students with skills to improve their academic competitiveness. The Broader Impact of the project will increase the economic diversity of the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
