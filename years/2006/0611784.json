 "awd_abstract_narration": "9th Annual Conference on Computational Genomics\r\nBaltimore, MD, October 2006\r\n\r\nThe goal of the 9th Annual Conference on Computational Genomics is to bring together leading scientists from around the world to discuss the latest advances in computational methods for analysis of genome sequences. The meeting addresses these topics from the perspective of biological scientists attempting to make sense of the vast quantities of genome sequence and expression data now becoming available. The goal of the meeting is to provide a forum for a combination of invited speakers, speakers selected from submitted abstracts, and poster presenters to discuss their work and exchange ideas. For 2006, the program committee has decided to focus on three special themes: 1. High-throughput automated genome annotation 2. Bioinformatics for biological networks 3. Computational genomics related to infectious diseases in humans, animals, and plants. The 9th Annual Conference on Computational Genomics is a joint initiative of the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute (VBI) and the Jackson Laboratories (formerly it was an initiative of The Institute for Genomic Research). \r\n\r\nThe objective of this award is to support 20 student scholarships to cover the registration costs and 5 student travel stipends to cover travel costs, poster display board costs, and some staff salary and benefit costs for administering the scholarship program. Increasing the participation from underrepresented groups and minorities will be done through fellowships to students, by targeted announcements to specific organizations, and by the individual initiative of program committee members. VBI has a good track record in working with the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native American in Science (SACNAS) and with African American colleges and universities, which should help in this effort.  \r\n",
