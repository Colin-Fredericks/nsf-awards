 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT \r\nThe meeting will bring together researchers to discuss the fundamental requirements on DDDAS environments, identify architectural components, structural elements, and mechanisms and policies which are crucial for a large-scale, shared facility commensurate with the requirements and objectives of DDDAS environments.  The proposed workshop, will focus and will address more extensively on DDDAS related infrastructure and testbeds.  The workshop will also address modalities and approaches of how collaboration with other communities such as distributed systems, software engineering, networking, algorithms and security, on both collaborative research and on experimental infrastructure suitable for large-scale, interdisciplinary experimentations be achieved.\r\n The 2-day workshop will bring together a community of researchers and students active in the areas of the theme of the meeting. The invitees will be asked to provide position papers, and the meeting conducted in the format of presentations, working groups sessions, and plenary sessions discussing recent advances in DDDAS and other NSF infrastructure efforts.  The workshop will produce a report, which will be made available to the broader community.",
