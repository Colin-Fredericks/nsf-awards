 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is part of the development of a Geosciences High Performance Computing Research Consortium as a successor to the high-performance computing and data center services currently provided by the National Center for Atmospheric Research. It includes a three-day workshop, to be held in Fall, 2006, to seek geosciences community participation in planning and scoping the Consortium. The goal of the workshop is to develop a plan, supported by the geosciences research community, for the implementation of the vision described in the \"Petascale Collaboratory for the Geosciences\" report. Questions to be addressed include:\r\n\r\n- What is the \"sweet-spot\" for capability computing in the Geosciences?\r\n- What research opportunities are being missed in the current computing climate?\r\n- What is the best balance between capability and capacity for the Geosciences?\r\n- Is a geosciences capability computing center serving multiple disciplines desirable for the geosciences community?\r\n- If so, how can we make such a center work well for a broad range of users?\r\n- What governing model makes sense for the geosciences community?\r\n\r\nThe anticipated long-term impact is a set of more robust high-performance computing and data center services aligned with the research and education needs of the geosciences.",
