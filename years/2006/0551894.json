 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT \r\n\r\nThe project involves work on several distinct problems with the common\r\nthemes of controlling, estimating or reconstructing singularities that arise in\r\noscillatory integral operators, Fourier integral operators and  inverse problems.\r\nThe first problem concerns establishing optimal decay rates for oscillatory\r\nintegral operators in three dimensions having generic homogeneous polynomial\r\nphase functions. In the second, the Calderon problem for scalar conductivities\r\nwith jump discontinuities in two dimensions will be analyzed, with singularities\r\n(suitably interpreted) of boundary data yielding information about the\r\nlocations, and possibly sizes, of the jumps of the conductivity in the interior. \r\nA linearized version of the identification problem for the attenuated Radon\r\ntransform will be analyzed using techniques from micro-local and harmonic analysis\r\nin the third problem. Finally, a linearized hyperbolic inverse problem involves\r\nstudying the composition of Fourier integral operators associated to specific\r\nsingular geometries arising from the presence of caustics occurring generically\r\nin three dimensions.\r\n\r\nProgress on these problems will add to the understanding of partial differential\r\nequations, the operators, which are used to solve them, and the\r\nbehavior of their solutions. Many laws of nature are expressed as partial differential\r\nequations, which govern physical quantities of interest, such as electromagnetic\r\nfield strength or pressure exerted by acoustic waves. The techniques to be developed\r\nin this project are applicable to equations that govern various kinds of wave\r\npropagation and are based on a geometric point of view in understanding the\r\nsingularities, which are present.  The last three problems have the potential to\r\nassist in the design or refinement of systems for nondestructive testing, \r\nmedical imaging, and seismic exploration.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
