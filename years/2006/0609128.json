 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis NIRT proposal focuses on developing manufacturable NanoElectroMechanical Systems (NEMS) in which light-driven artificial molecular shuttles are used as the \"active nanostructures.\"  The PIs propose to (1) exploit the \"bottom-up\" based synthetic routes to create novel photoactive bistable rotaxane-based molecular shuttles, (2) develop multiscale computer-aided design methodologies to help design and optimize the molecular structures/properties of the molecular shuttles, (3) experimentally quantify the response time for photoactive bistable rotaxanes switching from one state to another, (4) develop hierarchical nanomanufacturing process for the creation of bistable rotaxane-based polymer micro/nano structures with controllable molecular architecture, and (5) demonstrate a new class of functional MEMS/NEMS devices with photoactive bistable rotaxane-based molecular machines as the key \"active nanostructures,\" including microfluidic platforms, chemical/biological sensors, and energy conversion/storage systems. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The PIs proposed research will lead to the creation of new synthetic routes for artificial molecular machines, and new computer-aided methodologies for the design and optimization of molecular structures/properties. The proposed research will result in breakthrough achievements in real functional molecular-machine-based NEMS.   Thus, they aim their effort at the essence of nanotechnologys promise, proving the value of the enormous investment already made and stimulating accelerated activities in these areas. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The PI and three co-PIs each has longstanding commitments to education and community outreach activities. With the support from this NIRT grant, their team from four institutes will be able to expand the existing or start new outreach activities for minority groups, high-school students, undergraduates, high-school teachers, and middle-school students.  The progress in our proposed endeavors will be included in courses being taught at the four universities.  In addition, immersing their students in this interdisciplinary approach to nanotechnology, involving organic chemistry, computational material science, and nanoengineering will better equip students to adjust to the ever-changing scientific world, enabling them to develop into future leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
