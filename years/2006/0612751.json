 "awd_abstract_narration": "The area of preconditioned iterative solvers for eigenvalue \r\ncomputations is rapidly developing. Software implementations of \r\nseveral preconditioned eigensolvers, in particular, the locally \r\noptimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method \r\ndeveloped by the principal investigator (PI) earlier, are being \r\nwritten. The recent progress opens new opportunities to develop \r\nefficient preconditioned iterative solvers for interior eigenvalues \r\nand singular value computations.  The use of preconditioned \r\neigensolvers in applications raises new area-specific important \r\nissues, both practical and theoretical, which need to be resolved. The \r\nproposed research addresses these issues based on the success of the \r\nprevious work of the PI. The PI expects to advance the theory of some \r\nknown methods, to discover new locally optimal algorithms, and to be \r\nable to provide specific recommendations concerning the choice of \r\nmethods. The following specific and interrelated research projects are\r\nproposed: reducing the LOBPCG costs for large block sizes; developing \r\nefficient preconditioned solvers for interior eigenvalues and singular \r\nvalue computations; finite element method error analysis for \r\neigenproblems resulting from partial differential equations with \r\nhighly discontinuous coefficients. The projects form a balanced mix of \r\ntheoretical research and code development. Numerical simulations are \r\nto be performed on modern parallel computing systems, such as the IBM \r\nBlueGene/L supercomputer.\r\n\r\nThe ideas behind the proposed research are original, and build on \r\nprior work. The project addresses mathematically difficult and \r\npractically important problems. The broader impact resulting from the \r\nproposed activity is twofold: Ph.D. education and advances in \r\nsoftware.  Funds are requested in the proposal to support Ph.D. \r\nstudents. Improvement of the software currently used and development \r\nof new codes for scientists and engineers creates potential advances, \r\ne.g., in analyzing extremely large data sets, which is important for \r\nnational security.",
