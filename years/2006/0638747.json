Andrade at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil.  The researchers plan to study the relationships between material processing and composition on the nanostructure and electrochemical performance of anode catalysts for direct ethanol fuel cells and wastewater electrolysis.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of the planning visit is to establish a collaborative research program in a thorough investigation and characterization of electrocatalysts that will affect fields of growing importance as new \"green\" and renewable energy sources are sought.  Improved electrocatalysts can have a broad impact in areas such as energy and the environment.  This activity and the follow-on project would strengthen collaborations with foreign scientists and provide international research experiences for students.\r\n",
