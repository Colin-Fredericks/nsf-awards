 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the interplay between molecular biology, computer science, \r\nand evolution to probe a complex form of biological information processing: gene\r\nunscrambling in ciliated protozoa. A long-term goal is to develop a multidisciplinary\r\napproach to this problem that will enable us to tap into this biological process as a\r\ncomputational tool.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed activity is the unique combination of three\r\napproaches experiments, computational biology, and modeling to improve our\r\nunderstanding of the function, mechanism, and logic of this phenomenon. Because\r\ngene unscrambling in stichotrichous ciliates has the ability to assemble thousands of\r\ngenes from tens of thousands of scrambled segments within a single genome, it is\r\nour opinion that DNA unscrambling in ciliates remains the most complex and\r\nspectacular, yet least explored, type of DNA computation known in biology. This\r\nproposal uses gene unscrambling as a model system to explore the mechanisms\r\nunderlying complex gene and genome rearrangements, the steps through which\r\nthese processes have evolved, and their capacity to solve hard computational\r\nproblems in vivo.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts\r\nThe broader impacts resulting from the prior NSF ITR award has been an influx of\r\nnew ideas and direction from computational sciences into the study of a complex\r\nbiological system of programmed DNA rearrangements in ciliated protozoa and\r\ntraining of a varied, interdisciplinary group of students. The broader impacts resulting\r\nfrom the proposed activity would be expansion of the current work and\r\ninterdisciplinary student training, with even more synergy between different members\r\nof the group from the computational and experimental sides, with the ultimate goal of\r\nharnessing this process for the purpose of performing in vivo computation. The\r\nstrength of the combined approach is its ability to recognize underlying quantitative\r\nprinciples, which would otherwise be missed in descriptive studies of gene\r\nunscrambling alone, and the continued building and refinement of a strong\r\nquantitative framework to understand this natural computing paradigm. This is\r\nespecially germane as we enter the stage of post genomic data for ciliates,\r\nheightening the need for rigorous quantitative tools and analysis to understand how\r\nnature implements complex data structures in molecular biology. These studies of\r\n'BioWare' offer a glimpse into one of nature's attempts to explore the diverse range\r\nand capacity of modern genetic systems.\r\n\r\n",
