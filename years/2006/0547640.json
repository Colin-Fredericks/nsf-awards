 "awd_abstract_narration": "Claudio Margulis of the University of Iowa is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for research that is developing a molecular- level theory of room - temperature ionic liquids (RTILs).  These solvents are of interest because they can dissolve a wide range of polar and non-polar solutes and although they are liquid at room temperature, their vapor pressure is very low.  Thus, they hold promise in green chemistry applications as good solvents that are non - volatile.  Margulis has developed a force field for the description of these ionic liquids and is now investigating the slow dynamics that have recently been observed experimentally for some RTILs.  The CAREER project is investigating the structural heterogeneity of these RTILs and the goal is to predict which set of cations and anions will exhibit the largest such heterogeneity.  The work is having a broader impact on the development of green chemistry techniques, a feature of the project which is emphasized by Margulis in an outreach program to minority students at area high schools.",
