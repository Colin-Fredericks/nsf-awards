 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Computer Science, National Center for Security Research and Training, and Office of Strategic Initiatives at Louisiana State University in collaboration with Southern University and Louisiana Tech University are providing educational and pedagogical opportunities for academically talented faculty in information assurance and security. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit. The project, \"Multi-University Research and Training in Information Assurance and Computer Security,\" engages faculty scholars in a series of faculty development activities that include a summer workshop, national lab/research center visits, academic year mini-grants, and a conference in information assurance and computer security. Program activities are being offered through two phases. During the first phase faculty participate in a 2-week summer workshop and national lab/research center visits that focus on state-of-the-art research training and various enhancement activities. During the second phase, faculty scholars receive academic year mini-grants that extend research and education training to the home institutions and participate in an annual conference that serves as a consolidation of experience exchange and national dissemination. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts. The focus of this research and training is to increase the number of US citizens, including members of under-represented groups, who are advancing their teaching and research in the emerging areas of information assurance and security. The interaction of distinguished experts from National Laboratories, the LSU National Center for Security Research and Training provides coordinated efforts in security research and training by both state and federal law enforcement agencies. The integration of research and education, and broader cross-disciplinary activities is an important component of the inter-institutional collaborative work. This project expands the learning community and provides a way to enhance faculty's academic preparation and to establish partnerships for research and education in information assurance and computer security.\r\n",
