 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a five year plan to expand and intensify the Notre Dame Honors Mathematics Program together with SUMR.  It aims for a sharp increase in the number of students pursuing graduate work in the Mathematical Sciences.  It also aims to increase the number of minority students majoring in Mathematics at Notre Dame and taking higher level Mathematics courses.  It includes funds for 2 postdocs, 3 graduate students, 37 scholarships for undergraduates and summer funds for 12 undergraduates each year.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThis is a plan to train Mathematics undergraduates at a very high standard. It continues and broadens the tradition established by the SUMR program.  It seeks to attract 8-10 undergraduate students per year into a career of research in one of the mathematical sciences.  It expects to make these undergraduates attractive to the country's top graduate programs.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThis plan aims to replenish and broaden this nation's mathematical talent base.  It will draw significant numbers of women into Mathematics, just as SUMR has done.  It seeks to increase the number of Latinos and other minorities choosing a career in the mathematical sciences.  In short, several constituencies traditionally served by Notre Dame have been historically somewhat hesitant in their engagement with the scientific tasks of our country.  This plan contributes to redressing that deficiency and so deepens our society's commitment to its research mission.\r\n",
