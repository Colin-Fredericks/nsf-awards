 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two basic types of open-ocean platforms have been identified for use in the Global component of the ORION Program - the discus and spar buoys. The designs of candidate discus buoys have advanced to the point of deployment of prototypes off the Pacific Northwest and Monterey Bay whereas the spar design has not progressed beyond the 6- year old DEOS. \r\n\r\nThe PIs request funding to provide an updated design and cost study of the spar buoy. The proposed study will be based on 1) specific spar locations established through the NSF's Request For Assistance (RFA) process and subsequent public scientific forum 2) recent experience with the installation of several spars with polyester moorings; 3) new fabrication methods for spars, especially the cell spar; 4) experience with float-over decks on spars; 5) the huge increase in costs for anchor handling tugs and platform supply vessels in the past year; and 6) meteorological and wave data (hindcast) for the three sites identified as prime candidates for spar deployments. They will develop design concepts for a high latitude spar - a particular challenge in such a harsh environment, but a high priority site for Ocean science. The proposed design update will also focus on methods for installation and servicing of the buoys. In particular, we will examine the tradeoffs between wet-towing and dry-transporting the spar to its deployments site. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe results of this proposal will be an extremely valuable resource and reference on the state-of-the-art of spar buoy designs for the ORION Program and rest of the ocean community. With the increased interest in ocean observing systems for not only research but for operational applications, an evaluation of the ability of the spar buoy design to meet power, structural, deployment, mooring and servicing requirements in remote and/or harsh environments will be of very great value to the ocean community world-wide. The proposed activity will advance the objectives of ORION which is expected to significantly promote teaching, training and learning as related to ocean observations, data and a greater understanding of the ocean and its socio-economic applications in general.\r\n",
