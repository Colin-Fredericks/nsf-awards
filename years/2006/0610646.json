 "awd_abstract_narration": "As computer simulations are playing an ever increasing role in many\r\nbranches of science and engineering and are rapidly replacing much of\r\nthe expensive prototyping and testing phases in manufacturing and in\r\nscience explorations, fast and robust numerical methods are becoming\r\nan indispensable tool for many scientists and engineers.  The focus of\r\nthis project is to design fast and robust spectral-Galerkin methods\r\nfor solving a large class of partial differential equations, and apply\r\nthem to investigate several important problems of current interest.\r\nThe proposed research will result in fast and accurate numerical\r\nalgorithms for a class of partial differential equations with\r\napplications in acoustic and electromagnetic scattering, fluid\r\ndynamics and materials science. \r\n\r\nIt is expected that the proposed numerical algorithms will allow\r\nsimulations of three-dimensional time-dependent problems within a\r\nreasonable turn-over time, and provide capabilities to numerically\r\nattack challenging problems arising from emerging engineering and\r\nscientific applications. In particular, the proposed numerical\r\nsimulations will contribute towards better understandings of the\r\ncomplex physical and mathematical problems, and provide valuable\r\ninformation for the design of advanced materials and on the\r\nrheological and hydrodynamic properties of complex fluids. The\r\nproposed research will also generate opportunities for undergraduate\r\nresearch projects such as software development, parallel computation\r\nand numerical simulation.\r\n",
