 "awd_abstract_narration": "MRI: Development of Magneto-Optic Near-field Scanning Optical \r\nMicroscope (MO-NSOM) for optical characterization of nanostructures\r\n\r\nOptical methods using visible or near-visible light are perhaps the most popular tools for sample characterization across virtually all scientific fields. Optical characterization on the nanoscale is hampered by the diffraction limit which can be overcome with near-field microscopy (NSOM), but at the price of more complex instrumentation. At this time, no instrument exists that provides polarization-sensitive detection with picosecond temporal and nanometer spatial resolution.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: This proposal will develop a Magneto-Optic Near-field Scanning Optical Microscope (MO-NSOM). This will be the first instrument that combines nanometer spatial resolution, sub-picosecond temporal resolution, and polarization sensitivity. To accomplish this goal, the PIs will work with two industrial partners to significantly expand the capabilities of a commercially available microscope in all relevant areas ranging from light source to detection apparatus. They will carry out a diverse range of research projects, focusing on ultrafast nano-magneto-optics of individual nanomagnetic structures in dense arrays.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: The picosecond MO-NSOM will be a valuable addition to nanoscale characterization instrumentation that combines a large set of capabilities that can be used individually or in combination. The results of the development effort will be disseminated through the participating companies and on the PI's website. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in different aspects of the instrument development. In addition, the instrument will be used for course development in the Electrical Engineering department at UC Santa Cruz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
