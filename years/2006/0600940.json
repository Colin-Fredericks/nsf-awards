 "awd_abstract_narration": "Groups of finite Morley rank arise in model theory as a substantial\r\ngeneralization of the class of algebraic groups.  It has been conjectured\r\nthat the simple groups in this category are all algebraic, and Cherlin is\r\nworking on this conjecture with a team of international collaborators.\r\nThis involves techniques used in the classification of the finite simple\r\ngroups as well as some ideas from black box group theory.  In graph theory,\r\nusing a mix of model theoretic and combinatorial techniques, Cherlin and\r\nShelah are developing techniques to determine, for a given finite set of\r\nforbidden graphs, whether there is a universal graph meeting the\r\nconstraints.  The ultimate question here is whether the entire problem is\r\nalgorithmically decidable.  Thomas works on the theory of countable Borel\r\nequivalence relations, combining the methods of descriptive set theory with\r\ntechniques related to superrigidity. The methods of descriptive set theory\r\ncast considerable light on classical classification problems, and\r\nconversely powerful methods coming from group theory illuminate and advance\r\nthe general theory.  Cherlin and Thomas also host a dynamic visitor program\r\nat Rutgers, coordinated with annual visits by Shelah.\r\n\r\nInfinite group theory provides a tool for studying and exploiting the\r\nsymmetries of a mathematical model or a physical system. Cherlin and his\r\ncollaborators are aiming at the classification of the groups associated\r\nwith well-behaved algebraic systems, while Simon Thomas approaches the\r\nstudy of infinite groups from the point of view of their actions and the\r\nanalysis of one action in terms of another.  A particularly strong role is\r\nplayed here by ideas coming from the theory of dynamical systems.  Graphs\r\nare the mathematical abstraction of networks in general, and the problems\r\nunder consideration relate to the analysis, preferably by a general\r\n(computable) algorithm, of classes of graphs characterized by forbidding a\r\nfixed set of patterns.\r\n",
