This year program has twenty-six technical papers selected from 172 submissions (an acceptance rate of 15%). The conference addresses a broad spectrum of foundational concerns for computer architecture and computer design including microarchitecture, cache and memory system design, parallel computer architectures, power-efficient\r\narchitectures, embedded and reconfigurable architectures, I/O systems, and performance evaluation.\r\n\r\nThis years conference is also the host to eight workshops and two tutorials. Detailed descriptions of the workshops, tutorials and the full technical program are available on the conference web site, http://www.hpcaconf.org. The conference is sponsored by the IEEE Computer Societys Technical Committee on Computer Architecture and is held annually. The lead organizers for the 2006 conference include Professors Yale Patt, and Craig Chase of The University of Texas at Austin (co-general chairs), and Professor\r\nChita Das, of Penn State University (program chair).\r\n",
