 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nThe underrepresentation of minorities in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)\r\nworkforce remains a national problem fourteen years after the National Science Foundation (NSF)\r\ninitiated the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Program. By all accounts,\r\nhowever, great progress has been made as indicated by the consistent trend of increasing enrollment and\r\nbaccalaureate STEM degrees by underrepresented minorities (URM) in the LSAMP program since the\r\nbeginning of the program in 1991. Figures show that baccalaureate degrees awarded at LSAMP\r\ninstitutions increased from 3,914 in 1991 to over 24,000 in 2004, and URM enrollment increased from\r\n35,000 to over 200,000 as the number of LSAMP sites increased from 6 to 35.\r\nAs one of the six oldest NSF alliances in the nation, Alabama Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority\r\nParticipation (ALSAMP) has been at the forefront of efforts to increase the quantity and the quality of\r\nunderrepresented minorities receiving baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields. The alliance has made\r\noutstanding progress in increasing enrollment and undergraduate degree production and changing the\r\nculture in STEM education at member institutions. With this experience, successful Phase I-Phase III\r\nawards and three Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) awards, the alliance is poised to undertake a Phase IV\r\nproposal to completely sustain the project by the end of NSF funding. To do this a team effort\r\ninvolving all member institutions and chief academic officers was needed. In preparation for the\r\nLSAMP Phase IV application, each alliance member was asked to identify particular campus programs\r\nfor inclusion in the phase IV proposal and strategies and resources for sustaining those efforts after NSF\r\nsupport ends. In addition, the ALSAMP Principal Investigator met in Atlanta, Georgia, with Dr.\r\nAnsley Abraham, Director, Southern Regional Education Board (SREB)-State Doctoral Scholars\r\nProgram, to solicit support for the proposed efforts from that organization. Information and application\r\nmaterial regarding minority fellowships were also solicited from the Ford Foundation, NSF and other\r\nagencies. An executive committee meeting was then held to discuss the programs and recommendations\r\nfor sustainability. This proposal grew out of the discussions at this meeting.\r\nALSAMP currently has a variety of student support programs designed to meet the needs of\r\nundergraduate students, as well as students at the high school to college and the college to graduate\r\nschool junctions in the academic pipeline. Over the period of the ALSAMP Phase IV award, these\r\nprograms will be sustained and institutionalized. The ALSAMP program sustainability is divided into\r\ntwo parts; undergraduate student programs and BD student programs. Undergraduate student programs\r\ninclude scholarship support, mentors, research conferences and graduate school preparation activities.\r\nBD student programs include fellowship and other support. Details on how each partner institution will\r\nsustain the project on their campus as well as how alliance-wide programs and the BD programs will be\r\nsustained are included in the proposal. These efforts will include SREB, the Ford Foundation, the NSF\r\nAlliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate and others.\r\nIntellectual Merit - The project is an important step in advancing knowledge and understanding of the\r\nfactors involved in assisting minority students in the attainment of baccalaureate degrees in science\r\ntechnology, engineering and mathematics and bridging the gap between college and graduate school. In\r\naddition, important knowledge on the process for achieving sustainability will be provided as a model for\r\nother similar projects. The project results will add to the knowledge base in educational and evaluation.\r\nBroader Impacts - The project broadens the participation of underrepresented groups by the inclusion of a\r\nlarge number of minority students in the target population for the program. In addition, a large number of\r\nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities are included in the Alabama alliance, and the project efforts will\r\ninvolve a diverse pool of students and faculty. Discovery and understanding are advanced by the\r\ncollaboration between disciplines and institutions. Evaluation and assessment findings will be documented\r\nand disseminated to other researchers in education and at national meetings.",

The dialogue involved NSF personnel, presidents, faculty, staff and students from both community colleges and four-year institutions, and principal investigators from the NSF LSAMP Program.  The workshop resulted in the establishment of signed partnership agreements between each ALSAMP institution and a corresponding Alabama community college.\n\nInternational Activities\n\nALSAMP students have and continue to participate in many international research activities through study abroad programs, exchange programs and research conferences.\n\nRyan Devon Lang, an Oakwood University student, conducted maternal/infant global health research in Amman, Jordan in the summer of 2010.  Candace Watson, a UAB BD Fellow, presented an engineering research paper in Xi\u00c6an, Shaanxi, China in 2010.      BD Fellows Jaquice D. Hughes, TaShundra Robinson and Candace Watson were selected to participate in the UAB Study Broad Program in Egypt.
