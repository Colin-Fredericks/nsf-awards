Vertically aligned nano-wires with specific periodicities (minimum size ~50-100 nm) will be fabricated on various substrates (e.g., Silicon and Pyrex). The nano-structured substrate will be clamped on a heater for performing pool boiling experiments using per-fluorocarbon fluids. The pool boiling heat fluxes on the ordered nano-structured surfaces will be measured and compared with those on atomic smooth surfaces (e.g., polished Silicon). \r\nIntellectual Merit: Previously the Principal Investigator and other research groups reported ~30-350% enhancement in pool boiling heat fluxes using randomly localized and vertically aligned Carbon Nanotube \"forests\" that were coated on heaters. Potential factors responsible for enhancement were found to be: (1) the height; (2) the enhanced surface area (\"nano-fins\"); and (3) the higher thermal conductivity of the Carbon Nanotubes. The data from the boiling experiments in this project will be used to estimate the relative contribution to total heat flux from the different factors (e.g., geometry, material thermo-physcial properties, etc.). \r\nBroader Impacts: The boiling experiments will be used to gain insights into the micro/nano-scale transport mechanisms in pool boiling and help the Principal Investigator to establish a novel research program for future career development. The potential applications are in development of more efficient thermal management techniques (e.g., electronic cooling, novel heat pipes, biotechnology, etc.).  This program will train a skilled work force in nanofabrication and cooling technologies - by involving graduate and undergraduate student researchers. Broader participation by members of the society will involve school educators, underprivileged and minority students. The Principal Investigator will teach undergraduate courses and develop new graduate courses (in fluid mechanics, heat transfer, multi-phase flows and nanotechnology). The Principal Investigator will incorporate the research results as additional contents into these courses. The experimental apparatus will be used as a demonstration module for students and will also enhance the infrastructure of Texas A&M University in emerging technologies.\r\n\r\n",
