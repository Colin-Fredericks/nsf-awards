These trends come hand in hand with the rapidly  decreasing cost and shrinking physical  size of radio interfaces. It  is now technically and  economically feasible to  put  several  radio  transmitters/receivers  in  a single wireless network  node.   This  creates   an  environment   where  the  network effectively has multiple physical  layers. This is expected  to become ubiquitous in the future. While the technical possibility of  multiple physical layers is already quite clear today, it is much less  obvious how can this opportunity  be efficiently utilized to  gain significant improvement    in    the    network    performance.   Or,   from   the practical/economical point of view, the ultimate question is: will the multiple  physical  layer  (multi-radio)  network  development lead to sufficient performance improvement that justifies the investment?\r\n\r\nIn this research project  the investigators develop and  analyze novel mathematical methods  that can  can quantify  the network  performance gain that is obtained via multiple physical layers. Specifically,  the investigators  model  the   network  topology  with   an  edge-labeled multigraph. This model  offers surprisingly richer  opportunities than the traditional  graph model.  Using this  approach, the investigators study the following main areas:  (1) quantifying  the multi-radio  gain in the network topology; (2) new  algorithmic problems at the  network layer; (3) new issues in network  reliability; and (4) modeling and  choosing routes in a mobile environment (5) experimental validation of the results via a testbed built in the project.\r\n",
