 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a program for advancement in the representation\r\ntheory of commutative Noetherian local rings.  The study of maximal\r\nCohen--Macaulay modules over such rings has grown out of the theory of\r\nrepresentations of Artin algebras, which has developed sophisticated\r\ntheoretical techniques for classifying and characterizing module\r\ntheories of non-commutative Artinian rings.  Classical problems from\r\nthe non-commutative theory can often be stated directly in the\r\ncommutative higher-dimensional framework, and this framework comes\r\nequipped with its own unique problems, specialized machinery, and\r\ndeep, powerful connections with algebraic geometry.  The interplay\r\nbetween the two areas has been exceptionally productive for both.\r\nHowever, many of the most powerful tools of the Artinian arsenal are\r\nessentially noncommutative, in that they produce noncommutative rings\r\neven from commutative input, restricting their use in commutative\r\nalgebra.  Recent theoretical advances in non-commutative algebraic\r\ngeometry have begun to provide methods, including the notion of a\r\nnon-commutative resolution of singularities, similar to those provided\r\nby classical algebraic geometry. Describing these non-commutative\r\nresolutions in terms of tools from the Artinian theory will allow the\r\npowerful tools of that area to be brought to bear on fundamental\r\nconjectures about the maximal Cohen--Macaulay modules over\r\nCohen--Macaulay local rings.\r\n\r\nThis project lies at the intersection of the areas of commutative and\r\nnon-commutative algebra, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry.  The\r\nclassical aim of commutative algebra is to describe the solution sets\r\nof systems of polynomial equations by associating to them algebraic\r\ngadgets known as rings.  Non-commutative algebra, on the other hand,\r\nhas developed theory for associating rings to directed graphs, also\r\ncalled quivers.  The synergy among these topics has enriched all four\r\nsubjects, and has led to applications in such varied fields as\r\nrobotics, statistics, cryptography, and particularly theoretical\r\nphysics.\r\n",
