 "awd_abstract_narration": "0601631\r\nUnlu\r\n\r\nThis award supports international research experience for students in a project by a team of scientists from Boston University (BU) led by the PI, Dr. Selim Unlu, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in collaboration with Dr. Irsadi Aksun, Electrical Engineering Department, Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey and Dr. Yusuf Leblebici, Electrical Engineering Department, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. The research focus is on applications of optical resonance to biosensing and imaging. The general approach is based on utilizing resonance to dramatically increase the stored optical energy density and thus enhance the interaction with the biological specimens bound on solid surfaces.  They will focus on three specific projects based on resonance enhancement in biosensing and imaging. Ring resonators have demonstrated Q~107 and higher in systems where the precise number of optical waves fit around in a 'whispering gallery' mode leading to development of highly sensitive compact platforms. Wavelength tuning spectroscopy of transmission in parallel Fabry-Perot cavities allows for sensitive label-free sensing of many thousands of independent features (or binding events) simultaneously. Spectral interference (or resonance) of fluorescent emission allow for sub-nm determination of position over a reflective surface. The goal to make ultra-sensitive and ultra-small devices in biological applications will build upon established interdisciplinary strengths at BU in photonics, biomedical engineering, physics, and computation.  The BU research team has expertise in optical design, instrumentation and characterization as well as biotechnology. The projects will benefit from the expertise of the international partners in (1) detailed physical modeling (Prof. Aksun at Koc University, Istanbul), (2) device and wafer fabrication (Prof. Ozbay at Bilkent U. in Ankara and Prof. Ionescu at EPFL, Lausanne) and (3) custom analog/digital circuit design (Prof. Leblebici at EPFL, Lausanne) as well as a combination of laboratories and complimentary infrastructure. Five PhD students will be supported per year acquiring international experience during the course of the project where each student is expected to spend 3 months overseas.  Success in the project will mean sustainable organizational structure both here and with the international partners to inspire a new generation of scientists to instill global research and education into their basic philosophical approach to scientific inquiry.  \r\nIntellectual merit: Proposed IRES program will combine expertise from Turkish and Swiss institutions together with scientists from Boston University to solve difficult problems in resonant optical structures for biological sensing and imaging. The PIs will develop the intellect of a large cadre of graduate students into a new breed of scientists whose core philosophy includes global scientific and technological interactions. \r\nBroader impact: The broad impact of will be in its long-term focus on developing a sustainable model and infrastructure for international collaborations in research and education. The expected scientific output of our research in biosensors and biological imaging will have significant impact in a variety of scientific disciplines from basic research on DNA conformation to DNA and protein micro-arrays and to bio-toxin detection. Many of these scientific outcomes have significant societal implications. Finally, the program will have broader impact through focused attention on recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities and women and in connecting students with a global perspective with outreach programs for women in engineering and teachers in underserved local schools through GK-12 projects.\r\n",
