 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Houston is awarded a grant to characterize and classify errors in multiple sequence alignment and to devise tools and protocols through which alignment errors and uncertainties can be accounted for and properly managed. Multiple sequence alignment is the most basic representation of evolutionary and functional relationships among homologous molecular sequences. It is the starting point of almost all analyses that involve sequence comparisons, such as derivation of genetic distances, identification of homologous sites, phylogenetic reconstruction, and identification of exons, introns, and alternative splicing sites, as well as prediction of three-dimensional structures of proteins from homology. Particular attention will be paid to the effects of multiple alignment errors in the context of phylogenetic reconstructions. The practical effects of alignment-error management will be assessed on real databases and real phylogenetic problems. \r\n\r\nThis project will generate new tools and protocols that can be used to improve the data on which many working hypotheses are based. All software, data, and protocols will be made freely available. This project will also help in the training of graduate and undergraduate students in scientific research, and every student will be encouraged to attend scientific meetings to present their findings. The training of students at the University of Houston is particularly significant since UH is one of the most racially and ethnically diverse research campuses in the US. The inter-disciplinary nature of the project will promote collaborations within and outside our laboratory between biologists, computer scientists, statisticians, mathematicians, and physicists, and these interactions will strengthen an emerging graduate program in Mathematical and Computational Biology at the University of Houston.  \r\n",
