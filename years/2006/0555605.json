 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in theoretical elementary particle physics \r\nM/Superstring Theory provides us with the only known consistent framework for reconciling quantum mechanics with Einstein's theory of\r\nfocused on M/Superstring Theory and related supergravity theories. The gravity and is a promising candidate for a successful unified theory of all interactions including gravity. At certain low energy regimes M/Superstring Theory can be effectively described by supergravity theories. However currently the physical as well as mathematical underpinnings of M/Superstring theory are not well understood. The aim of this project is to solve some of the outstanding problems in this field towards the eventual goal of finding a non-perturbative formulation of M/Superstring theory that can explain the universe around us. Symmetry principles underlie all of modern physics.\r\nHence some of the methods developed and the results obtained in this\r\nresearch will have applications in other areas of theoretical physics as well as in mathematics. Graduate students will be involved in the research. \r\n\r\n",
