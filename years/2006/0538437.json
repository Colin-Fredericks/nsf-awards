 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThis work is advancing the understanding of the long-term strength of faults, lower crust, and upper mantle within the plate boundary zone of Western North America. Constraints on the long-term frictional resistance to steady sliding on active faults holds information on processes that affect earthquake rupture and the seismic cycle in general, such as dynamic weakening mechanisms, the role of pore pressure, and the role of intrinsic weakness, such as fault gauge. Observationally constrained kinematic and dynamic models of western North America are being refined using the Quaternary Fault database and GPS velocities as a constraint. The long-wavelength components of the GPS data are being used to help constrain the long-term deformation field, while the transient signal is filtered out. Moreover, the no-length-change directions in the Quaternary Fault database, along with fault style and slip vector directions, are being used to help constrain the long-term deformation field for latest Quaternary in western North America. The long-term estimates of the directions of principal axes and relative magnitudes of principal axes (style of faulting) for the rates of strain provide a proxy for orientation and style of deviatoric stress field responsible for such deformation. Dynamic models are constrained by topography, gravity, seismically defined crustal thicknesses and densities, heat flow, as well as the observations important for global mantle circulation models, such as tomography and history of subduction. Given these dynamic models, significant advances are being made on the constraints of long-term frictional behavior of faults because (1) the absolute magnitudes of vertically integrated deviatoric stresses acting within the brittle crust and the lithosphere are quantified and (2) a general approach is applied that accounts for the dramatic change in fault mechanisms observed across the plate boundary zone.  Furthermore, hypotheses are being tested using a general three-dimensional model that properly deals with lateral strength anisotropy, lateral variations in strength profile characteristics, and non-uniform layer thicknesses resulting from topography on the surface and the Moho. The  grant  will be used to support the Ph.D. research of Stony  Brook graduate student Elliot Klein.  This work is providing further support  for  the  mentoring  of  REU  undergraduates  who  participate  in development  of  visualization  tools  for understanding the plate boundary zone in western North America. These visualization tools will be displayed on  the interactive web site maintained at UNAVCO (http://jules.unavco.org/).  Moreover,  this  research  is  further  supporting activities to update\r\n\r\nexisting  models on the ILP's Global Strain Rate Map (GSRM) interactive web site,  used  for  both teaching and research (www.world-strain-map.org). In addition, this work is providing infrastructural support for broadening and enriching  the  activities of a graduate student, Daniel Hernandez, from an underrepresented  group.  The  proposed  work  is  basic research.  It will\r\n\r\nadvance  fundamental  knowledge about the long-term strength of faults, and it  holds  implications for fault mechanics and even the earthquake rupture energy  budget  and earthquake cycle. However, the contributions we make to the younger generation are of societal benefit in itself.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n",
