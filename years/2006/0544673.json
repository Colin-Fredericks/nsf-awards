 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantile regression, as introduced in Koenker and Bassett (1978), is gradually evolving\r\ninto a comprehensive approach to the analysis of statistical models for univariate response.\r\nBy supplementing the exclusive focus of least-squares-based methods on the estimation\r\nof conditional mean functions with a general approach to estimating conditional quantile\r\nfunctions, it expands the scope of both parametric and non-parametric statistical methods.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact of the Proposed Research: Since Quetelets work in the 19th century\r\nsocial science has iconified the average man, that hypothetical man without qualities who\r\nis comfortable with his head in the oven, and his feet in a bucket of ice. Conventional\r\nstatistical methods, since Gauss, seek to estimate the effects of policy treatments on this\r\naverage man. But such effects are often quite diverse: medical treatments may improve\r\nlife expectancy, but also impose serious short term risks; reducing class sizes in schools\r\nmay improve academic performance for good students, but not help weaker ones. Quantile\r\nregression methods helps to explore these heterogeneous effects\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposed Research: Koenker (2005a) offers a comprehensive\r\nview of the current state of play, but inevitably any such monograph constitutes no more\r\nthan an interim progress report. This proposal sketches several prospective research topics\r\nthat the PI would like to explore over the next three years Among these include:\r\n1. Penalty methods play an increasingly important role in non-parametric statistics. With\r\nthe notable exception of some recent work in image processing, virtually all of this work\r\nemploys L2 roughness penalties and related Hilbertian machinery. But a compelling case\r\ncan be made for complementary methods based on total variation roughness penalties for\r\nfunctions in spaces of bounded variation. Such !1 penalties are better suited to estimating\r\nfunctions with sharply defined features. In addition to continuing work on nonparametric\r\nregression, the PI anticipates a major effort directed toward density estimation.\r\n2. Panel data methods in econometrics are still predominantly the provence of Gaussian\r\nrandom effects models, however there is often a strong motivation in applications for also\r\nestimating conditional quantile models. Growth curve data is a leading example in biostatistics,\r\nand program evaluation offers numerous examples in econometrics. Expanding upon\r\nthe close relationship between random effects estimation and penalty methods in Gaussian\r\nsettings, research is proposed on a penalty approach to quantile regression estimation for\r\nlongitudinal data.\r\n3. Although there is already quite an extensive literature on quantile regression methods\r\nfor time-series, most of the attention has focused on models in which lagged response exert\r\na pure location shift effect on the distribution of the current response. With Zhijie Xiao,\r\nthe PI has begun to investigate more general specifications, focusing initially on a class of\r\nmodels that exhibit some features of persistent random-walk behavior, while also exhibiting\r\na sporadic form of mean reversion. The PI believes that these models offer considerable potential\r\nfor broadening the scope of applied time series analysis.\r\n4. Estimation of mean effects in linear structural models with endogonous covariates lies at\r\nthe foundation of econometrics as a discipline. Significant progress has been made in recent\r\nyears to expand the scope of such models to incorporate heterogeneous treatment effects.\r\nBuilding on work of Chesher (2003), Koenker and Ma (2005) compare two approaches\r\nto quantile regression for recursive structural models; expanding this inquiry from both\r\ntheoretical and empirical perspectives would be highly desirable.",
