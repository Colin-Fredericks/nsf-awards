The development of an understanding of the fundamental reactivity of new functional groups, examination of new systems for molecular layer deposition, and the investigation of the interactions between organic ligands and metal atoms at the semiconductor surface are being pursued in this work.  Vacuum deposition methods, coupled with careful spectroscopic characterization of the modified layers is used in this work.  Applications to molecular electronics, biosensors, and MEMS devices are likely to develop from this fundamental science.  Students across a broad range of disciplines are involved in these studies.  \r\n\r\nThe robust and reproducible attachment of organic molecules with myriad functionalities to semiconductor surfaces impacts a broad range of interesting technologies.  The work of Professor Bent and her colleagues at Stanford attempts to develop a detailed understanding of this attachment process and to develop new routes to silicon surface functionalization.  The fundamental knowledge gained from these studies will impact molecular electronics fabrication, bio-sensor development, and micro-electromechanical device construction.  Students across a broad range of disciplines are involved in these studies. \r\n",
