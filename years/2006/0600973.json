 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThis project will deal with a variety of algebraic objects that have\r\narisen recently in different areas such as Hopf algebra theory,\r\ncombinatorial representation theory,\r\nthe theory of operads, free probability theory, and renormalization theory\r\nin mathematical physics. It should be regarded as an extension of the \r\nclassical work on the theory of free Lie algebras and its interplay \r\nwith the representation theory of the symmetric group.\r\nThrough the eyes of operad theory, the objects we deal with are free \r\nalgebras of various kinds. Addressing this property is fundamental in \r\nunderstanding the role\r\nplayed by these objects in the other theories.\r\nFreeness is also responsible for the rich combinatorics exhibited by these\r\nobjects. Part of the goal of the project is to make the algebraic \r\nstructure as explicit as possible, which often leads to interesting \r\ncombinatorial constructions.\r\nConversely, the project will make use of algebraic properties to unify \r\nand generalize important constructions in combinatorics.\r\nSome of these free algebras have found\r\napplications in free probability theory, while others are at the basis of\r\nrenormalization theory. All of them are closely related to symmetric functions\r\nand the representation theory of the symmetric group. A common feature is the\r\nexistence of Hopf algebraic structures, which are often also free in one sense\r\nor another. Exploiting this structure is another central feature of the \r\nproject.\r\n\r\nCombinatorics provides a tool for handling subtle algebraic structures.\r\nUnderstanding these structures is important in various areas of recent \r\ninterest\r\nboth in pure mathematics (free probability theory, representation \r\ntheory) as well as in mathematical physics (renormalization theory).\r\nThis project plans to deepen our understanding of the rich combinatorics\r\nunderlying various free algebraic structures.\r\nThe PI will introduce graduate students to this area of research and make\r\ninternational contacts and collaborations in Europe, Latin America, and India.\r\n\r\n",
