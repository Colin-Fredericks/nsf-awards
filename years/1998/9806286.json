To provide information for the study  committee, the advice of the broader scientific community  will be sought.  Several National Research Council (NRC)  units will identify and prioritize up to three important  challenges, based on criteria they identify. Professional  societies will also be consulted.  The study committee,  based on information provided, will organize a workshop to  discuss the most important grand challenges in the  environment. A report will be issued by the end of 1999.  The report will articulate a clear and credible intellectual  foundation for the next two to three decades of basic  research into the earth's environment and the life that it  supports.  The small number of research opportunities chosen  are expected to further understanding of the most  fundamental processes that control life and the environment  on earth and constitute the best opportunities for  substantial research progress.    The scope of the study will be broad, as indicated by the  NRC Boards that will provide input: Environmental Studies  and Toxicology, Water Science and Technology, Ocean Studies,  Biology, Agriculture, Earth Sciences and Resources, Polar  Research, Atmospheric Sciences and Climate, Chemical  Sciences and Technology, Sustainable Development, Human  Dimensions of Global Change, and Ecosystems.  The National  Academy of Engineering will also be involved.  The study  committee will be overseen by a group formed from the  various NRC commissions in areas of physical sciences,  mathematics, behavioral and social sciences, education,  geosciences, environment and resources, engineering and  technical systems, life sciences and agriculture.  Interdisciplinary opportunities will be emphasized  throughout the process.",
