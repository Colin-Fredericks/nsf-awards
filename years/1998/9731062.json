Research on eclipsing binary star systems provides the only data on the mass of other stars, and the majority of data on their radii.  The variations in the observed light during eclipses yields these important basic parameters.  In addition, differences between the times of the predicted and observed eclipses can be used to determine the internal constitution of stars as well as interesting effects of general relativity.    Mira variable stars, on the other hand, are single stars that intrinsically vary in brightness and color due to pulsation in radius and temperature.  The exact mechanisms for this pulsation are still not completely understood.    This project is to upgrade an existing telescope by installing a new detector--a CCD camera.  The camera will be used with special filters that will allow observers to obtain brightness measurements of variable stars throughout their orbit or phase variations.  For observations of  the Mira variable stars, the camera will provide photometric imaging with nearly simultaneous spectrographic data acquisition on the telescope.  For the eclipsing binary work, the new camera will allow data to be obtained that is of better quality than previously obtained.  Data may also be acquired on nights where thin clouds or other variations in atmospheric transparency prevent use of older, photoelectric techniques.    The CCD camera will capture electronic images of the field of stars being studied.  These images are saved on computer disk files and later studied with special image processing software.  The brightness of the variable star is determined by comparing the data to data from  other stars of constant brightness in the same image.  The measurements made through different color filters will provide information on the color, and thus the temperature of the stars.    The upgrade to the telescope will also i nclude the installation of an automated instrument selector to allow rapid redirection of the telescope beam to either the spectrograph, the new CCD camera, or a visual eyepiece.  This will allow rapid changeovers between spectroscopy and imaging modes, and will help preserve the quality of the instruments by minimizing equipment removal and installations.  It will also facilitate the remote operation of the telescope from a climate-controlled room, providing a safer and more comfortable environment for the observers.    The project will involve undergraduate students in all phases of the work (data acquisition, reduction, analysis, and publications).  The new equipment will allow more students to participate in exciting and fundamental scientific research.  ***",
