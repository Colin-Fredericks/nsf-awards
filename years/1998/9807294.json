The work at Penn  State would focus on glass surfaces, which will complement the research  currently performed at Alfred University on glass and glass manufacturing.  Research on glass surfaces is of interest because the surface of a  manufactured glass product often dictates many of the properties important  to such products, including strength, corrosion, weathering resistance,  cleanliness, scratch resistance, and optical reflectivity.  Additionally,  glass products may be mated or bonded to other materials such as deposited  thin films for solar control and metal coatings for optics.  During  manufacturing, the surface of the glass must withstand a variety of chemical  and physical properties for cleaning, etching, polishing and plasma  treatments.  Thus, an understanding of glass surfaces and interfaces is  essential to both the science and technology of glass.",
