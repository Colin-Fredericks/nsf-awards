 "awd_abstract_narration": "U.V. Effects on Marine Production by Bacteria and Phytoplankton:  Assessing  the Impact of UVB.  Ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 290-400 nm) from the sun penetrates to  significant depths in many marine environments and a variety of studies  have indicated its ecological importance. Stratospheric ozone depletion is  changing the spectral composition of solar LTVR to varying degrees in  different locations by increasing levels of biologically harmful, short  wavelength UVB (290-320 nm). Previous work has shown that both UVB and the  longer wavelength UVA (320-400 nm) affect marine carbon cycling, primarily  through effects on phytoplankton and bacterioplankton which comprise the  base of oceanic food webs. While phytoplankton are responsible for carbon  fixation, bacterioplankton play a vital role in the mineralization of  nutrients and provide a trophic link to higher organisms. Assessing the  impact of UV on these processes during variations in ozone and water  transparency requires accurate knowledge of spectral dependence. This  dependence is described by a biological weighting function (BWF).  Significant effort has been devoted in the last two decades to resolving  BWFs for biological processes controlling rates of primary production in  aquatic environments (i.e. photoinhibition). Compared to reports of UV  effects on phytoplankton, however, studies of the impact and effects of UVR  on bacterioplankton are in their relative infancy. Previous work with  bacterioplankton has been limited to broad spectrum analysis (i.e. UVA vs.  UVB). Unfortunately, such limited spectral resolution precludes prediction,  particularly of the effects of increased UVB due to ozone depletion. The  principal goal of this project is to develop biological weighting functions  for inhibition of bacterioplankton production using DNA, RNA, and protein  synthesis as representative biological processes. Biological weighting  functions for inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis will be  determined for diverse marine environments (Chesapeake Bay and Gulf of  Mexico) using polychromatic light regimes and compared to similar functions  measured for phytoplankton. Models will be developed and compared to in  situ measurements of production and examined for significant disparities.  Experiments with pre- and post- fractionated samples will indicate how  bacterioplankton coupling influences UV responses. Time series assays will  define how response is related to exposure and whether damage is  counteracted by photoreactivation. This study will increase our  understanding of the spectral sensitivity of natural assemblages of  bacterioplankton in diverse environments and of the role of UVR in  controlling marine ecosystems with particular reference to increased UVB  associated with stratospheric ozone depletion.",
