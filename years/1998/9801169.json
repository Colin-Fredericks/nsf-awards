 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9801169  Connell    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will manufacture a 4 meter aperture membrane and demonstrate that the as-manufactured accuracy of the membrane can in fact be improved to the micron range by figuring on an array of adjusters.  The development of a lightweight, thermally stable reflecting surface for large radio wave telescopes and Ka-band ground segment antennas would greatly improve performance of these instruments.  In the Phase I study, the feasibility of designing, fabricating, and figuring a reflective surface consisting of a single-piece carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) membrane for an 8 meter aperture millimeter wave radio telescope was established.  Although the technology under investigation in the Phase I study was somewhat general in nature, the antenna proposed for the U.S. National Radio Astronomy Observatory's (NRAO) Millimeter Array was used as the model system.  Achieving this objective will require further development of key support technologies that will be generally applicable to the design and manufacture of any size membrane. These technologies include: refined design/analysis approach, manufacture of accurate plaster tooling, proof of a CFRP backup structure concept, and resin infusion molding capability.    Potential commercial applications of this research include radio telescope applications in the millimeter wave portion of the spectrum where low mass, high precision, thermal stability, environmental endurance, and low cost are important factors.  Currently, the American, European, and Japanese radio astronomy communities all have plans to build millimeter wavelength radio telescopes, each consisting of an array of 40 to 60 large antennae.  In addition to radio astronomy, the ground segment antennae of Ka-Band communication satellite systems are also candidates for this technology.  The FCC is currently overwhelmed with requests from commercial and military sources to utilize the millimeter wave portions of the  spectrum, making it likely that this technology will find additional commercial application outside of radio astronomy.  ***",
