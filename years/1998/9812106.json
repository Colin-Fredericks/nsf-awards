The  original  consolidation theory for fine-grained soils cannot predict  the  influence of creep deformations that occur under constant  effective  stress levels.  This has led to significant practical  problems,  including difficulty in predicting field consolidation  settlements  based on laboratory tests.  It has also led to research and  debate on  the nature of creep during consolidation.  One hypothesis  predicts no  influence of creep deformations until after all loading-  induced pore  water pressures are dissipated; the other hypothesis  includes creep  throughout the consolidation process.  There are substantial  data and  prominent researchers supporting each of the two theories,  but little  agreement between them.    This research will investigate the validity of a  consolidation model  that can potentially unify the two hypotheses and explain  both sets of  apparently conflicting data.  This research is not aimed at  proving one  of the hypotheses, but toward measuring the contribution of  each  consolidation component (due to pore pressure dissipation  and due to  creep) to the overall behavior.    The research will be executed through a partnership between  Northeastern University and the University of Massachusetts-  Amherst.  The UMASS- Amherst partner will obtain high quality block  samples of  four natural soils, each with its own particular structure,  and will  perform short- and long-term conventional, incrementally  loaded tests  to evaluate creep behavior and conventional consolidation  parameters.  At Northeastern, a computer-automated, specially  instrumented  consolidation cell was developed under a prior NSF award.  This device  will be used to perform controlle d gradient tests with  feedback  provided by mid-specimen pore pressure probes.  ***",
