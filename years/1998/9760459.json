 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9760459  Geng    This Small Business Innovation Research (Sbir) Phase I project will explore a new means for rapid generation of three dimensional (3D) data for parts to be prototyped.  Although many rapid prototyped (RP) parts can be produced from CAD drawings, the capability of directly digitizing 3D physical objects is needed in certain RP applications, in which parts must be fabricated to fit irregular shapes of 3D objects, e.g., certain parts of human body or teeth.  Conventional methods of measuring complex 3D shapes are usually time-consuming, complicated, highly interactive, and require expert knowledge.  Thus, the time of a RP iteration cycle is driven by the digitizing of a 3D model and generating an adequate 3D data file.  Phase 1 SBIR will study a high speed 3D camera (that can acquire a full frame 3D image of an object at a rate of 30 frames per second) and an ultra-precision RP machine.  The high-speed 3D imaging technique will be combined with an ultra-precision droplet deposition ink jet RP technique for realistic dental office environments.  3D dental images will be acquired, and dental parts will be produced in real-time with sub-millimeter to micro-sized features.    Applications of this integrated RP concept include rapid dental treatment in the digital dental office.  By this technology a new generation of RP dental instruments is expected that can rapidly fabricate dental implants, caps, crowns,and bridges in a dentist's office.    ***",
