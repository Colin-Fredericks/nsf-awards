Dr. Schmeeckle will work with Dr.  Hitoshi Baba, General Director, CERI, on a research project  entitled \"Turbulence Structure and Sediment-transport Field  Near a Flow Obstruction at the Bed of a Hydraulically Rough  Turbulent Boundary Layer.\"    The scour of sediment from around river structures during  flood is a major engineering concern.  Such scour can lead  to the loss of the structure or expensive repairs.  Unfortunately, the prediction of scour is often based on  empirical methods with little physical understanding, and  even scale models are difficult because it is nearly  impossible to accurately scale both the flow and sediment  transport fields simultaneously.  Previous physically based  sediment transport models only considered mean flow  conditions in simplified turbulence fields and performed  poorly in complex flow conditions such as around river  structures.  In this study a newly developed model, which  directly couples the instantaneous near-bed velocity to the  sediment transport field, will be applied to the case of  flow around a cylindrical pier.  To accomplish this goal,  high-frequency measurements of near-bed velocities around  the pier will be collected.  These velocity measurements  will then be used to drive the sediment transport model, and  the sediment transport will in turn be used to predict the  evolution of the scour profile around the cylinder.  Successful completion of this project will result in a  physically based understanding of scour around river  structures.  ***",
