 "awd_abstract_narration": "Silverberg  9805854  The research is in the fields of Number Theory and Arithmetic Algebraic Geometry, with a focus on abelian varieties and Shimura varieties. The questions to be studied concern f-adic representations, adelic representations, ranks of elliptic curves, fields of definition, fields of moduli, and torsion points on abelian varieties.  Silverberg will use a POWRE grant to be a Visiting Professor at the University of California at Berkeley. This will contribute positively to her research, career advancement, visibility, and professional growth.  Abelian varieties and Shimura varieties are important mathematical objects which arise in a wide variety of areas, and were used in Faltings' proof of the Mordell Conjecture and in Wiles' proof of the Semistable ShimuraTaniyama Conjecture. Arithmetic Algebraic Geometry is a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of Mathematics: Number Theory and Algebraic Geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful, having recently solved problems that withstood generations. Among the many applications are new error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks. Number Theory and Algebraic Geometry have found numerous applications in data transmission and processing, communication systems, physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.",
