 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Brian M. Hoffman, Chemistry Department, Northwestern University, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program of the Chemistry Division for a collaborative project with Dr.   Anthony G. M. Barrett, Chemistry Department, Imperial College of Science   and Technology, London, England, aimed at synthesis and study of star   porphyrazines, solitaire phthalocyanines and related multimetallic   macrocycles. A series of porphyrazines that are peripherally substituted   with heteroatoms will be synthesized. These will be converted into   complexes with metals bound to the peripheral heteroatoms and to the core   of the central macrocycle. Extended arrays will be formed by connecting   several of the metalla-porphyrazine units through peripheral metal   bridges. The resultant complexes will have unusual spectroscopic,   magnetic, or electrical properties properties due to electron   delocalization and metal-metal interactions through the macrocyclic   pi-system.      Compounds which contain several metals often have unique magnetic and   electronic properties. In this project a series of such materials will be   prepared. The specific design involves a central metal which is   surrounded by a rigid structure of other atoms (a macrocyclic ligand) to   which additional metals are attached. This results in star-shaped or   linear arrays of metal atoms. These are expected to have a diversity of   applications including biomedical optical imaging, optical sensors, the   separation of chiral substances, and catalysis. The project involves the   collaboration between a group in England, where the macrocylic ligands   will be prepared, and one at Northwestern University, which will be   responsible for the conversion of the ligands into metal complexes.   Students will be exchanged between the groups and thus will receive an   extremely broad training in synthetic organic and metal chemistries. The   collaboration also provides the opportunity for US students to experience   the international aspects of modern science.",
