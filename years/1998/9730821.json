In August 1996, Congress passed the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program that profoundly alters the legal status of poor families, ending the federal guarantee of case assistance and shifting welfare's fundamental purpose from that of assuring income to transforming welfare recipients to workers.  Yet, formal provisions of law do not fully define welfare rights or settle rights questions.  They establish new boundaries within which struggles over the elaboration, interpretation, and production of practical legal meaning occur as law is translated into actions.  Practical legal meaning refers to law as it is produced by the public bureaucracies that implement and interpret law:  the politics of informal lawmaking.  This research seeks to understand the bureaucratic construction of legal meaning, the factors that shape it, and its substantive implications for the rights of the poor under new welfare law.  The study uses field interviewing and observation  in four welfare offices in Chicago.  The offices are categorized to represent differences in caseload demographics, location, caseload size, and the research sites then  randomly selected .  Patterns of practice and social explanations of behavior will be used to test theories of the development and implementation of informal legal meaning.  %%%  Welfare law substantially affects the scope and content of rights accorded to poor families, both a claimant on the state and a citizens subject of state protection.
