 "awd_abstract_narration": "9760474  Carlberg  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and utilize advanced transgenic genetic engineering methods to produce striped bass fingerlings with traits favorable production in culture systems common in the U.S.  Desired traits include accelerated growth and increased resistance to bacterial disease. Phase I will first introduce a marker gene (foreign genetic information that can be readily identified) and then introduce foreign genetic material that will confer upon fish the desired traits.  If this succeeds, Phase I will develop the required supporting culture and fish breeding technology to take advantage of fingerlings possessing the new traits.  Every major review of U.S. aquaculture describes the critical need for improved seed stock methodologies if this new industry is to expand.  The introduction of genes for expressing growth hormones and antimicrobial molecules in striped bass is a complex task, but the rewards could be significant.  Striped bass farming has exploded around the world, and although the primary markets are in the U.S., foreign products are easily delivered fresh anywhere in the country overnight.  Research on these methods is expected to buttress the industry against the rising global competition.",
