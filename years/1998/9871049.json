 "awd_abstract_narration": "9871049  Vali        Fundamental understanding of the characteristics of freezing nuclei is an  important problem for the atmospheric and other sciences.  The atmospheric science  community recognizes that the origins of ice in clouds is one of the major  uncertainties in the understanding of cloud processes.  Those processes in turn are the  most critical source of uncertainties in global models of the general circulation and the  water cycle.   In the biological arena, ice nucleation has been found to have  widespread importance.  Bacterial and fungal ice nuclei have been identified and it  has been shown that ice nucleation measurements can provide more effective ways  than microbiological tests for the identification of bacterial contaminants in food.  Ice  nuclei are being used in spray ice technology (including artificial snow making).   Prevention of frost damage to agricultural plants is possible via control of ice  nucleating bacteria on plants, and insect pest survival may be controlled similarly.          The new freezing nuclei apparatus that the  Principal Investigator will develop   has the potential to significantly enhance research activity in these areas, since the  unavailability of simple and reliable measurement methods has been frequently cited  by researchers as a serious problem.  This apparatus will provide a significant  improvement over the commonly used drop freezing method of determining the  activity of freezing nuclei in water. The principal advances provided by the new  instrument will be the preservation of sample integrity and a high degree of  reliability.  Sample integrity will be achieved by placing sub-samples in individual  sealed vials.  In this manner each sub-sample can be preserved through any desired  sequence of freezing or other tests without any serious limitation on duration.  This  same step also assures that there is no possibility of spurious spread of ice into the  sample which was a major limitation of earlier devices.         Successful develo pment of this instrument is expected to lead to new research  on freezing nucleation, in relation to atmospheric and biological ice formation  including better measurements of the effects of solutes, inhibitors, and activators; the  stability of nuclei; compositional analyses; the analyses of cloud and precipitation  samples; and the connection between biogenic and atmospheric ice nuclei.  Most of  these topics have been addressed in previous experiments but only statistical results  could be obtained, and some results remained in doubt because of shortcomings of  earlier instruments.   ***",
