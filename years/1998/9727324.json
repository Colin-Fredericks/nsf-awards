 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the studies of    Professor Richard Weiss on the effects of structural and/or electronic   anisotropy imposed by liquid crystals, polymers, and gels on guest   molecules.   Molecules with well-established spectral and photochemical   properties in fluid solution will be incorporated into these media, and   their reactivity in the different media compared to elucidate structural   and electronic influences imposed by the media.   Conversely, well   defined anisotropic environments will be employed to impose specific   influences on the guest thereby providing insights into the fundamental   factors affecting specific transformations within these constrictive   environments.   Undergraduate and graduate students involved in this   research will be exposed to a variety of photochemical, fast reaction and   spectroscopic techniques, and their application to materials   characterization.  With this Renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   supports the research and educational activities of Professor Richard   Weiss of Georgetown University.   Professor Weiss will focus his research   on elucidating the structural and electronic effects imposed by liquid   crystals, polymers, and gels on the photochemical reactivity of   incorporated molecules, called guests.   The local microenvironment   imposed by these materials influences the reactivity of the guest, and   changes in the reactivity of the guest, when compared to that in fluid   solution, offer unique insights into materials processing at the   molecular level.   The educational activities of Professor Weiss include   the training of graduate and undergraduate students in spectroscopy, fast   reaction techniques and materials characterization.",
