Unstable talus slopes and prolonged snow cover exclude plant establishment and soil development.  Almost nothing is known about the microbial life in these sites.\r\n\r\nIn this LExEn project, Steven Schmidt and Mark Williams will follow on from preliminary studies indicating that the microbial communities of talus slopes are composed of oligotrophic bacteria, but primary production is dominated by chemoautotrophs.  The PIs predict that reduced forms of iron and sulfur from rock weathering, and nitrogen from atmospheric deposition, to be the principal sources of energy for life in talus.  They will measure these factors, as well as organic and light energy inputs to the microbial communities.  They will also track the biogeochemical activity and population dynamics of functional groups, and test the ecophysiological limits of isolated organisms.  This integrative approach is facilitated at the chosen research site (upper reaches of Green Lakes Valley in the Colorado Front Range) by its proximity to nearby high altitude laboratories that allow frequent sample collecting and immediate sample processing.\r\n",
