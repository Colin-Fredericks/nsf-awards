 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802803  Boninsegni  This is a Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) Award  for a theoretical program consisting of numerical studies of  Helium physisorption.  Computer simulations of Helium  adsorbed on alkali surfaces and on graphite will be  performed using the Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) method.  Available, realistic interatomic potentials will be adopted  to model the interaction among Helium atoms, as well as  between Helium atoms and the substrate.    Specific objectives of the proposed research effort will be  the study of the physical properties of a 4He adsorbate on  the surface of alkali metals, as well as on a graphite  substrate.  The unifying theme of this research is the topic  of physisorption, of great interest in condensed matter  physics, and one where relatively little numerical  simulation has been performed so far.  This research is also  expected to offer novel insight into such fundamental  theoretical issues as phase transitions in reduced  dimensions and monolayer superfluidity.    The PIMC method is arguably the most powerful numerical tool  currently available to calculate thermodynamic properties of  quantum many-body systems directly from a microscopic  Hamiltonian.   The use of this technique in this research  can afford quantitative predictions for a variety of  adsorption phenomena involving differently attractive  substrates and a quantum adsorbate; thus, it will help in  the interpretation of several ongoing experiments involving  Helium adsorption.  %%%  This is a Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) Award  to support a program of numerical simulation of the  adsorption of Helium on various substrates including  graphite.  The numerical simulations will support a number  of experiments being done elsewhere.  The simulations will  also provide insight into phase transitions of adsorbates on  surfaces and on monolayer superfluidity.  ***",
