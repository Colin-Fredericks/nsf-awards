 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. William B. Euler of the Department of Chemistry, University of Rhode   Island, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic   Chemistry Program to study polymers of mixed-valence ruthenium azine   complexes.  This project involves the synthesis and characterization of   new ruthenium-polyazine based polymers in order to determine the role of   the metal in the electronic and charge-transfer properties of the   polymers.  Systems selected will incorporate the ruthenium center as part   of the conjugated electron-transfer pathway.  The charge-transfer   properties of the polymers will be modified by changing the length of the   oligoazine bridge portion of the polymer ligand and thus the distance   between ruthenium sites.  A theoretical model predicts that as the metal   sites become further apart, the coupling between metals will increase, up   to the limit of the conjugation length of the oligoazine.  Binuclear   ruthenium-oligoazine-ruthenium compounds will also be prepared and   studied as models for understanding this unusual predicted property of   the polymers.  All of the new materials will be studied by infrared,   nuclear magnetic resonance, and ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared   spectroscopies, cyclic voltammetry, and variable temperature electrical   conductivity measurements.  In this project the use of metal compounds appended to electrical   conducting polymers is expected to modify the polymer properties,   allowing for the creation of new nonlinear optical materials, catalysts,   and nanostructured materials.  The polymers to be studied will also help   in the fundamental understanding of the transfer of electrons through   proteins, an important problem in biological chemistry.",
