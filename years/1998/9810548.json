This subject is a central issue in the field of turbulence and is important in bringing mathematical modeling methods in closer harmony with nature.  Fifteen author groups of international recognition were invited to present their ideas on this subject in articles in the monograph.  The purpose of this symposium is to get this group of experts together again to discuss and critically review their ideas and the ideas of others.  Since publication of the monograph, all parties have had an opportunity to review the ideas of others.  Also, since the initial articles have been written, several groups have made significant progress and have new developments to report.  In addition to the original authors, four experts in turbulence have been invited to critique the monograph contributions and add their own ideas. A report will be prepared in the form  of a review article.  The review article will be made public in written form as a paper at a future national meeting of a scientific society.  ***",
