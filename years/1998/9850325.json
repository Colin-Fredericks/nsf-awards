 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Center for Biotechnology Education is creating a structure to enhance and expand biotechnology technician programs throughout the nation.   The National Center is working with six regional centers, baccalaureate institutions, high schools, national laboratories, and industry to accomplish a set of ambitious goals.   Each region is spearheading a specific element such as identifying and testing instructional materials; implementing new programs; identifying methods for recruiting and retaining underrepresented minorities; creating student assessment tools; linking to high schools and baccalaureate institutions; strengthening basic math, science, and critical thinking skills; and increasing work-based learning opportunities for students.   By relying on the expertise of individuals around the nation, the Center is addressing a wide range of issues.    The National Center will hold an annual ten-day Summer Intensive for 30 Fellows across the nation.   Each Regional Center will hold annual regional workshops for 30 participants in their region.   These professional development activities will include hands-on laboratory training; discussion of legal, ethical, and social issues; industry tours; and pedagogical tools to be used for students.   Each region will also identify paid instructor internships.   This regional approach will allow the Center to reach a wide range of instructors from across the nation.    In addition the Center is creating an on-line network that will provide the opportunity for all interested people to communicate.   Input can be received to evaluate materials, strategies, and issues.   In a rapidly changing field such as biotechnology, the ability to communicate quickly speeds the integration of new knowledge and materials into the curriculum.   The Center also makes use of the most advanced technologies to enhance student learning, such as multi-media programs, virtual learning and virtual libraries, CD-ROM materials, and distance learning.   The lasting effect i s to bring stimulating, cutting-edge, and practical educational programs to the students who will make up the nation's future workforce.",
