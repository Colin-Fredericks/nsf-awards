 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a first step in reform of its core undergraduate curriculum, the Department of Biological Sciences proposes a new thematic and discovery-based laboratory, \"Introduction to Inquiry,\" to illustrate the integration of biology sub disciplines in studying real-world problems. Objectives are to increase students' active participation in experimentation and their understanding of science as a process, not just a list of facts. Through links of faculty research expertise with experiments conducted in the laboratory, entry-level Biology Majors (sophomores) gain an appreciation for and an identify with their teachers as scientists creating new understandings of life processes. Course objectives are achieved with hypothesis-driven experiments centered around unifying themes, as illustrated with \"Stress in Biological Systems\". Beginning with skill-based modules, students learn theory and application of techniques needed to conduct research projects. In the second phase, students construct researchable hypotheses and select proper techniques for experimental designs. Working in teams, students choose topics to investigate and use a variety of literature databases to acquire background information. In the final module students conduct experiments to test hypotheses, analyze data, draw conclusions, explore alternate hypotheses, and develop written and oral reports. Students constructively critique the work of other groups, reinforcing science as a self evaluating process. To identify modifications necessary to teach this course to general majors, we will pilot the course first for honors students. Assessment of effectiveness in increasing understanding in biology, in retaining majors, and in stimulating entry into research will include : (1) senior performance on the Educational Testing Service Biology Exam (comparing these students with those who did not take the course) and (2) comparative tracking of student career paths. Successful experiments and assessment results will be submitted to The American B iology Teacher and the Association of Higher Education Assessment Forum.",
