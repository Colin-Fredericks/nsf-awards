 "awd_abstract_narration": "9730072  Chen       It has been known for some time that orography plays a substantial role in the   production of heavy rainfall.  Orographic induced flash floods are a problem world-  wide.  In 1987, the U.S. in conjunction with Taiwan executed a research project  aimed at investigating the dynamics of heavy rainfall in mountainous terrain.  This  project, known as the Taiwan Area Mesoscale Experiment (TAMEX) produced a  wealth of data which is being used to understand the interactions between  environmental and orographic induced flows and their impact on precipitation  production.       In this study, the Principal Investigator will continue analysis of TAMEX data  in conjunction with modeling studies using an advanced mesoscale numerical model.    Specific objectives include to investigate 1) the structure and dynamics of the barrier  jet along the northwestern coast of Taiwan under the pre-frontal southwesterly  monsoon flow; 2) the role of mesoscale convergence generated by the deflected  airflow and environmental flow on the occurrences of localized heavy rainfall along  the northwestern coast.  In addition, with the dense surface and rain gauge networks  that are already in place, the Principal Investigator will study the diurnal evolution of  island-scale airflow and rainfall distributions over the island.       Successful completion of this research should lead to a better understanding of   critical dynamical structures of orographic induced flash floods and may lead to better  forecasts of such life-threatening events.  ***",
