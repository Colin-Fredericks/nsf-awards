The support will fund travel  and related expenses for a group of US scientists,  postdoctoral scholars, and graduate students to discuss  research topics and technologies of mutual interest to US  and Mexican plant scientists.  Organizers are Dr. Joseph  Chappell, University of Kentucky, Dr. Ann Hirsch, UCLA and  Dr. Clarence Ryan, Washington State University in  collaboration with Dr. Alfredo Herrera, National Polytechnic  Institute (IPN), Mexico.    The objectives are to bring together U.S. and Mexican  scientists to discuss multidisciplinary efforts in plant  physiology, biochemistry and molecular biology, that may  lead to biotechnological applications in agriculture.Topics  to be discussed in the conference include plant development  and signal transduction, plant-environment interactions,  metabolic processes in plants, plant cell biology and novel  strategies for crop improvement.   These topics are  significant, not only for their scientific importance, but  also for their potential to promote longlasting interactions  between U.S. and Mexican scientists.  ***",
