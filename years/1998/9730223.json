 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central role of Dissolved Organic Matter  (DOM) in the ocean carbon cycle and the  influence of DOM on numerous physical,  chemical, and biological processes are widely  recognized, but fundamental questions about  the sources, reactivity, and cycling of DOM  remain to be answered.  Many of the answers to  these questions lie hidden within the chemical  structures of DOM, but characterization of DOM  is challenging because concentrations are low  and salts are abundant in seawater.  Novel  approaches to the isolation and chemical  characterization of DOM are beginning  transformations of this major carbon  reservoir.  Tangential-flow ultrafiltration  has emerged as a powerful approach for the  isolation of different size classes of marine  organic matter.  Recent efforts in the  characterization of ultrafiltered material  have provided a wealth of new information  about marine DOM.  Over the next three years  research will focus on the characterization of  seawater DOM and build upon major findings of  the past three years of research on the  characterization of ultrafiltered DOM.  The  major objectives of the proposed research are:   1) to investigate relationships among size,  composition, and microbial reactivity of  marine organic matter, and 2) to characterize  the distribution and cycling of terrigenous  DOM in the ocean.",
