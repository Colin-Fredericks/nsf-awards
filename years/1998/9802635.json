Boucias of the University of Florida  and Dr. Myrian Silvana Tigano of  Embrapa/CENARGEN in Brasilia, Brazil.    These researchers will study an insect  mycopathogen that may be used as a  microbial control agent against pest  insects.  In Brazil, this fungi,  Nomuraea rileyi, was used against the  velvetbean caterpillar, a pest that  infests soybeans, and found it was  sufficient to cause a season-long  suppression in the population density of  that pest insect. Collecting insect  population data, soybean data and  weather data from sites in North  Florida, the Federal District of Brazil  and in the central region of Parana, the  reseachers will compile, review and  analyze an extensive database on the  disease agent and its relation to  various biotic and abiotic factors.  They will develop a joint culture  collection that will serve as a valuable  research tool from which selected  isolates can be screened for development  as microbial control agents.  The data  gathered from these field studies will  increase our understanding of how animal  mycopathogens operate in an epizootic  state without concomitant selection for  resistance insects.  It may also provide  insight into how to manipulate  mycopathogens, which are a sustainable  resource for pest insect and plant  management.  ***",
