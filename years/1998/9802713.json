 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work supported under this grant will address problems in \r\nNonlinear Wave Dynamics, which will be studied using a combination \r\nof analytic and numerical methods. For example: \r\n(I) Nonlinear interactions of large scale atmospheric waves \r\nin the Equator, which play a fundamental role in the global weather. \r\nA new mechanism for nonlinear interactions of the waves via \r\ntopography and convected properties (e.g.: potential vorticity, \r\ntemperature and humidity) will be investigated. \r\n(II) Interaction of nonlinear hyperbolic waves with media nonuniformities. \r\nThese waves distort as they propagate, leading to the formation of shocks, \r\nwhich are strongly dissipative. Past research shows that nonuniformities \r\nor interactions with other waves can stop this process. For example, \r\na large class of new solutions to the Euler equations of Gas Dynamics \r\nwas found and will be studied. These solutions are attracting for the \r\ntime evolution and can achieve large pressure variations without \r\nbreaking and forming shocks. Their existence gives rise to \r\ninteresting mathematical issues. A better understanding of this phenomenon \r\ncould provide means to control (or at least diminish) the influence \r\nof shocks in some gas flows. \r\n(III) Focusing, reflection and refraction of weak shocks. \r\nStrong acoustical waves and weak shocks are ubiquitous. A better \r\nunderstanding of their behavior has considerable scientific \r\nsignificance and will shed light into many important practical problems. \r\nMany puzzling problems remain in this area. For example, in many \r\nsituations experiments show three weak shock waves joining at a \r\npoint in a nearly flat configuration, but theoretical calculations \r\nindicate that this is not possible, leading to a contradiction \r\nwith the experiments. A second related problem occurs with the \r\nprediction of infinities in the amplitudes of weak shock waves \r\nas they undergo focusing, reflection or refraction under \r\nappropriate conditions.\r\n\r\nWaves occur in many fields --- such as Acoustics, Atmosphere \r\nand Ocean science, Gas Dynamics, Optics, Combustion Theory, etc. --- \r\nwhere they fundamentally affect the dynamics. Many advances have \r\nbeen made in the last few decades, but many open questions remain,\r\nboth concerning the applications and the mathematics that is used. \r\nThis award will support research on mathematical models for wave-like \r\nphenomena in the global weather, processes in gas dynamics that \r\navoid the formation of shock waves, and the mathematical modeling of \r\ncomplex shock wave interaction.\r\n",
