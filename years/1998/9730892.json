 "awd_abstract_narration": "06/30/98    This award supports the development of new methodology to  enhance the NMR imaging and spectroscopy performance of the  7T horizontal bore spectrometer at Yale Magnetic Resonance  Center for quantitative blood-oxygenation level dependent  (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) image-contrast.  The main  significance of this project is that it will provide the  fundamental basis for converting the BOLD images into  neuronal activity maps.  Autoradiography studies on animals  and PET studies on humans have provided the standards for  quantitative measurements of changes in cerebral activity by  detecting alterations in cerebral perfusion and metabolism  at high spatial resolution.  However, the major  disadvantages of these techniques are that both  methodologies require radioactive tracers and temporal  alterations in neuronal activity cannot be monitored.  The  BOLD fMRI method, in contrast, does not require exogenous  tracers and provides a dynamic measure of brain activity.  The proposed project will allow the BOLD signal to be  quantitatively related to cerebral metabolism and perfusion,  providing a quantitative MRI method of probing the  physiological parameters that are coupled to cerebral  activity.  A non-invasive and non-radioactive method for  quantitatively mapping alterations in neuronal activity in  the mammalian brain would be a very important tool in  neuroscience.  Applications would include brain mapping of  sensory and cognitive functions, assessment of altered  cerebral activity in the diseased or injured brain, and long-  term investigations of brain development and functional  plasticity.",
