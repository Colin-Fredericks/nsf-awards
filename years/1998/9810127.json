 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study addresses various past claims about the importance of telecommunication flows in modern spatial economies. Such claims have rarely been subject to empirical scrutiny, and this study is an empirical project with two specific aims: (1) To uncover the spatial structure and socio-economic determinants of regional, point-to-point telecommunication flows; and (2) to understand the economic and locational impacts of telecommunications on urban and regional systems. The empirical analysis makes use of a 5% random sample of all telephone calls within a region carrying details of callers, locations called, business sector (if applicable) etc. These data are to be matched with a variety of census materials to examine telecommunications demand and resulting regional economic impacts. GIS tools are used for the database matching. New spatial interaction models of telecommunication flows will be specified and estimated, and then used to examine flow elasticities with respect to distance and prices. In addition, inter-industry links will be explored, especially the role of spatial structure and how these interactions vary over time.  A model will be developed of the impacts of telecommunications on rural development, office relocation, work at home, and urban interdependencies (i.e., changes in the urban hierarchy).  The results of the study are important to the formulation of policies on infrastructure modernization, reduction of regional inequalities, and decentralization of economic activities.",
