 "awd_abstract_narration": "This IIA project deals with fixed-structure methods in robust  estimation and control of nonlinear and linear parameter varying  systems. Estimation techniques such as the Kalman filter have  application in applications such as navigation, industrial  processes, power systems and fault detection and isolation.  However, the performance of standard estimators is limited due to  the lack of robustness to modeling errors, and although some  aspects of robust estimation theory have been developed, the  power of mixed structured singular value (MSSV) theory has not  yet been applied. Hence, research in the development of robust  estimation techniques using the MSSV is pursued. Three  performance criteria are considered:H2, Hoo, and l1. This  research also considers issues in fixed-structure control design  for nonlinear systems. In particular, automated techniques for  the design of output feedback control laws and Lyapunov functions  that yield large domains of attraction about an equilibrium point  are developed. Fixed-structure techniques are applied to control  design for linear parameter varying (LPV) systems. LPV control  theory was developed to provide a more rigorous and effective  means of designing gain scheduled control laws for nonlinear  systems. This research focuses on the development of fixed-  structure methodologies corresponding to the two main approaches  to control design for LPV systems. The LPV design techniques are  applied to pointing problems which are being considered at the  Hughes Mechanisms, and Cryogenics.",
