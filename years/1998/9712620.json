 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712620  Garrison    The objective of this research is to investigate the effects  of carbon content on sulfide formation and void nucleation  resistance in titanium-modified steels.  It is hypothesized  that increasing the carbon content of titanium-modified  steels causes the precipitate particles of the Ti2CS sulfide  to be formed at higher temperatures, thereby producing  larger sulfide sizes.  Since the void nucleation resistance  of Ti2CS particles is expected to decrease with increasing  particle size, tying up sulfur as Ti2CS should be less  effective in improving fracture toughness as the carbon  content increases.  If it is confirmed that increasing the  carbon content increases the sulfide size and diminishes the  void nucleation resistance in the titanium-modified steels,  then methods will be explored to:  (1) refine the sulfide  size when the sulfur is gettered as Ti2CS, or (2) create new  methods of gettering the sulfur into void nucleation  resistant particles that remain effective at higher carbon  levels.  One approach that will be considered is to dissolve  the sulfides and later reprecipitate them at lower  temperatures in the austenite.  If the sulfide size is  refined by this approach and the reprecipitated sulfides are  Ti2CS, then the toughness of higher carbon steels which  contain reprecipitated sulfides will be investigated as well  as the void nucleation resistance behavior of these finer  reprecipitated sulfides.  Gettering sulfur as Nb2CS rather  than as Ti2CS will also be considered.  Recent results  suggest that this is feasible and that such particles are  resistant to void nucleation.  %%  This research explores microstructural factors that  influence the fracture behavior of structural steels.  It  has potential impact on the design of fracture-resistant  metal alloys that could be employed in structures with  improved lifetimes and safety.  ***",
