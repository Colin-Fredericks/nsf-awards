 "awd_abstract_narration": "The New York Hall of Science will conduct research to determine the  effectiveness of random-access audio technology as a means of  improving access to science-technology center exhibitions for  visually-impaired visitors.  The project will use formative  evaluation techniques to create random access tours of two major  exhibitions at the New York Hall of Science:  Sound Sensations and  Seeing the Light.  The project will use a recently developed  technology, the random-access audio player, which offers the  promise of improving the effectiveness of learning for all  visitors, including the visually-impaired, at science-technology  center interactive exhibits.  This project builds upon earlier work  to develop and evaluate audio tours for hands-on science museums.  The exhibitions selected for this project address the technology of  audio reproduction (Sound Sensations) and the physiology and  psychology of visual perception (Seeing the Light).  The project  goal is to extend the benefits of these substantive informal  science experiences to visually impaired visitors.  Seeing the  Light, originally created by the Exploratorium in San Francisco, is  one of the most widely replicated exhibitions in the world, making  the findings of the project directly relevant to many museums.  The  project team will use control and experimental groups of visually  impaired visitors to evaluate the effectiveness of these tours in  increasing the impact of the exhibits for these individuals.  The  goal of the currently funded project is to determine whether audio  tours work for any.  The initial findings from the earlier research  were encouraging indicating that audio tours are beneficial for  audiences in hands-on science museums.  The new research will  extend the prior work in two ways:  (1) It will enable the museum  staff to develop and test an audio tour which is designed to  support the special requirements of visually-impaired audiences.  (2) It will enable the project team to ascertain the degree to   which an audio tour can benefit from the principles of universal  design -- how the specific requirements of a visually impaired  audience might be incorporated in the design of an audio tour for  all audiences.  Both general findings and tour components from this  research could be used later by over 250 science-technology centers  in the United States.  The project will conclude with a report to  the field on the production, use, cost, and impact of this  technology on the target audience.",
