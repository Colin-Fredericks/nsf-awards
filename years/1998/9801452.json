This study will determine the mating system from the  parentage in a natural breeding population of humpback  whales.  Skin samples will be obtained by approaching whales  in a small boat and harpooning biopsy samples from adult  males (individually recognized by their flukes), and from  adult females and their calves; this does not harm the  whales.  Molecular genetics lab work then will match the  DNA of each calf with the DNA of its mother and its possible  father. By comparing the variation in reproductive success  from the genetic fingerprints among the large representative  local sample of males, the mating system of the population  can be assessed.   The results may explain the elaboration  of the complex male songs and behavior traditions in  humpback whales, and they will further the understanding of  sexual selection in mammalian mating systems.  The study is  the first assessment of male reproductive success in a  mysticete whale.    This method may prove to be especially important in studies  to determine the mating systems of whales and other marine  mammals where mating is difficult to observe. scientific  model may apply in determining the mating systems in marine  The results may be of general significance to conservation  of whale populations.",
