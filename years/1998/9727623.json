 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727623   Schwartz    Animal communication in nature involves detection of  important signals in a noisy environment.  In gray tree frog  mating choruses calling males attempt to attract mates,  females must discriminate among large number of competing  calls and use this acoustic information to choose among  competing males making this an ideal setting in which to  investigate such signal discrimination in a noisy  environment. The proposed research will also improve our  understanding of mate assessment in nature and competition  among males.  Females of the gray treefrog base their choice  of mate solely on acoustic criteria. In the intensely  competitive environment of a chorus, males change their  calls in a way that laboratory experiments suggestshould  improve their attractiveness.  However, we don t know how  well females can assess males in the complex acoustic  environment of a chorus or why certain patterns of calling  are preferred. Nor are the fine details of the vocal  competition that occurs among males or the relationship  between these details and male condition understood. This  research, using field-based tests of female choice and  laboratory studies of male vocalizations, will help answer  these questions in addition to addressing the general  problem of signal detection in a noisy environment.  Experiments will use a computer-based interactive playback  system, that constitutes a new  methodology for application  to studies of animal communication.",
