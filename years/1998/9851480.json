 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing an improved algebra-based introductory physics course sequence based on Workshop Physics and other activity-based curricula. The new course sequence is aimed at preservice precollege science teachers, especially physics teachers, for whom this course sequence may serve as their sole exposure to physics. Coverage is reduced slightly from the standard introductory course to mechanics, waves and sound, light, and electricity and magnetism, with treatment of modern physics limited to electrons and radioactivity. Lectures are replaced by direct observation and guided, collaborative inquiry. When possible, computer-based labs and video capture and analysis is used to model real world phenomena. Each student group completes an independent investigation each semester, and gives an oral presentation to the class using presentation software and hardware. The new course is intended to improve scientific inquiry skills, conceptual understanding, skill and confidence with modern technology, and student retention and attitudes towards science. Emphasis is placed on carefully evaluating and improving the effectiveness of this activity-based curriculum in a less selective institution. Guidance and assessment in collaborative group functioning will respond to concerns reported in the literature. Multiple choice conceptual evaluations is used with free-response items to probe conceptual understanding and ability to apply conceptual knowledge in novel contexts. The Maryland Physics Expectation survey is administered to evaluate changes in student attitudes and beliefs about physics. Baseline assessment data collected in the present course permits meaningful comparisons. Assessment results, new free-response assessment items, and improved instructional methods based on assessment results will be presented through American Association of Physics Teachers national meetings and the Project Kaleidascope network.",
