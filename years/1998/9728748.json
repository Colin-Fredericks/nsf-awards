 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728748  Ohuchi    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Fumio S. Ohuchi,  Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University  of Washington, to pursue with Dr. Duck-Kyun Choi, Department  of Inorganic Materials Engineering, Hanyang University,  Seoul, Korea, for 36 months, a program of cooperative  research on the growth and characterization of perovskite  based thin film heterosystems for use in future Dynamic  Random Access Memory (DRAM) applications.  The heterosystems  to be grown and characterized consist of (Ba, Sr)TiO3 as  ferroelectric dielectric and (Ba, Sr)Ru O3 as conductive  material.  Elucidation of the roles of chemical, kinetic,  and structural constraints controlling the growth and  properties of the heterosystem is a major objective.    The collaborators will determine the feasibility of using  these structures in novel DRAM structures.  This will be  accomplished through studies of the (1) fabrication of thin  film heterostructures by magnetron sputtering, (2)  characterization of thin film microstructure, and (3)  properties of the resultant thin film systems, with emphasis  on exploitation in device applications.  The cooperating  scientists and their laboratories have complementary  expertise and equipment, respectively, for their roles in  pursuing this research..  This project is relevant to the  objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program  which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between  U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the  exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and  techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual  benefit.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea  Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  ***",
