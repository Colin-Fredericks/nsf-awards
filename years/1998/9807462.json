 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmental degradation is a critical issue in resource management and development projects.  Historically, population increase coupled with poverty has been thought to create a `downward spiral` that traps the rural poor in the third world in an ever worsening struggle for survival. This dissertation research project by a cultural anthropology student at Southern Methodist University will examine the relationship between poverty, expanding population and land use in two Philippine communities. The two agricultural communities differ in degree of market integration, income and poverty levels, but have similar land use strategies and occupy the same ecological niche.  An explicit comparison between the land use strategies will allow the researcher to isolate the relevant variables that determine land use decisions and their impact on the environment.  Methods will include semi-structured ethnographic interviews, decision analyses, consensus analysis, mapping of agricultural plots, life histories and archival research. This project will advance our understanding of the political economic underpinnings of environmental degradation and will be helpful to decision makers concerned with the actual relationships of the rural poor to their environment.",
