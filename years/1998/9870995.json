 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal to the Major Research Instrumentation Program  requests funds for the purchase of an Olympus Fluoview laser-  scanning confocal microscope system to be shared by  researchers in several departments at the Charles River  Campus of Boston University. This confocal microscope will  extend the research of several Users who are experienced  with confocal microscopy, and it will allow the initiation  of many new research efforts using confocal microscopy by 12  principal investigators and over 70 postdoctoral fellows,  graduate students and undergraduates. The research projects  of the Users cover a wide range of microscopic applications  including the following: visualization of basic cellular  events, the analysis of neuronal and synaptic anatomy and  function, the subcellular localization of cellular  components, the study of development, and cell-specific gene  expression. In addition to research, this microscope will be  used in a wide variety of research training at all  educational levels, especially the training of graduate  students and postdoctoral fellows in the laboratories of the  Users. At the undergraduate level, this microscope will  facilitate the research of many students doing honors  research in the Users laboratories, the students doing  projects funded by the NSF Research Experience for  Undergraduates (NSF-REU) program and the students doing  Howard Hughes Medical Institute-sponsored summer research.  As part of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute-sponsored  Frontiers in Biology for High School Teacher Summer  Research, a number of local high school teachers will also  use the microscope.    The use of a confocal microscope is critical for studies  which require high resolution light microscopic images of  fluorescent markers, particularly in thick or living  specimens. The use of photomultiplier detection in this  confocal scope greatly enhances the detection of faint  images and allows the accurate quantitative measurement of  colocalization of fluorescent labe ls at the limits of  resolution of the light microscope. The requested equipment  includes an Olympus Fluoview Confocal Imaging System  integrated with an Olympus BX50 light microscope. The  Fluoview confocal microscope can achieve excellent  performance at a relatively low cost, because the Fluoview  confocal system has been optically integrated directly to  the Olympus BX50 using optimized hard optics. It will allow  single- and double-label imaging, along with both  transmitted (Nomarski) and reflected imaging modes. The two  lasers we are requesting (an argon ion and a dual-line  krypton ion laser) provide three widely-spaced excitation  wavelengths to allow the use of the broad range of  fluorochromes needed for optimal multiple-labeling. The  emission filters can be easily changed by the users to  accommodate any future developments in fluorescent probes.  The Fluoview software is intuitively organized and well  suited for a multi-user facility, as all of the microscope  settings are graphically illustrated for specific labeling  techniques. This software provides strong support for the  optical sectioning, 3-D reconstruction and rotation, and  kinetic analysis requirements of the users. The BX50 Olympus  microscope provides excellent optical performance at a  reasonable price. It incorporates the latest infinity  corrected optics using universal high numerical aperture  objective lenses that can be used for all techniques  including fluorescence and Nomarski optics. The  ergonometrics of this microscope are excellent and it allows  the use of three fluorescent wavelengths plus transmitted  light. The mechanical stability of this microscope provides  an excellent base for the attachment of the Fluoview  confocal scanning unit. In summary, this request for a high  performance confocal microscope will broadly benefit both  research and research training at the Charles River Campus  of Boston University.",
