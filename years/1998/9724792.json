 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724792  Buttry    This U.S.-Brazil award will support a research collaboration  between Dr. Daniel Buttry of the University of Wyoming to  work with Professors Roberto M. Torresi and Susana Cordoba  Torresi at the University of Sao Paulo.  Their collaboration  is on enhanced power density in polymeric, thin film battery  materials.    These two research labs want to work together to define  materials and conditions that make the  most of charging and  discharging rates  of lithium-based batteries.  Specifically  they are looking at the mechanism of the polyaniline (PAn)  catalyzed oxidized 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole (DMcT)  redox process.  This is a thin-film mixture that has been  shown to have extremely high energy density under certain  conditions that are relevant to use as a cathode material in  a lithium battery.  This research is important not only for  industry, which has an increasing need for portable power  sources, but also for the projected need for society's  conversion to electric vehicles.    The University of Wyoming lab specializes in electrochemical  quartz crystal microbalance methodology, in  spectroelectrochemical (EQCM) methods of analyzing thin  films and in the complex chemistry  of the Pan/DMcT system.  The University of Sao Paulo lab possesses skill in the  synthesis of new conducting polymer derivatives and in using  the EQCM in conjunction with other measurement methods.  The  expertise brought by each side is unique and essential to  the project.  ***",
