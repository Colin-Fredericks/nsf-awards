 "awd_abstract_narration": "The William and Mary Electroweak Spin Physics Group  proposes to undertake a program of electromagnetic and weak  current studies that probe the flavor content of hadrons and  hadronic matter.  The primary focus of the effort will be  measurements of the parity violating asymmetry in elastic  electron scattering from the nucleon using a polarized  electron beam at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator  Facility (Jefferson Laboratory).  The experiments will  explore the strange quark sea contributions to the nucleon  ground state (Jab Experiments E91-010, Finn & Souder, et  al., and E91-017, Beck, et al.).  The strength of the  strange-quark sea has important consequences for nucleon  models and for interpretation of deep inelastic spin-  structure function results.  The HAPPEX (Hall A Proton  Parity Experiment) and GO experiments have received the  highest scientific priority at the laboratory.  The  importance of the proposed work is recognized as well in the  long-range plan for nuclear science prepared by NSAC.  The  group also intends to develop and be a part of possible  extensions to the HAPPEX and GO programs.       Preliminary studies of helicity-dependent beam  fluctuations indicate that the Jefferson Laboratory beam is  of exceptional quality and suitable for parity violation  measurements.  The first HAPPEX production run for is  scheduled for 1998.  W&M are responsible for optic studies,  Monte Carlo simulations, and for the design, fabrication,  and installation of the detectors needed for this  experiment.  These detectors are being assembled and tested  in our detector laboratory by graduate and undergraduate  students associated with the group.  We have also entered  into a Memorandum of Understanding with Jefferson  Laboratory, the University of Maryland, Carnegie Mellon  University, Norfolk State University, and the GO  Collaboration to work on the GO detector package.  Commissioning of the GO spectrometer is expected to begin in  2000.       There is a large educational component to this effort.  Six graduate students (two supported by Jefferson  Laboratory) are presently working on group related  activities at Jefferson Laboratory.  We also anticipate that  several undergraduates will participate in senior thesis and  summer REU projects.",
