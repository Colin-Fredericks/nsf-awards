 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study the information that chimpanzees can recall and transmit about the nature and location of objects in outdoor environments. Four chimpanzees will be tested. The animals are uniquely well-suited for studies of recall memory. Three have learned visual symbols that refer to objects and places. An experimenter will show an animal an object in an outdoor location. The location will vary across trials. Later, in its indoor cage, the animal can indicate to an uninformed person the location and type of object. Memory tasks that animals solve in real-life situations will be modeled for presentation to animals in a digital format. Animals will manipulate a joystick to make a cursor hit targets on a monitor screen. Targets will disappear as soon as the animal begins to move. Research questions to be addressed by these experiments are  1) how much detail each animal retains about the relative positions of targets and landmarks, and  2) how efficient its path is to the target. The ability to recall and report environmental features not present to the senses is important in human thinking and communication, but to date there are almost no data on recall memory capabilities in nonverbal animals.",
