Academic year 1998-99 is the sabbatical  leave year of the P1. The PI will spend one semester in the lab. The  purpose of the trip Is two-fold: to learn the new lab methods which will  broaden the PI's research' program and to solidify a developing  collaborative relationship. The PI will spend the second semester  perfecting the techniques at the home institution with the animal models  commonly used in the PI's lab. Upon working out the methods in the home  lab, the PI will begin applying the new methods to the ongoing research  project of the P1. The PI will involve undergraduate in this part of the  project and the 'proposal includes summer salary for two students for the  summer, This proposal is particularly suited to a POWRE award. It makes  possible significant professional advancement of the PI by broadening the  scope of the research project through learning new methods, and it  increases leadership opportunities by providing funding for undergraduate  research. Completion of these activities would not be possible without  funding from the NSF which provides necessary salaries and supplies, and  the ability to dedicate time to these activities.",
