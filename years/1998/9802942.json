While the affiliates participate in the work of the Coalition, they are not supported in this by any Federal funds.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation Engineering Education Coalition's vision is to be a recognized leader in creating a new engineering education culture that is responsive to technological changes and societal needs.\r\n\r\nTo build on their work to date, the Coalition will develop further its engineering education innovations and work to have these institutionalized on the campuses of their members and affiliates.  They will also participate in a multi-coalition effort to disseminate the product and practices of this and the other engineering education coalitions, to the engineering education community at large.\r\n\r\nDetails of the work of this and other Engineering Education Coalitions are available on the World Wide Web at http://www.needs.org/coalitions/.  Information on the Foundation Coalition can also be found at http://foundation.ua.edu/.\r\n \r\n",
