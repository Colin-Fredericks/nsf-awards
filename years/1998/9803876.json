 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803876  Change propagation is a key part of software maintenance and  evolution. The change starts with the programmer changing a  component of software. After the change, the component may no  longer fit with the rest of the software, because it may no  longer provide what the other components require, or it may now  require different services from the other components. In order to  reintroduce the consistency into software, the programmer must  keep track of inconsistencies and the locations where the  secondary changes are to be made. The secondary changes, however,  may introduce new inconsistencies, etc. The process continues  until all inconsistencies are removed. The formal model of change  propagation is based on graph rewriting. It covers specific  scenarios, including strict change-and-fix, random change-and-  fix, and top-down. The research includes development of a  prototype tool based on the formalism, which keeps track of the  remaining inconsistencies in software, and marks the components  to be updated. The validation of both the formal model and the  tool will be done by a case study. The results of the case study  will serve as a feedback, and will be projected into both the  model and the prototype tool.***",
