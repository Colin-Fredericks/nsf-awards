 "awd_abstract_narration": "Western Wisconsin Technical College (WWTC) will introduce telemedicine technology support training at three levels.  First, to high school age youth through on-line (internet and videoconferencing) first year electronics courses, for which they will receive credit toward high school graduation and advanced standing towards an Associate' s Degree in Biomedical Electronics.  Second, the Associate Degree in Applied Science, Biomedical Electronics program will be modified to include telemedicine technology in its curriculum and bridge the gap between information systems and biomedical technology.  And lastly, WWTC will offer an Advanced Technical Certificate to update skills of technicians already in the field.    Curriculum and instructional materials will be developed and offered to the high school students. High school faculty will be offered a summer inservice workshop on core electronics instruction to prepare them to assist their students who are taking courses via video conferencing and Internet. Existing Biomedical Electronics curricula will be modified to include telemedicine, and Advanced Technical Certificate, Telebiomedical Technician curricula developed for updating technicians on telemedicine advancements. All curricula and teaching materials will be placed on an intranet/Internet for 24 hour a day access from anywhere. A model telemedicine site will be equipped in the lab, which will include videoconferencing capabilities, both for delivery of instruction to rural sites and for training purposes.",
