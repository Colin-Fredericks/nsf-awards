 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic transition (700-500  million years ago (Ma)) is a critical period in Earth  history.  During this period one supercontinent known as  Rodinia was coalesced, then fragmented, prior to  amalgamation of a second supercontinent referred to as  Gondwanaland.  These events were manifested by major  mountain building, continental erosion, species  diversification, sea-level fluctuations, and changes in sea-  water composition.  Continental-margin sedimentary sequences  from this era (notably in western and eastern North America,  northeastern Asia, southern Africa, eastern Australia, and  the Ross margin of Antarctica) provide detailed records of  sea-level fluctuations, faunal distributions, and post-  depositional tectonism.  One of these sequences, the  Beardmore Group in Antarctica, represents a significant  element in the evolution of the East Antarctic craton, yet  very little is known about its depositional or tectonic  history.    The Beardmore Group is a thick sequence of graywacke and  carbonate that is traditionally correlated with similar  rocks elsewhere in the Transantarctic Mountains.  Beardmore  rocks are largely unfossiliferous, lithologically  monotonous, and lie in uncertain depositional relation with  both crystalline basement rocks and fossiliferous Lower  Cambrian carbonates.  Previous workers have suggested that  the entire Beardmore Group is Neoproterozoic in age and that  it records two distinct deformations, the well-known Ross  orogeny (~500 Ma) and an earlier cryptic \"Beardmore\"  orogeny.  Reconnaissance field and geochronologic studies  indicate that portions of the Beardmore Group are  significantly younger (<600 Ma) than previously thought, and  that it only shows evidence for Ross deformation.  These  preliminary data reflect uncertainty in the geologic  relations of these rocks, and they indicate that the  Neoproterozoic tectonic history for the region must be  revised.    This project will investigate the Beardmore Group in the  ce ntral Transantarctic Mountains in order to better  understand its depositional history and its role in orogenic  events shaping the outer margin of Gondwanaland.  The study  will include: (1) detailed field study of the stratigraphy,  sedimentology, and structure; (2) provenance (source) study  of graywackes to constrain the depositional setting of the  turbidites; (3) determination of carbonate isotopic  compositions for comparison with the global C-isotopic  record; (4) refinement of depositional age(s) through U-Pb  dating of detrital and igneous zircons; and (5) constraint  on the age(s) of deformation(s) with Ar-isotope  thermochronology.  Field work will be completed during the  1998-99 and 1999-2000 austral summers.    This work will test a recently proposed model for Beardmore  Group deposition and deformation that involves latest  Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic(?) rift-margin sedimentation  and structural inversion as an early expression of Ross  activity.  The results will help to directly resolve long-  standing uncertainties in the geologic history of the  Antarctica and they will improve our understanding of global  paleogeographic and plate-tectonic relations during  supercontinent transformation at the close of the  Proterozoic.",
