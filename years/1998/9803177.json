 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803177  Weaver    The proposed program aims to investigate the interactions of  fluorine with silicon surfaces, the modifications that are  brought about by etching, and the atomic-scale interactions  that underlie material removal.  The fluorine-silicon (100)  system is an ideal model system because problems can be  addressed that are of broad importance, namely how ideal  surfaces develop \"corrosive layers\" when exposed to  reactants and how multilayer etching competes with layer-by-  layer etching.  Atomic-resolution scanning tunneling  microscopy would be used to investigate fluorine  chemisorption and fluorine-fluorine repulsive interactions  in the adlayer.  Studies have been designed that would  determine the atomic sequency of events leading to silicon  difloride desorption and the implications vis-a-vis layer-by-  layer etching with silicon defluoride.  Others would focus  on corrosive-layer silicon tetrafluoride eteching, the  nucleation of fluorosilyl structures on the surface, and the  strucural consequences of material removal from these  disordered layers.  %%%  These studies of fluorine etching of silicon are pertinent  to modern technologies based on silicon and other  semiconductors.  In the $700b microelectronics industry, for  example, the majority of the 1018 transistors produced in  1997 were carved into monolithic pieces of silicon using  themethods of chemical etching.  The shapes, positions, and  registry of these structures are controlled with sub-micron  accuracy.  This project focuses on the underlying chemical  and physical processes responsible for this etching.  Deeper  insights are needed to achieve dfurther miniaturization for  tomorrow's circuitry.  ***",
