 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has two aims. First and foremost is the aim of  collecting data on four previously undocumented or poorly  documented languages of Nepal. There are at least 130 languages  spoken in Nepal and, of these languages, only about 25 have  grammatical descriptions of any sort and many of these are  rudimentary. Since no more than about three dozen of Nepal's  language are spoken by more than 5000 people, since bilingualism in  the national language, Nepali, is now almost universal for adults,  and since economic factors typical of many undeveloped countries  are operative in Nepal resulting in increasing migration to the  cities, it seems unlikely that the majority of Nepalese languages  can survive for more than a generation or two. It is imperative  that linguistic fieldwork be conducted now while the majority of  Nepal's languages are still spoken by whole communities. The second  aim of the project is to provide training in fieldwork and  TibetoBurman linguistics for four graduate students.",
