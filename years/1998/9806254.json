 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides fellowship support to a student for post-doctoral  research and training.  The student's proposed research project is entitled `The Influence of Intentionality, Racial and Gender Information of African-and European-American Children's Social Judgments.` The study investigates African- and European-American children's use of outcome intentionality information in dispositional and likeability judgements of black and white story characters.  Prior empirical investigation suggests that there may be ethnic variations in social perception, such that the culture/ethnicity of perceivers influence their dispositional judgements.  Age-related differences may exist in such influence as well.  To further explore children's social judgements, this project will investigate age and ethnic variation in the influence of outcome intentionality information on children's dispositional and preference judgements.  Prior research has not investigated children's judgements of female actors.  Children will be presented with judgement stories about actors who intentionally almost cause a harmful outcome and actors who unintentionally almost cause a harmful outcome.  Second and fifth grade children will be asked to rate actors on likeability, disposition, and cross-situational behavior.  It is expected that the children's ethnicity, age, the actor's ethnicity and gender, and outcome intentionality information, will influence the children's judgements.",
