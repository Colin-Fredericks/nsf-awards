 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to create a methodology for optimizing manufacturing processes using statistical models.  These models will be created from knowledge acquired from different sources, including heuristics, expert knowledge, physical experimentation, first principle relationships and large-scale computer simulations of physical models.  Optimizing a manufacturing process requires an understanding of the influence and interactions of design and process variables on the final quality of the manufactured artifact -  Variables are properties of the material (or combinations of materials) selected, of the physics of the process, of the geometry of the part, of the equipment settings, and of the manufacturing environmental conditions.  The process modeling framework must be flexible and adaptable, so that models for subprocesses can be updated and adapted as processes evolve and new knowledge is acquired.  This research focuses on a new class of manufacturing processes called Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) or layered manufacturing, which are changing traditional approaches to design and manufacture of mechanical parts.       Better process models of SFF manufacturing processes will lead to faster development of rapid manufacturing processes and will accelerate their use and acceptance by industry.  Good models will also allow better identification of design possibilities so that manufacturing considerations can be brought into the early phases of the design cycle.  A methodology for creating and optimizing process models with differing levels of detail for different phases of the design cycle will remove impediments to the integration of design and manufacturing concerns.  This work will also contribute to statistical model building by enabling users to incorporate the active and critical constraints on design variables, to handle high-dimensional and irregular parameter spaces efficiently, and to assess model reliability, predictive capability and parameter sensitivity.",
