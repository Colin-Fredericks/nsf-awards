 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many database applications today are no longer I/O bound but memory bound - during transaction processing applications, the CPU wastes approximately 80% of its cycles waiting for fetches from memory. Thus a 5 fold speed up is possible if cache misses are eliminated entirely, and with clock speeds continuing to grow, the available speed up will grow as well. Thus the goal of this research is to build significantly faster database management systems (DBMSs) by (1) developing analytical models of the interaction between different database structures (i.e. indexes, tables) and the memory hierarchy, (2) identifying those structures that are causing the most stalls, (3) synthesizing new structures and algorithms that are more \"cache friendly\", and (4) verifying the new designs through low level performance studies on a real system. The results of this project will help ensure that database performance scales with the ever increasing speed of processors and density of memory chips. The educational goal of this project is to develop a project based curriculum for database systems. Instead of using a scaled down \"teaching\" system, students learn to use and extend commercial DBMSs through standard interfaces like JDBC and OLE DB, which gives them practical skills as well as teaches them to write and debug code that is part of a large complex system.",
