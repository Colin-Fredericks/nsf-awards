 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803884  Pantano    The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding  of the molecular structure of multicomponent silicate glass  surfaces, and especially, the effect of modifier-ions upon  the distribution and activity of surface adsorption sites.  A coordinated study of multicomponent silicate glass  surfaces is proposed in which computer simulation and  experimental studies will be directed toward  characterization and prediction of adsorption isotherms in  terms of the atomic/molecular scale surface structure.  The  computer simulation of the atomic structure of the  silicate-based glasses is based on a novel approach to the  simulation of the vitreous silica surfaces.  It is assumed  that the surface of pure vitreous silica should be  hydrophobic.  To achieve this in a computer simulation, it  is necessary to bring the structural relaxation time within  the time limits of computer simulation.  Whereas previous  computer simulations of glass have focused on the ideal  surface created by abrupt removal of periodic boundary  conditions with some annealing, this study will focus more  specifically on the annealing of surfaces in an effort to  simulate lower energy melt surfaces.  A novel experimental  approach will be used for determining the isotherms and  energies of adsorption on glass powders, glass fibers and  gels.  This approach is an extension of the comparison  method in which the gas-adsorption isotherm of an adsorbent  (with unknown adsorption characteristics) is plotted against  the standard isotherm (of a reference material).  The  isotherms will  be compared with computer simulated  isotherms to obtain (i) detailed descriptions of the atomic  structure of multicomponent glass surfaces, (ii) the local  electric fields associated with modifiers, non-bridging  oxygens or surface silanols, (iii) the spatial distributions  of modifying cations on the surface and (iv) the mechanism  of water (and other reactive specie) adsorption on these  heterogeneous surfaces. Static-SIM S, FTIR and related  spectroscopic techniques will be employed to further  validate surface composition effects and irreversible  chemisorption reactions.  %%%  The ability to accurately simulate the glass surface and  physisorption isotherms using computer methods provides a  powerful tool to predict the surface thermodynamic  properties for new glass compositions, and/or to interpret  the adsorption behavior of existing glasses and glass  products. The surface and surface chemistry of silica and  silicate glasses are fundamental to many of their properties  including strength, corrosion, polymer adhesion,  bioreactivity, and optical response. The project is being  carried-out through the collaboration of scientists  simulating and studying the theory of simple gas adsorption  on model amorphous surfaces with those whose focus is  characterization and processing of more complex glass  surfaces.  ***",
