 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 98-06215  ARAI      Neurons throughout the brain contain a calcium-activated  protease called 'calpain' that can cleave various intracellular  proteins.  It has been shown that the moderate increase in  intracellular calcium produced by a few bursts of synaptic  activity is sufficient to activate this enzyme. Such activity  under the proper circumstances induces a long lasting enhancement  of synaptic transmission called 'long-term potentiation' (LTP),  which is thought to be one of the mechanisms responsible for  encoding memory.  Suppression of calpain in fact prevents both LTP  and memory formation, which suggests that this enzyme plays an  essential role in these processes.  Expression of LTP is now  commonly thought to involve a change in currents through AMPA  receptors, a subtype within the glutamate receptor family, that  mediates excitatory synaptic transmission between most neurons in  higher brain regions.  It is thus of particular interest that AMPA  receptors were recently found to be cleaved by calpain near their  intracellular C-terminal, and that the domain removed by  proteolysis contains target sites for kinases and a site which  anchors the receptor to cytoskeletal proteins.  The goal of this  project is to identify whether and in what way C-terminal  modification of the AMPA receptor by calpain alters the functional  properties of this receptor. It will be specifically tested (1)  whether direct application of activated calpain into neurons  changes the time course of the current flow through the receptors,  (2) whether AMPA receptors truncated at their C-terminal exhibit  characteristic alterations in their physiological properties, and  (3) whether modulation of AMPA receptors by kinases is altered  after truncation.  The proposed experiments supported by this  POWRE award represent a new direction for Dr. Arai and will give  her the opportunity to learn new skills in the field of molecular  biology which will complement her expertise in neurophysiology.  Acquiring thes e skills will be critical for her career goal to  start an independent research laboratory, to expand her research  scope, and to develop further her leadership in the field of AMPA  receptor research and synaptic plasticity.",
