These include the chemical evolution in the universe before formation of galaxies, in the Big Bang, and possibly in the earliest stars which set the initial conditions for the chemical evolution in galaxies.  The chemical compositions of galaxies evolve with time as new elements are created in stars, returned to the interstellar medium, and incorporated into subsequent generations of stars.  A galaxy's chemical evolution involved a complicated interplay among star formation, stellar evolution, nucleosynthesis, stellar winds, and galactic winds.  In addition, random events such as the merger of galaxies or the accretion of gas by a galaxy may have had a profound effect on chemical evolution.   This cyclic process is exceedingly complex, and involves several poorly known processes and variables.    Probably the simplest form of this complex process occurs in the smallest, least complicated of galaxies, the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies.  These galaxies are very low luminosity galaxies usually members of the Local Group.  Both the Milky Way and Andromeda are members of the Local Group.  Because of this simplicity, there is hope that the most important features of the chemical evolution of these galaxies may be isolated and understood.  In general, these galaxies contain very little, if any, H I gas.  There is clear evidence that stars formed over a large range in time, either more or less continuously or at separate epochs.  Dr. Zinn is studying in detail three dSph galaxies: in Draco, Ursa Minor and Sculptor.  He is obtaining spectroscopy and photometry of red giant stars in these galaxies to determine their metallicity distributions.  The comparison of these distributions with each other and with models may reveal the most important factors controlling the evolution of low mass galaxies.  ***",
