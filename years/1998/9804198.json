This  fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain  additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue innovative and imaginative research into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular, cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled effects of  mosses on thermal and chemical controls of decomposition in  the boreal forest.  Most studies that relate plant  functional groups to ecosystem processes focus on direct  effects, such as the effects of litter quality on  decomposition or nitrogen mineralization rates. Plant  functional groups can also affect ecosystem processes  indirectly through effects on microclimate. Effects of plant  species on soil temperature may be particularly important in  the high latitude systems that contain a large portion of  global terrestrial carbon stores, where below-ground  ecosystem processes such as decomposition and nutrient  dynamics are often temperature-limited. In boreal forests,  mosses can comprise up to 100% cover of the forest floor.  This research hypothesizes that mosses are strong thermal  regulators in boreal forest ecosystems and thus exert  dominating control over ecosystem carbon storage. The goals  of the research are to quantify important moss traits for  ecosystem energy fluxes; differentiate between moss thermal  and chemical effects on decomposition, and link effects to  nutrient cycling and carbon storage; and use models to test  the role of mosses in ecosystem change following distu rbance  and climatic change.",
