 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729178  Kumar    The aim of this proposal is to develop strategies for the  successful immobilization of proteins at solid  surfaces. In this study,  a-zirconium phosphonates with specific  functionalities will be prepared,  and selected proteins will be  immobilized at these surfaces by covalent and non-covalent  methods.  Immobilized proteins will be examined with diffuse  reflectance spectral methods (Ultraviolet-Visible, Fourier  Transform InfraRed),  powder X-ray diffraction, activity  studies, and by differential scanning calorimetry.  These data  for the immobilized proteins will be compared with those of the  free proteins to gain insight into how surface functionalities,  linker lengths, and covalent immobilization influence bound  protein behavior.  Such detailed information is essential to  learn how specific surfaces can be rationally designed in order  to maximize the bound protein function.  %%%  The catalytic efficiency and selectivity of enzymes have not  been fully exploited for societal needs due to their instability  and high cost.  Immobilized enzymes, on the other hand, are  often more stable, result in lower costs, and they can be  recycled.  Immobilized proteins are important for applications  involving biosensors, medical implants,  enzyme reactors, and biomedical devices.  Immobilized proteins  can provide new and improved catalysts to produce fine  chemicals, pharmaceutical intermediates, and synthetic fuels to  meet growing societal needs while reducing the environmental  impact of  human activities.   This activity is jointly supported by the Division of Chemistry, the Division of Materials Research, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the MPS Directorate.  ***",
