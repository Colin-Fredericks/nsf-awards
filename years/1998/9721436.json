 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design of successful numerical methods for image processing  and other biomedical applications require a thorough  understanding of the underlying problems and of the desired  solutions, as well as of the instrumentation for data collection  and the computational environment.  This proposal seeks support  for the PI to spend his sabbatical year, and part of the summers  attached to it at the Biomedical Engineering department at Case  Western Reserve University.  J. Duerk and D. Wilson will serve as  hosts to the PI during his stay.  A year of full time immersion  in the biomedical environment at CWRU will give the PI an  opportunity to strengthen and broaden his image processing  knowledge and to view the field from the engineering   perspective.  He will also acquire significant insight in various  biomedical engineering applications whose solution is  computationally challenging.    The PI's expertise on numerical methods for large-scale  computations and the recent applications to the restoration of  images will make it possible to begin interacting with faculty  and students in the hosting department from the start, thus  allowing him to take advantage of all learning opportunities.  It is envisioned that this interaction will develop into a solid  and fruitful cooperation on the development of better numerical  methods for novel medical applications, e.g., interventional MRI  for a new less invasive cancer treatment.  The new knowledge and  skills will significantly broaden the PI's expertise and will  open new avenues for his future research. Upon returning to his  home institution, where there is neither an engineering school  nor a medical school, he will divulge his new knowledge of  medical imaging and of the engineering perspective on it by  directing the work of Masters and PhD students, designing  new, interdisciplinary courses and giving a series of lectures  and seminars.    Upon return to his department the PI will be able to    -introduce applications from biomedical enginee ring in graduate  and undergraduate courses on numerical analysis and scientific  computing    -assign computational problems arising in biomedical engineering  for Ph.D. and Masters theses, possibly in collaboration with  members of the Department for Biomedical Engineering at CWRU.   This should yield thesis topics that students would find  interesting and attractive, as well as make the students more  attractive on the job market    -organize seminars on computational problems in biomedical  engineering, and if there is interest, develop courses on  \"Computational Problems in Biomedical Engineering\"    -serve as liaison between his department and the Department of  Biomedical Engineering at CWRU.    This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
