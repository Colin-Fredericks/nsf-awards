 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803755\r\nDunn\r\n\r\nPhysical systems whose states evolve in response to variable externally\r\napplied controlling forces, voltages, temperatures, interest rate policies,\r\nresource allocation strategies, and the like, are commonly modeled by\r\ndifferential equations or approximating difference equations. Related\r\noptimization problems arise naturally when some choice is permitted in\r\nthe way the control inputs are applied in time or space. These optimal control problems have classic precursors in the Calculus of Variations, and may also be viewed as specially structured nonlinear programs in function spaces or\r\nfinite-dimensional sequence spaces. The most difficult optimal control\r\nproblems enforce strict pointwise bounds or other inequality constraints\r\non the control and state variables. Run-of-the-mill problems in this\r\ncategory can easily entail hundreds or thousands of variables with comparably\r\nmany constraints, and when cast in the currently accepted mathematical format,\r\nare often so badly scaled that the simplest and most readily implemented\r\niterative optimization methods are effectively incapacitated. The more\r\nsophisticated Newtonian and quasi-Newtonian algorithms do provide\r\ncomputational countermeasures for bad scaling near almost-singular local minimizers; however, Newtonian scaling procedures are costly and do not\r\nguarantee good nonlocal convergence properties while the iterates are still\r\nfar from a local minimizer.\r\n\r\nThe proposed investigation would address these issues with theoretical and\r\ncomputational evaluations of standard optimization schemes implemented in\r\na new nonstandard mathematical framework for optimal control problems\r\nwith pointwise state and control constraints. The alternative framework replaces local differential or difference forms of the state evolution equations by nonlocal integrated forms, and replaces state variables in the primal variable set by new artificial variables that coincide with the state when all constraints are met. Recent experiments with hybrid augmented Lagrangian projection methods outlined in this proposal indicate real and important analytical and computational advantages in the new formulation. The goal of the proposed study is to gain more experience with algorithm implementations in this setting, and to develop sharpened optimality conditions and other mathematical tools needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the observed behavior and improve the computational methods. Improvements in this area must have an immediate and significant practical impact, since large-scale computationally challenging optimal control problems arise in many physical settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
