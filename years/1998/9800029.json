 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project encompasses three lines of research, all related to  computational learning theory.  (1) The well-known ``probably  approximately correct'' (PAC) model of learning---and other  models---have provided a robust framework within which various  notions of learning have been formally analyzed.  However,  learning is a broad concept, and some senses of learning have not  been captured well by existing models.  This project develops a  framework for analyzing one such type of learning, that of  learning search-control rules within the context of task  planning.  In addition to developing this framework, lower and  upper bounds on learnability within the framework will be sought.  Based on preliminary work, graph-theoretic approaches appear to  be particularly promising in producing such bounds.  (2) Several  fundamental questions within existing learning models still  remain open.  Some of the best answers to related questions have  been obtained using Fourier analysis of function classes along  with associated Fourier-based algorithms. Thus, Fourier and other  techniques will be applied to several of these remaining  questions.  (3) Fourier-based algorithms that have been produced  thus far, while efficient in the sense of running in polynomial  time, are not used in practice in part because of somewhat large  exponents in the running time.  This project seeks to produce  algorithms with noticeably better running times.",
