 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for, \"Mechanisms of Homologous Pairing in Drosophila\"   Kent Golic, P.I.  - 9728070    The work described here is designed to characterize the mechanism of homologous chromosome pairing in mitotic cells of Drosophila rnelanogaster. Pairing will be examined in different tissues at different stages of development, in order to assemble a detailed picture of how cells manage to efficiently pair homologous sequences. The proposed experiments will determine whether pairing is a dynamic process that continues throughout interphase, and whether there are specific portions of the chromosomes that act to promote pairing. The influence of chromosome structure and the arrangement of chromosomes in the nucleus will be examined to determine whether these factors constrain the ability of chromosomal sequences to find and pair with homologous sequences elsewhere in the genome. In these experiments, the FLP site-specific recombinase and its target sites (FRTs) will be used to quantitate mitotic pairing, and the disruption of that pairing by chromosome rearrangements. The principal that underhes these experiments is that, in order to recombine, FRTs must pair, and that pairing must be brought about by normal cellular functions. By supplying the FLP recombinase to the cell in a controlled fashion, the levels of recombination that are detected must reflect the relative pairing of FRTs in different circumstances. Because FLP-mediated recombination is highly efficient, large amounts of data can be obtained with relative ease. In addition, FRT insertions can be used to assay pairing at many different sites throughout the genome.    Chromosome pairing is a fundamental feature of chromosome behavior in many types of cells. Homologous chromosome pairing is needed for meiotic recombination and the faithful segregation of homologs in Meiosis I. Double-strand breaks can be repaired by using homologous sequences as a template, and this clearly requires that the sequences be in close proximity. Ectopic pairing and re combination has been implicated in small scale and large scale genome rearrangemerit in evolution. Pairing of sequences at ectopic sites may also be involved in generating the recurrent chromosome rearrangements that are associated with some types of cancer. Ectopic pairing may also underlie phenomena of multi-copy suppression that have been observed in many organisms. The work to be undertaken will increase our understanding of the mechanisms that cells use to pair homologs. It will likely be possible to generalize the results to provide a better understanding of the mechanism that cells employ to bring together homologous DNA sequences. In addition, the proposed work will have practical benefits for the Drosophila community. A resource of approximately 100 insertions of specially designed FRT-bearing P elements, with locations and orientations determined, will be produced. These P elements can be used for making chromosome rearrangements, as targets for the FLP-mediated insertion of genes, and for mitotic recombination. Furthermore, methods to increase the efficiency of FLP-mediated DNA integration should result.",
