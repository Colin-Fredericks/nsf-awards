The investigator and his\r\ncoworkers are studying the fundamental group of three-\r\ndimensional manifolds asymptotically via the recursive\r\npatterns at infinity defined by those groups.  This approach\r\ntransfers difficult problems about three-dimensional spaces\r\nto difficult problems about recursive tiling patterns in \r\nthe two-dimensional sphere at infinity.  The patterns \r\nobtained are very attractive aesthetically and seem to\r\nsupply deep connections among three-manifold theory, the\r\ngeometry of three-manifolds, geometric and combinatorial\r\ngroup theory, circle packing, classical complex variable\r\ntheory, Teichmueller space theory, and the theory of Kleinian\r\nand Fuchsian groups, with potential connections as well to\r\nthe theories of iterated rational maps, tiling theory, \r\nBlaschke products, Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants, etc.\r\nThe initial theory was developed with essentially only one\r\naim in mind, namely to prove the conjecture that a discrete\r\ngroup is Kleinian if and only if it is negatively curved \r\nin the large (in the sense of Gromov) and has the two-dimensional\r\nsphere as its space at infinity.  An affirmative solution to this\r\nproblem would fill an important slot in Thurston's program\r\nto show that all three-manifolds admit a geometric structure.\r\nThe theory of recursive tilings of the plane and two-sphere\r\nis very rich and rewarding and is likely to have applications\r\nwell beyond its intended target.\r\n     Discrete group theory can be used to model physical motion,\r\ngeometric symmetries, and biological cell growth.  The generic\r\ndiscrete group is infinite and negatively curved in the\r\nlarge (Gromov and Olshanskii) and has a recursive self-\r\nsimilarity structure at infinity (Cannon).  One might\r\nalternatively say that the generic group casts fractal\r\nshadows at infinity.  The investigator and his coworkers\r\nare studying this fractal structure at infinity by using\r\nthe theory of conformal mappings to optimize the geometric\r\nshape of these shadows.  The results have application \r\nto the study of discrete groups, three-dimensional spaces,\r\ncomplex variables, computational group theory, and, potentially,\r\nto the theory of biological cell growth.\r\n***\r\n",
