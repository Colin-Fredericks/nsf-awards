 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY  Robert Dores    Gene duplication is a recurring theme in the evolution of  vertebrate polypeptide hormones and neuropeptides. These  duplication events lead to the formation of gene families in  which divergence of function is the usual outcome. In the  case of the opioid-coding genes, duplication events have  proceeded along two paths: a) an apparent duplication of  function (both Proenkephalin and Prodynorphin circuits  function as inhibitory networks in the central nervous  system); or b) divergence of function as seen in analgesic  activity of Proenkephalin and Prodynorphin products, as  compared to the heightened pain responsiveness (nociceptic)  activity of Pronociceptin products, or the melanocortin  (color change and chronic stress regulation) activity of  Proopiomelanocortin products. Are these duplication events  entirely random, or do they correspond to discrete points of  radiation of the vertebrates? This proposal develops the  hypothesis that the duplication-driven expansion of the  opioid-coding gene family (Proenkephalin, Prodynorphin,  Pronociceptin, and Proopiomelanocortin) corresponds to  periods when polyploidization (replication of the entire  genome) altered the course of vertebrate evolution. To  identify these \"burst\" periods, Dr Dores and colleagues have  combined a comparative approach with a molecular approach.  The species selected for this analysis (lungfish, urodele  amphibians, and a ancient lineage of anuran amphibians)  represent lineages that bracketed one of the predicted  genome duplication events (the rise of the lobed finned fish  and tetrapods in the Devonian). Thus, by taking a  comparative approach it is possible to select taxa that fit  into a logical phylogenetic hypothesis based on the fossil  record. By employing the molecular approach, it is possible  to test that hypothesis. In this study, the opioid-coding  gene family will be used as a model to analyze how natural  selection acts on duplicated genes to alter sequence, and  potenti ally alter function. The key to the molecular  approach is to focus on an ancestral character common to all  members of this gene family - the opioid core sequence  YGGF(M/L). By taking this approach, we have already detected  genes in ray-finned fish and lobe finned fish (previous  period of support) which were previously unsuspected. In  addition, novel opioid peptides have been revealed whose  opiate agonist potential has not been evaluated. While it is  appreciated that none of the taxa used in this study are a  \"living fossil,\" by taking a comparative/molecular approach  it is possible to reconstruct, through cladistic paradigms  (maximum parsimony), the most likely pathways which have  lead to the extant opioid-coding genes, and the potential  ramifications of these genes with respect to evolution of  neuronal circuits in the vertebrate central nervous system.",
