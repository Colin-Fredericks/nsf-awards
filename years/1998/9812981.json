In this way, the welding current passing through the work is thought to enhance the localized energy input. The scope of work addresses basics physics, novel process development, and process control issues. The experimental study will emphasize the fundamental understanding of the process in order to develop key technological foundations for implementation. This requires specific understanding of the power supply-torch-work-torch-power supply energy /material loop and the resulting heat affected zone.\r\n     The modeling techniques  are state-of-the-art for the process modeling. The investigator includes a plan to educate graduate students in both the fundamental science integration and the potential for industrial applications. The impact on industry should be significant and several industries are committed to providing equipment and engineering support for the future development of this novel process at a production level.",
