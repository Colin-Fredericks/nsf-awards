 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727547  Rayor  Earlier questions in tri-trophic theory focused on whether plants and insect predators function as mutualists or whether they have an antagonistic relationship as a result of negative effects of plant allelochemicals. However, it remains uncertain as to when these situations prevail. This research will determine when plant allelochemicals have a negative effect on insect predators by focusing on two of the major factors or conditions that affect insect predators: prey quality and prey quantity. No study has simultaneously addressed the effects of these factors on predator population growth and demography. The model system to be used in this research includes predatory wasps, caterpillars, and leaves that contain iridoid glycosides. The results of a series of experiments will determine when plant allelochemicals affect an insect predator, thus addressing the issue of mutualism vs. antagonism between plants and predators. Because current foraging theory and predator-prey population theory do not take into account the effects of plant allelochemicals on invertebrate predators, these reults will broaden understanding of a major constraint that most invertebrate predators must face. Furthermore, the results will indicate how prey species fare relative to others that differ in plant allelochemical concentrations.",
