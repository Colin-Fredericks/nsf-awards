Genetic studies of insects and  non-animal organisms have identified genes that code for many of  these molecular gears, but very few clock genes have been  identified in vertebrate animals. The goal of this project is to  understand how the components of the circadian system interact to  produce daily rhythms, and to determine how the clock is assembled  during embryonic development.       Recent work in this laboratory has demonstrated that clock  cells are located in the pineal gland and retina, and that these  cells release a hormone, melatonin, in a circadian rhythm.  Behavioral activity levels are also controlled by a biological  clock. The first major objective of this project is to determine  the causal relationships among these phenomena. Is behavioral  rhythmicity driven by melatonin rhythms, and is behavior regulated  by clocks in the pineal gland, the retinas or some other clock7 The  second objective is to determine when and how rhythms of melatonin  and behavior are initiated during development from a single cell  embryo to a fully formed vertebrate animal. Fish embryos are  fertilized and develop external to the mother. This allows  manipulation of physiological and environmental conditions to test  hypotheses about how the biological clocks that control melatonin  and behavior are initiated and set.       This initial characterization of the zebrafish circadian  system will provide the baseline information necessary to fully  exploit emerging zebrafish genetic information and technology in  future studies of  vertebrate circadian clock mechanisms.",
