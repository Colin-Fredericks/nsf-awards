 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increasing reliance on computers for virtually all  applications drives the need for provision of fault-  tolerance to prevent disruptions in the delivery of desired  services. However, approaches to fault-tolerance are  acceptable only if high costs and degradation in the system  performance is avoided. The checkpoint based fault recovery  schemes currently used are effective, but they necessitate  customized solutions and a high cost penalty, both  monetarily and in long recovery times.  A novel cache based  approach that provides for high-performance and low-cost  checkpointing based recovery in distributed systems will be  investigated. The principles of using caches for providing  stable checkpoints will be  established, and the  architectural concepts will be developed. The research  focuses on developing techniques to analyze and control the  cache attributes of stability and frequency of  checkpoints, and establishing response/overhead  characteristics. Protocols for cache based recovery (roll-  backward and roll-forward) over varied fault instances will  be developed and analyzed. This research will utilize  existing system caches in order to provide for automatic  checkpoint establishment and for a low-overhead fault  recovery approach which is explicitly transparent in use to  the user/OS; thus a viable and effective fault tolerance  scheme for general computing systems will be developed.",
