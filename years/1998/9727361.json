 "awd_abstract_narration": "Susan Tucker is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue her studies of density   inhomogeneities in supercritical fluids and their effects on solute   reactions.  Supercritical fluids are industrially important as   environmentally benign solvents for carrying out chemical reactions.    Tucker will investigate, using molecular dynamics modeling, the way in   which various density inhomogeneities affect reaction dynamics.  More   specifically she will seek to answer the following questions: 1) How do   solvent density inhomogeneities affect solute reaction dynamics?  2)   Which are the relevant processes controlling the reactive event?  3)   Under what conditions are enhanced solute-solute distributions expected?    and  4) What influence will these distributions have upon solute reaction   dynamics?  Supercritical fluids have recently received widespread attention as   potential solvents for use in industrial chemical processes, even though   reactivity in these solvents is not yet well understood.  The excitement   over supercritical fluid solvents arises because the solvating properties   of these fluids may be altered dramatically and continuously with modest   changes in temperature and pressure.  This tunability suggests that it   may be possible to conduct a wide variety of chemical reactions in   environmentally benign solvents such as supercritical water or carbon   dioxide.  Tucker's work seeks to understand the unique features of   supercritical fluid solvation at the molecular level.  This understanding   can lead to an improved understanding of how supercritical fluids can be   more widely employed in environmentally benign industrial syntheses.",
