 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9801034  Graf  The Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project from EDVOTEK, Inc. builds on studies completed in Phase I for the development of classroom plant-based science experiments, software and resources.  These plant science resources will be designed for integration in high school and college science courses; computer-based tools will complement these resources.  A major objective is to develop 'hands-on' and 'minds-on' experiments that build upon students' prior knowledge.  The project will entail qualifying Arabidopsis strains for establishing an educational seed center.  It will also involve selecting for development experiments that are currently presented in textbooks but not in manuals, as well as plant science biotechnology experiments.  Research and development for computer software (GenScope) and CD-ROM plant images will also be continued.  Two faculty workshops will be organized and conducted to field test and evaluate prototype experiments and software.  Participating faculty will be provided with take-home materials to incorporate in their classrooms, and they will provide the appropriate feedback.  Evaluation and assessment of prototype products will be initiated at the workshop using assessment tools that will be developed for determining teaching and learning objectives.  Information obtained will be incorporated in product development and final product for commercialization.  This project proffers new plant science laboratory activities which are an essential part of biology education, and it also fills the need for a biotech education seed center.  Knowledge of plants is not only essential to food production but also to the development new products that are useful in ecology, energy, and medicine.  ***",
