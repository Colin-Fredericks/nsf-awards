 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726205  Strand    This award supports a two year collaborative research  project between Professor Michael Strand of the University  of Wisconsin and Professor Yoichi Hyakawa of Hokkaido  University in Japan.  The researchers will undertake a study  of novel multifunctional peptides in insects and their role  in cellular immunity.  The investigators believe that the  biological activities reported for PSPl and GBP reflect a  multifunctional role for this family of peptides in response  to invasion by infectious agents.  They plan to characterize  the function of these peptides in insect immunity.  The  specific objectives are:  (l) compare the functional  activities of PSPl and GBP in P.includens and P.separata;  (2) isolate a PSPl cDNA and characterize its expression  during wounding and encapsulation; and (3) develop an in  vitro system for production of PSPl/GBP and investigate its  processing.  The long-range goal of the research is to  understand the function of these peptides in invertebrate  immunity.     This project brings together the efforts of two  laboratories that have complementary expertise, research  capabilities and equipment.  Both researchers were studying  different biological processes related to parasitism in  larvae of noctuid moths and converged upon the same  hemolymph peptide as the biological effector molecule for  stimulating plasmatocyte spreading and for retarding  development through altering juvenile hormone level.  The  planned experiments will enable the researchers to work  together to understand the functions of this family of  peptides.  Events associated with formation of hemocyte  clots and capsules are fundamentally conserved across most  insects and many other invertebrates.  Therefore, results of  this research will be relevant to many taxa and will provide  an important foundation for future comparative studies.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project  will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote  international understandin g and cooperation.  ***",
