 "awd_abstract_narration": "9732592  Abhyankar    Various Recognition Theorems of Group Theory provide powerful tools for  computing Galois groups. They also provide suggestive guidelines for  constructing explicit equations with assigned Galois groups, i.e., for solving  various Inverse Galois Problems. It is proposed to continue using this method to get information on the algebraic fundamental groups of algebraic and  arithmetical varieties. Some of these Recognition Theorems are based on the Classification of Finite Simple Groups. Some others use the Classification of Polar Spaces. Still some others use the older techniques of finding Limits of Transitivity. Another fertile application area for these Recognition Theorems is in Hilbert's Thirteenth Problem about composite functions. Yet another such application area lies in the direction of Permutation Polynomials and Exceptional Polynomials.        This research is in the combination of the fields of algebraic geometry and group theory. Although they are amongst the oldest parts of modern  mathematics, both these fields have had a revolutionary flowering in the past  fifty years. In its origin, algebraic geometry treated figures that could be  defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Likewise. group theory had its origin in the study of symmetries. Nowadays, both these fields make use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and  topology, and conversely they are finding applications in those fields as well  as in physics, theoretical computer science and robotics.  Moreover, an interplay between algebraic geometry and group theory continues to enrich both these disciplines.",
