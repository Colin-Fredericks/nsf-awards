Kenneth Perlin and Robert Rowe of New York  University to work with Professor Jodo Antonio Zuffo at the  Laboratorio de Sistemas Integraveis da Escola Politecnica  (LSI-USP) at the University of Sao Paulo and with Professor  Mauricio V. Kritz at the Laboratorio Nacional de Computacao  Cientifica (LNCC) in Rio de Janeiro, as well as with  Professor Luiz Velho at Instituto de Matematica Pura e  Aplicada (IMPA) in Brazil on multi-media research.  Specifically they will work with two major software  platforms, Pad and Improv, creating believable embodied  agents combining procedural animation techniques, behavioral  scripting, and distributed environments.  The Experimental  and Integrated Activities Program of the Computer and  Information Science and Engineering Division is providing  part of the support.    This collaboration continues a relationship among colleagues  from three labs in Brazil, which was started in 1992 by  Perlin.  Perlin's work with IMPA involves an investigation  of procedural multiresolution paint textures involving Pad,  which provides a mechanism to generate a large number of  details with a simple and compact representation.  With  LNCC, they are working on recursive hypergraph  representation to model interactions in biological systems.  NYU and LSI-USP are working on an integration of their  animation research with their work on multimodal input and  output devices.  The project will involve graduate students  from both sides in the collaboration.  ***",
