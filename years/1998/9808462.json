 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Electronic Field Guide (EFG) project will provide a web-  accessible distributed object oriented database for the  identification of biological specimens from field  observations. The data, including both taxonomic and  environmental or ecological data, wi  ll aid in iden-  tification by building a context for each observation. The  database will also support the recording of multiple  observations, so that larger-scale ecological studies can be  carried o  ut using the data. This project will complement the  traditional book format field guides, and extend their utility  by addressing certain problems inherent to the format. These  prob-lems include long time lags in preparation, expense of  production, and the   broad geo-graphic scope usually  necessitated by economic considerations. EFG exploits the  flexibility and the ease of updating inherent to the  electronic format.    This project will complement the traditional book format field  guides, and extend their utili  ty by addressing certain  problems inherent to the format. These problems include long  time lags in preparation, expense of production, and the broad  geographic scope usually necessitated by economic  considerations. EFG exploits the flexibility and the eas  e of  updating inherent to the electronic format.    EFG will use Object Oriented Database technology to provide  mechanisms by which biol-ogists can extend the description of  the data itself to include the ecological and taxonomic  attributes they deem appropri  ate to the particular  collection of species they wish in the database. The  underlying descriptions will be specified in the ACS Reference  Model for Biological Collections. These descriptions will  allow multiple EFGs to connect to one another or to other d  atabases, using protocols which will be developed, tested and  pub-lished.    The EFG software design rigorously separates the data models  from the database and from the user interface, thereby  supporting multiple views of the data for differing  research  and e  ducational purposes. Demonstration of this separation  is a key goal of the project. Ini-tially, EFG will be deployed  in Monteverde, Costa Rica, to record the 700 species of but-  terflies and 3000 species of plants in their environment. The  utility of the r  esulting database will be evaluated in  relation to traditional book-based identification.",
