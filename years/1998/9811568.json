 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to examine empirically the effects of  emerging computing and communications technologies on the performance of  globally distributed teams engaged in a specific type of collaborative  work - engineering design.  The primary objective is to investigate how  social and cultural factors shape usage and effects of collaborative tools, and in particular shape distributed team communication processes  and team performance.  Design teams comprised of engineering students  affiliated with a consortium of institutions in Asia, Europe and North  America, and engineers working with our industrial partners are provided  with collaboration tools.  Surveys and thorough interviews with team  members before, during and after project work highlight the interactions between distributed group communication and knowledge distribution  processes, computer-mediated communication supports, and cultural  factors.  The results of this research will provide new approaches for  using computer-based communication and collaboration tools to help  distributed groups overcome problems associated with extreme geographic  dispersion and cultural differences.  A particular application of the research is to improve the likelihood of success of teams comprised of  members from differing regions of the world who remain in their home  locations.  It thus has applications for international engineering  design, engineering education, and collaborative systems development.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://cscw.msu.edu\r\n\r\n\r\n",
