These meetings bring together a select group of the nation's emerging engineering leaders from industry, academia, and government labs to discuss pioneering technical work and leading edge research in various engineering fields and industry sectors.  The goal of the symposia is to introduce these outstanding engineers to each other, and through this interaction facilitate collaboration in engineering, the transfer of new techniques and approaches across fields, and establishment of contacts among the next generation of engineering leaders.    Three Frontiers of Engineering symposia have been held since 1995 during the third week of  September at the Academies' Beckman Center in Irvine, California.  NAE will conduct a fourth symposium using funds from NSF, possibly supplemented by funds from other Federal agencies, which will allow additional person to be included.",
