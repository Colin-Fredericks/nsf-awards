 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Prof. Robert W.   Field of Massachusetts Institute of Technology in his continuing   investigation of `scaling laws,` a priori known functions of quantum   numbers. Such scaling laws arise when the coupling between parts of a   molecule becomes sufficiently weak. For example, many properties of   hydrogenic eigenstates can be expressed as simple functions of Z, n and   l. Many atom-based scaling relationships remain useful and instructive,   even for polyatomic molecules; for core-nonpenetrating molecular Rydberg   states, in which the coupling between Rydberg electron and the molecular   ion-core is very weak, the resemblance to hydrogenic systems is quite   strong.  Field will undertake various types of experiments involving   either resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization or multiple resonance   spectroscopies in an effort to develop experimental methods for   spectroscopic studies of core-nonpenetrating molecular Rydberg states.    These studies will yield information on the electric anisotropies and   polarizabilities of molecular ion cores.    A few comments about the practical significance of these experiments are   warranted.  Why should we care about the electric multipole moments of   cations?  All +1 cations have the same monopole, so this dominant aspect   of the interaction of the cation with the outside world is independent of   the molecule.  Ion-specific long-range interactions, on the other hand,   derive from the higher multipoles (and their normal coordinate   displacement derivatives).  These multipoles and derivatives control the   mechanisms and rates of resonant long-range ion-molecule, ion-electron,   and possibly ion-surface energy and angular momentum exchange.  The   information obtainable from systematic studies of core-nonpenetrating   Rydberg states would yield valuable insights into a wide variety of   processes occurring in plasmas.",
