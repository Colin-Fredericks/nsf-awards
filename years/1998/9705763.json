 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program, focuses on the study of the coordination  chemistry of odd-electron organometallic systems and metal-olefin  complexes.  Professor Weber and his students at the University  Vermont will use a variety of electrochemical and  spectroelectrochemical methods together with electron paramagnetic  resonance spectroscopy in this work.  The organometallic systems to  be studied include cyclopentdienyl and tris-(pyrazolyl)borate  ligand complexes and these compounds have relevance to applications  involving electronic devices.  Metal-olefin complexes will be  studied to better understand Ziegler-Natta catalysis and to search  for ways to enhance the reactivities of these materials.  The electron transfer properties of organometallic  complexes,  while extensively studied, remain poorly correlated with the  ability of these compounds to catalyze selective molecular  transformations.  Odd-electron metal complexes will be the focus of  this work in order to further understanding of these reactions so  that they can be better exploited as catalysts and electronic  devices.  Electrochemical and spectroscopic methods will be used in  this work.",
