 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to improve the quality of computer graphic  images of outdoor, natural scenes.  To date, renderings of  outdoor terrain have had a cartoon-like quality that  significantly distracts from a sense of realism.  Partially, this  is due to computational and source data constraints that limit  the geometric complexity of terrain that can be rendered.  The  thesis of the research described here is that illumination and  material properties play an equally important role in creating a  sense of realism from these scenes.  Moreover, there are  important interactions between geometry, illumination, and  material properties in a model of outdoor terrain that should be  understood when real-time constraints must also be satisfied.    Significant progress has been made in the last decade in  understanding how to generate realistic renderings of indoor  scenes.  The general approach is to analyze the physics of light  transport in such environments and then to embody approximations  to the physics in computational algorithms.  Correct modeling of  illumination and material properties is vital.  It is now known  that a sense of realism depends critically on accounting for  shadows, secondary illumination, and non-uniform reflectance  functions.  Accurately approximating the effect of these  properties involves great computational expense.  As a result,  methods for rendering realistic imagery almost always exploit  assumptions about the nature of the geometric structure and  illumination and materials properties likely to be encountered.  Most of these assumptions derive from a presumption of indoor  environments.    Outdoor scenes present very different computational  characteristics.  While the physics is the same, geometry,  illumination, and reflectance properties are all distinctly  different.  Many of the techniques developed to support realistic  rendering of indoor scenes will require substantial modifications  for natural, outdoor environments.  The most  difficult computational prob lem to overcome is the need to be  able to aggregate the effects of micro-structures into large  enough units that they can be rendered effectively, while at the  same time preserving key aspects of visual appearance.  This  problem exists across a wide range of scales, ranging from  foliage, in which a collection of individual leaves generates a  collective appearance that is quite different than that of the  constituent members, to distant landmarks, where detail must be  suppressed without removing those properties that make landmarks  distinctive and thus useful.",
