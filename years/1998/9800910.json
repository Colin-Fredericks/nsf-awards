 "awd_abstract_narration": "Billera\r\n9800910\r\n\r\nResearch on this project will involve the use of algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial methods to attack fundamental questions involving convex polytopes and their subdivisions.  Questions considered involve enumerative properties of general polytopes and arrangements of hyperplanes and structures on the set of all subdivisions.  A major focus will be to move closer to a characterization of the numbers of faces and chains of faces in polytopes and arrangements, as well as to obtain information on the structure of the set of all triangulations of a fixed point set.  The type of enumerative information being sought here has been of use in the design of geometric algorithms for problems in robotics and motion planning, and recently has come into play in the analysis of randomization schemes for the management of data.  Questions involving the structure of all triangulations have been raised repeatedly in  a variety of practical settings, ranging from condensed matter physics to computer-aided design.\r\n\r\nThis research is in the area of combinatorics.  One of the goals of combinatorics is to find efficient methods for manipulating and enumerating discrete collections of objects.  The behavior of discrete systems is extremely  important to modern communications.  For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in  computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of  combinatorial research.",
