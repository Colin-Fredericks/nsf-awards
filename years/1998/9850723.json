 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will have an immediate impact on our students majoring in biology, enabling the University to develop an undergraduate sophomore/junior/level cell biology course. Advanced microscopy laboratories employing fluorescence microscopes equipped with contrast-enhancing optics, video image acquisition and analysis systems are being developed for cell biology and our courses in immunology, medical microbiology, microbiology, physiology and molecular biology. These new exercises take special advantage of many of the exciting new fluorescent probes available for studying living and fixed cells. These activities will increase the \"hands-on\" participation of our students in project-oriented laboratories. In many instances students will work on investigative projects designed to employ the advanced features of these microscopes. The results will be a significant revitalization of the biology laboratory curricula. The University is contributing an amount equal to the award.",
