 "awd_abstract_narration": "9806810  Frydman    This project focuses on studies of the order, structure and  dynamics adopted by liquid crystalline polymers. These are  important macromolecules with numerous practical applications as  structural materials and in optoelectronic devices. Their  usefulness derives from special characteristics including a  superior thermal and chemical stability, a tendency to aggregate  into ordered domains when appropriately dissolved or molten, and  an ability to retain these anisotropic arrangements upon being  frozen or coagulated into solids. Using a variety of oneand  multi-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques,  this research proposes further characterizations of these  macromolecules in both their solid and fluid phases. A common  feature of the proposed experiments is their reliance on natural  abundance spin probes, an approach which imposes no  preconditions on the types of samples to be analyzed. In order  to deal with the spectral complexities arising when using such  techniques, new protocols will be developed involving the  collection of data in coordination with well defined sample  reorientations with respect to the NMR magoetic field. This will  enable atomic level characterizations of numerous complex liquid  crystalline polymers including commercial thermotropic  polyesters and their polyrner blends, polymers incorporating  fluorinated probes, new types of Iyotropic polyamidcs, and  thermotropic polymers characterized by the inclusion of metal  centers. These measurements will help elucidate the complex  rotational isomerisms occurring in these systems, and clarify  the possibility of chemically controlling their macromolecular  alignment. New MNR experiments will also be exploited to  investigate the rotational and viscoelastic dynamics of these  polymers in their rnelt, to monitor how these fluids change  their order upon freezing/coagulating into solids, as well as  the nature of the macromolecular relaxation processes  characterizing the resulting  glasses.  %%%  It is expected that as a result of these studies, a new and  deeper understanding on the atomic- and molecular-level behavior  of liquid crystalline polymers will result. This in turn should  provide valuable knowledge for improving the practical  characteristics of these novel kinds of commercial materials. It  is also anticipated that this research will enable a thorough  training of scientists familiar in thc application of advanced  spectroscopy to polymer research at postdoctoral, graduate and  undergraduate levels.  ***",
