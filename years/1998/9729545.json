The primary focus of the conference is to  discuss new research on the neuronal basis for locomotion in  higher vertebrates, including man.  As an introductory  overview, the best understood vertebrate and invertebrate  preparations are presented , followed by a session on spinal  locomotor networks in higher vertebrates. The second day  highlights  sessions on neurotransmitter control of pattern  generating networks, sensory inputs to these generators,  modeling of well understood networks, and molecular  biological approaches to understanding neural network  function and modulation. On the final day, the sessions  cover various developmental and comparative approaches to  study rhythmic locomotion and clinical applications of  spinal locomotor network analysis in animals and man.  A  final panel discussion is charged with generating general  principles for rhythmic pattern generation and discussion of  fruitful avenues for future research.                          LAY ABSTRACT                                  Principal Investigator:  Herron, Paul  Proposal Number:         IBN-9729545    Effects of Progressive Periods of Cholinergic Depletion on  Brain and Behavior         The brain neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, has been  suggested to play a major role in the adaptive response of  the brain to sensory and cognitive experiences. The purpose  of this research is to determine the consequences of  selective depletion of acetylcholine on brain structure,  function, and behavior. This research will enable an  understanding of the role of acetylcholine on the underlying  brain circuitry and quantity of synapses in the cortex; the  neural activity of  single neurons in the cortex; and the  mechanism of  learning and memory. Results show how brain  structure, brain function and behavior are degraded when  acetylcholine is not present at certain levels. This  work  is  important for providing a better understanding  of  the  adaptive and maintenance roles of acetylcholine in sensory  perception as well as learning and memory.",
