 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trident Technical College's Intermediate Algebra is a math \"bridge\" course that prepares students for College Algebra. Most new students at Trident are required to take Intermediate Algebra because they lack adequate skills to take College Algebra. College Algebra is considered a 'gatekeeper\" course since it is a requirement for many of the other math and engineering courses offered at Trident. Class sizes and limited technology induce Trident to use a lecture based instructional method for Intermediate Algebra courses. The lecture-based approach does not meet the needs of the various learning styles and mathematical ability levels represented by Intermediate Algebra students, thus only one in two students pass the course.    The College is eliminating the current lecture-based approach used in Intermediate Algebra and creating a learning environment to improve student success in Intermediate Algebra and better preparing students for College Algebra. By redesigning the delivery, the project is addressing major areas of mathematical reform and creating a Mediated Learning Mathematics Lab supporting interactive algebra software.    The mediated learning environment allows students with diverse learning styles to learn the material according to their individual learning styles and mathematical ability levels. Faculty utilize small group cooperative learning activities to support instruction. Faculty use specific writing activities to solicit student feedback through software \"E-mail\" and \"on-line journal\" features. Instructors use these features, other software management tools and increased student-instructor interaction to monitor student and adjust instruction to address problem areas. Faculty are receiving extensive training to prepare them to teach this newly designed course.    Project deliverables include a project Implementation Manual to be used by Trident faculty and other colleges interested in implementing the reform course, and a student training manual: How to Succeed in College Mat h to help students understand and use learning strategies.",
