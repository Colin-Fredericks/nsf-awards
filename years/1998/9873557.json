The mini-symposia will introduce  prospective  investigators to the state-of-the-science in  these increasingly important areas of biomedical engineering  research.    Support is being provided to cover partial travel costs for  15 speaker-participants in the mini-symposia.  Individuals  who receive support are to be selected based on the  following criteria: participation in the mini-symposia;  young investigators; diversity (gender; minority; disabled);  organizers.    Participants in the mini-symposia will learn about current  research that will contribute to the development of  technologies that will lead to new applications in medicine.  Each recipient of support is to submit a report to the  Division of Bioengineering and Environmental Systems  describing the research discussed at the mini-symposia  having the greatest potential for dramatically influencing  the development of new medical technologies.  ***",
