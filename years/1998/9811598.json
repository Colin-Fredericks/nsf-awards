 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southwestern Research Station (SWRS) of the American  Museum of Natural History (AMNH) was established in 1955  and is located in southeastern Arizona.  There it offers  field biologists, from numerous U.S. and international  institutions, a modern research facility with access to a  wide range of biological communities.  The primary  objective of the Station is to provide accommodations and  scientific to support the activities of scientists,  graduate students, undergraduate courses, scientific  meetings, and workshops.  One measure of institutional  success the SWRS has achieved over the years is the body  of scientific generated at the Station, over 900  publications in peer review journals.    The main House building at the SWRS contains a dining  room, where scientists, students, and staff share meals  and exchange ideas, and a lounge/lecture room where  scientific presentations, classes, etc. occur.  The  current facility is small and overcrowded, which impedes  its ability to serve these functions well.    The renovations encompassed by this project are aimed at  1) alleviating a facilities bottleneck in the ability of  the SWRS to significantly improve the environment for the  intellectual exchanges between the scientists and students  utilizing the Station from across the country, and 2)  increasing the ability of the Station to serve as a  meeting site for regional, national, and international  scientific meetings and workshops.  Thus, the proposed  building renovation will enhance the activities of all  scientists and students utilizing the Station.  Changes in  the Main House will expand the seating capacity of the  dining room from 62 to 82 and will improve its acoustics,  and the lounge/lecture room (current capacity 30)  will be enlarged to become a lecture hall facility that  will have seating capacity for 100 people.  The modernized  dining room, where everyone at the Station eats, will have  an environment conducive to the exchange of ideas between  established scientists,  graduate students, undergraduate  SWRS volunteers, undergraduates in university classes,  meeting and workshop participants, and naturalists.  The  lecture hall will (1) continue to fulfill its role as a  lounge/casual meeting area, (2) afford ample space  (currently extremely crowded) for the 40+/- seminars held  on a regular basis by and for residents at the Station,  and (3) provide a meeting area for larger groups of  scientists coming to the Station for meetings, workshops,  and retreats.    The additional capacity will allow the SWRS to improve and  expand its role as a leading national center  for biological research and education in the Southwest.  The positive impact on the quality of research  at the Station will come about through conditions  that  promote additional collaborations between visiting  scientists, and b integrating the research activities and  results into the informal and formal education programs.",
