 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Lauterbach - 9733821    Prof. Jochen Lauterbach or Purdue University will follow mesoscopic spatio-temporal dynamics of catalytic surfaces with in-situ high-resolution methods based on imaging ellipsometry, IR vibrational, and second-order non-linear optical spectroscopy. The main objective is to identify periodic phenomena that occur because of nonlinear coupling of effects due to mesoscopic features such as surface heterogeneity or site diversity. The potentially synergistic effects will be exploited to conceive new catalysts based on tailored surface heterogeneity. CO and hydrocarbon oxidation simultaneously with NOx reduction will be studied on Rh-BaO-Pt catalyst surfaces microfabricated with spatially resolved compositional difference, or CeO2 on Pt and Cu foils, under reaction conditions resembling automobile exhaust catalysis. External forcing of reaction-diffusion systems will be effected by pulsed IR laser heating, leading to better understanding of resonant forcing effects on CO oxidation, and to unsteady state reactor operation in general. Modeling and simulation of reaction, diffusion, and pattern formation will also be carried out. A second reaction system to be investigated is spatially resolved photoinduced polymerization, which may lead to new compositionally modulated thin polymeric films. UV-initiated, mask-shadowed, gas-phase polymerization of acrolein, methacrolein, and styrene on various transition metal surfaces (Ag, Cu, Pt), will be followed up to a micron thickness by SSHG, which is sensitive to interfacial structure. Likewise, the bonding, electronic, and structural details during the initial polymerization steps will be studied under high vacuum conditions with IR absorption or SFG simultaneously with EMSI or SSHG. This research links electronic, molecular, mesoscopic and macroscopic parameters for reaction-diffusion phenomena that are important in various areas: catalysis, semiconductor manufacturing, biological and polymeric coating deposition. At the educa tional level, Prof. Lauterbach will renew the chemical engineering laboratory courses with experiments in surface chemistry, catalysis, nanoscale mechanics, polymer engineering, holography, and optical engineering, coupled with newer evaluation and teaching methods based on interactive electronic media.",
