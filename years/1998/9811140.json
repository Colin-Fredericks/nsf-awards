 "awd_abstract_narration": "Longitudinal studies of modern human and Rhesus macaque crania have revealed the significance of bone remodeling during growth in the establishment of the adult form.  From these studies has emerged the regional growth field concept, which indicates that craniofacial form is generated by variation in a combination of bone remodeling fields.  Despite considerable explanatory potential, the regional growth field concept has received little attention in evolutionary studies.  This is due in part to the absence of reliable techniques for characterizing the activities of remodeling fields in archaeological and fossil samples.   In recent years a non-destructive method of characterizing surface remodeling activities in archaeological and fossil samples has become available.  The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/replica technique involves examination of high-resolution replicas of immature bone under the SEM in order to identify the last active remodeling state of the bone.  The objective of this research project is to determine if quantitative information about the rate of bone remodeling can be extracted reliably from SEM images of dry bone surfaces.  Histological studies of immature cranial bone indicates that the rate of surface bone deposition is quantifiable on the basis of the density of vascular canals present on the bone surface, while rate of bone resorption is believed to be represented by the size of resorption 'pits' on the bone surface.  These surface bone features are visible and scorable under the SEM.  Rates of bone remodeling activity will be quantified using this approach along the nasal and oral surfaces of the bony palate of immature chimp crania.  If the SEM/replica technique proves capable of providing information on remodeling rate, it will have important implications in determining inter-specific variation in adult form, both in contemporary species, and in the fossil record.",
