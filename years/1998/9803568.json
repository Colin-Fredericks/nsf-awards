Hile    TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION  ---------------------  The research in this project focuses on the development of efficient  computational electromagnetic methods that will be utilized to gain a  fundamental understanding of (1) ultrashort pulse propagation in nonlinear  optical fibers and devices and (2) microwave material processing systems.  The  first project focuses on understanding the behavior of ultrashort pulse  propagation in nonlinear optics fibers and devices by (1) developing  computational solutions of Maxwell's equations and (2) determining the extent to  which asymptotic envelope approximations can be used to describe these pulses.  Specifically, we develop computational solutions of Maxwell's equations to  understand the behavior of one-dimensional pulse propagation near the zero  dispersion wavelength in dispersion-shifted optical fibers and to understand the  behavior of two-dimensional pulse propagation of ultrashort spatial solitons.  In parallel with this, we derive corresponding envelope equations and determine  the extent to which these more simplified equations can be used to model  ultrashort pulse propagation near the zero dispersion wavelength and  two-dimensional pulse propagation of ultrashort spatial solitons.  The second  project focuses on the development of efficient hybrid numerical methods to  model microwave material processing in single- and multi-mode cavity heating  systems.  We will begin by developing an efficient hybrid numerical method to  model the electromagnetic interaction of a low-loss ceramic in a high-Q  single-mode waveguide applicator.  Finally, we will extend these ideas to create  a hybrid numerical method for modeling high-Q multi-mode cavity heating systems.    NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION  -------------------------  The research in this project focuses on the development of efficient  computational electromagnetic methods that will be utilized to gain a  fundamental understanding of (1) ultrashort pulse propagation in  nonlinear  optical fibers and devices and (2) microwave material processing systems.  Understanding these complex phenomena and processes is essential for the  development of new optical technologies and the industrial production of high  quality materials and products.  The first aspect of this project focuses on  understanding the behavior of ultrashort pulse propagation in nonlinear optics  fibers and devices by (1) developing computational solutions of Maxwell's  equations and (2) determining the extent to which asymptotic envelope  approximations can be used to describe these pulses.  The second aspect of this  project focuses on the development of efficient hybrid numerical methods to  model microwave material processing in single- and multi-mode cavity heating  systems.  These numerical methods will provide detailed knowledge of the  interaction between the waveguide applicator, the electromagnetics fields and  the ceramic in these microwave heating systems.  Detailed knowledge of this  interaction will lead to a more complete characterization of the heating process  and thereby help to prevent nonuniform heating and lead to future optimizations  of the heating process.",
