 "awd_abstract_narration": "REICHSTEIN,  DMS 98-01675    The proposed research includes two related projects:  The purpose of the first project is to study the minimal  number of parameters required to describe all algebraic objects of   a certain type, e.g., field extensions, central simple algebras or  quadratic forms. This number can usually be expressed as a numerical  invariant of a naturally arising algebraic group. This invariant is called  the essential dimension. It has been computed in a number   of cases by J. Buhler and the PI;  additional results were recently   obtained by J.- P. Serre.  The PI will continue this line of   research through a combination of our geometric techniques and  Serre's cohomological approach.The second project focuses on the study of finite-dimensional algebras and their deformations. Such an algebra can be represented  by a set of structure constants, which can, in turn be identified  with a point of a certain algebraic variety. L. LeBruyn and the PI   recently described all smooth irreducible components of this variety,   answering, in particular, an old question of Seshadri.    A number of of fundamental objects of classical abstract algebra, such as field extensions,   division rings, and quadratic forms will  be investigated. Some of these and related  objects have recently found applications in areas ranging from coding theory to computer graphics. The aim of this project is to increase our theoretical understanding of   of the nature of these objects. In particular, the most   economical ways of representing them are sought. In this connection  the smallest number of parameters required to represent an object   of a given type are studied.  This number tells us how many objects of each   type are ``essentially different'', i.e., cannot be transformed into   one another by a change of coordinates.",
