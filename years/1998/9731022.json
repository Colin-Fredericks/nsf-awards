 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731022  Villalobos    This award will support a U. S.-Mexico program development  workshop on research and educational opportunities in  manufacturing.  Organized by Prof. Rene Villalobos of the  University of Texas at El Paso and Prof. Louis Martin Vega  from Lehigh University for the U.S. side, and Prof. Eugenio  Garcia of the Instituto Tecnologico de Monterrey and Prof.  Felipe Rubio of the Centro de Investigacion y Asistencia  Tecnica del Estado de Queretaro for the Mexican side, the  workshop will serve to identify opportunities for joint  research between the academic and industrial communities in  both countries and as a catalyst for the development of  academic/governmental/industrial partnerships.    The links in the area of manufacturing between the United  States and Mexico are becoming stronger.  The evolution of  manufacturing in the United States, the increased presence  of Mexican companies in the U.S. market, and the  implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA) are all conducive to the expansion of integrated  manufacturing operations between the two countries.  For  these reasons, the NSF and the Mexican National Council for  Science and Technology (CONACYT) have agreed to support this  program development workshop with the expectation that it  will arrive at a set of recommendations that will be useful  to both agencies and to others concerning the manufacturing  arena.  The activity is being jointly funded on the NSF side  by the Division of Design, Manufacture, & Industrial  Innovation (DMII) and the Division of International  Programs.  ***",
