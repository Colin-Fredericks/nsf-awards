 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the co-evolution of organizations and careers in the American magazine industry before the Civil War.  The modern era has been dominated by formal organizations, which have considerable power to determine the lives of individuals. But at the same time, these formal organizational comprise their individual members; hence, organizational members can collectively shape organizations. For decades, sociologists have pondered the question of how formal organizations affect their employees and how, in turn, employees influence organizations. This project will augment our knowledge of organization-employee relations by using the empirical case of the magazine industry to answer two basic questions: (1) How do individual employees contribute to organizational resources that, in turn, improve organizational activities, performance, and ultimately organizational survival chances? (2) How do the changing structures of industries and their constituent organizations alter the career paths of industry employees? Answering these questions will fill gaps in both organizational theory and the literature on careers.     First, this project will develop and test a theory of how the resources accruing to individuals from their human and social capital combine to affect the capabilities and thus the fates of entire organizations. Second, it will expand our knowledge of how organizational dynamics - organizational founding, growth, change, and failure - create and destroy jobs wholesale and so radically alter the opportunity structures facing individuals.    To test relationships concerning the co-evolution of organizations and employees' careers, this project will collect and analyze data on the magazine-publishing industry and its employees from its inception in 1741 to the Civil War.  Data will be drawn from publicly-available archives in the Library of Congress, the New York City Public Library, and various university libraries, to create three longitudinal data bases, one each for magazine-publ ishing companies, magazines, and magazine-industry employees. A variety of econometric techniques - event-history analysis, event-count analysis, and pooled time-series regression - will be used to analyze the dynamics of magazine-publishing organizations and their employees. These quantitative data and analyses will be supplemented with a systematic qualitative analysis of the abundant historical data sources.    In addition to answering key questions about reciprocal and dynamic relations between organizations and employees, this project will shed light on how industry-level change affects the structure of opportunity. By focusing on the early magazine industry in America, it will examine how economic and technological revolutions that transformed the face of publishing reconfigured the pathways to upward mobility for generations of Americans.  From this study of the American past will come insights about the relationship between organizations and individuals, and between social capital and human capital, that will strengthen our understanding of the policy choices we face today in the areas of organizations and occupational careers.",
