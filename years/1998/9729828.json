The first project integrates compile-time and run-time parallelization techniques focusing on loops with non-linear subscripts on a cluster of SMPs. An implementation of APE will reduce the execution time for various scientific and engineering applications. The second project serves radiation therapy where current computer assisted optimization techniques are too slow or too expensive to be adopted in  clinical practice.  Genetic algorithms will be used to optimize the dosage. A real-time cost effective implementation on a cluster of multiprocessors will make the planning process applicable in clinical practice.  The third project encounters the bottleneck in parallel implementation of 3D Cone Beam Tomography technique on ethernet in the low bandwidth of the network.  Using the  virtual connectivity provided by ATM, the multiphase broadcast can be efficiently implemented.  Results from this implementation will apply to other problems like volumetric imaging applications and finite element analysis of 3D structures. The last project utilizes profile data from various applications to enable sources to request just the necessary bandwidth and facilitate fair allocation of bandwidth. It  will permit a better utilization of the network resources and improve the application perf ormance.",
