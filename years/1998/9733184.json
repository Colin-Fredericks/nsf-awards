 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9733184  Von Jouanne   Power Quality (PQ) is becoming an ever increasing concern with the growth of both sensitive and disturbing loads in the residential, commercial and industrial levels of the power system, and the current movement toward deregulation in the electric utility industry.  With the increased attention on high efficiency and controllability of industrial processes, as well as reduced weight, volume and cost of consumer products, the application electronic converters is showing a rapid rise.  While solid-state power electronic equipment, such as Adjustable Speed Drives (ASDs), provide efficient conversion of electric power, the switching-mode operation causes PQ problems such as harmonic distortion of voltages and currents leading to several adverse effects including the malfunction of sensitive electronic equipment, equipment overheating, lower operating efficiency (and higher losses) and interference with communication systems.  PQ related disruptions, ranging from system malfunction and hardware damage to costly data loss and downtime currently, cost U.S. companies more than $25 billion annually.   In response to these concerns, the objective of the proposed career plan is to develop a strong PQ program at Oregon State University (OSU) as follows:  Simulate distributed nonlinear load effects on the power system/industrial facility network.  Experimentally analyze critical PQ situations by subjecting representative loads to typical poor PQ conditions generated by a programmable AC source.  Evaluate ASD ride-through capabilities (multiple makes and ratings up to 300hp) through voltage sags, static capacitor switching and input distortion.  Investigate and develop improved PQ compensators and ASD ride -through devices.  Develop a novel \"Standard PQ Guide\" for industry and utility personnel to use in the design of new or existing facilities to ensure a high PQ environment and compliance with IEEE 519.  Disseminate this information through a series of courses and practical worksh ops for industries and utilities, and incorporate it into both the undergraduate and graduate course curricula.   The unique contribution of the proposed research and education plan is two-fold.  Results of the power system/power electronic simulations and experimental analyses will contribute to the development of a novel \"Standard PQ Guide\" (manual).  This Guide will significantly aid design engineers and utilities in harmonic compensation, and compliance with existing and upcoming PQ standards, as well as future planning.  Using the PQ Guide will help engineers get up to speed on PQ issues as well as 'clean up' existing facilities to significantly reduce costly downtime.  With the recent and continuing growth of the semiconductor manufacturing industry in the Pacific Northwest, utilities and industries have expressed the need for assistance in improving their PQ.  The proposed PQ Guide will address this need.     The second novel contribution is the dissemination of the results of the proposed PQ work through a series of innovative industry, utility and university seminars.  These seminars will include theoretical PQ analysis in a classroom setting combined with a unique hands-on laboratory experience in the Motor Systems Resource Facility (MSRF).  These seminars will also include instruction on how to use the proposed PQ Guide.  No other PQ courses offer the \"hands-on\" opportunities that the PI is proposing here, which will greatly enhance the effectiveness of the learning experience.  The PI has conducted several successful seminars addressing PQ issues.     The proposed career plan includes specific plans to stimulate and educate a new generation of energy systems engineers on the importance of PQ.",
