 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the dissertation research of a student from the University of California-Davis.  The student will focus on disputes about the use of federal lands in Nye County, Nevada.  Ranchers dominate the rhetoric about federal land use and local politics in this area although they are not the dominant industry. The student hypothesizes that the ranchers' dominance is based on their use of `anti-colonialist` rhetoric and use of powerful cultural symbols against the federal government, tracing their cause back to the colonial exploitation of the West by Eastern interests.  The student will study local lifestyles through participant observation in government meetings and local social and political events, will collect genealogies and federal land surveys, and will interview participants in Forest Service and BLM disputes.  This research will shed light on a subject of great current interest, the anti-government rhetoric and activities of local people concerned about `White identity` which has given rise to militias and other anti-government movements.  The in-depth social science knowledge will correct biases and advance public understanding beyond sensationalist media accounts.                                                       \u2554 \u00f5e\u00cb6)\u00f3\u00de\u00b3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00f0\u00cbN\u255d\u00a6\u00c1\u255a\u00d5Yv<\u00f0?\u252c\u00cd\u00bf\u00af\u250c\u00a6t : lU \u00ac\u00a8 \u2017M (\u253c\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00feKX\u00a7(C\u00ac\u00ce&\u00a7   \u00de\u2534)\u00be %S \u00dao\u00b7W \u00be\u2514'3\u00a1 \u00db ] I; `x \u00fd\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
