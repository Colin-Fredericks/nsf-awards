Seymour, Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials  Science, University of California at Davis, and Professor  Paul T. Callaghan, Department of Physics, Massey University,  New Zealand. This project will take a Nuclear Magnetic  Resonance (NMR) spectrometer which operates in the Earth's  magnetic field, to Antarctica to measure brine content and  brine diffusion within first year sea ice of McMurdo sound.  The objective is to obtain a second season (1st season, NZAP  Event K131, Oct.-Nov. 1995) of  NMR data to validate prior  results, provide sampling of seasonal ice variation and  establish a correlation between NMR measurements, ice  structures and traditional optical microscopy data.  In  addition, a system in which a magnet is placed in a bore  hole in the ice will be tested, a technique new to the  principal investigator.  Time in New Zealand will be used to  complete data analysis on extensive laboratory NMR  microscopy measurements made during the PI's NSF  postdoctoral tenure (1995-1996, Massey University) and  prepare a manuscript on the laboratory and field studies.  The laboratory data includes three dimensional images of  brine channel structure and spatially resolved measurements  of the diffusion tensor. The diffusion data provide the  direction and magnitude of brine mobility, of use in  understanding convective heat transport in sea ice. This is  the first use of NMR microscopy to quantitatively  characterize NaCI/sea ice structure. The project is the only  application of field NMR methods to polar research being  pursued and represents validation of NMR as a field  instrument for environmental measurements.",
