 "awd_abstract_narration": "Terman  9802339       The investigator and his colleagues develop mathematical  tools for analyzing the population rhythms of biophysical models  for neuronal networks.  These models exhibit a rich structure of  oscillatory behavior.  The dynamics of even a single cell can be  quite complicated; it may, for example, fire either periodic  spikes or bursts of action potentials that are followed by a  silent phase of near quiescent behavior.  Examples of population  rhythms include synchronous behavior, in which every cell in the  network fires at the same time, and clustering, in which the  entire population of cells breaks up into groups; cells within a  single group fire synchronously and different groups are  desynchronized from each other.  Activity may propagate through  the network in a wave-like manner.  A network's population rhythm  results from interactions between three separate components: the  intrinsic properties of neurons, the synaptic properties of  coupling between neurons, and the architecture of coupling.  Each  of these components may include numerous parameters and multiple  time scales.  The mathematical techniques that are developed by  the investigator can help determine the role each of these  components plays in shaping the emergent network behavior.  This  may lead to a classification of the possible rhythms that can  emerge from a given network and help determine how complicated a  model must be in order to display some observed dynamics.       The types of rhythms that the investigator studies arise  throughout the central nervous system.  Consider, for example,  thalamic networks: these have been implicated in the generation  of sleep rhythms, certain forms of epilepsy, and Parkinson  tremor.  The investigator studies how the same set of neurons can  exhibit the very different rhythms that take place during  different stages of sleep and what changes must occur in the  networks during the transition from one stage of sleep to  another.  Recent experiments have demons trated that neurons in  the basal ganglia exhibit quite different population rhythms in  normal and parkinsonian animals.  The investigator develops and  analyzes biophysical models for these networks in order to  determine factors responsible for the generation of these  rhythms.",
