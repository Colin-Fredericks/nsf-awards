 "awd_abstract_narration": "Schmitt   9806858                     Many plant species exhibit characteristic morphological and physiological   responses to crowding and vegetation shade. This \"shade avoidance\" response   is cued by a reduction in the ratio of red to far-red wavelengths (R:FR) in   light transmitted through or reflected from green vegetation. This R:FR   signal is perceived by light-sensing molecules known as phytochromes.  It   has been hypothesized that phytochrome-mediated shade avoidance responses   are beneficial to plants because it enables them to anticipate and avoid   competition for light in dense stands. Recent results from a related project   strongly support this hypothesis.  In a field experiment,   phytochrome-mediated stem elongation increased the reproduction of the   native annual Impatiens capensis (jewelweed or touch-me-not) in dense   stands, but plants induced to display the shade avoidance response at low   density suffered reduced fitness relative to non-elongated plants,   apparently due to an unmeasured physiological cost.  The objectives of the   proposed research are to investigate the possible ecological, physiological,   and genetic mechanisms underlying this cost, and to quantify the frequency   and pattern of natural selection on shade avoidance traits within a natural   population.  A specific goal is to determine  whether the shade avoidance   response results in increased damage from ultraviolet-B radiation due to a   lack of protective pigments, and to test for genetic variation in   morphological responses or sensitivity to UV-B. To address these questions,   elongated and non-elongated seedlings from replicated inbred lines will be   produced by manipulation of the R:FR cue, and planted into a series of    treatments in a natural population and an experimental garden.         The results of this project will provide important information about the  role of phytochrome-mediated shade avoidance responses in natural plant   populations, and will provide an ecological and  evolutionary context for   current research on the molecular, genetic, developmental, and   physiological mechanisms underlying plant responses to light.  It will also   help to inform selection strategies for crop improvement and provide an   ecological context for recent proposals to increase yield by genetically   engineering crops in which shade avoidance responses are blocked.   The   results will also be valuable for understanding how wild plants will   respond to increasing UV radiation levels during the current period of   rapid global change.",
