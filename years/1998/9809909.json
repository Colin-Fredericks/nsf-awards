 "awd_abstract_narration": "9809909  Sheridan  Hormones of the gastoenterpancreatic system play an important part in regulating the growth, development, and metabolism of animals.  This symposium will bring together scientists fro molecular biology, cellular biology and organismal biology to provide an integrated synthesis of the function and evolution of this important group of chemical mediators in vertebrate and invertebrate organisms.  This symposium is in honor of Dr. Erika Pisetskaya, Research Professor Emeritus, who has had a long and distinguished career and who has contributed so much to the fields of comparative endocrinology and comparative physiology/biochemistry.  The symposium will have both oral and poster sessions.  Ten invited speakers will deliver oral presentations while postdoctoral fellows or graduate students fro the laboratories of each of the speakers will present posters as a means to encourage the participation of young scientists.  The proceedings from the proposed symposium will be published in the American Zoologist by a peer review process.     Dr. Sheridan hopes to foster a broader discussion and integrated synthesis of the comparative structures and functions of these chemical mediators in invertebrate and vertebrate organisms.  In addition, the relationship of the hormones of the enteropancreatic systems will be discussed in relationship of these factors and hormones in other systems will be discussed in relationship of these factors and hormones in other systems such as the central nervous system.",
