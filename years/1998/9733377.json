The Principal  Investigator's research goal is to study the potential use of  bioelectrochemical systems for treatment of polluted water.  His  objectives are to obtain the engineering design parameters that  would provide guidance to engineers in design of processes and  systems utilizing these bioelectrochemical systems for treatment  of surface and groundwaters.  The research proposed is a renewal  of work that was started under NSF's Research Initiation Award  No. 94-10486.    In accord with NSF 97-87, the Principal Investigator plans on  involving undergraduate students in the conduct of his research.  His plan for revising the undergraduate laboratory used for  environmental engineering instruction is to structure it to  provide opportunities for discovery and creativity by students  rather than specifying the performance of rigid laboratory  exercises consisting of experiments that are performed, data  recorded and ended with a laboratory report.  He plans to  coordinate the laboratory experiences of students with lectures  and classwork that will include addressing field-scale problems.  ***",
