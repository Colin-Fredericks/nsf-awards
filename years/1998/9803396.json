In one part of this project, the investigator, working\r\njointly with B. Farb of the University of Chicago, will attempt to show\r\nthat if G is a finitely generated group that is quasi-isometric to a\r\nsolvable group, then G is very closely related to some solvable group by\r\nsimple algebraic operations, with special attention to fundamental groups\r\nof 3-dimensional solv-manifolds and other polycyclic groups.  In another\r\npart, joint with M. Sageev, the investigator will work on constructing\r\nnew examples of word hyperbolic groups that have high codimension but are\r\nnot closely related to arithmetic lattices, a problem posed by M. Gromov.\r\nContinuing a long-term effort, the investigator will study the following\r\nweak version of W. Thurston's Hyperbolization Conjecture, namely that if\r\nM is a compact 3-manifold, then the fundamental group of M is either word\r\nhyperbolic or else contains a subgroup isomorphic to a free abelian\r\ngroup of rank 2.  This part will make use of tools developed in previous\r\njoint work with U. Oertel as well as new tools of ``coarse algebraic\r\ntopology'' developed recently by geometric group theorists.  Continuing\r\nanother long-term effort, the investigator will work on showing that if M\r\nis a compact hyperbolic 3-manifold, then only finitely many different\r\npseudo-Anosov flows are needed to compute Thurston's norm on the second\r\nhomology of M.\r\n     Groups are the mathematical abstraction of symmetries of geometric\r\nobjects.  Symmetry patterns of wallpaper, bathroom tiles, and the\r\ntilings on the walls of the Alhambra in Spain give examples of Euclidean\r\nsymmetry groups.  Many of Escher's paintings give examples either of\r\nEuclidean or of hyperbolic symmetry groups.  This project will cover\r\nseveral topics in geometric group theory, the general study of geometries\r\nand their symmetry groups.  By matching the large scale properties of a\r\ngeometry with the large scale properties of its symmetry groups, one can\r\nuse geometries to study groups and vice versa, a very fruitful pairing\r\nthat has led to many recent mathematical advances.  The investigator,\r\nworking with Benson Farb (U Chicago), will study a special class of\r\ngroups known as ``solvable groups,'' a generalization of Euclidean\r\nsymmetry groups.  Working with his colleague Michah Sageev, he will\r\ninvestigate new generalizations of hyperbolic symmetry groups.  He will\r\nalso continue work on long term efforts to understand 3-dimensional\r\ngeometries and their symmetry groups, as well as to study 3-dimensional\r\ndynamical systems.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
