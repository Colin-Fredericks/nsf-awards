The meeting, which is the 52nd Annual Symposium of the Society of General Physiologists, will focus on the mechanisms by which localized calcium signals are generated within cells, and on the diverse consequences of these signals for cell function.  The latest findings on this topic will be presented.  Lectures by leaders in the field will cover aspects of local calcium signaling in diverse systems including  both excitable cells (neurons, muscle, neuroendocrine) as well as non-excitable cells (lymphocytes, oocytes).  Poster sessions and six short talks devoted to late breaking results are also included.   The goal of this meeting is to bring together a diverse group of researchers to discuss and compare the latest findings in the field of local calcium signaling.  It is anticipated that the conference will not only provide the current state of knowledge, but will also play an important role in identifying new directions for future research in this field.",
