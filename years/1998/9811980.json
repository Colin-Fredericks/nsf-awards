 "awd_abstract_narration": "A crucial challenge for global query optimization in a multidatabase system is that some required local information such as local cost models may not be available at the global level due to local autonomy. A number of techniques to tackle this challenge have been suggested in the literature recently. However, they are suitable only for a static system environment. This research project explores theory and methods to establish dynamic cost models for a multidatabase system. Previous work on a query sampling method for establishing cost models in a static system environment is extended to a dynamic system environment. The methodologies adopted in this project include a qualitative approach, which introduces qualitative variables into cost models, and an adaptive approach, which adaptively incorporates dynamic cost information observed from execution of user queries into cost models. All approaches are evaluated and compared in order to determine the most promising one to establish dynamic cost models for multidatabase systems. Theoretical and experimental studies on query optimization that takes advantage of dynamic cost models are also conducted. The project will provide theory, algorithms, and implementation techniques for the design and development of an efficient multidatabase system.",
