 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to request funds for the  purchase of a JEOL JSM-6340F Field Emission Scanning Electron  Microscope with key optional capabilities including a field  emission (FE) electron gun for increased resolution of sample  analysis, and a backscattered electron detector for low  voltage imaging and analysis of gold-labeled (3, 5, and 10 nm)  surface antigens. This new JEOL JSM 6340F FESEM will serve 7  major and 13 minor users from seven different departments in  interdisciplinary research and education efforts at the  University of Missouri-Columbia (MU). The requested microscope  will be housed in the Electron Microscopy Core Facility (EMCF)  which is a recently reorganized centralized multi-user core  facility that has as its mission to support research and  education within the University community and in the region.  It was established in 1995 as a result of combining the  resources from the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural  Resources, College of Arts and Science, College of Veterinary  Medicine, and School of Medicine. The need for more modern  capabilities has made it essential to ask for funds to  purchase a new versatile, reliable, and user-friendly  instrument, as the 20-year old JEOL-JSM35 scanning electron  microscope cannot satisfy the demands of the present users.  Additionally, because the EMCF serves a diversity of research  projects and has as it's mission the training and education of  future scientists, modern instrumentation is critically  important. The new capabilities requested for this multi-user  Core Facility will allow (1) high resolution analysis of  minimally coated samples of biological plant and animal  materials, and of molecular isolates and spreads; (2) high  resolution detection of small gold labels down to 3 and 5nm  gold-labeling for immuno-electron microscopy; (3) image  acquisition and archiving for post-examination analyses; (4)  use of the PC-based, fully digital microscope for training  computer-age microscopists and resea rchers; (5) the ability to  add a cryo-system; and (6) the ability to add enhanced x-ray  microanalysis of minimally coated specimens from an EDS system  that is planned for future purchase. These features have  become essential for major parts of funded projects in  agronomy, entomology, plant pathology, cell and molecular  biology, veterinary parasitology, plant and animal  reproduction, microbiology, and other basic sciences. The  requested microscope will also serve to train users and  students in a graduate-level Cell and Molecular Electron  Microscopy course offered annually. The new microscope will be  supervised by the EMCF director, who is assisted by two  permanent staff EM technicians. The EMCF is one of six Core  Facilities administered by MU's Molecular Biology Program, a  state-funded program, that is committed to provide 50% of the  capital costs, long-term salaries for the director and staff  of the EMCF, and substantial subsidies for existing equipment  as well as laboratory renovations and service contracts for  all Core instruments.",
