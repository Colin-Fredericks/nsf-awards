 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is directed at basic research for the development of  data structures and algorithms for performing computations  involving collections of geometric objects, such as lines,  planes, polygons, curves, and spheres.  These topics have  applications in computer-aided design, physical modeling,  software engineering, information visualization, and robotics.  Specific focus in this project is given to:  1) algorithms for performing geometric shape analysis and  tolerancing,  2) data structures for efficient geometric data organization,  3) the combinatorial and algorithmic complexity of graph  visualization,  4) numerical stability and software reliability for geometric  computing,  5) object-oriented design patterns for geometric algorithm  implementation.  The main objective of this work is the development of general  methodologies for the design of geometric data structures and  algorithms, as well as their incorporation into object-oriented  geometric software libraries.  This work has potential impacts in  enabling new capabilities in areas of science and engineering  that model physical objects or that use geometry for information  visualization.  In addition, a key component of this work  involves the development of geometric software and Internet  technology for use in computer science education.",
