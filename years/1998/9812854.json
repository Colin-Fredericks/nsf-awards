 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of deformed material in the subsurface of sliding metals will be followed in detail by a combination of high resolution microscopy and surface analysis, and a non-contact Kelvin probe.  The probe measures changes in the metal's electronic work function.  Preliminary work has indicated that during sliding contact the work function shows periodic changes. These have tentatively been identified as due to slow build-up of deformed material by formation of nano crystals, transfer films, and agglomeration, followed by sudden removal.  If this mechanism can be confirmed and followed in detail it may change the view of wear mechanisms in general.  The work will include collaboration with a researcher in Belarus, who developed the Kelvin probe, and with researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory, who will conduct molecular simulation studies in tandem with the experimental work.",
