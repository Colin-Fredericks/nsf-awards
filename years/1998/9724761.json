 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724761  Knox    This award supports a 9 month National Science Foundation  Dissertation Enhancement award for Dr. James Knox in the  Department of Geology, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.  Dr. Knox's student, Mr. Michael Grossman, will work with Dr.  Nobuyuki Yonekura, Professor of Geology, on a research  project entitled, \"Extreme Floods, Typhoon Occurrences, and  Climate Change in the Ara River Basin, Japan.\"    The proposed research will examine the history of extreme  floods in the Ara River basin in Japan and, through data  analysis, the probability of their future recurrence.  Current theories suggest that extreme floods in the region  (and elsewhere) may be a direct result of human-induced  global climate change and not a continuation of patterns  occurring in previous eras.  The proposed research will test  global change theories by comparing past and present fluvial  system data from the Ara River basin, with a specific  emphasis on the hypothesized relationship between climate  change-induced typhoon activity and regional flooding.  Results of the research will offer insight into whether  global climate change is indeed the primary determinant  involved in apparent changes in fluvial regimes, and will  provide empirical rationale for similar research in other  regions throughout the world.  ***",
