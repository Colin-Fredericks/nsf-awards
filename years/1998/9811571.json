 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to construct dexterous yet mechanically simple robot manipulators and parts feeders using dynamic underactuated robotic manipulation.  ``Dynamic'' means that the robot exploits dynamic forces to help control the motion of the part; ``underactuated'' indicates that the manipulator has fewer degrees-of-freedom than the part(s) it is to control.  This is a minimalist approach to robotic manipulation--it seeks the simplest manipulators, in terms of the number of actuators, capable of controlling the motion of all part freedoms.  Such manipulators will be cheap, lightweight, and modular.  Because the manipulator has fewer freedoms than the part, the extra part freedoms are described by motion relative to the manipulator--slipping, rolling, and free flight.  Unlike pick-and-place, the part is not firmly grasped by the manipulator.  The purpose of dynamic underactuated manipulation is to exploit impact, slipping, rolling, and free flight dynamics to achieve effective control of the motion of the part, replacing some mechanical complexity of a robot system with intelligent motion planning and control.  This research explores controllability, motion planning, and feedback control of dynamic underactuated manipulation, and applications including parts feeding and manipulation in space.",
