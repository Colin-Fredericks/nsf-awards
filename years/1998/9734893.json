 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hans Andersen is funded by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program to continue his studies of the dynamics and equilibrium   of liquids, supercooled liquids and glasses.  Andersen will develop and   use three types of statistical mechanical methods for the study of the   kinetic theory of dense supercooled fluids: 1) a formulation of the   Martin, Siggia, Rose (MSR) approach applied to the classical dynamics of   particle and spin systems; 2) molecular dynamics simulation studies of   dense, low temperature and slightly supercooled atomic liquids; and 3)   simulation of the time dependence of kinetic spin models designed to   elucidate mechanisms for relaxation and structural change in highly   supercooled liquids and glasses.  The major objectives of the research   are: 1) to provide critical tests of the derivation and accuracy of the   extended mode coupling theory and a greater understanding of the physical   content of the theory; 2) to develop a basis for kinetic theory that is   an alternative to the use of projection operators or the four-point   function of Mazenko; and 3) to understand how to incorporate such   phenomena as formation of frustration-limited domains, secondary   relaxation, and inhomogeneous relaxation into kinetic theory.  Molecular   dynamics simulations will be used to study liquids and slightly   supercooled regimes, and more schematic spin models will be used at lower   temperatures where the relevant time scales are longer.  Glasses are technologically important materials made from a variety of   components, both organic and inorganic, both small molecular weight   substances and polymers.  Examples include ordinary materials such as   window glass and food containers, as well as high-tech materials for   telecommunications, optoelectronics, and solid electrolytes.  As   nonequilibrium materials, their properties depend on how they are made,   which usually involves preparation of a high temperature liquid followed   by various cooling and processing steps.  The preparation of such   materials to achieve optimal performance is guided largely by empirical   observations, but Andersen's research seeks an understanding of the   dynamics of these materials and their corresponding liquids on a   molecular level which can be useful in the design of rational processing   procedures.",
