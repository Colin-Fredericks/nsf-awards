 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project by a cultural anthropology student from Stanford University involves the study of a community of Afro-Mexicans living on the Pacific coast of central Mexico.  Through participant observation and in depth interviews with members of several local communities, the African American student will try to understand why Mexican blacks do not identify themselves uniquely as blacks, or with blacks of other nations, but rather have identities as Mestizos in contrast to local Indians.  The analysis will trace the effects of the single-minded national Mexican social-cultural thought and policies about Indians and Mestizos, which have tended to obscure any other identity such as Afro Mexican, and the effects of local geographic, social and economic isolation on the local society's connections with other black communities in Mexico as well as in other countries.  Comparative studies will be briefly undertaken in the state of Veracruz, a Caribbean state with a black population which is much more connected with other black and African-descent communities.  This research is important because it will advance our understanding of how peoples of African descent have developed variable identities and relations with national societies as well as with members of other ethnic groups.",
