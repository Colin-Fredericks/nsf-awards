 "awd_abstract_narration": "9812340  Larkin    This award is for the study of quantum fluctuations in  superconductors.  Of particular interest is the role of  quantum fluctuations in two-dimensional superconducting  films and Josephson junction arrays.  The PI's plan to  calculate the quantum corrections to the mean-field theory  of the transition temperature suppression in a continuous  disordered superconducting film. It is hoped that a  connection will be made to the scaling theory description of  the critical region around the quantum phase transition  point. Localization effects that occur for strong  superconducting fluctuations will be studied.  Motivated by  recent experiments in Josephson junction arrays, the PI's  aim to study phase transitions in systems of interacting  quantum vortices.  Investigations of the Hall effect and  vortex charge in two-dimensional Josephson arrays will also  be carried out.  %%%  Two PI's, one an eminent senior expert in the theory of  superconductivity and the other a rising star in the field  of mesoscopics will team up to study the role of quantum  mechanical fluctuation effects that are beyond the standard  (BCS) theory of superconductivity.  Phenomena assocated with  these effects are observed in experiments on superconducting  thin films and on arrays of superconducting grains or  islands, where neighboring grains are weakly coupled to each  other.  Research on these systems may give rise to new  electronic device technologies that exploit  superconductivity.  ***",
