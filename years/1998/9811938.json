 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigators address the roots of mean circulations in the solar interior.  Using similar problems in Earth's atmosphere as an analogy, they believe gravity-wave/mean-flow coupling in the stable solar interior is pivotal.  While dynamics of coherent downwellings at the convection zone base are believed to control scales, energetics and distribution of gravity waves generated in the interior, little is understood of their efficiency as an excitation source.  Estimates for plume penetration vary widely, and nothing is understood of plume scales and stability in three dimensional rotation, shear and stratification.  These numerical studies include compressible, anelastic, and incompressible simulations focusing on plume dynamics to clarify relevant processes at the highest attainable Reynolds numbers.  Their analytic studies address vortex dynamics and instabilities accompanying plume evolutions in sheared and stratified flows and gravity waves excited by penetrative convection as they propagate to greater depths.  Insuring numerical results and their implications for gravity-wave excitation are not constrained by model resolution, they are able to further quantify gravity wave forcing of the solar interior.  Results will yield a far more complete understanding of plume dynamics and the scales and character of gravity-wave excitation in the solar interior.  In sum, they provide important interpretations of the convective/stratified interface of the Sun, the dynamics controlling the interface, and the implications for the solar interior.",
