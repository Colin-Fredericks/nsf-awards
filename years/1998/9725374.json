 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725374  Bell  The goal of this project is to develop a Web-based Antarctic  gravity database to globally facilitate scientific use of  gravity data in Antarctic studies.  This compilation will  provide an important new tool to the Antarctic Earth science  community from the geologist placing field observations in a  regional context to the seismologist studying continental  scale mantle structure.  The gravity database will  complement the parallel projects underway to develop new  continental bedrock (BEDMAP) and magnetic (ADMAP) maps of  Antarctica.  An international effort will parallel these  ongoing projects in contacting the Antarctic geophysical  community, identifying existing data sets, agreeing upon  protocols for the use of data contributed to the database  and finally assembling a new continental scale gravity map.  The project has three principal stages.  The first stage  will be to investigate the accuracy and resolution of  currently available high resolution satellite derived  gravity data and quantify spatial variations in both  accuracy and resolution.  The second stage of this project  will be to develop an interactive method of accessing  existing satellite, shipboard, land based, and airborne  gravity data via a Web based interface.  The Lamont-Doherty  Earth Observatory RIDGE Multi-beam bathymetry database will  be used as a template for this project.  The existing online  RIDGE database allows users to access the raw data, the  gridded data and raster images of the seafloor topography.  A similar structure will be produced for the existing  Antarctic gravity data.  The third stage of this project  will be to develop an international program to compile  existing gravity data south of 60 S.  This project will be  discussed with leaders of both the ADMAP and BEDMAP efforts  and the appropriate working groups of SCAR.  A preliminary  map of existing gravity data will be presented at the  Antarctic Earth Science meeting in Wellington in 1999.  A  gravity working group meeting  will be held  in conjunction  with the Wellington meeting to reach a consensus on the  protocols for placing data into the database.  By the  completion of the project, existing gravity data will be  identified and international protocols for placing this data  in the on-line database will have been defined.  The process  of archiving the gravity data into the database will be an  ongoing project as additional data become available.",
