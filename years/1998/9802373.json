Theoretical methods and computational algorithms are being  generated that can be applied to important idealized  systems, such as the homogeneous electron gas, as well as to  realistic problems in atoms, molecules, and condensed  matter.    The approach taken is a combination of quantum Monte Carlo  (QMC) simulations and density functional theory (DFT).  QMC  can provide exact results for some many-body problems and  the range of problems for which this method can be applied  is being extended.  DFT is the only method feasible for  large-scale simulations of real systems.    Research objectives include the development of QMC methods  with emphasis on the improvement of the nodal surfaces for  fermion wavefunctions which is the limiting factor in the  accuracy of the algorithms.  A method has been developed to  dynamically optimize the nodal surface and will be applied  to many-electron systems.  Work will also continue to  calculate forces with QMC methods.  First applications will  be for forces between protons in an electron gas.  Applications of QMC methods to physical problems will  include nanoscale quantum devices and lower dimensional  systems; electron-hole plasmas where finite-temperature  techniques will be used to srudy the formation of excitons,  bi-excitons, and the superconducting state; and hydrogen  impurities in metals, which is a test of DFT and an  important problem in materials science.  New work on the  phases of hydrogen at high pressure will focus on prediction  of infrared activity using the Berry's phase formulation.  Also to be developed will be general theoretical methods for  studying dielectric polarization in correlated systems.  The  first test of the new ideas are being implemented in lattice  models and methods will be developed for real systems.  Many-  body calculations will be used to  test approximate DFT  functionals and to derive new forms.    Long term challenges are to develop algorithms to solve the  famous \"sign problem\" which is a limiting factor in  application of Monte Carlo methods to fermions and dynamics;  to develop robust \"order-N' linear scaling methods that go  beyond approximate DFT methods; and to apply these methods  to outstanding materials problems.  %%%  The long range goal of this research is to develop  practical, efficient theoretical methods to accurately  predict the properties of many-electron systems.
