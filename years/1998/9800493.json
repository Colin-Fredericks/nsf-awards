 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9800493  GUCERI  Rapid prototyping technology allows us to generate complex architectures-ordered and random, isotropic and anisotropic, homogeneously or nonhomogeneously distributed-with a variety and accuracy never encountered before. An interdisciplinary and multi-institutional research effort is proposed to take advantage of the advances in rapid prototyping to fabricate controlled porous domains and to conduct fundamental studies for investigation and development of physical models for transport issues that are relevant to fluid flow and  impregnation-based  manufacturing technologies. The research has two concurrent and highly interrelated activities. The first will be the development of fabrication techniques to generate a variety of porous structures that are representative and have strong relevance to a range of impregnation-based  manufacturing applications. This effort will explore discrete manufacturing capabilities of solid freeform (SFF) rapid prototyping techniques to fabricate porous structures with controlled pore architectures by developing novel SFF hardware interfaces to generate/edit tool-paths. Next, various mesh generation algorithms with grid control  will be employed  to achieve desired three-dimensional  pore architectures.  The second phase of the study will focus on porosity and flow characterization.  Porosity will be evaluated by determining the pore architectures and percent porosity extremes that can be achieved using the SFF technology. Flow characterization for this exploratory research will be limited to determination of wet and dry permeabilities using the pressure gradient approach as well as optical methods. All studies will be conducted under isothermal conditions. The outcome of the proposed study will be the development of a new enabling technology for conducting fundamental studies in three-dimensional flow fields. Most importantly, it will enable researchers to design and evaluate complex three-dimensional preforms for impregnation-based manufacturi ng  with engineered  pore  architectures. If the exploratory  tasks are completed successfully, fabrication of preforms from ceramic and metallic materials for advanced composites applications will follow the current fused deposition research in prototyping/rapid fabrication with ceramics and metals.",
