 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry   Program, is directed at the study and application of electrogenerated   chemiluminescence (ECL) reactions occurring at microelectrodes.    Professor Wightman and his students at the University of North Carolina   at Chapel Hill will investigate the use of ECL as a means of screening   potential organic compounds as light emitting diodes (LEDs) in   collaboration with Professor Neal Armstrong of the University of Arizona.    Optical monitoring of luminescence-producing reactions will be   undertaken to study the stochastic nature of the ECL process.  These two   studies set the stage for critical comparisons of the mechanisms of light   production in LEDs and via ECL.  ECL of Ru(bpy)3+2 immobilized at a   microelectrode will be evaluated as a monitor of histamine secretion from   cell walls.  Finally, ECL occurring at a microelectrode is proposed as a   new illumination source for near-field scanning optical microscopy   (NSOM).       The ability to monitor chemical processes in and about   micrometer-sized electrodes has a large number of practical applications.    Professor Wightman's laboratory is a leader in the theory and use of   these devices.  One of the most novel means of operating a microelectrode   is as an initiator of reactions which produce light, termed   electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL).   The technique is being   extended to the screening of potential organic molecules for use in light   emitting diodes and as a means of detecting histamine secretion from   biological cells.  The use of ECL produced at microelectrodes may also be   useful for optical microscopy.  The work to be done by Professor Wightman   and his students is likely to have impact in a wide range of   technological areas.",
