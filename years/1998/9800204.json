 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800204  Abraham  Investment in civil infrastructure made by public agencies  and the private sector involves a major portion of the  wealth of the U.S. Most often, owners, designers and  contractors have approached the design, construction,  maintenance and operation of underground infrastructure on a  crisis-based approach. As a result of this, the impact of  important considerations such as construction practices,  construction duration, life-cycle costs, environmental  impacts, safety requirements, etc., are not fully explored.  This project will create a framework for a life-cycle model  for assisting in the prioritization of scheduling of  maintenance and rehabilitation of underground  infrastructure. Sanitary sewer systems are selected to test  the proof-of-concept, since the maintenance of sewer systems  is an increasing priority worldwide.    The development of the sewer management framework can be  divided into three stages.    In the first stage the focus of the research will be on the  development of a prototype decision-making framework for  concrete sewers. Examples of key decisions include: type of  rehabilitation/maintenance strategy adopted, selection of  sewer where rehabilitation strategy will be applicable, and  frequency of application of rehab/maintenance strategy. This  will be accomplished through: 1) analysis of the condition  rating methodology (based on cracking, deflection, corrosion  and subsidence) used at present to determine the status of  sanitary sewers (using historical data from the City of  Indianapolis, Department of Capital Asset Management), and  2) deterministic dynamic programming, Markov decision  process, and probabilistic dynamic programming will be  investigated to determine their feasibility in modeling life-  cycle costs.    The second stage will include a focused pilot study to test  the framework developed in stage 1, to determine the ability  of the framework to improve decision-making, when life-cycle  costs are considered.  The framework can t hen be extended to  include the effect of external (such as soil type and depth  of cover) and internal factors (such as infiltration and  surcharge) on sewer deterioration.  In stage three, the  impact of other life-cycle costs (e.g., disruption costs,  environmental impact costs, and safety costs) will be  incorporated into the framework.  Two budget goals will be  analyzed at this stage: (a) Provision of the best return for  funds expended and (b) Optimal allocation of funds for  preventive maintenance and rehabilitation. Opportunity costs  and other virtual costs (such as planning costs, claims  costs arising because the system has to be shutdown) will be  considered in future studies.  ****",
