 "awd_abstract_narration": "Klowden  9807538    In many species of mosquitoes, the females mate only once during their  lives. When the males inseminate the females shortly after they emerge,  they not only receive sperm to fertilize their eggs, but also products that  are transferred from the accessory gland of the male. These accessory gland  products have been believed to be active in the female in various ways,  switching her behavior to turn off subsequent mating behavior and activate  egg-laying, but these generalizations have been based on the easily  colonized Aedes mosquitoes that are usually the subjects of laboratory  research. None of the previous studies for which this accessory gland  mechanism has been determined have examined Anopheles mosquitoes, which are  important vectors of malaria. The PIs preliminary experiments indicate that  in these Anopheles mosquitoes, male accessory glands indeed have no role in  the behavioral switchover, although mating itself does affect the female in  several ways. The PIs research will determine how Anopheles mosquitoes are  affected by mating, and what possible role male accessory gland substances  do play in these mosquitoes. Because future methods of mosquito control may  involve the introduction of novel genes by modified males, it is important  to understand the mechanisms that regulate mating in these vectors of human  disease.",
