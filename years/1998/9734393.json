 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jordan  9734393        This  proposal is concerned with integrating a research program  in  the  mechanics of swimming with a teaching program in biomechanics to generate an  atmosphere  where  undergraduate students can  team  about  the  physics  of  biology  and the processes of science. The research aspect of this  proposal  focuses  on  the  swimming  performance consequences  of  morphological  and  physiological  variation in aquatic animals. At issue is the idea  that  the  muscles which generate force do so in a way that depends upon their speed of  shortening which in turn determines the hydrodynamic force produced  by  the  muscle. Thus, a complete analysis of swimming would  solve, simultaneously, the force-velocity relationships for both muscle and  fluid-dynamic forces. The proposed work will attack this \"force balance\"  with both experimental and theoretical approaches for analyses of swimming  in anuran tadpoles.  As a model system, tadpoles are ideal for studies of  scale effects on swimming performance. These animals propel themselves by an  retrograde bending wave on the tail, show a dramatic ontogenetic size  variation,  and an intriguing predator-induced morphological variation which  appears to confer a swimming  performance advantage over non-induced forms. This research program will be  integrated into a teaching program by bringing the experimental techniques  of biomechanics into the classroom.  Through demonstrations, laboratory  exercises and independent research projects, students will be able to apply  what they have learned in their biomechanics coursework, as well as other  biology and engineering courses, in an effort to understand the physical  constraints and determinants of swimming performance.",
