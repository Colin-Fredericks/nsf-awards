 "awd_abstract_narration": "The College of Education and Human Development at the University of North Dakota (UND)  is continuing the DREAMS program with the support of faculty from the College of Arts and  Sciences and the School of Engineering and Mines and of Native American Programs at UND  and in conjunction with parents and school personnel representing four reservations and two  Indian service areas in North Dakota.  DREAMS involves a group of 30 American Indian  students with disabilities, now ranging in age from 8 to 14, in a program of classroom-based and  informal activities in mathematics and science.  Summer institutes which involve parents,  educators, elders or culture teachers, university faculty, mentors, and role models, as well as  the DREAMS students, are an important feature of the project, which aims to provide curriculum  which meets national standards in science and mathematics, provides for hands-on learning, and  is culturally connected.  Computers with the adaptive equipment needed by each student have  also been made available.  The DREAMS program has succeeded in raising the awareness of all  participants that persons who are disabled can succeed in life and in careers that require  expertise in mathematics and science.    Goals for the second cycle of DREAMS as an Experimental Project are to continue the program  for the original participants, and also add more students; to articulate and develop the  professional development potential of DREAMS; and to supplement National Science Foundation  funding to augment and continue DREAMS.  Through systematic professional development the  incompletely realized goal of DREAMS, to enable change in the infrastructure of schools, will  be promoted.",
