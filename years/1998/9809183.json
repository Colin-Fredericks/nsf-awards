 "awd_abstract_narration": "9809183  Alvarez    It is well know that it is difficult to reconcile many of the quantitative asset pricing implications of the standard representative agent models with the data. For instance, the average excess return and Sharp ratio of an equity portfolio are much higher in the data than in simple parametrized representative agent models. It is also well known that for a model to imply the Sharp ratios that we observe in the data, the relevant marginal rate of substitution has to be quite volatile. In a representative agent economy this can be achieved, among other ways, by an extremely large risk aversion or by a very (counterfactually so) volatile consumption process. Additionally panel data on consumption shows that agents do not insure idiosyncratic risk completely. Motivated by these facts, this project analyzes the asset pricing implications of a model with heterogeneous agents and idiosyncratic risks that are not completely insurable.   The project studies a model of limited risk sharing motivated by the possibility of default due to an extreme form of limited liability.  It is assumed that if agents default they are punished by permanent exclusion of the asset market. The strength of this model is that it produces endogenously solvency constraints - a form of borrowing constraints- The solvency constraints have to balance two conflicting objectives, to provide as much risk sharing as possible against the idiosyncratic shocks and to avoid default. In equilibrium agents carry some of the idiosyncratic risk, which is reflected in asset prices. The equilibrium theory behind these models has been worked out by Kehoe and Levine (1993) and subsequently adapted to asset pricing by Alvarez and Jermann (1997).   More specifically, this project develops computational algorithms to explore quantitative versions of this model. In doing so it uses the connection between (constrained) efficient allocations and equilibria.  There are three topics for a close economy where the interaction between a ggregate and idiosyncratic shocks may be important. The first is a study of the properties of the (real) term structure.   The second part  reexamines the \"equity premium puzzle\" and the third studies the cost of business cycles.",
