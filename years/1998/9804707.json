 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  work addresses the need for a deeper understanding of human  communication in situations where more than one channel and  mode  are  employed.  The context in which this problem will be studied  involves human-machine and human-human communication when one  of  the  users is deaf-blind.  This student and another undergraduate  student are working on the project with the investigator using  a  process  known as scenario-based design.  Of particular  interest  is  the  use  of  typing and synthetic speech for  production  of  messages  by  the  deaf-blind user, and  speech  recognition  and  Braille  for  the  reception  of  the  partner's  side   of   the  conversation.  A portable, prototype system will be  created  and  evaluated in the setting of the University campus.  The  work  is  done  in the experimental undergraduate laboratory known  as  the  Idea  Factory, developed to encourage students with  disabiliites  to pursue the study of science, engineering, and mathematics.",
