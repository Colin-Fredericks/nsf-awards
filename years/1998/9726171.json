 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program, aims to synthesize and characterize the chemical  and electrochemical behavior of monolayer-protected nanoscopic  metal clusters and of novel, mixed valent solid and semi-solid  molecular melt phases.  Professor Murray and his students at the  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will use a wide range  of experimental methods in this work including nuclear magnetic  resonance, Fourier transform infrared red, thermal, fluorescence,  and mass spectroscopy together with electrochemical techniques and  conductivity measurements.  These new interfacial materials with  nanoscopic dimensions hold technological promise in  electrocatalysis, molecular devices, and electrochromic materials.  Novel thin-film materials incorporating nanoscopic gold clusters  and involving electroactive molecular melts prepared from polyether  oligomers that exhibit polymer-like solid and semi-solid properties  will be studied.  Professor Murray and his students at the  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will pursue studies of  these materials using a wide range of experimental techniques while  considering the applicability of these materials in the fields of  electrocatalysis, electrochromic devices, and novel chemical  reagents.  This work blends fundamental work in chemistry while  keeping clear goals to develop materials with technological  relevance and societal value.",
