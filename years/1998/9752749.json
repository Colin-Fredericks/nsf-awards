 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of PRE-STAT are to enable college faculty to enhance the statistical education of preservice teachers on their home campuses and to encourage active learning through problem-solving in order to improve statistical education in the middle and secondary schools.    The PRE-STAT project is developing a model faculty development workshop which prepares participating mathematics educators to implement an effective statistical education curriculum.  A network of teacher educators is being established to share statistical education ideas.  PRE-STAT is also supporting the participants during the development of incorporation of statistical education components into the curriculum at their home institutions for preservice and inservice teachers. Curriculum ideas are being organized into \"Guidelines\" for differing curriculum settings.    The PRE-STAT project is disseminating ideas including (1) curriculum guidelines developed by participants and (2) instructional activities appropriate for these curricula.  A World Wide Web site is being implemented and maintained to share ideas.    PRE-STAT is a two-year project which begins with faculty development workshops in the summer of 1998 at Appalachian State and Montana State Universities.  A follow-up phase during 1998-99 is providing support for participants. PRE-STAT builds on ideas developed in previous projects.",
