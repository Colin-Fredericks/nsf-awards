 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870246  Zwanziger    Two glass families with important non-linear optical  properties will be studied, using a suite of structural  probes.  The goal of the project is to correlate the  structural features in the glasses with the non-linear  optical response, so that the optical properties may be  understood and tuned to desired values.  Glasses and  glass-ceramics composed of tellurium dioxide and a  transition metal oxide co-glass-former will be made, and  studied with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), neutron  diffraction, and x-ray diffraction. Oxides of the group VB  elements vanadium and niobium will be used as co-former, in  order to understand the second order non-linear optical  properties observed in telluriteniobate glass ceramics.  These structures will be investigated using oxygen,  vanadium, and niobium NMR, as well as diffraction  techniques.  The resulting structures will be correlated  with the second order optical properties.  The second glass  system studied will be germanium sulfide, modified with  phosphorus or gallium.  These materials show strong third  order optical non-linearity, and are of interest for  photonics applications. Various design compromises must be  made in their application, however, stemming principally  from their thermal behavior and optical absorption.  Their  local structural features will be studied with phosphorus  and gallium NMR, diffraction methods, and Raman  spectroscopy. and the resulting features correlated with  both the non-linear optical properties and the thermal  properties.  It is conjectured that symmetric local  structures, such as rings and homopolar bonds, are  significant in inducing a slow nuclear response in the  optical non-linearity.  This hypothesis will be tested by  comparing the non-linear behavior with the local structures  found from the NMR and diffraction data.  In support of the  above two areas, new experimental probes of materials  structure will be developed. In particular new NMR  experiments expressly designed to  reveal spatial  correlations between atoms in disordered solids will be  implemented. Furthermore, the results of these experiments  will be incorporated with those from diffraction-based  measurements to generate large real-space models of the  material structure. From these models not only individual  structural elements but also their frequency and  distribution in space will be inferred.  %%%  Glass and optical science will be enriched through the  knowledge created about which structures are stable in  complex oxide and chalcogenide glasses, and how these  structures affect the optical properties of the materials.  Moreover, the creation of new non-linear optical materials  for applications such as photonics could be of great  economic benefit to society, via the creation of faster  computers and communications networks.  ***",
