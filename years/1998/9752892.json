 "awd_abstract_narration": "A coalition of four institutions, the University of Montana, American University, Clark Atlanta University, and the University of Kentucky, are adopting and adapting the core project Workshop Chemistry (centered at CUNY City College), currently supported by the Systemic Changes in the Undergraduate Chemistry Curriculum initiative.  Workshop Chemistry is a flexible curriculum model that involves students in active participation in the learning process under the facilitation of a peer group leader.  The traditional \"question and quiz\" recitation section format is replaced by a cooperative learning, peer-led workshop.  We are addressing the problem of the high drop and fail rate in general and organic chemistry courses by changing the social dynamics of the course format.  Specifically, we are promoting (1) a collegial network of learners among students, (2) a recognition of differences in learning styles, (3) the development of mentoring relationships, and (4) active group study that develops interpersonal verbal communication skills.  We also address the problem of improved conceptual understanding through a collaborative learning process that is specifically focused on chemistry concepts and problem-solving techniques.  Our objectives are being accomplished by restructuring our courses to utilize the Workshop Chemistry format.  Workbooks for both General and Organic Chemistry courses are also being developed as part of the project.",
