Development in these areas permit the planning and execution of large scale scientific programs.  Such programs, in turn, frequenly require sophisticated data handling and processing techniques.  In view of the multilateral character of many large scale scientific programs, the handling, processing, and transmission of scientific data has become a major international enterprise in its own right, one that is vital to those scientific programs.  The Committee on Data for Science and Technoogy (CODATA) is a non-governmental, multilateral body affiliated with the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU.)  CODATA's principal objective is to facilitate worldwide communication on problems relevants to scientific data.  Like other memembers of the ICSU family, CODATA is comprised of non-governmental National Member Organization.  The National Acadmey of Sciences (NAS) fulfill this function in the United States.   A. U.S. National Committee for CODATA, which is comprised of non-governmental scientists, coordinates U.S. participation in the international body, with NAS serving as its secretariat.  This award will provide partial support to the NAS to continue the activities of the U.S. National Committee.  Additional support is also being sought  is also being sought from several other Federal Agencies:  DoE, NASA, NIH, and NIST",
