 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics has recently seen extensive interaction with physics,  especially with the ideas of quantum field theory (QFT), string  theory, conformal field theory and Seiberg-Witten theory.  These  theories provide our deepest understanding of basic physical  laws. Mathematics, especially algebraic and differential  geometry, has provided the correct framework for these theories,  and mathematical techniques have enabled the physicists to  establish many of their results, especially in string theory and  conformal field theory. On the other hand, physicists, such as  Witten, Candelas and many others, have discovered many truly  amazing mathematical relationships using physical ideas. However,  few mathematicians are fully conversant with the concepts of  physics. It is imperative that we train our students to  understand these theories.  Professor Gieseker's objective is to  learn conformal field theory, which is a very basic theory which  is also a building block for string theory.  From this, he will  develop a course which will be accessible to mathematics graduate  students, who are eager to learn these theories.  On the research  side, Professor Gieseker's recent research has been in the  deformation theory of infinite dimensional integrable systems,  which is closely connected to conformal field theory. So  understanding conformal field theory will enrich his research. In  this project, Professor Gieseker will collaborate with Professor  Eric D'Hoker of the UCLA Physics Department.    This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
