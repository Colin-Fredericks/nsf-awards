Homeoproteins are an important class of well-defined DNA binding proteins that have been amenable to many and varied techniques designed to reveal the nature of protein/nucleic acid interactions. These proteins are extremely important transcription factors that regulate crucial stages in the development of eukaryotic organisms. This project seeks to provide the necessary foundation for extensive structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic studies of the DNA binding stability and specificity of natural and recombinant Isl-1, a metal-containing homeodomain (HD) protein that binds to and regulates the rat insulin-I gene enhancer. The objectives of the current project  are: 1) to purify soluble Isl-1 from an E. coli expression strain; 2) to characterize Isl-1:DNA binding conditions; and 3) to deduce a general solution structure description of DNA binding via transitional metal cleavage (TMC) methodologies. The initial characterization supported by this starter grant will provide the foundation upon which more extensive studies on the Isl-1 DNA binding even may be designed. \r\n\r\nSuch studies are important because they increase our understanding of the molecular details of processes that determine why specific genes are expressed at specified times during development.\r\n",
