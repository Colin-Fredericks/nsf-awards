 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810581  de Wet    This grant provides support for the acquisition of a magnetic  mapping system for the Department of Geosciences at Franklin &  Marshall College.  The system will include a cesium vapor  gradiometer and GPS unit as well as computer hardware and  software for data processing, manipulation and presentation.  The system will be used by several faculty in the Geosciences  Department for a variety of environmental, archaeological and  geologic applications. Co-PI's Andrew de Wet and Rob Sternberg  are interested in the environmental applications of the equipment  including the determination of subsurface conditions at former  industrial sites in order to better understand the areal extent  and environmental legacy of these activities.  Rob Sternberg is  also interested in archaeological applications of the equipment  including the magnetic and paleomagnetic characteristics of  historic kilns, and detailed magnetic surveys at historic and  prehistoric archaeological sites for the delineation of sites and  the identification of structures and features.  Magnetic studies  are also planned for further elucidation of the structure of the  Martic Line in Lancaster County, PA, which separates  Precambrian/Lower Cambrian metamorphic rocks from Lower Paleozoic  sedimentary rocks.  The involvement of undergraduates in research  using the magnetic mapping system is a high priority.  ***",
