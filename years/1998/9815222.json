 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Philosophical Association is supporting and disseminating philosophical-research into issues of science, technology and diversity through a dual program of-commissioned research papers and small research grants. The focus on science,-technology and diversity extends traditional philosophical concerns with the-foundations of knowledge and value into concerns with the conflicts and dilemmas of cultural,-racial and ethnic diversity as these concerns increasingly emerge through-scientific and technological development.  Papers will be commissioned through established APA Committees and presented in Committee sessions at APA Divisional Meetings during 1999-2000.  A small grant competition will provide support for other-philosophical research into these issues.  The APA plans to commission 10-15 papers-and to fund 10-15 research projects, with the actual balance between the two dependent-upon the proposals submitted by APA Committees and prospective grantees.  Bill-Lawson, a member of the Philosophy Department at Michigan State University, and Chair-of the APA Committee on Blacks, will serve as Research Coordinator, assisted by a 5-member Advisory Committee.  The Advisory Committee will serve-as the grant selection committee and advise Professor Lawson, as needed, on the-development of other aspects of the program.  Both the commissioned papers and the-research conducted under the grant program will be collected into a book, to be edited by-Lawson with advice from the Advisory Committee.  The National Office of the American-Philosophical Association, including Executive Director, Eric Hoffman, and appropriate-members of his staff, will handle all administrative work in support of the program.",
