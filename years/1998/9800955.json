In two dimensions the object in question is the  moduli space of flat connections over a surface.  This space appears  in contexts as diverse as algebraic geometry and quantum gauge theory:  it is the moduli space of representations of the fundamental group of  a surface, it has arisen in the study of certain invariants of  three-dimensional manifolds, and in certain contexts it is the moduli  space of certain types of bundles over a surface.  Dr.  Sengupta has  been led to study the structure and nature of the moduli space through  his investigation of a limiting classical form of an infinite  dimensional measure which arises in the quantum theoretic study of  gauge fields.  This investigation will study the infinite-dimensional  quantum field theoretic measure, understand the way in which it  condenses onto a natural volume measure on the moduli space, and  extract information about the structure and volumes of the various  strata of this space.  This investigator believes that much  topological information about the moduli space of flat connections is  contained in the Yang-Mills probability measure.  It is hoped that  this project will provide a fruitful example of how probability theory  can be used to understand topology in this context.  In three  dimensions, this project aims to develop a rigorous analysis of the  quantum-field theoretic functional integrals arising in Chern-Simons  theory and understand, at a rigorous level, their relationship with  topological invariants.  These investigations will also provide new  concrete non-linear problems and techniques, involving stochastic  processes on Lie groups, in infinite-dimensional Gaussian analysis.    In broad terms, this project inv estigates mathematical questions that  arise from the deep relationship between geometry, topology, and  physics.  The idea that space, time, and matter can be understood in  terms of geometry forms the foundation of Einstein's general theory of  relativity.  Later, as the study of quantum theory and elementary  particles developed, it was discovered through the works of Yang,  Mills, and others, that geometry and topology play an even deeper and  more subtle role in mediating the fundamental forces of nature.  In  recent years, many mathematicians have focused their attention on deep  problems in topology and geometry which arise from questions in  fundamental particle physics.  The mathematics here is often  understood at a rough and intuitive level.  This project is devoted to  putting some of these mathematical issues on firm foundations as well  as discovering new results in the mathematical setting.",
