 "awd_abstract_narration": "9812730  Shenhar   This research is focused on the development on an integrative, strategic framework for dealing with management of projects in modem organizations. While recognized as a distinguished discipline and accumulating an extensive body of knowledge, project management is seldom perceived today by organizations as a competitive weapon, and project performance is still disappointing in many ways.  Most projects still suffer from time and budget overruns, and when completed, many do not meet customer or management expectations. This research will focus on building for a better understanding of the project phenomena using the concept of contingency in project management and the UCP (uncertainty, complexity, pace) model for distinction among projects. The research framework will combine three dimensions: style, adaptation, and learning.  The idea of style, previously addressed at the operational level, will be extended to include the components of strategy, culture and attitude, organization, processes, and tools; adaptation will concentrate on seeking new contingencies and study higher elements of style for different kinds of projects; and learning will be addressed at the corporate, project, and individual levels.   This study will show how to develop an integrated strategic focus on project management in the modem corporation; how to make project management a central competitive weapon in the company's core competencies; and how to train young and experienced managers to understand and face the demands of today's complex projects.",
