 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program supports a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant to Dr.   Claudia Turro of the Chemistry Department, Ohio State University.  The   goal of the research is to determine the role of electrostatic effects on   electron-transfer reactions. The surface potentials of micelles   (macromolecules) will be tuned by varying the composition of the micelles   using cationic, neutral, or anionic detergents.  The rate of electron   transfer will then be measured as a function of micellar potential.    Attempts will also be made to use electrostatic fields to control   directionality of electron transfer.  The excited-state electron donors   will be well-known neutral ruthenium(II) compounds so that the decrease   of the steady-state luminescence and emission lifetime of their   metal-ligand charge transfer states can be used to obtain   electron-transfer rates.   The acceptors will be viologen and   pyridine-based species that have been incorporated into the micelle   surface synthetically.  In addition to teaching undergraduate chemistry   courses, Dr. Turro is actively involved with mentoring women and minority   students in science.  Electron transfer is an important process in biological systems and in   materials, and it is possible that charged groups within the large   molecular structure could have an impact on the path and on the time   required for electron movement.  In this research, the influence of   external electric field effects on the rate and direction of electron   transfer will be studied.  Dr. Turro will serve as a mentor to women and   minority students at Ohio State University.",
