 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thomas Keyes is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in the area of   instantaneous normal mode (INM) analysis of liquids.  Instantaneous   normal modes are the harmonic modes of a representative configuration of   a liquid, and they provide an intuitive description of liquid state   dynamics.  Keyes will further develop INM theory to treat relaxation in   supercooled liquids.  The self diffusion constant will be calculated from   the double well modes and the distinct behavior of strong and fragile   supercooled liquids will be related to the form of the double well   density of states.  Other properties of supercooled liquids including the   Boson peak in scattering, a possible growing correlation length,   stretched exponential decay of correlation functions, breakdown in the   Stokes-Einstein law, and the role of spatial heterogeneity will be   calculated from INM.  An extension of the current theory will be   investigated to introduce time-dependent adiabatic and diabatic normal   mode treatments.  This would extend the INM treatment to dephasing and   motional narrowing.  There are excellent theoretical models which explain the behavior and   properties of gas phase systems where the motion is chaotic, collisions   frequent, and interactions are weak. Theoretical models for the solid   state are also quite well developed since periodic order in crystalline   systems provides the necessary simplifications to lead to tractable   solutions. The properties of liquids and supercooled liquids or glasses   still present quite a challenge to theoretical interpretation.  Keyes is   one of several theoretical chemists who is making significant headway on   developing a molecular interpretation of the physical and chemical   properties of liquids. The long range impact of this work could be   significant in helping to understand chemistry in condensed phases.",
