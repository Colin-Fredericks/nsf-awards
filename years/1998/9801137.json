 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kunz  9801137    Bats are highly social mammals, and for species with complex social  structures, individual recognition is important. Among bats, a combination  of visual, auditory, tactile and olfactory cues are used to assess  individuals, roost sites, and colony members. While auditory and visual  systems have been well studied, interestingly the olfactory system of  mammals has received little attention. The purpose of the present study is  to establish the importance of olfactory communication in bats, and to  apply this knowledge for conservation and pest management.        Behavioral tests will identify the role of olfaction in kin  recognition in little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) and big brown bats  (Eptesicus fuscus). Females often roost in large colonies in which they  must identify their own pups. Y-maze test will present females with choices  between kin and foreign scents to establish whether olfaction plays a role  in mother-pup recognition in these species. Behavioral assays will set the  stage for the investigation of the role of olfaction in the social  interactions of bats.        Chemical analysis of odors from selected bats will be collected to  assess whether odor chemistry mirrors the evolutionary history among  related species and will be used to test the potential use of human  olfaction as a probe into chemical communication in bats. Constituents of  odors will be analyzed using gas chromatograpahy olfactometry (GCO). GCO  coupled with behavioral tests is expected to emerge as an important tool  for investigating mammalian behavioral ecology and provide important  avenues for research into the attraction of bats which are economically  important as pollinators and predators of insect pests.",
