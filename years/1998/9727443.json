 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727443   CHIARAMELLO     The general focus of this project is on  the mechanisms that govern mammalian neuronal differentiation.  Dr. Chiaramello will investigate the roles of the basic helix-loop-  helix transcription factor ME1 during brain development.  The ME1  gene encodes two isoforms of ME1, called ME1a and ME1b, due to  alternative splicing of the messenger RNA.  However, only the ME1a  form is neuron-specific.  Several lines of evidence suggest that  ME1 plays an important role in the development of the nervous  system:  1) It has a strong homology with transcription factors  known to be essential for cell determination and differentiation  in the nervous system, such as Drosophila gene Daughterless; 2) It  is expressed in areas of the nervous system where neuronal  differentiation and plasticity occur; 3) It is also detected in  the subependymal region of the adult brain which includes  constitutively proliferating cells (neural progenitor cells) as  well as relatively quiescent cells that have the capacity to self-  renew and give rise to neurons and glia; 4) It modulates the  expression of two neuronal target genes involved in neuronal  growth and development, GAP-43 and the low affinity nerve growth  factor receptor p75LNGFR; and 5) It can assume distinct functions  as a transcription factor, acting either as an activator or  repressor.  In this application, we propose experiments to further  investigate ME1 with respect to its molecular mechanism of action  and its neuron-specific partners during neuronal differentiation.  The specific aims of this project are as follows:  In specific aim  I, Dr. Chiaramello will examine the posttranslational modification  of ME1a during neuronal differentiation by assessing whether  phosphorylation of ME1a by casein kinase II dictates the  transcriptional activities of ME1 on neuronal target genes.  In  specific Aim II, Dr. Chiaramello will unravel the molecular  mechanism of action of ME1a during neuronal differentiation.  ME1a  binds DNA as eit her a homodimer or heterodimer.  The specificity  of the genes regulated by ME1 are thought to depend on the  dimerization partner.  Therefore, it is of tremendous importance  to identify the heterodimeric partners of ME1a.  In specific Aim  III, Dr. Chiaramello will analyze in detail the temporal and  spatial expression of novel partners identified in Aim II.  Results from the project will elucidate the cascade of regulatory  events necessary for neuronal differentiation.",
