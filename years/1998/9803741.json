 "awd_abstract_narration": "The short-term objectives of this research are to design and  evaluate general solutions to the problem of inexactness of values  in fault-tolerant systems. The long-term goals are to understand  the ways in which inherent redundancy in  parallel and distributed systems can best be exploited to provide  highly dependable multicomputing environments.  Sources of  inexactness include round-off error, noise, quantization error,  diverse software, non-determinism, heterogeneity, and redundant  sensors.  Inexactness problems include approximate agreement,  inexact agreement, clock synchronization, sensor fusion, diverse  software, and inexact voting.  In this project, new solution  techniques for dealing with inexactness in parallel and  distributed systems will be developed, and a unifying methodology  for studying inexactness problems will be investigated.  Techniques developed in the project will be evaluated  analytically and in a network of workstations testbed.  This  research is expected to lead to more efficient and more powerful  techniques for dealing with inexactness in fault-tolerant systems.  The effect of these techniques will be increased precision of  final results, lower communication overhead for redundancy, and  increased overall system reliability.",
