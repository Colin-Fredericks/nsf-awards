It continues a previous effort on varying  alloy chemistry, nanocrystal morphology, and interfacial  structure to influence the magnetic anisotropy in magnetic  nanocrystals and nanocrystalline arrays.  Magnetic  anisotropy in nanocrystals and nanocrystalline arrays  depends on magnetic crystalline anisotropy, shape  anisotropy, interfacial anisotropy, and/or the anisotropy  provided by magnetoelastic coupling.  These issues are  addressed in (1) C-coated nanoparticles; (2) filled C-  nanotubes with carbide nanorods; and (3) infiltrated,  periodically arranged pores in mesoporous silicates with  ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic species.  Nanoparticles  produced by plasma synthesis are usually spherical and do  not benefit from shape anisotropy as a barrier to the  thermally activated switching of the magnetization.  The  research examines the effects of shape anisotropy in detail  in novel nanoparticles and nanoparticle arrays in which  large aspect ratios in the magnetic particles can be used to  exploit shape anisotropy.  Issues of interfacial anisotropy  are addressed by comparing the magnetic properties of  nanoparticles having carbon and oxide coatings.  %%%  This research is aimed at understanding the magnetic  reversal mechanisms in nanoparticles in order to determine  fundamental limitations for a variety of magnetic  applications.  Nanosized clusters have demonstrated  properties that differ from those of bulk crystalline  solids.  Examples of nanocrystalline forms include  Buckyballs and Buckytubes, C-coated nanoparticles and  nanorods, and other self-assembled structures.  Understanding properties of these materials enables the  development of novel materials with a host of applications.  ***",
