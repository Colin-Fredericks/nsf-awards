The projects will address:    - Development of nagging, an asynchronous, fault-tolerant, parallel search     pruning technique with applications to combinatorial optimization,        computational biology, and theorem proving;  - Development of fast interior-point optimization algorithms and their   application to resource allocation and similar problems;  - Optimization-based motion estimation techniques for high-quality video    compression;  - Development of efficient satisfiability testing algorithms and their   application to constraint satisfaction and problems in discrete mathematics;  - Development of distributed automated-reasoning systems based on the clause-    diffusion principle of parallel search with applications to verification, constraint solving, and logic programming.    In addition to an environment for the development and testing of   coarse-grained distributed search techniques, this new NSF-supported   distributed computing facility's high-speed large-memory CPUs constitute   the only available dedicated computational resource for empirical   evaluations of algorithmic performance, which may sometimes require weeks   of CPU time.",
