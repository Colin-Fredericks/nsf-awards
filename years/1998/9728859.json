These  emphasis areas are particularly timely and consistent with  the many contributions of Professor John Hirth, who is  honored in this symposium.  The symposium is designed as a  forum for the discussion of new developments in theory and  applications involving defects in crystalline solids, and  the exchange of ideas and a discussion of new directions for  research on this topic.  The support is for travel grants to  student co-authors and assists in travel costs for foreign  speakers.  %%%  The properties of materials depend in part on the type and  distribution of defects that have been incorporated into  structure during processing.  This symposium explores this  subject with an emphasis on theory and modeling.  ***",
