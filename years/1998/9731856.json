 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to study both practical and  theoretical aspects surrounding the application and  implementation of algorithms for computing stationary  probabilities and analyzing transient behavior of discrete Markov  chains. One facet of the research is dedicated to applications of  discrete models for understanding and analyzing the dynamics of  large systems comprised of collections of  loosely coupled subsystems such as in the study of queuing models  and networks, telecommunications, computer performance  evaluation, stochastic automata networks, economic and biological  forecasting, and flexible manufacturing systems. Special  attention is devoted to making Markov chain technology widely  available to researchers in diverse areas. Specific research  objectives include the following aims. (1) The project seeks to  relate properties of specific Markov chain models to  characteristics of numerical algorithms with the goal of devising  a sieve from which the most appropriate algorithm and  implementation for a given application can be extracted. (2)  Another objective is to develop both theoretical and numerical  mechanisms to facilitate the determination or estimation of  stationary probabilities of large-scale finite Markov chains by  utilizing a variety of aggregation/disaggregation methods. A  specific goal is to formulate a comprehensive theory of errors  which can simplify and unify the analysis of a broad range of  aggregation/disaggregation processes and algorithms. (3) The  project seeks to develop practical preconditioning techniques for  iterative algorithms which can be applied to Markov models which  are formulated as stochastic automata networks. (4)  A final  objective is to develop a comprehensive software package which  provides access to sophisticated computational tools for Markov  modeling. The goal is to structure the package for researchers in  applications areas who do not want to be diverted by or become  immersed in technical numerical analysis details.",
