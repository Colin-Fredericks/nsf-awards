Sethi, the PI will analyze the supersymmetric\r\nmatrix model quantum mechanics which has been conjectured to provide a\r\ndefinition of M theory.  Crucial to the conjecture is the existence of\r\nnormalizable ground states in quantum mechanical gauge theories with\r\n16 supersymmetries.  These ground states correspond to gravitons in\r\nthe model.  We seek to show existence and uniqueness of a groundstate\r\nwavefunction, by computing an L2 index for a large family of\r\nassociated non Fredholm, (generalized) Dirac operators.  We will\r\nanalyze the structure of the wavefunction in order to determine, for\r\nexample, the \"size\" of the graviton.  In further work related to the\r\nmatrix model, in collaboration with S. Paban and Savdeep Sethi, the PI\r\nwill study constraints on the effective action in Yang Mills theories\r\nwith 16 supersymmetries.  Mathematically, this may be viewed as a\r\nmoduli problem for deformations of systems with 16 supersymmetries.\r\nIn collaboration with W. Pardon, the PI proposes to establish a\r\nharmonic theory for the L2 cohomology of singular projective varieties\r\nwith the metric induced by a projective embedding, extending their\r\nharmonic theory for varieties with isolated singularities.  The goal\r\nof such an investigation is to bring to the study of the L2 cohomology\r\n(and conjecturally the intersection cohomology) of these varieties the\r\nsame array of tools available for studying complete Kahler manifolds.\r\nThis includes Hodge and Lefschetz decompositions and potentially\r\nBochner type vanishing theorems.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to explore a recently proposed\r\nmodel for a theory of quantum gravity known as the matrix model.\r\nMathematically this model has many advantages, but it is not yet\r\ncomplete and is not yet clear that it gives a physically reasonable\r\ntheory.  We will perform various (mathematical) tests to determine if\r\nthe model does have the conjectured desired physical properties.  For\r\nexample, we seek to determine whether it predicts the existence of a\r\nstable particle, \"the graviton\".  Then we will try to determine the\r\nstructure of this particle and see if the model gives a framework for\r\ncomputing predicted outcomes to simple processes such as scattering of\r\ngravitons.\r\n",
