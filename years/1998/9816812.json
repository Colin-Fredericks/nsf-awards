A conference will be held in Washington, D.C. on  November 18 and 19, 1998.  Approximately 40 principal  investigators will have the opportunity to \"showcase\" their  projects.  Selected leaders from the ATE and technology  education communities will be invited to participate as  well, NSF program officers will present on \"Relationships  Among ATE, IMD and TE Projects.\"  Panels of three principal  investigators will address issues such as:  \"Developing  standards-based curricula,\" \"Strategies for enhancing the  impact of projects,\" and, \"Working with publishers.\"  A  rapporteur will listen throughout the conference and make  reflective comments concerning the issues addressed.  He  will also make recommendations for further research.  Based  on the rapporteur's report, panelist's one-page comments and  reports, and the conference evaluation a manuscript will be  prepared for submission to a national journal.",
