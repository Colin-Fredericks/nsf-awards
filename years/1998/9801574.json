The project goals are to establish the Virasoro constraints in certain fundamental cases, find new universal relations, understand related Chow rings of spaces of stable maps, and study the enumerative geometry of descendent integrals. Virtual localization techniques will be studied and used.    This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic  geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but  one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined  in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra,  but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding  application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical  computer science, and robotics.",
