 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kraichnan\r\n\r\nThis proposal is for theoretical research on the higher statistics of \r\nNavier-Stokes turbulence. The principal tool to be used is called mapping \r\napproximation. It is a systematic mathematical procedure applied to the fluid \r\nequations of motion. Nonlinear transformations of fields with Gaussian \r\nstatistics are exploited. In previous applications to several problems, \r\nnotably to the advection of passive or chemically active scalar contaminant \r\nfields by turbulent flows and to Burgers' one-dimensional model of turbulence, \r\nit has yielded quantitatively accurate predictions of statistics that describe \r\nextreme intermittency of small scales. The proposed work involves further \r\ndevelopment of mapping approximation and its application to intermittency of \r\nvorticity in incompressible turbulent flows. Ultimate goals include the \r\ndetermination of scaling exponents for vorticity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurbulence, the disordered motion of fluids, is an ubiquitous phenomenon in \r\ngeophysics and industry. It has been an outstanding challenge to \r\nmathematicians and physicists for over a century. Examples where turbulence \r\nplays a crucial role are weather systems, airplane flight, the dispersal of \r\natmospheric pollutants, and industrial chemical reactors. The complexity of \r\nturbulent motion is so extreme that fully detailed computer solutions of real \r\nturbulent flows are not possible; the demands on memory and speed are too \r\nextreme. In order to reduce computation to maneagable size, theoretical models \r\nof the statistics of the smaller scales of turbulent motion are essential. The \r\nresearch to be carried out under this proposal brings recently developed new \r\ntools to bear on the statistics of small scales. These tools have proved to be \r\npowerful in related problems. Improved models of the small scales of \r\nturbulence that can be used in computer simulations are an objective of this \r\nresearch.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
