 "awd_abstract_narration": "Digital signal processors, made possible through advances in  integrated circuits, have added a new element to the environment of  digital signal processing (DSP).  They have found their way into a  number of applications including communications and controls,  graphics, instrumentation, speech, and image processing.  These  processors are found in cellular phones, modems, automotive and  security/identification systems, noise cancellers, etc.  They have  emerged as a response to the ever-increasing number of real-time  DSP applications across a wide range of disciplines.    This workshop addresses the need to add or integrate DSP techniques into courses such as Digital Signal Processing, Controls, Signals and Systems, Senior Design Project, etc.  It will combine both the lecture and laboratory components of DSP, with a special emphasis on the laboratory component to provide the participants valuable hands-on experiences.  While a theoretically oriented DSP course can be found at a more convenient location to the participant, the strength of this workshop is derived from its laboratory emphasis. The faculty participants will implement a wide range of experiments and mini-projects on finite and infinite impulse response filters, adaptive filters, and the fast Fourier transform using both simulation and real-time techniques.  DSP tools and techniques will be provided to the participants who will quickly realize how software and hardware experiences can be used to motivate their students.  They would then be able to integrate these software and hardware experiences at their home institutions.",
