Although the venue is South Africa, the  workshop encompasses the broader southern Africa region,  including Zambia, Tanzania, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi,  and Botswana.  Participants from each of those countries  have been invited, along with participants from the United  States and South Africa.  The workshop is co-organized by  Robert Swap and Paul Desanker, Department of Environmental  Sciences, University of Virginia, and Harold Annegarn,  Schonland Research Centre for the Nuclear Sciences, the  University of the Witwatersrand.    The purpose of the workshop is to address emerging  interdisciplinary research needs resulting from the  integration and linking of southern African land cover and  land use change, atmospheric emission and transport, and  biogeochemical research as it relates to global change.  The  participants will design and develop a conceptual model that  describes linkages across time and space scales between  southern African terrestrial, atmospheric, and  biogeochemical processes.  Specialists in many fields are  participating, some of which are ecosystem and biosphere  modeling, remote sensing, woodland savanna ecology and  management, soil science, meteorology, climate change and  forecasting, and land use and biodiversity.  The workshop is  supported jointly by the Division of International Programs,  the Division of Atmospheric Sciences, and the Division of  Environmental Biology.  In South Africa, support for the  workshop is being provided by the Foundation for Research  Development (FRD).",
