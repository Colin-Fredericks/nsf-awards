 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported in the   Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focuses on the development of   high speed separation techniques with high sensitivity detection   strategies to study neurotransmitter release from single cells.    Professor Shear and his students at the University of Texas-Austin will   fabricate a novel, multichannel capillary electrophoresis array for the   rapid sampling and separation of excreted neurotransmitters.    Multiphoton-excited fluorescence can be generated from extremely small   (sub-picoliter) volumes to provide high sensitivity while retaining   chromatographic integrity.  This combination will allow the monitoring of   neurotransmitter release across the 'landscape' of a single cell.  This   CAREER research project will expose undergraduate students to modern   research laboratory instrumentation and illustrate the utility of the   approaches through the analysis of `real world` samples.  Professor Shear   will combine fundamental aspects of chemical instrumentation in his   lectures with hands on problem solving in the laboratory.  One of the long standing issues in the area of neurochemistry has been   the desire to observe neurotransmitter release on the single-cell level   in real time.  Professor Shear and his students at the University of   Texas-Austin, are developing monitoring techniques based on the   combination of a novel capillary electrophoresis array and high   sensitivity optical spectroscopy methods.  Instrumentation having the   capabilities to monitor individual neurotransmitter releases across the   surface of a cell would impact a number of disciplines.  The   multidisciplinary aspects of the instrumentation development portion of   this project are complemented by Professor Shear's interest in   introducing undergraduates to state-of-the-art research instrumentation   for solving `real world` analytical problems which may have a high degree   of complexity.                                                 \u2524\u00c1\u255d\u00c0\u255d/\u2524\u2510/\u00a5\u00c1 \u00a2\u2502\u2563\u00c1>\u2502\u00c1 \u2502%/\u00a2\u00a2\u00c1\u00a2     \u00bd\u00c1_\u2563\u2502?>\u2524\u2510\u2502\u00a5?\u255d >/>?\u2551/\u255d\u00a5\u2563\u2502%\u00c1\u00a2 /\u255d\u00c1 /> \u2563_\u2551?\u255d\u00a5/>\u00a5 \u2502%/\u00a2\u00a2 ?\u00c2 >\u00c1 \u2534 _/\u00a5\u00c1\u255d\u2563/%\u00a2     \u00bc\u00a9\u00c1` ?\u00c2\u00c2\u00c1\u255d \u2510>\u2563\u2557\u2510\u00c1 ?\u2551\u2551?\u255d\u00a5\u2510>\u2563\u00a5\u2563\u00c1\u00a2 \u00a5? \u00a2\u00a5\u2510\u2524` \u00c2\u2510>\u2524/_\u00c1>\u00a5/% \u2551\u255d?\u2593%\u00c1_\u00a2 \u2563> \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1   \u2563>\u00a5\u00c1\u255d\u2524\u2563\u00a2\u2502\u2563\u2551%\u2563>/\u255d` /\u255d\u00c1/\u00a2 ?\u00c2 \u2502\u00a9\u00c1_\u2563\u00a2\u00a5\u255d`  \u2551\u00a9`\u00a2\u2563\u2502\u00a2 />\u2524 _/\u00a5\u00c1\u255d\u2563/%\u00a2 \u00a2\u2502\u2563\u00c1>\u2502\u00c1  /\u00a2  \u2534\u00c1%% /\u00a2 _/>` \u2551?\u00a5\u00c1>\u00a5\u2563/% /\u2551\u2551%\u2563\u2502/\u00a5\u2563?>\u00a2 \u00a2\u2510\u2502\u00a9 /\u00a2 \u00a2?%/\u255d \u00c1>\u00c1\u255d\u00c0` \u2502?>\u2514\u00c1\u255d\u00a2\u2563?>    \u2534/\u00a2\u00a5\u00c1 \u2524\u00c1\u00c0\u255d/\u2524/\u00a5\u2563?>  />\u2524  >/>?\u00c1%\u00c1\u2502\u00a5\u255d?>\u2563\u2502\u00a2   \u00bc\u00a9\u00c1 \u2524\u00c1\u00a5/\u2563%\u00c1\u2524 \u2510>\u2524\u00c1\u255d\u00a2\u00a5/>\u2524\u2563>\u00c0   \u255d\u00c1\u00a2\u2510%\u00a5\u2563>\u00c0 \u00c2\u255d?_ \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1\u00a2\u00c1 \u00a2\u00a5\u2510\u2524\u2563\u00c1\u00a2 \u2534\u2563%% \u00a9/\u2514\u00c1 /> \u2563_\u2551?\u255d\u00a5/>\u00a5 \u2563_\u2551/\u2502\u00a5 ?> \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1   /\u2551\u2551%\u2563\u2502/\u00a5\u2563?> ?\u00c2 \u00a2\u00c1_\u2563\u2502?>\u2524\u2510\u2502\u00a5?\u255d >/>?\u2551/\u255d\u00a5\u2563\u2502%\u00c1\u00a2  \u2563>\u2502\u00c1 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u2551\u255d?\u2502\u00c1\u00a2\u00a2\u00c1\u00a2 \u00a5? \u2593\u00c1   \u00a2\u00a5\u2510\u2524\u2563\u00c1\u2524 \u2524\u00c1\u00a5\u00c1\u255d_\u2563>\u00c1 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u00c1\u00c2\u00c2\u2563\u2502\u2563\u00c1>\u2502` />\u2524 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u2502\u00a9\u00c1_\u2563\u2502/% \u00a2\u00a5/\u2593\u2563%\u2563\u00a5` ?\u00c2 />`    \u2524\u00c1\u2514\u2563\u2502\u00c1\u00a2 _/\u2524\u00c1 \u00c2\u255d?_ \u00a2\u2510\u2502\u00a9 >/>?\u2551/\u255d\u00a5\u2563\u2502%\u00c1\u00a2   \u00ac\u00c1\u00a2\u2510%\u00a5\u00a2 \u00c2\u255d?_ \u00a5\u00a9\u2563\u00a2 \u00a2\u00a5\u2510\u2524` \u2534\u2563%% /%\u00a2?   /\u2524\u2524 \u00a5? \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u00c0\u00c1>\u00c1\u255d/% \u2510>\u2524\u00c1\u255d\u00a2\u00a5/>\u2524\u2563>\u00c0 ?\u00c2 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u2524`>/_\u2563\u2502\u00a2 \u2563> \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u00a2?%\u2563\u2524 %\u2563\u2557\u2510\u2563\u2524   \u2563>\u00a5\u00c1\u255d\u00c2/\u2502\u00c1  \u2534\u2563\u2502\u00a9 \u2563\u00a2 \u00c1\u00a2\u00a2\u00c1>\u00a5\u2563/% \u00c2?\u255d \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u2524\u00c1\u00a2\u2563\u00c0> />\u2524 /\u2551\u2551%\u2563\u2502/\u00a5\u2563?> ?\u00c2 _/>`   \u2563_\u2551?\u255d\u00a5/>\u00a5 \u2524\u00c1\u2514\u2563\u2502\u00c1\u00a2 />\u2524 \u2551\u255d?\u2502\u00c1\u00a2\u00a2\u00c1\u00a2 \u00a2\u2510\u2502\u00a9  /\u00a2 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u00a2?%/\u255d \u2502\u00c1%%  \u00c1%\u00c1\u2502\u00a5\u255d?\u2502\u00a9\u00c1_\u2563\u00a2\u00a5\u255d`   />\u2524 \u00a9\u00c1\u00a5\u00c1\u255d?\u00c0\u00c1>\u00c1?\u2510\u00a2 \u2502/\u00a5/%`\u00a2\u2563\u00a2",
