 "awd_abstract_narration": "IP traffic is becoming the killer application for ATM networks.  One challenge in current network research  is how to effectively transport IP traffic over ATM networks.  IP was independently developed on basis of connectionless model,  while ATM was originally designed for connection-oriented services.  IP traffic is usually switched using packet  software-forwarding technology, which is expensive  and has substantially limited forwarding capacity.  In contrast, ATM switches are designed with high transmission bandwidth,  but having limited connection setup processing capacity due to its  complex signalling structure developed for connection-oriented services.    The proposed research addresses a fundamental problem in resource management  for hybrid switching systems.  Such systems aim at efficiently transporting  layer 3 connectionless IP traffic over layer 2 connection-oriented ATM  switching fabrics. The hybrid switching technology is further classified  into flow-driven switching and topology-driven switching.   The idea behind the flow-based hybrid switching is first to decompose  individual IP packet streams into flows  and then to classify them into short-lived flows and long-lived flows.  While the short-lived flows are best forwarded  by the embedded software through permanent virtual connections (PVC),  the long-lived flows are more effectively transmitted by hardware  through to-be-established switched virtual connections (SVC).  Clearly, the key issue in such a flow-based hybrid switching system is the  design   of an on-line flow classification scheme, which can effectively   utilize the constrained system resources to achieve the maximum throughput  performance.   In contrast, the topology-driven switching establishes switch connections  based on current network routing information, i.e.,   associated with routing table entries rather than individual flows.   Hence, no software forwarding is required if the arriving packets  can be mapped into such pre-established switched  conne ctions.  The key issues in such a topology-based hybrid switching system are   related to routing scalability, connection-setup initiation and traffic merge.    The first part of our proposal will consider the flow classification design   in flow-based hybrid switching systems, such as IP switching and MPOA.   Unlike the traditional emphasis on resources such as link bandwidth and cell  buffer size, our proposal focuses on the resources which are directly  associated with  packet processing power, signaling capacity and routing table size.  Our study indicates that the presently available {\\it static flow  classification} methods have a vital shortcoming in balancing the   utilization of the system's resources.  This is due to the various system design strategies  for allocating resources as well as the time varying traffic characteristics.  As a consequence, hybrid switching system can end up operating  in a highly unbalanced mode where some resources are  significantly underloaded while others are heavily  overloaded, causing substantial inefficiencies in network performance.     We propose a novel approach for {\\it adaptive flow classification}  which can balance the utilization of system resources  to match the time varying traffic characteristics.  The proposed flow adaptation is formulated as a stochastic control  problem, where the stochastic control framework can be applied  towards the development of efficient and stable flow adaptation algorithms.  Our preliminary studies for this proposal show  the viability of the proposed flow adaptation  for dynamic resource management in hybrid  switching system design.  Due to its great impact on system performance,  we propose to carry out further theoretical analysis, algorithm development   and simulation study for flow adaptation mechanisms.      The second part of our proposed research will focus on the development of   an unified modeling technique for performance comparison study between   the flow-driven and topology-driven switching tech nologies.   One of the most challenging issues in networking field today is   to decide which of these two switching technologies should be adopted.   The success of proposed research is expected to have a substantial  technical impact on the selection of the next generation switching  technologies and also the design and resource management   of such IP/ATM hybrid switching systems.
