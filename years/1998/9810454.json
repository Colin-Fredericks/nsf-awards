 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a two-year initiative of the Women's and  Gender Studies Program and the Women in Science and Engineering  Project at North Carolina State University.  A sequence of seminars  for science, engineering, and mathematics (SEC) faculty and  teachers who want to revise their SEM course syllabi to include the  new scholarship on women and people of color, followed by an  evaluation of the extent of those revisions and their impact on  students' attitudes and behavior.  Goals are to foster ties between  SEM and women's studies curriculum initiatives; to evaluate if/how  the new scholarship can encourage an inclusionary culture in SEM  courses; and to develop a prototypical and national model  evaluation process.  A third of the participants already teach  women's studies courses that have science content.  Women's studies  scholarship is defined as a \"social innovation\" that has a  \"diffusion\" process.  Using sequential surveys, interviews, and  observational data, an evaluation will be done on how faculty adopt  and implement the scholarship in their courses, how the students  respond to it, and the degree to which students' attitudes and  behaviors change as a result.  This approach contributes a much  needed empirical component to SEM-women's studies collaborations.",
