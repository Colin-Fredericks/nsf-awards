 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main focus of the program will be upon polymeric  composite materials. The program is comprehensive, ranging  from basic research to technology applications for industry.  The technical foundation of the work is that of the time-  temperature superposition methodology for polymers. With  this methodology, elevated temperature states can be used to  accelerate time flow events. When properly viewed on  logarithmic scales the acceleration effect is nothing less  than dramatic. The method has been available and widely used  for many years to characterize nondestructive properties  such as relaxation functions. In vitally important work of  very recent times, the method has been proven to apply to  the time based irreversible properties controlling failure  in polymeric based materials. This breakthrough work and  approach will be carefully exploited through evaluation and  expansion in the present program. The basic research  component of this program will involve developing a theory  of crack kinetics. Inherent flaws in bulk polymers and at  interfaces progresses through growth stages under load,  ultimately becoming of critical size to cause failure. This  avenue will be explored in great detail, along with full  statistical aspects of the problem. The work will be posed  in the temperature dependent state in order to incorporate  the time-temperature shift methodology. Common empirical  formulations of damage accumulation, such as Miner's `law`,  will be evaluated.",
