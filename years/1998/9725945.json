 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725945  Wettlaufer    This award supports a three year collaborative research  project between Professor John Wettlaufer of the University  of Washington and Professor Yoshinori Furukawa of Hokkaido  University in Japan.  The researchers will be undertaking  studies relating to pattern formation in growing ice  crystals and the influence of microscopic interfacial  structure.  This involves understanding the dynamics of  liquid water existing at the boundaries of ice crystals at  temperatures below the freezing point of pure water.  This  process, called premelting, has significant consequences in  the redistributing of brine in sea ice, the apparent  migrating of contaminants through glacier ice, and the rate  of frost heave and weathering in soils and rocks.  The  experimental and theoretical program will include studies of  ice crystal growth and unfrozen water transport between  crystals as functions of temperature and temperature  differences, as well as such studies between ice crystals  and various substrates.  An important objective will be the  development of useful models for ice growth and impurity  transport under natural conditions in order to assess how  grain interfaces may serve as chemical conduits.     This project brings together the efforts of two  laboratories that have complimentary expertise, research  capabilities and equipment. The research should provide new  insights into the theory of near equilibrium growth and  melting of ice.  The project is technically relevant because  surface phase transitions occur in a host of materials, many  of which are important to industrial processing.  It is also  environmentally relevant since the most abundant crystal  growth problems in the natural environment involve ice.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project  will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote  international understanding and cooperation.  ***",
