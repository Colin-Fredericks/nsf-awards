 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bucknell University `Summer Research Program in Physics`  will be continued, giving eight undergraduate students per  summer the opportunity to collaborate with a member of the  Bucknell physics faculty for ten weeks on his or her  research.  Students will be recruited from around the  country, with a focus on colleges in the eastern seaboard  and Appalachian region.  Six Bucknell faculty will offer  projects each summer, so the level of student-faculty  interaction will be high.  This immersion in a research  environment is intended to complement traditional classroom  experiences of the students.  Participation will help  students make career choices, and will provide specific  preparation for those that continue on the graduate studies  in physics.  All of the students will live together on the  Bucknell campus, conduct most of their research in on-campus  facilities, and participate in weekly departmental seminars  and colloquia.  Projects offered cover many areas of  physics.  They include experimental investigations of phase  transitions in biological cell membranes, use of laser  diodes and magnetic resonance to study atomic interactions,  experimental studies of pattern formation and chaos in  complex systems, observation based studies of star  formation, analysis of data from an experiment performed at  Fermilab National Accelerator, theoretical studies in  quantum optics, and theoretical studies in general  relativity.",
