 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most fundamental problems in theoretical computer  science, perhaps next in importance to only the P vs. NP  problem, is the P vs. NC problem.  Earlier work by the PI  has shown that many important combinatorial optimization  problems such as mincost flow and maxflow do not have fast  parallel algorithms in a PRAM model without bit operations;  this is like the usual PRAM model, the main difference being  that the instruction set of the processors does not contain  any bit operations.  Since the maxflow and mincost-flow  problems are P-complete, they do not have fast parallel  algorithms even in the unrestricted PRAM model assuming P  NC.  The significance of the result was in the fact that  this could be proved unconditionally, i.e., without assuming  P  NC, in a model that is natural and realistic for the  problems under consideration.  In fact, the PRAM model  without bit operations has been widely used in practice in  the design of parallel algorithms for a large number of  algebraic and weighted combinatorial optimization problems.  These include fast parallel algorithms for solving linear  systems, and for minimum-weight-spanning trees, shortest  paths, global mincuts in weighted undirected graphs,  blocking flows and max flows, approximate roots of  polynomials, and several problems in computational geometry.  Thus, our lower bound provided a concrete support for the  belief that P-completeness implies high parallel complexity,  and for the  P   NC conjecture itself, by proving its weaker implications  in a restricted, but realistic parallel model of  computation.    This project extends these techniques to investigate  parallel complexity of several other problems that are not  known to be, or expected to be, P-complete, and  consequently, whose parallel complexity is not well-  understood at present.  These include problems from several  different areas: network flows, matroidal optimization,  computational geometry, numerical computation, approximate  optimization, and so fo rth.  Investigating parallel  complexity of these problems in a unified manner is of  considerable practical as well as theoretical significance  in the design and analysis of parallel algorithms.    The project includes further applications of deep techniques  from algebraic to questions of lower bounds in complexity  theory.",
