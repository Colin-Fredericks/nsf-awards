 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award by the Divisions of   Chemistry and Earth Sciences supports interdisciplinary research and   education on mantle dynamics and plume-ridge interactions by Dr. Karen S.   Harpp, Department of Chemistry, Lawrence University.   The investigation   will focus on the Galapagos hotspot, located south of the Galapagos   Spreading Center (GSC), off the west coast of South America.  The magmas   produced here are controlled by both hotspots and mid-ocean ridges, thus   serving as tracers of mantle flow patterns, extent of mixing between the   two sources, and detailed lithospheric structure and dynamics.  The   relationship of regional volcanic features, specifically the Wolf-Darwin   Lineament (WDL) as well as Pinta, Marchena, and Genovesa islands, to the   ridge and hotspot are not well understood.  Three mechanisms for   understanding the region have been proposed:  WDL pipes plume material to   the ridge; lithospheric weakness at the lineament; ridge upwelling, with   increased melt production because of the adjacent hotspot.  Each   mechanism results in different predictions for geochemical variation.    Sample lavas will be collected from Wolf, Darwin, and Genovesa and their   chemical compositions determined.  The data will be fit to models to   determine which mechanism best describes geologic activity in the area.    The project will be carried out by undergraduates.  In addition,   inquiry-based methods and team approaches  will be introduced into   chemistry laboratories, including a new environmental laboratory course,   at Lawrence University and undergraduate students will be involved in   outreach with local school and community groups.  The origin of volcanic islands in the Galapagos archipelago is not well   understood because of the complex interaction between ocean ridges and   local hotspots or plumes.  The geological mechanism will be determined by   studying the chemical composition of the lava flows at various islands.    The research is integrated with education of undergraduate students who   will be prepared in discovery-based laboratories prior to experience in   field work in the Galapagos.",
