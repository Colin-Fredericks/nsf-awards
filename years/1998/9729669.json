 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729669  RHODES    The pituitary gland is a small organ located at the base of the brain in mammals.  In response to signals from the brain and the bloodstream, the pituitary secretes hormones that regulate growth, reproductive development and status, milk production, the response to stress and control of functions such as body temperature and metabolism.  During development, genes are turned on and off in a regulated program that allows the specialized hormone-releasing cells to be derived from simple, common precursor cells.  Molecules known as transcription factors act as switches to coordinate this program of gene activation.  Using state-of-the-art molecular technology, Dr. Rhodes will determine the specific mechanism of a pituitary transcription factor called P-Lim.  P-Lim is essential for pituitary development since individuals with mutated P-Lim do not develop pituitary glands and thus, die shortly after birth.  The results from these fundamental studies will significantly further our understanding of pituitary development and function.  Moreover, the knowledge gained from work on the pituitary can impact on related processes, such as the development of the nervous system, the blood and the limbs.",
