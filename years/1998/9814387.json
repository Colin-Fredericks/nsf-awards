A  theme, which appears to be emerging from studies of early development is  that  the  emotional context of the stimuli, has an enormous  impact  on  behavioral and brain changes, especially during early development. Thus,  these  emotional  events  can guide behavioral and  neural  development,  which result in permanent alterations in these systems. The objective of  the  proposed  experiment  is  to do assess  whether  the  relevance  or  significance  of  stimuli can also have a strong  impact  on  experience  dependent behavioral and neural changes.    The  whisker  system in rats offers an excellent system  for  studying  information processing because the somatosensory cortex is a  relatively  well  understood network of neurons and the neural pathway  between  the  whiskers and the cortex has been thoroughly described. Furthermore, each  whisker  is  represented by a cortical neural network called a  \"barrel\"  which  is  easily  identifiable with histological staining.  During  the  neonatal period, when a whisker is removed, its cortical barrel does not  develop.  Due to the limited sensory capabilities of neonatal  rats  (no  visual or auditory systems) the somatosensory system represents an ideal  partner to the existing literature in the olfactory system in which  the  circuitry  is  not as well understood. Using 1-8 day old rat  pups,  the  basic  experimental  method is to train neonatal  rats  in  a  classical  conditioning  procedure  using  the  somatosensory  system   and   later  assessing  the  somatosensory cortex for neural changes associated  with  the training.    The  potential  impact  of this proposal is  that  it  applies  a  new  approach  to  an \"established\" research area. The learning  paradigm  is  considered  an   enrichment paradigm and it has not been integrated  into  the  neonatal  whisker system plasticity research. The inclusion  of  an  enrichment paradigm into this area of study will add a dimension  to  an  existing cortical model of plasticity in which a deprivation paradigm is  currently   used.   Although  deprivation  is  very   helpful   in   our  understanding  of  systems, it becomes particularly useful  when  it  is  complimented with an enrichment paradigm.    This  proposal will enable the development of a strong foundation  for  a  model  in  the  whisker  system which will capitalize  on  a  growing  interest  in  the  characteristics of stimuli (emotional,  significance)  which  appear  to  be  important in promoting early experience-dependent  behavioral and neural changes.    Given   the   recent   progress   in   my   lab   on   defining    the  behavioral/functional  development of  the  vibrissal  system,  and  the  recent  explosion  of  interest  in  the  role  of  emotional/behavioral  significance of early experience on brain development, now is  an  ideal  time  to  bring  together  these two lines of research.  To  do  so,  my  proposal  capitalizes  on  the  wealth of  knowledge  concerning  normal  anatomical development of the rat vibrissal system.
