 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rex Skodje is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Progam to develop new methods to improve the understanding of   dynamical chemical processes.  Spectral quantization techniques will be   applied to transition state dynamics, control procedures will be   developed to optimize initial states, and applications will be made to   gas-phase photodissociation spectra and gas-surface scattering   resonances.  Methods for reducing complex systems of coupled nonlinear   kinetic equations to simpler lower dimensional models will also be   developed.  Applications will include combustion chemistry, vibrational   relaxation kinetics, and the kinetics of adlayers on solid surfaces.  Chemical reactions often proceed indirectly, i.e., by first forming an   unstable intermediate and then on to final products.  These intermediate   species are often unstable and difficult to study experimentally.    Therefore it is necessary to employ quantum mechanical simulations to   characterize the dynamics of such systems.  Many important problems such   as atmospheric chemistry and combustion are modeled using nonlinear   kinetic equations.  New algorithms will allow the simplification of   complicated networks of such equations.",
