The goal of the program  is to recruit students from the physical sciences with the hope  that they will be stimulated to the point of pursuing a research  career in the Earth Sciences.  Students in this program will work  with faculty members of the Mineral Physics Institute on projects  which probe the physical and chemical properties of materials with  a particular emphasis on the use of high pressure.  Working closely  with members of the MPI, students will pursue their own projects  and discuss their progress during weekly seminar sessions.  During  the program, students will visit other laboratories and  institutions affiliated with the Mineral Physics Institute.  ***",
