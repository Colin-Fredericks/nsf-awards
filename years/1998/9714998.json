 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program,   Professor Randolph P. Thummel, of the Department of Chemistry at the   University of Houston, investigates the preparation and properties of   novel ligand systems.  Professor Thummel explores the stereochemical   consequences of unsymmetrical substitution within bidentate ligands,   focusing on the steric and electronic effects of such substitution in the   formation of facial and meridional diastereomers of tris(bipyridyl)   complexes of ruthenium(II).  Through the synthesis of a series of ligands   related to 9-(di-2'-pyridyl)methylenefluorene, designed to undergo   rotation about the central pi bond following photoinduced metal-to-ligand   charge transfer and thereby present a barrier to internal return to the   ground state, Professor Thummel is investigating the generation of   long-lived photoexcited states.  Related ligands permit assessment of the   impact of ligand oxidation state on electronic communication between two   bound metal ions, while complexes of pyrene-based ligands offer the   possibility to observe room temperature emission.  The physical and chemical properties of metal ions may be altered   dramatically by capturing them within a molecular structure designed to   impact chosen properties.  Professor Randolph P. Thummel, of the   Department of Chemistry at the University of Houston, is supported by the   Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his investigations of   the synthesis and study of molecules designed to affect the chemical   processes resulting from the interaction of their metal complexes with   light.  Such photoprocesses lead to the transfer of an electron from the   metal to the supporting molecular structure, and by designing this   structure to undergo a significant change in geometry upon such electron   transfer, Professor Thummel attempts to stabilize the photoinduced   `excited state.`  Related studies permit assessment of the effect on the   electronic communication between two metal ions of a change in the nature   of a molecular grouping which bridges them.  These studies address   fundamental issues regarding photoinduced electron transfer and are   directly related to the harvesting of energy from sunlight.",
