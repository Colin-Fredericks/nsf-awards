 "awd_abstract_narration": "9808427  Jameson  The object of this research is to improve the understanding of subunit interactions and conformational dynamics of ribosomal \"stalk\" proteins, both isolated and associated with other ribosomal components.  The specific systems to be studied include the Escherichia. coli ribosomal proteins L7/L12 and L10, free and reconstituted into ribosomal subunits and the yeast eukaryotic proteins YPO, YP2( and YP1(. Cysteine residues, specifically placed at appropriate locations within these proteins by site-directed mutagenesis techniques, will be labeled with sulfhydryl specific fluorescence probes.  Fluorescence methods, including both steady-state and time-resolved anisotropies, will then be utilized to characterize the rotational properties of different domains of these proteins, free in solution and incorporated into ribosomes.  These latter studies will be aimed at elucidating thermodynamic aspects of the dimer/monomer equilibria as well as studying subunit exchange between dimers free in solution and in the various complexes.    The ribosome is the cellular organelle that makes new proteins and hence is essential to the proper functioning of the cell and to life.  These studies will help to provide a better understanding of how the various parts of the ribosome move as they carry out their biological function.  The training aspects of the research program will also help to develop human resources.",
