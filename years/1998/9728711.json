 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728711  Kuo, Scot  Wirtz, Denis    The project will employ a novel optical device to measure the viscoelastic properties of the cell cytoplasm and in vitro model systems.  This laser-based device, capable of \"laser-deflection particle tracking\" (LDPT), measures two-dimensional Brownian movements of particles with high temporal and dimensional resolution.  Unlike \"optical tweezers\" techniques, LDPT uses low energy laser illumination that does not perturb the particle being observed.  The technique will be used to make measurements on systems in which cytoskeletal elements may considerably alter the viscoelastic properties of the medium and affect particle movement.   The specific aims are first to refine methods of measurement and to establish a baseline by tracking polystyrene latex spheres in reconstituted actin gels in vitro.  This will be done in the presence and absence of various actin-binding proteins (capZ, alpha-actinins, and actophorin) which should significantly alter the viscoelastic properties of the gels.  Measurements will then be made on an in vivo system in which particles will be tracked in the dynamic, actin-rich lamellae of COS7 cultured cells.  The technique has the potential of providing highly refined measurements of the viscoelastic properties in localized regions of the cytoplasm which can be directly related to the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in these regions.  The measurements would be physiologically relevant to directional and force-dependent movement of vesicles and other organelles within the cytoplasm.",
