 "awd_abstract_narration": "Employing  a longitudinal study design, this doctoral dissertation research will examine the influence of experiences in education, work, and family on job-related values, taking into account selection processes. The focus is on three dimensions of job values: extrinsic (rewards derived from the job that are separable from the work tasks themselves); intrinsic (rewards derived from the work tasks themselves); and altruistic (rewards derived from doing things for others). The research will employ a longitudinal component of the annual \"Monitoring the Future\" study of high school seniors; specifically, panel data for the 1976-1980 senior cohorts, collected biannually over 14 years, will be used. Structural equation modeling will test three hypotheses: 1) values transmitted through social environments produce individual value change; 2) when the achievement of something desired is blocked, more readily available sources of reward become relatively more highly valued; 3) when the achievement of something desired is blocked, it tends to increase in value. In contrast, when something desired is readily achieved, it tends to decrease in value. An additional objective is to examine whether gender differences in job characteristics, family roles, and pre-employment values produce conditions such that similar experiences have different effects on the job values of men and women. The research will contribute to a general understanding of the nature of human values and how they change.",
