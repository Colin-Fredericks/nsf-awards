 "awd_abstract_narration": "9807128  Halliburton    This University/Industry collaborative GOALI proposal aims for  improved ternary and quaternary chalcopyrites (ZnGeP2, CdGeAs2,  CdGe(As1-xPx)2, AgGaSe2, AgGa1-xInxSe2, AgGaTe2); potential  applications are frequency conversion, tunable lasing and optical  parametric oscillator (OPO) materials. Professor Larry  Halliburton at West Virginia University (WVU) is collaborating  with Sanders, Nashua, NH where crystal growth research will be  done in collaboration with characterization studies at WVU.  Techniques to assess defects in these materials include EPR,  photo-induced EPR and photo-induced ENDOR. An important feature  of the project is the feed-back loop with the Sanders crystal  group, both in growth and post-growth treatments of the  materials. The knowledge obtained from defect characterization  will provide guidelines for modification in the crystal growth  and post-growth treatment that is expected to lead to materials  with optimized nonlinear optical properties. The project is co-  supported by the DMR Electronic Materials Program and the MPS  OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities).    %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  materials science having high technological relevance. The  research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a  fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/magnetic  devices. The basic knowledge and understanding gained from the  research is expected to contribute to improving the performance  and stability of advanced photonic devices by providing a  fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing  improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important  feature of the program is the integration of research and  education through the training of students in a fundamentally and  technologically significant area, and in providing an important  opportunity through the GOALI aspect of the project for students  to experience both academic and industrial research  approaches  and environments.  ***",
