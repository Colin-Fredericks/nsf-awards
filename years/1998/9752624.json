 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of Project Inclusion is to provide appropriate materials and strategies to deal with student diversity.  The Project products will be a series of resource materials and an implementation process that supports faculty in focusing students' attention on the chemical contributions of women and minorities.  All Project materials are connected to the typical topics presented in introductory/general chemistry.  The resource materials are undergoing review by a set of external faculty members and a group of faculty participants from a summer workshop program, as well as through extensive field-testing by a number of interested faculty.  Summer workshops provide faculty with an opportunity to learn how to prepare and integrate Project materials into their classes.  Project Inclusion is being publicized in presentations at chemistry conferences, by announcements to a comprehensive mailing list and through journal articles.  Preliminary work in the Project supports the belief that use of Project Inclusion materials and strategies results in greater student interest and success in their chemistry classes.  Evaluation is primarily focused on measuring attitude changes in faculty and students through use of CBAM (Concerns Based Adoption Model).  The potential impact of the Project is tremendous as its audience is every lower division college chemistry class in the nation.",
