 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the need to consider details of the  analog behavior of digital circuits and interconnect in  order to ensure correct functionality. Specifically it  focuses on analysis of timing and noise in deep submicron  circuit designs. All noise sources in a digital integrated  circuit are being considered - coupled and ringing noise on  signal lines, power supply noise, and noise from the  circuits The effect of noise on delay is being considered in  performance verification. Because many of the emerging  timing and noise problems are associated with on-chip  inductance, techniques for practically extracting on-chip  inductance will be developed. The question of how the  complex time-domain responses that result from inductive  interconnect can be used in static timing and noise analysis  is being investigated. Additional explorations are on using  the complex time-domain responses that result from inductive  interconnect for static timing and noise analysis. Other  areas of investigation include a static solution to on-chip  power grid integrity analysis and noise considerations in  synthesis and circuit tuning.  The educational plan includes building a VLSI CAD research  laboratory, and development of courses in hardware design  using FPGAs.",
