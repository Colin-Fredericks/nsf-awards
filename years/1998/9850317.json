 "awd_abstract_narration": "The wood products industry in the United States repeatedly points out with a sense of urgency the pressing need for more technicians and skilled employees. The Advisory Board of the Forest and Wood Products Institute at Mount Wachusett Community College (MWCC) and the Wood Products Manufacturers Association (WPMA), a 650-member organization, concur. This project is developing Technician Certificate, Continuing Education, and Contract Training programs that efficiently provide wood products industry employers with productive and well trained employees. This pilot is resulting in the design and development of a unique Certificate Program for Woodworking Technicians at Mount Wachusett Community College, with the ultimate goal the creation of an Associate Degree program. Both the Certificate and the Associate Degree Programs are being linked to regional high school and vocational school programs, and regional universities and colleges, particularly the Building Materials and Wood Technology Program at the University of Massachusetts. One of the unique components of this program is the creation of a Corps of Craftsmen, which consists primarily of retired persons who, through their vast experience, are bringing hands-on instruction and mentoring capability to this educational effort. The program consists of a combination of in-plant, classroom, and multimedia/distance learning. The program initially targets companies and students primarily located in rural areas of the Northeast, in cooperation with the Wood Products Manufacturers Association, with national dissemination to follow the evaluation of the results of this pilot program. The project also serves as a model for application in other industrial sectors, such as the plastics and metal working industries.",
