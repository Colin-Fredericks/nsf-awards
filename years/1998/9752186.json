 "awd_abstract_narration": "In today's world of global economic competition, the US is trying to maintain its competitive edge among industrial nations by training a sufficient number of engineers.  However, the number of trained individuals graduating from US colleges does not meet our current and projected needs.  In addition, the number of females and minority graduates with engineering degrees is unacceptably low and the attrition rate in engineering programs is unacceptably high.      The causes include (i) the inadequate preparation of our high school graduates, (ii) unfavorable attitudes toward engineering and other science based careers, and (iii) the absence of continuity in the transition from high school to college.  Some additional preparation for science and math teachers as well as high school courses that are more friendly to engineering and technology would address the above perceived causes.  To this end, this project will develop a new three credit hour class to address these problems. This class will be a capstone course that introduces fourth year pre-service teachers in mathematics and science education to engineering problem solving through specific practical applications.  The courses will include projects to be completed by teams of students and lectures by the instructors and guest lecturers.  The course will cover activities performed by practicing engineers and the related ethical, social and environmental issues within the rubric of Science, Technology and Society (STS).  It will also emphasize science literacy and inquiry learning as suggested by the new National Science Education Standards.    The proposed course will include an introduction to the practice of engineering rather than its theory.  The course will set up problems, present simplified solutions and avoid complex theoretical developments.  In addition, the business aspects of engineering, which are a prerequisite for a successful engineering career, will be introduced.  This business aspect fits within the suggested school to work  programs that are becoming a part of Nevada pre-university education.  A business plan or cost analysis will be completed for each project undertaken by the students.",
