 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Lepidoptera collections of the Florida Museum of Natural  History (FLMNH) Allyn Museum of Entomology (AME) represent  one of the most significant regional, national and  international systematic research resources in North  America.  Composed of a number of impressive older  collections, other donations, and field work completed by  the curatorial staff and other investigators, including  several biodiversity surveys, the AME collections contain  more than 1.1 million specimens and are 92-95% complete in  the representation of genera worldwide.  Among the  institutions in the Western Hemisphere, the collections of  AME rank comparable with and exceed the holdings of some  major  institutions in butterflies alone.    Collection growth as the result of donations of private  collections and biological survey studies in progress has  increased markedly over the past seven years.  In the  interim, the storage capacity to integrate these specimens  into the main collection in order to make them readily  available for research and use by the scientific community  has dramatically decreased.  These collections along with  voucher specimens derived from previous and current  biodiversity studies in addition to a backlog of more than  80,000 processed specimens have further exacerbated the  situation.  Due to critical lack of appropriate storage  facilities and very limited access, some data and specimens  are not available for study.    This project will improve the collection in four areas: (1)  the installation of additional mechanical storage units to  incorporate significant collections, voucher specimens  derived from biodiversity surveys, and a backlog of  processed specimens, (2) additional part-time personnel to  aid in the complete reorganization, transfer and integration  of these specimens and collections, (3) assistance in the  sorting of specimens  into groups to be forwarded on loan  for identification, and (4) provide support for visiting  taxonomic specialists to assist in the ident ification and  integration of specimens into the collection.    At the completion of the project, the entire collection will  be reorganized and expanded to accommodate this backlog of  specimens.  The identification and integration of all  processed, backlog specimens and other donations in kind  received should be completed.  The increase in collection  storage and reorganization will conserve and make these  unique research resources available for further study,  enhance curation, and aid in the future computerization of  collection data.",
