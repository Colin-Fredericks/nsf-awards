 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9801608   Alexander R. Its    The  research project is focused on the analytical aspects of the theory of   integrable systems related to the Riemann-Hilbert and isomonodromy methods.   The problems under consideration include the asymptotic analysis of the   correlation functions of  exactly solvable quantum field and statistical   mechanics models, the investigation of the double scaling limits in the theory of random matrices and orthogonal polynomials, and the global asymptotic analysis of the solutions of integrable differential equations of the Painleve' and KdV types.    The theory of integrable systems is an expanding area which plays an   increasingly important role as one of the principal sources of new   analytical and algebraic ideas for many branches of modern mathematics and   theoretical physics. Simultaneously, it provides an efficient analytic tool   for the study of some of the fundamental mathematical models which play a   central role in numerous applications arising in modern nonlinear science   and technology. Specifically, the research directions indicated above   deal with the mathematical models which form the theoretical basis for   the following fields: condensed matter, high energy and plasma physics,   nonlinear hydrodynamics, and high bit-rate telecommunication systems.",
