 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sequence analysis of the rice genome is progressing at a  rapid pace.  To maximize the impact of the sequencing  project, scientists who will be the end-users of the  sequence information, that is, those who will link the  genome information to function at all biological levels,  including cellular, organismal, and evolutinary, must be  included in the effort.  To facilitate of the international  coordination of this broadened view of rice genomic research  and the formation of international research collaborations,  this award provides funds to coordinate and support the  participation of 10-15 scientists from the USA to attend the  6th International Symposium on Rice Molecular Biology to be  held October 31-November 2, 1998 in Shanghai and Hangzhou,  China.  The scientific program for the Symposium includes a  comprehensive analysis of the rice genome, including  physical mapping and sequencing as well as gene regulation  and expression.  As many of the key Symposium speakers are  rice researchers from Asia (China, Japan, Philippines) and  the UK, this meeting provides an excellent opportunity for  US scientists working complementary and overlapping areas to  discuss potential collaborations and international research  coordination.  In additional to the formal sessions, an  informal discussion forum will be schedule during the  Symposium where all interested scientists can voice their  ideas on future directions for rice research and suggest  strategies for the coordination and implementation of this  research.    US participants for the 6th Internal Symposium will be  selected to represent the breadth of rice research in the  USA.  A widely distributed electronic invitation will  solicit applications for participation from faculty, post  doctorals and graduate students currently involved in  research in rice molecular biology.",
