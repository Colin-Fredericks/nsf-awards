The conference theme is  OMaterials Reliability Through Corrosion Research.O  Subject  areas include:  reliability of coatings for corrosion  prevention; reliability/corrosion predictive models; stress  corrosion cracking - models and experiments; corrosion  mechanisms and prevention in fluid delivery systems;  passivity - metals and semiconductors; pitting and crevice  corrosion - models and experiments; corrosion mechanisms and  prevention in atmospheric corrosion and the transportation  industry; and emerging areas in corrosion research.  The  conference features eighteen invited talks.  Nine of the  speakers are long-standing leaders in aqueous corrosion and  related fields; one is a younger scientist with a promising  new research program; the eight speakers yet to be selected  are a similar mix of senior leaders and newer entrants to  the field with emphasis on foreign scientists.  The  demographic mix of speakers and discussion leaders reflect  the worldwide community of people working in the field of  aqueous corrosion.  The discussion leaders are senior people  with in-depth knowledge of the session topic, experience in  the Gordon Research Conference format, and demonstrated  ability to stimulate vigorous discussion of the key issues  with broad audience participation.  The countries  represented by the speakers and discussion leaders are  include Germany, Britain, Japan, Switzerland, Sweden,  Australia, Canada, and France.  %%%  Aqueous corrosion is an important form of degradation in  metal alloys components.  This workshop addresses mechanisms  of aqueous corrosion with the purpose of improved  understanding of corrosion mechanisms and methods of  reducing this problem.  ***",
