Its central focus will be physical phenomena associated with quantum fluctuations.  Several specific topics have been selected for detailed study, some of which involve the gravitational field, and others of which involve nongravitational systems.  These topics include constraints on negative energy densities which derive from quantum field theory.  Such constraints impose severe restrictions on the use of negative energy to create exotic gravitational fields.  A second topic will be fluctuations of the stress tensor of quantized matter fields.  This is of interest both in the context of quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field and of the theory of van der Waals forces between solid bodies.  The quantum fluctuations of boundaries, including horizons, will also be subject to investigation.  Finally, some topics related to vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field in flat spacetime will be examined.  These include the effects of such fluctuations on electron interference patterns, and the possibility of amplifying vacuum fluctuations in the context of van der Waals forces.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to understand more deeply some of the effects of quantum fluctuations in a variety of situations, and in particular, to understand aspects of the quantum nature of the gravitational field.\r\n***\r\n",
