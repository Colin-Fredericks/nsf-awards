FRP materials were originally developed for the aerospace industry, and they are now starting to be considered for the repair of many deteriorating concrete and masonry structures throughout the world. but little information exists on their behavior or durability when used in such repair work.      Boothby and Mukherjee will visit several sites to inspect damaged structures and discuss with other professionals the extent of the repairs to be made in order to determine which structures to include in their cooperative research project.",
