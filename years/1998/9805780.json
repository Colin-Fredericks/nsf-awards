The data are from a network of cosmic ray detectors (neutron monitors) strategically located around the poles in order to gather information about the cosmic rays' angle of arrival. With such an array, the entire Earth acts as a directional cosmic ray detector. The fact that the Earth's magnetic field deflects the particles is used to determine the direction of arrival of energetic cosmic rays. Compared with cosmic ray detectors flown in space, this new \"Spaceship Earth\" enjoys counting statistics far exceeding current spacecraft capabilities. The Spaceship Earth network is an international project, with participation from US, Canada, Russia and Australia. It consists of 10 high-latitude stations, roughly equidistant in longitude (in Antarctica, in Russia, in Northern Canada).\r\nThe investigators will also examine the role of cosmic rays in the context of space weather. An advance warning of as much as 10 hours of potentially damaging magnetic storms might be possible. An innovative program of undergraduate education and public outreach in Space sciences, neutron detectors, and Space Weather is also planned. The present proposal requests funds to combine in real time the data from the widely spaced detectors, analyze the data in terms of the space physics and astrophysics applications mentioned above, distribute the data in a form that can be used by other researchers, and collaborate with Russian scientists to reactivate 2 inoperative stations in Siberia. \r\n\r\n",
