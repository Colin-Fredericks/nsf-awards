This is accomplished by means of an intensive summer program  centered on guided research experiences in natural history.  The  Research Training Program has developed a highly regarded and  innovative program that introduces undergraduates to the diversity  of scientific disciplines, research techniques, and career choices  available in the field of modern natural history.  The ten-week  program focuses on a research project guided by a research advisor  who is one of the over 100 Ph.D.'s on our scientific staff.  The  participant, in conjunction with the research advisor, develops and  tests a scientific hypothesis using appropriate techniques, and  communicates the results in written manuscripts and oral  presentations.  The research project is supplemented with a  schedule of activities including lectures, discussions,  demonstrations, field trips, and tours to provide a broad and  balanced view of natural history careers.  While in residence at  the National Museum of Natural History, the participants are fully  integrated into the Museum community.  This award supports 5  program positions dedicated to geoscience-based research topics.   Cooperative funding of the Research Training Program between the  Biological Sciences and Geosciences Directorates will also  encourage, through both formal research projects and informal  discussions, the type of cross-disciplinary research which occur  frequently within a large natural history museum.  ***",
