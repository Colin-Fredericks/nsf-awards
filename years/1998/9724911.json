 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724911  Ferry    This award supports a three year collaborative research  project between Professor David Ferry of Arizona State  University and Professor Yuichi Ochiai of Chiba University  in Japan.  The researchers will be exploring new  applications for nanostructures research.  The objective of the collaboration is to study the nature of  quantum transport in nanodevices, in particular the quantum  dot structure as it will appear in nanodevices (as an \"open\"  device and not a tunneling device).  They will investigate  the nature in which the crossover from classical to quantum  transport occurs.  Through studies of the phase coherent  lifetime, they will also investigate the conditions under  which quantum mechanical effects can be observed in  realistic device structures.     This project brings together the efforts of two  laboratories that have complementary expertise, research  capabilities and equipment.  The collaboration provides a  unique combination of experiment and theory.  It is  anticipated that these studies will provide an important  insight into those fundamental physical principles which  will determine the operation of future generations of room  temperature nanodevices.  Through the exchange of ideas and  technology, this project will broaden our base of basic  knowledge and promote international understanding and  cooperation.  ***",
