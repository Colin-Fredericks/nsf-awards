Rakhmanov      The project involves the use of potential theory and operator theory  to investigate three main problem areas: (1) discretization of the surface   of the unit sphere in N-dimensions, including asymptotics for minimal   energy arrangements and algorithms for constructing near optimal points;   (2) weak and strong asymptotics for orthogonal polynomials with respect  to continuous and discrete weights; and (3) best rational and meromorphic   approximation in function spaces, including generalizations of the   theory of Adamyan, Arov, and Krein.      The main problem to be investigated concerns finding nearly optimal   arrangements of large numbers of points (typically in the hundreds or   thousands) on the surface of a sphere so that these points are uniformly   dispersed with respect to area on the sphere (i.e., the proportion of   points lying in an arbitrary cap is close to the ratio obtained by   dividing the area of the cap by the total area of the sphere). For this   purpose the investigators will use minimum energy criteria which were   introduced in a previous NSF grant. By analyzing the asymptotic behavior   (as the number of points grows large), the investigators aim to devise   simple schemes that generate configurations with near minimal energy. The   importance of this problem is underscored in a recent article by S.Smale,   who lists the study of such spherical point schemes as one of the eighteen   main mathematical problem areas for the next century. Indeed this study   has a wide variety of practical applications, among which are the   following: (1) the structural analysis of large, stable, carbon molecules   (known as fullerenes); (2) the determination of optimal sampling points on    the Earth's surface for data gathered by orbiting satellites; and (3) the   testing of radar sensors for aircraft  when spherical  coverage around the aircraft is essential.",
