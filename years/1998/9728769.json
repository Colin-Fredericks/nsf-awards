 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organization and Reorganization of Pattern Generators: A Comparative  approach.         Only  in  recent years have we begun to understand in  reasonable  detail  how  specific neural circuitry mediates any given behavior.  A  fundamental question that is difficult to directly address is: \"How do  behaviors  co-evolve  with  the neural  circuitry  that  mediates  the  behaviors?\" This comparative study will begin to examine this  general  question   by   exploiting   invertebrate   feeding   systems.    Many  invertebrates have neurons with unique identities. These  identifiable  neurons  have  morphological  and physiological  characteristics,  and  interconnections with other identifiable neurons, that are  replicated  in  each individual of a species. As specification occurs some of  the  properties and interconnections of some of these identifiable  neurons  will  diverge,  whereas others will remain unchanged.  Many  distantly  related gastropods (i.e. different subclasses) have relatively similar  feeding  behaviors. In contrast many closely related  gastropods  have  radiated   into   diverse   ecological   niches   with   corresponding  diversification  of  feeding apparatuses  and  behaviors.  This  study  exploits  data  on  the  circuitry  underlying  similar  feeding   and  ingestive  behaviors in the distantly related opisthobranch sea  hare,  Aplysia  californica,  and pulmonate pond snail,  Helisoma  trivolvis.  Similarities and differences in the neural control of feeding in these  animals  will  be experimentally analyzed. These data will  provide  a  baseline  for  examining  the changes that  have  occurred  in  neural  circuitry   devoted   to  oral  behaviors  in  closely   related   but  ecologically   diverse   gastropods  as   the   oral   behaviors   and  morphological feeding apparatuses have evolved.",
