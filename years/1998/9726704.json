 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726704  Raymond    This award supports a three year collaborative research  project between Professor Charles Raymond of the University  of Washington and Professor Masayoshi Nakawo of the  University of Nagoya in Japan.  The researchers will  undertake a computer-aided study of the rapid shrinkage of  glaciers in the Himalaya. Glaciers are retreating especially  rapidly in many tropical and sub-tropical mountain regions.  Over the last two decades, glaciers in the Himalaya show  mass balance rates that are amongst the most negative of any  region of the world.   The losses of glacier mass are  indicative of climate warming over the last half century.  However, quantitative interpretation of the retreats in  terms of past climate changes requires elucidation of the  processes that relate the masses and lengths of glaciers to  climate.  The researchers will use a combination of models  that predict the mass balance of a glacier from climate  input and the redistribution of ice mass by glacier flow.  The mass balance models will be based on field observation,  by the Japanese, of environmental characteristics peculiar  to the Himalaya.  These include accumulation predominantly  in the summer and retardation of melting by extensive thick  covers of rock debris.  The glacier geophysics group at  Washington will aid in the adaptation of ice flow models to  the Himalayan glaciers under study.  ***    This project brings together the efforts of two groups that  have complimentary expertise and research capabilities.  Results of the research should quantify the significance of  the disappearance of glaciers as an important indicator of  global climate change.  The results should also help  indicate the degree to which the shrinkage of debris covered  glaciers can  pose flood hazards for down-stream areas.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project  will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote  international understanding and cooperation.",
