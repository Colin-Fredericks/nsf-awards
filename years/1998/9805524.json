 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concepts of lamination and foliation have recently been the focus of much attention. They have been incorporated into the renormalization theory of one-dimensional dynamical systems, played a crucial role in the foundations of higher dimensional holomorphic dynamics, enabled advances in long-standing problems in hyperbolic geometry, witnessed the solution of classical problems on analytic differential equations, and led to new concepts in  topology. The conference will bring together people looking at laminations and foliations from different points of view in the hope that it will create fruitful interactions between intimately related but somewhat separated fields.      Laminations and foliations play a fundamental role in the theory of dynamical systems, which is the general study of evolution of systems that change with time. Dynamical systems theory emerged, historically, in celestial mechanics, and has since found numerous further applications everywhere: in statistical mechanics, biology, chemistry, economics, and so on. It has deep implications for any aspect of science involving the time-evolution of complex systems.  The study of foliations is concerned with the way that a large system can be broken up into a family of smaller systems, like layers of dough in a pastry.  For  example, a physical system in which energy is conserved separates into thin layers, one for each energy level. The ability to analyze a system in this way is of crucial importance, and leads to deep connections between the dynamics and phenomena in other important subfields of mathematics, in particular, in geometry and topology. The broadly interdisciplinary nature of the subject was one of the main motivations for this conference.  With this in mind, the conference will be strongly directed towards the interests of graduate students and young researchers, who will have a chance to see a broader perspective of mathematics in its active development.  To support this educational goal, the conference will include , in addition to the customary research lectures, a number of introductory \"mini-courses\" which will provide participants with a more comprehensive outlook on different aspects of the field.",
