 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 97-28171  DIENEL      The functions of two major classes of brain cells, neurons and  glia, are highly specialized. Neurons carry out the signaling  processes, transferring information from one cell to another to  control and coordinate the activities of the body. Glial cells  surround neurons and have many important functions, including  control of the extracellular environment which can modify neuronal  activity thereby influencing behavior. Glial functions and glial-  neuronal interactions in brain are poorly understood because it is  very difficult to assay the activities of specific classes of  cells in the living brain. Brain function is often evaluated by  metabolic brain imaging procedures using radiolabeled glucose  analogs because there is a close correlation between changes in  functional activity and local rate of glucose utilization to  provide energy for brain work.  Functional metabolism is the  breakdown of compounds to extract energy for the working cell, and  metabolic imaging is based on local trapping of labeled products  of the metabolic tracer in the cell where it is metabolized; the  quantity of trapped label reflects the magnitude of functional  activity. Because glucose is a fuel for all cells, it cannot  distinguish between the functional metabolic changes in the  different cell types in brain. In the present study, glial-  specific  \"reporter molecules\", i.e., labeled compounds known to  be metabolized mainly in glial cells, will be used to measure  stimulus-induced metabolic changes in glial cells and evaluate  working relationships between glia and neurons. Experiments are  designed to test the hypothesis that metabolic activity in glial  cells increases in proportion to the activity of neurons when  neurons are stimulated by graded changes in sensory input, and  that compounds made in glial cells are transferred from glia to  neurons in increased quantities. Neurons will be activated by  changing the magnitude of a visual stimulus (flash rate or  intensity of a  strobe light) to cause progressive increases in the  signaling activity of neurons in the eye as the visual information  is processed in the brains of experimental rats; altered neuronal  activity is predicted to cause parallel changes in the activity of  glial cells in the visual pathway and rates of metabolism of glial  reporter molecules. Some compounds made in glial cells are  exported to neurons, and the quantity of labeled compounds  transferred and incorporated into a neuron-specific marker (a  neurotransmitter called GABA) will be measured, thereby permitting  assessment of neuronal-glial metabolic interactions in working  brain. The results of the proposed experiments will increase our  understanding of how glia obtain their energy to carry out their  work and how neurons and glia work together to process visual  information.  Knowledge of the cellular basis of metabolic brain  images will also help to form the basis for future development of  new brain imaging techniques to visualize and quantify glial cell  activity in human brain.",
