 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims at the effective integration of databases, multimedia and the Internet for digital library applications. The research establishes an underlying framework and develops techniques for ensuring consistent and robust retrieval, transmission and presentation of multimedia data. The research plan involves: (1) customized presentation: develop principles to support consistent multimedia presentations based on quality of service specifications; (2) transmission: develop adaptive end-to-end control techniques to support transmission of multimedia data over networks; (3) retrieval: formulate a resource allocation model for a database server to allocate its resources for data retrieval; and (4) implementation and experimentation of a distributed multimedia database prototype for educational digital libraries. The educational component of the project focuses on two objectives: (1) development of new courses in the area of multimedia databases and digital libraries, and (2) application of the research to the establishment of a computer-assisted learning environment for asynchronous distance learning. The new courses and accompanying curriculum standards are designed to reflect the changing needs of computer professionals. Through the above research and educational activities, the fundamental understanding and novel techniques can be provided to support system development. The developed framework can be readily used to facilitate student tutoring, medical training, human resource development, and asynchronous distance learning. On a broader level, the methods and experimental results arising from this research will also guide the development of distributed multimedia database systems in industrial applications.",
