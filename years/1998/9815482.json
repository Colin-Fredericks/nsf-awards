The principal        investigator is Dr. Andrew Hillier at the University of Virginia. The        research is directed towards the development of a class of adaptive        materials whose binding characteristics respond to changes in their        local environment. These materials are particularly attractive in        chemical separation as their environmental sensitivity can be used as        either a signal of analyte binding or as a means of actively        controlling chemical affinity.  Specifically, a series of        supramolecular  compounds will be constructed based on macrocylces of        cation-selective polyethers and anion-selective polyammoniums that are        tethered to redox-active metallocenes or optically-responsive        diazobenzenes.  The chemical affinity of the macrocycle will be tuned        by varying its chemical composition and ring size to adjust        selectivity for small, inorganic ions ranging from halides to        transition metals. The impact of optically electrochemically-induced        switching of the binding behavior in these materials will be        investigated. The separation characteristics of these macromolecules        will be examined in aqueous solutions while incorporated into liquid        and bilayer lipid membranes.               This work provides a novel class of materials with highly  controllable        chemical binding behavior and a switching mechanism that can be        externally triggered to actively control membrane-based separation        processes and design novel chemical sensing techniques. The work will        lead to the discovery and implementation of new materials that provide        a specifically controlled local environment for manipulation of        chemical affinity and transport properties.",
