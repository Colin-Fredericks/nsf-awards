 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 97-28383  GOLDSTEIN      Human hearing continuously monitors the frequency composition of  sounds throughout the audio range (50-16,000 Hz). The inner ear  allows the brain to monitor about 4,000 different overlapping  frequency bands within this range. A model for how this is  accomplished by the brain, the\" simple spectrogram model,\" has  been used widely throughout this century by scientists and  engineers.  The model  represents auditory frequency analysis with  25 contiguous linear filters, each spanning 1/3 of an octave, with  the brain monitoring the energy within short segments (10-250  milliseconds) of the filter responses.  By assuming further that  information received by the brain is limited by internal noise,  this model has served as a basic framework for predicting human  abilities to recognize speech and to discriminate changes in  sounds.  Limitations of the simple model are known, including  failures to predict audible distortion tones generated by inner-  ear nonlinearity, and sensitivity to signal waveform.  In recent  collaborative research with Bell Laboratory scientists, Dr.  Goldstein discovered that detection of signal peaks rather than  energy improves model predictions of discrimination phenomena.  This revived interest in an earlier, \"peak-detection,\" model of  Dr. Goldstein's (1967) that was used to explain discrimination of  waveform changes produced by modulation of sinusoidal carriers.  As a result, evidence was found for two processes at each auditory  filter in the peak-detection model.  Because of other recent  evidence that slow modulations within speech sounds contribute to  their recognition, these newly recognized characteristics of  hearing may be particularly relevant for audio science and  engineering. In the present project, use of random signals  minimizes confounding effects of inner-ear nonlinearity on  interpretations of experiments. The project is exploiting this to  develop further the model of auditory peak detection.  In addition  to upgradi ng the classical spectrogram model, this research is  contributing knowledge of functions performed by neural mechanisms  beyond the inner ear.",
