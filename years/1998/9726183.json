 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, focusses on the development and characterization of new  method for probing the mechanisms and energetics of large ion  dissociation in electrospray ionization and matrix assisted laser  desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.  Professor Williams and  his students at the University of California at Berkeley will  experimentally and theoretically study this new method, blackbody  infrared radiative dissociation, with smaller biomolecules  initially.  A long-term goal of this work is to understand the role  of salt bridges involving acidic residues in peptides in the gas  phase.  The unique feature of this new method is ions ranging in  size from small to large can be trapped in a Fourier-transform mass  spectrometer cell and exposed to blackbody photons that activate  dissociative processes under controlled conditions.  This  experiment permits study of the kinetics and mechanisms of these  processes which also occur in other ion dissociation methods, but  under uncontrolled conditions.    A new method for inducing chemical reactions for ions ranging in  size from small to large is being developed and characterized in  conjunction with mass spectrometry experiments.  Professor Williams  and his students at the University of California at Berkeley will  use blackbody infrared photons to initiate these reaction under  controlled conditions in a mass spectrometer cell.  The  experimental and theoretical characterization of this new method,  developed in Professor Williams' laboratories, will permit the  study of the conformation of large biological molecules, such as  DNA, in the gas phase.  This information is important for  understanding the chemistry of these biological molecules and their  structures.",
