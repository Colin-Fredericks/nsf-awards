 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on a computational analysis of the barrierless   reactions of transient carbenes and biradicals.   Computational   approaches to tunneling and entropy controlled reactions will be examined   with a specific emphasis on developing the theoretical underpinning   needed to predict product ratios.   Undergraduate students involved in   the research will be introduced to modern computational approaches to   chemical dynamics and semi-empirical electronic structure theory.  With this Standard Grant, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry   Program supports the research and educational activities of Dr. Charles   Doubleday of the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University.   Dr.   Doubleday will focus his research efforts on the theoretical analysis of   the reaction dynamics of carbenes and biradicals.   Although implicated   as intermediates in a number of organic transformations, in most cases   these species can not be observed experimentally because of their short   lifetimes.    Computational methods capable of treating these barrierless   organic reactions will be developed and tested through the prediction of   reaction product ratios.   Dr. Doubleday's educational activities will   include introducing undergraduates to the development and testing of   modern computational approaches to chemical dynamics.",
