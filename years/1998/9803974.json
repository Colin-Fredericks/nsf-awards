 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project proposes research on distributed systems that  monitor the positions of various moving objects and process  queries and triggers referring to their positions.  Applications of such systems, called Moving Object  Information (MOI) applications, typically occur in  transportation systems in the civilian sector and in the  digital battlefield management in the military.  This  proposal considers two different architecture models for the  MOI systems; in the first one a single central server (CS)  monitors the position of the objects and answers queries;  the second architecture is fully distributed in which the  moving objects communicate with each other to answer the  queries and to monitor trigger conditions.  The project  proposes various location update policies for maintenance of  the position information of the objects in the CS model. All  these policies maintain the position of an object as a  dynamic attribute that changes with time. The project plans  to investigate the cost effectiveness of these policies  through analytical and experimental studies.  A query  language based on Future Temporal Logic (FTL) is proposed  for specifying spatial and temporal queries and trigger  conditions on the moving objects. The language  permits  specification of the desired levels of uncertainties in the  answer. Research towards the development of efficient  query/trigger processing mechanisms in the two architectures  are proposed. The proposed mechanisms will be evaluated in  an experimental testbed.",
