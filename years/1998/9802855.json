 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802855  Saloff-Coste   This research focuses on certain Markov processes that evolve in a geometric   environment. The relations between the long time behavior of the process and the   geometry are studied. In the context of finite Markov chains, analytic and geometric tools   are developed to obtain quantitative results concerning ergodicity. The role of Sobolev   type inequalities is investigated. For random walk on finite groups, the relation between   the behavior of the walk and the structure of the group is studied. The behavior of random   walk on infinite Cayley graphs and its relation with isoperimetric inequalities are   investigated. Examples showing exotic behaviors are produced by considering wreath   products and studying the Laplace transform of the number of visited points and other   related functionals. In the context of Brownian motion on Riemannian manifolds, the   investigator will study two-sided global heat kernel bounds on manifolds with ends. This   requires hitting time estimates for compact regions and bounds on the Dirichlet heat kernel   of unbounded regions. Some problems concerning Gaussian measures on locally compact   groups will also be investigated.      This research is concerned with basic properties of certain random processes. A   familiar yet typical example is the question of how many times a deck of cards must be   shuffled to be mixed well. Random processes similar to card shuffling are used in   computer programs to perform tasks for which no efficient deterministic algorithm   is known. Understanding how well these stochastic algorithms work is important and calls   for precise mathematical studies. Different generalizations of card shuffling lead to the   study of random processes on different types of mathematical structures. The investigator   will study the long time behavior of these processes.",
