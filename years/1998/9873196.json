 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  EEC-9873196  Trotter    The procurement of a CAVE will allow the ERC 's computational infrastructure to advance the understanding of the output of the numerous simulations and data sets processed by the Center.  It will allow the Center to better contribute to advancing the knowledge and technology base in virtual environments.    The focus projects are drawn from application areas related to ongoing ERC research.  The application areas are flow about manufactured objects (propulsors, propellers, and moving vehicles), i.e., CFD applications, meteorology and oceanography (METOC) visualization environments, and visualization of remotely sensed data.    The research issues underlying these applications concentrate on distributed, multiresolutional representations and visualization, compression, and  human-computer interfaces (HCI) and human-factor issues.    The first two areas of research will be addressed predominantly by the members of the Scientific Visualization Thrust of the ERC.  The last research area will be addressed in collaboration with faculty from the Cognitive Engineering and Systems Laboratory (CESL) and the Institute for Signal and Information Processing (ISSP).    The CAVE will also be used as an educational tool.  The ERC will include its use in existing courses and will institute new course devoted to virtual environments.",
