The seven previous ADASS meetings have  established this series of conferences as the leading world forum for  scientists and programmers to discuss issues of common interest  regarding algorithms and software systems for the acquisition,  reduction, analysis, archiving, and retrieval of astronomical data.  Due  to the success of the ADASS conferences, ADASS is now the sole forum for  discussions of astronomical software and techniques. The goal of these  conferences is to facilitate the exchange of information and to foster  continuing communication between software developers (including those in  the computer industry at large) and users in the astronomical community.  ADASS 98 has the following components.  There will be two formal short  workshops taught by leading experts: An Introduction to Parallel  Computing and Topics in Java Application Development. There will be  invited talks on the special topics scheduled for ADASS 98: The Future  of Astronomical Computing, Advanced Visualization Technologies, PCs in  Astronomy, Measuring the Cosmological Constant via Automated Supernova  Detection, and Computer Security in a Scientific Environment. In  addition, there will be contributed talks, poster papers, and informal  Birds of a Feather sessions.  ***",
