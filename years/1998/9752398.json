 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a two-year project  to develop curriculum materials to teach the concepts of Visualization, i.e., the use of computer graphics to display information. It is a joint project between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the ACM SIGGRAPH Education Committee (SEC) and is international in scope. This project builds on several previously funded NSF and SEC projects, and on a project funded by the United Kingdom Advisory Group on Computer Graphics (AGOCG).    While in one sense Visualization has been around for hundreds of years  TUFT83 , in another sense, it began as a formal discipline only recently  MCC087 . It was initially specific to scientific computing applications, but has been extended to many other areas such as general data or information visualization. The basic concepts of Visualization are transferable to, and important for, many different areas such as mathematics, science, business, education, and others. An estimated fifty percent of the brain' s neurons are associated with vision and Visualization exploits this \"gigabit bandwidth of the eye/visual cortex system\"  MCC087  to facilitate the understanding of both simple and complex concepts in many different application areas.    While Visualization has been previously used in many different areas, such as education, it has only been in the past few years that a large amount of research has gone into many of the underlying principles and components of the field. We are proposing to take the knowledge gained in these research efforts, create instructional materials that capture this knowledge, and make them available to a wide audience. The successful implementation of this project will provide the basic materials to teach the important concepts of Visualization and can be used at many different levels in college and K-12 courses.",
