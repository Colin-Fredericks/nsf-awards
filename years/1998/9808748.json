 "awd_abstract_narration": "9808748  Fechheimer    Actin microfilaments represent one of the three major classes of cytoskeletal elements known to exist in eukaryotic cells, and one of two such classes known to serve as the structural framework not only for cellular morphology but also, in conjunction with specific motor proteins (e.g., myosins in the case of actin-based motility), serve as the mechanistic basis for  cellular movements.   Such cell movements, including not only whole-cell locomotion  but also movements within cells, such as phagocytosis and cytokinesis, require precise control of the assembly of actin microfilaments into either gelled networks or highly polarized bundles of filaments.  This precisely-controlled actin filament assembly is mediated by actin cross-linking proteins.  These cross-linking proteins are highly conserved across eukaryotic species.      This project will exploit the advantages of the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, to study actin cross-linking proteins. Eleven different cross-linking proteins have been identified in this organism.  The ameboid stage cells of Dictyostelium undergo directed whole-cell locomotion (chemotaxis), phagocytosis, and cytokinesis, which can be readily observed and assessed under laboratory conditions.  In addition to microscopical approaches, both biochemical and genetic approaches can be used in an integrated approach to elucidate the structure and function of cytoskeletal proteins in this organism.      One of the eleven cross-linking proteins in Dictyostelium is a calcium-regulated 34,000 Dalton actin bundling protein (34 kD protein) found in filopodia, pseudopodia, phagocytic cup, cleavage furrow, and cell-to-cell contact sites.  Cells lacking the 34 kD protein grow, locomote, and develop, but exhibit detectable phenotypes in the morphology of filopodia and persistence of motility.  Similarly, single mutants in other actin cross-linking proteins have phenotypes that are not debilitating to locomotion, division, or development.  The first aim of this project is to utilize gene replacement to determine the functions of the actin cross-linking proteins from the synthetic phenotypes exhibited by double and triple mutants.  The second specific aim is to evaluate whether the multiple actin binding sites and the calcium binding site are required for actin binding/bundling in vitro and for function in vivo.  Molecules containing only one or two of the three actin binding sites and/or lacking the ability to bind calcium will be produced in Escherischia coli, and the molecular interactions required for actin filament cross-linking and bundling will be dissected by studies of the interactions of these altered molecules with actin in vitro.  These 34 kD proteins bearing defined structural/biochemical lesions will also be expressed in D. discoideum cells lacking two or more of the actin cross-linking proteins to determine whether the altered 34 kD molecules can substitute for the intact protein to restore function in vitro.  The third specific aim is to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the 34 kD protein is recruited to sites of phagocytosis, the cleavage furrow, and sites of cell-to-cell contact.  The experiments are designed to test three hypothesized mechanisms that may function separately or collectively to control the correct spatial and temporal localization of actin cross-linking proteins in vivo:  1, binding to actin filaments is sufficient to direct proper subcellular localization; 2, calcium regulation is required for correct localization; and 3, an unknown binding partner of the 34 kD protein directs its localization.    The experimental advantages of Dictyostelium and the background information already available in this organism present a unique opportunity for this project to make fundamental contributions to new knowledge about the structure of actin cross-linking proteins and their interactions with actin, mechanisms of regulation, and functions in living cells.  This information will be of general significance for c ell structure and organization across all eukaryotic species.",
