 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biochemistry occupies a unique position at the interface between the physical and biological sciences, generating a need for educational programs which focus on quantitative as well as descriptive aspects of the field. However, most curricula provide limited exposure to chemical and biophysical approaches. We are addressing this deficiency at UCSB via a new major in Biochemistry within the auspices of the Chemistry Department. Central to the curriculum are two new laboratories with emphasis on quantitative and analytical aspects of biological phenomena. This proposal seeks funding to equip these two laboratories. Instrumentation requested includes UV-visible atomic absorption and circular dichroism spectrometers.  The new laboratories will enhance undergraduate laboratory experiences via a research-oriented teaching perspective in which students are given experimental objectives but only general protocols. Guidance is provided as the students turn the objectives into detailed protocols. Students will be asked to integrate diverse approaches while focusing on the same enzyme for an extended period. This approach better resembles the working mode of practicing scientists than does the usual class experience of unrelated experiments.  We expect that these laboratories will permit students to develop highly marketable skills in protein chemistry, enzymology and biophysics. It is also hoped that students will more directly experience the excitement of scientific research as they learn to think creatively and quantitatively. Such an experience should be lasting and will help educate professionals in areas such as business, law and primary education, to better grasp the impact of the biotechnology revolution on society. The experiments will be disseminated through presentations and a published laboratory manual.",
