 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program supports research on metalloenzymes by Dr. Marcetta Darensbourg   of the Chemistry Department, Texas A&M University.  The focus of the   investigation is the reaction chemistry of (NiFe)hydrogenase, an enzyme   that promotes the formation, fixation, and sensing of dihydrogen.  The   active site of the Desulfovibrio gigas hydrogenase is heterobinuclear   (Fe, Ni) and the iron center appears to be associated with cyano and   carbonyl groups.  In this work, the known organometallic anions   CpFe(CN)2(CO) where Fe = Fe(I), Fe(II) will be studied for their ability   to signal electron density changes at Cp substitutents caused by   hydrogen-bonding or solvent interaction.  Vibrational spectroscopy will   be used to monitor the electron density changes accompanying redox and   enzyme activity levels.  In addition, newly designed dithiolate ligands   will be used to coordinate nickel complexes to the iron unit which may   serve as a structural model for the enzyme.  The hypothesis concerning   the catalysis process is that either the iron unit provides stabilization   via an electron-withdrawing iron site that mediates charge through the   thiolates, thus easing accessibility to catalytically active Ni(I); or   the dihydrogen production catalysis involves the Fe(II) site, with the   nickel dithiolate serving as a bidentate ligand that is electronically   tunable by changes in redox state or ligation.  Hydrogenase enzymes perform important biological functions that provide   energy to cells.  These enzymes have been found to contain two metals,   iron and nickel, at the active reaction site, but how these metals   cooperate in the reaction is unknown.   Many past studies have   investigated the role of nickel, but this research will elucidate the   role of iron, and of the iron-nickel combination.  The results may also   be relevant to the functioning of mixed metal industrial catalysts whose   functioning is not well understood.",
