 "awd_abstract_narration": "9808801  Sharrock  This proposal addresses the general question of how plants sense the environmental light cues that control their physiological and developmental processes.  Specifically, the proposal explores the organization and function of a plant regulatory photoreceptor system, the red/far-red (R/FR) light-sensing phytochrome family.  The phytochromes are soluble receptor proteins, which exhibit R/FR-reversible conformational changes and biological activities.  The small weed Arabidopsis, a plant commonly used as a model species in molecular genetic studies, contains five different phytochromes, phyA through phyE.  Among these, phyA is abundant in dark-grown plant tissue, is strongly down-regulated by light, and is referred to as type I phytochrome.  The phyB through phyE phytochromes are lower in abundance, less light-labile, and are collectively referred to as type II forms of the receptor.  The overall goals of this proposal are to define the specific functions of these type II phytochromes and their distributions in the plant and within plant cells, and to test models for genetic and/or physical interactions among these photoreceptors.  The R/FR light environment plays a large role in regulating plant architecture and development in response to shading and crowding.  In addition, the contribution of R/FR-controlled plant responses to important agronomic traits such as seed germination, yield, and flowering time make the phytochrome receptors significant targets for modification in crop plants via biotechnology.  An understanding of the physiological functions and the molecular mechanisms of the type II phytochromes will aid in the development of agricultural applications of plant photosensory systems.",
