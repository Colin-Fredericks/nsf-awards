 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803526  Schwartz       Richard Schwartz will carry out research in geometry and dynamics,  along four lines.  First, Schwartz will continue the work that began  with his proof, in 1993, that nonuniform rank one lattices are  quasi-isometric if and only if they are commensurable.  In particular,  Schwartz will further develop the theme of action rigidity, introduced  in his 1996 Acta paper, \"Quasi-isometric rigidity and diophantine  approximation.\"  Second, Schwartz will explore the ramifications of his  1997 proof of the Goldman-Parker Conjecture, which gives exact discreteness  criteria for complex hyperbolic ideal triangle groups.  This result is the  first of its kind, in that it gives the complete analysis of a nontrivial  deformation problem in complex hyperbolic space.  Third, Schwartz will  continue his work on dynamical systems defined by iterative constructions  in projective geometry.   The work here is related to birational dynamics,  abelian varieties, the KdV equation, and determinants.  Fourth, Schwartz  will develop software that aids in the understanding, communication, and  solution of geometric and dynamical problems.       The common theme to this research is that it deals with the geometric  structure of infinite, symmetric, patterns.  One should think, for example,  of tiles on the kitchen floor, or trees arrayed in an orange grove.  Informally speaking, the first area of Schwartz' research deals with the  question:  Could a fairly blind person mistake one infinite symmetric  pattern for another?  The idea is to find very \"rough\" features of an  infinite pattern that could distinguish it from another infinite pattern.    The second area of research deals with the following kinds of questions:  Imagine that an apple is suspended in space, surrounded by mirrors.  How  can you position the mirrors so that the pattern of reflections of the  apple will be nice and orderly?  The third area of research deals with  the generation of infinite patterns through the repetition of simpl e  constructions, made from pencil and paper drawings.  Often a very innocent  construction, such as the Pappus' theorem construction, yields a surprising  and beautiful geometric pattern upon infinite repetition.  The purpose of  Schwartz fourth area of research is to make all these infinite patterns  come alive through interactive computer graphics.  ***",
