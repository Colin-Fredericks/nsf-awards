 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733160  Wang    This grant explores synthesis and characterization of  magnetic nanocrystal superlattice materials.  To utilize the  technological advantages offered by the size specificity and  selectivity of nanoclusters, it is imperative to understand  the fundamental methodologies for preparation of cluster  assembled materials in macroscopic quantities and with high  standards of size, structural morphological and shape  uniformity.  These are vitally important steps toward a  systematic exploration of the nature of patterned  superstructures assembled from such building units, as well  as the formulation of methods for designing and controlling  such novel assembled materials.  The major research  objectives are:  to synthesize, characterize, and determine  the properties of self-assembly passivated magnetic  nanocrystal superlattices of Co, y-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4; to  determine the bulk and surface microstructures of the  nanoparticles and the superlattices for understanding the  magnetic coupling/decoupling among nanocrystals as a  function of the interparticle distance; to examine the in-  situ structure evolution and phase transformation of the  nanoparticles, the surfactant and the superlattices for  predicting the stability, reliability and durability of the  system for device applications, and to model the structure  and behavior of nanocrystals and their assemblies.  Education efforts are concentrated in the areas of  development of collaborative graduate student thesis  projects, expansion of outreach programs, development of  interactive microscopy displays for high school students and  the public, and development of interdisciplinary teaching  experiments related to materials science.  %%%  Nanocusters, and the physical and chemical functional  specificity and selectivity they possess, suggest that they  are ideal building blocks for two-and three-dimensional  cluster self-assembled superlattice structures.  Self-  assembled arrays can involve self-organization into  monolayers, thi n films, and superlattices of size-selected  nanoclusters  with encapsulated in protective compact  organic coatings.   Patterned magnetic nanocrystals are of  vital interest both scientifically and technologically  because of their potential applications in information  storage, color imaging, bioprocessing, magnetic  refrigeration, and ferrofluids.  ***",
