 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of growth patterns is important in the study of human evolution.  Detailed comparisons of archaic and modern juvenile craniofacial morphology and growth patterns are possible because the remains of juvenile Neandertals are relatively abundant.  This project will compare modern and archaic juvenile craniofacial morphology and growth using eight juvenile Neandertals and ten samples of modern humans from Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America. The purpose is to: 1) examine variability in modern h uman juvenile morphology and growth,  2) determine if a basic, modern human pattern of craniofacial growth can be distinguished, and  3) compare this modern human pattern with the Neandertal pattern.  This project is unique in using three-dimensional (3D) morphometric methods to examine craniofacial growth in Neandertals and is the first to include an adequate sampling of juvenile modern humans against which the Neandertal pattern can be evaluated.  The data consist of 3D coordinate locations collected from 80 landmarks on the face, neurocranium, basicranium, and mandible. A pilot study has demonstrated the utility of the 3D data and methods, and has revealed differences in growth between Neandertals and modern humans.  It also revealed differences in growth between two modern human samples, supporting the need for further investigation of variability in modern human juvenile morphology and growth.",
