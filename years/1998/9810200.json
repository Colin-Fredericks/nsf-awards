 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project applies computer-based networking techniques to two cases studies of the design process to examine how ethical commitments and other contingencies shape the development of two products, an `environmentally intelligent fabric` and a solar water heating system.  Each product was invented in a different way, the fabric through collaboration, the water heater through individual effort.  But both were guided by principled commitments to environmental values, and both confronted technical and economic constraints that conditioned the sort of product that would be produced.  Such values, influences and constraints are best represented by networks, and this project will integrate competing frameworks for depicting such influences while using recently-developed, computer-based techniques for depicting actors, influences, and outcomes.",
