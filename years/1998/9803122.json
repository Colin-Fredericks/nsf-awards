More\r\nspecifically, what are the hyperbolic knots in the 3-sphere that admit\r\nDehn surgeries that are small Seifert fibered spaces or contain essential\r\n2-spheres or 2-tori?  The main approach to this problem is to understand\r\nwhen a surface of small genus, either an essential surface or a Heegaard\r\nsurface, can appear in a Dehn surgery on a hyperbolic knot.  The residue\r\nof a surface in the Dehn surgery is seen as a punctured surface in the\r\nknot exterior.  It is put forth that by looking at the intersections of\r\nsuch a punctured surface with an appropriate planar surface in the knot\r\nexterior, one will obtain a good picture of the knot.  Such an approach\r\nhas been successful in the past at analyzing similar situations.\r\n    The structures of 3-dimensional spaces and the classification of knots\r\nare beautiful and deep subjects, but they are also important subjects in\r\nextending our knowledge in other branches of the sciences.  For example,\r\nsome physicists now are trying to tie astronomical observations to\r\nstructures of 3-dimensional spaces in order to determine the shape of the\r\n3-dimensional universe.  Microbiologists are beginning to use the concepts\r\nof knot theory to describe and understand the knotting of DNA molecules.\r\nChemists are doing the same to understand the knotting and linking of other\r\nmolecules.  The Dehn surgery construction is an operation on a 3-dimensional\r\nspace that produces a new 3-dimensional space.  This is done by changing\r\nthe space around a knotted circle in the space.  This project studies how\r\nthe space changes according to the type of knot along which the change was\r\nmade.  The relationship between the resulting space and the knot is a\r\ncomplex one, and its understanding is a natural goal for 3-dimensional\r\ntopology and knot theory.  A good knowledge of this relationship is also a\r\nuseful tool for exploring knots and 3-dimensional spaces.  Since its\r\nintroduction at the turn of the century, the Dehn surgery construction has\r\nbeen a standard way of constructing examples of phenomena in 3- and\r\n4-dimensional spaces.  It also turns out that many basic questions about\r\nknots can be formulated as questions about the Dehn surgery construction. \r\n***\r\n",
