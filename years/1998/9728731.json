 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 97-28731  METZNER and KOCH      The long term goal of this project is to determine how higher  order nerve cells (\"neurons\") within the central nervous system  extract behaviorally relevant features from their sensory input, a  task common to all sensory systems. To address this question, we  will focus on the question of how information is encoded at the  primary sensory neuron level and subsequently processed by higher  order neurons in the electrosensory system of weakly electric  fish. These weakly electric fish produce a sinusoidally varying  weak electric field in their environments using a specialized  \"electric organ.\"  Electrosensory receptor cells located along the  body of the fish detect modulations in the amplitude of the  electrical field produced by the presence of nearby objects.  Primary sensory neurons  (\"P-receptor afferents\") transmit this  information to the next level of the sensory pathway, the  electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL). There, behaviorally  relevant features are extracted and encoded in the spike trains of  pyramidal cells, the output neurons of the ELL. The mechanisms  underlying this feature extraction will be investigated by  combining neurophysiological, neuroanatomical and computational  data analysis techniques.  Major aims are: First, to characterize  the accuracy and robustness of P-receptor afferent responses (the  \"nerve impulses\" or \"spikes\" electrical fields cause) to time-  varying modulations of electric field amplitude and second to  perform simultaneous recordings from several pyramidal cells  during presentation of the same stimuli. Accuracy and robustness  of the impulse firing of primary sensory neurons will be studied  using recently developed measures of \"distance\" between spike  trains and standard signal processing techniques. The responses of  pyramidal cells will be analyzed using signal detection techniques  adapted to multiple spike train data. The proposed project is  designed as a group proposal: experiments will be conducted  in the  laboratory of Dr. Metzner (UCR) and the computational analysis in  the laboratory of Dr. Koch with participation of Dr. Gabbiani  (both Caltech). This combination of neuroethological and  computational/information theoretical approaches will clarify the  nature of early sensory processing in a model sensory system  ideally suited for this kind of analysis. In particular, this work  is expected to lead to a quantitative understanding of the code  used to represent and transmit sensory information across multiple  neurons.",
