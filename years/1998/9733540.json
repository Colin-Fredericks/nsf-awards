 "awd_abstract_narration": "The explosive growth of wireless communications has  generated competitive pressure to fulfill the promise of  seamlessly integrated personal communication services.  Meeting quality-of-service constraints for advanced  multimedia services over wireless is an important challenge.  Wireless channels are rapidly-varying, rate-limited, and  subject to severe degradation due to propagation and  multiuser interference. This has sparked considerable  interest in blind signal separation techniques, capable of  separating and estimating the users' signals without  assuming knowledge of the channel. Interestingly,  mathematically similar problems appear in chromatographic  analysis (CA) and flow injection analysis (FIA) in  chemometrics, with applications in quality control for  manufacturing, a Federal Strategic Area.  The research  component of this program involves the study of blind signal  separation problems, posed as a (system of) bilinear  regression(s) subject to: (i) factorization constraints;  (ii) uni- or oligo-modality, convexity, or support  constraints on the columns of certain factors (these exploit  direction-of-arrival (DOA) diversity afforded by antenna  arrays, without requiring DOA estimation; unimodality is  well-motivated in the context of CA/FIA, and so is  smoothness of factor profiles); and (iii) modulation-induced  (e.g., finite-alphabet) constraints. The emphasis is on the  development and performance analysis of associated  optimization algorithms, and applications thereof in  communications and chemometrics. Cross-fertilization between  the two application domains is an integral goal of this  program. The educational component of this program includes:  (i) the development of introductory and advanced courses on  optimization theory and algorithms for signal  processing/communications -oriented undergraduate and  graduate students; (ii) the development of a suite of MATLAB  routines for laboratory/Web instruction; (iii) the creation  of undergraduate signal processing research and education  opportunities; and (iv) greater emphasis on innovative  instruction through proper utilization of multimedia tools  to complement traditional modes of instruction.",
