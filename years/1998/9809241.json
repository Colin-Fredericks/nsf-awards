Traditionally these have included analysis of tree rings, pollen, and packrat middens among others.  Unfortunately, the most widely used proxies only determine one hydrologic variable: effective moisture.  This project will attempt to develop additional paleoclimate proxies capable of predicting several hydrologic variables by using the physical geologic and geomorphic features of a well-studied paleolake.  We believe that many lake features can be directly related to lake circulation and hydrodynamics, which in turn are a function of wind direction and magnitude as well as precipitation.  We further believe that the best place to develop this methodology is in the natural laboratory of Lake Bonneville (Utah-Nevada), one of the largest and best studied Late Pleistocene pluvial lakes in North America.\r\n\r\nThe project will proceed in a logical 3-stage (approximately 3-year) sequence, which will rely upon the expertise of the three PIs.  In the first stage, a coarse-resolution (2-km grid spacing), 3-dimensional hydrodynamic model of Lake Bonneville will examine the velocity field (which define general transport and deposition patterns), surface waves and their relationship to shore transport, bottom shear stress, and flow convergence.  Emphasis will be placed on using idealized wind boundary conditions in which mean wind direction is varied.  This stage will proceed in concert with photogeologic and GIS analysis of longshore transport directionality of Bonneville shoreline segments.  The hydrodynamic model output and geomorphic and GIS analysis will be used to identify areas in one or more subbasins of Lake Bonneville where siliciclastics lake deposits will be studied in detail.  This portion of the project will also be used to determine the prevailing wind direction for both the Bonneville and Provo lake stands.  These analyses in turn will aid in interpretations about the role of the continental ice sheet on mean wind direction in the Great Basin.\r\n\r\nIn the second stage (years 2 and 3 of the project), detailed field studies will be followed with fine-grid (100-500 m grid spacing) hydrodynamic simulations of selected portions of Lake Bonneville.  Fieldwork will consist of determining shoreline character, morphometry and morphostratigraphy of the shore-zone sediment bodies, and detailed facies analyses.  These fine-grid simulations will permit detailed calculations of velocity, bottom shear stress, as well as determination of the temporal evolution of sedimentary and geomorphic features.  The hydrodynamic model is capable of operating at any grid spacing, and can therefore be tailored to the particular field setting being considered.  Sensitivity analyses with the fine-grid model will examine the importance of storms; irregular increases in river input as well as time-dependent formation of lacustrine features.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the third stage (year 3), there will be interactive feedback between fine-grid modeling and field studies to resolve the real observable field data with both GCMs and RCMs.  This final synthesis of the combined modeling and field studies should allow considerable guidance for future integrated studies of climate models, hydrodynamics, geomorphology, and siliciclastics sedimentology.\r\n",
