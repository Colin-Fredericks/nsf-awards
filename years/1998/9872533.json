 "awd_abstract_narration": "98-72533  Plichta    Michigan Technological University - Redesigning Engineering Education with Active Learning and Integration Through the Engineering Enterprise    Michigan Technological University (MTU) has one of the largest undergraduate engineering programs in the nation with a major emphasis on undergraduate engineering, science  and technology education.  MTU is reported to be the 15th largest undergraduate engineering college in the country.  The college of engineering offers 10 ABET accredited programs.  Of these programs several are also among the largest in the nation, including Mechanical Engineering (3rd), Civil and Environmental Engineering (5th), Chemical Engineering (7th), and Metallurgical and Materials Engineering (7th).  Of the remaining 2000 undergraduate students, well over 95% are enrolled in baccalaureate degree programs in science, technology, business and forestry.    This project describes the implementation of a major engineering curriculum redesign at Michigan Technological University.  The new curricular structure of the engineering programs incorporates innovations in completely implemented, the new curriculum will impact every engineering student at MTU as well as many non-engineering students.  There are five major thrust areas of the project:  1) development of a common, first year engineering program, 2) integration of math, science, communication and engineering during the first and second years, 3) development of an interdisciplinary design experience in the 4th year, 4) implementation of a interdisciplinary engineering experience for students during the 2nd through 4th years, and 5) establishment of a program for secondary teachers that will ultimately lead to greater participation of underrepresented groups in the engineering profession.  The project will involve faculty in every engineering program at MTU, as well as faculty from business, economics, physical sciences, mathematics, and communications.  Key and unique ingredients of this project are the dev elopment  of personal and professional behaviors/skills as an integral part of the student's education while at the same time allowing the students to explore their technical interest and apply their technical background to 'real world' problems.    Faculty and administrators from MTU have been interacting with faculty from Coalition schools, including SUCEED, FOUNDATION, and ECSEL, over the past two years in an order to identify \"best practices\" and innovations in engineering.  Many of the ideas presented in this project draw on experiences with these educational leaders.  However, this project contains a component, the Engineering Enterprise, which is a revolutionary concept in undergraduate education.  The Engineering Enterprise concept developed by faculty and administrators at MTU, working in conjunction with industrial leaders, will provide our students an environment in which they can develop professional as well as technical skills.  Industrial reaction to the proposed Engineering Enterprise initiative has been enthusiastic.",
