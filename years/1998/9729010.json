 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents a continuation of research into the  syntactic structure of American Sign Language (ASL), funded by NSF  grant #SBR-9410562. The research agenda has been to investigate the  distribution of functional categories in ASL. Functional categories  are those that signal structural relationships among lexical  categories. For example, functional categories, such as Tense,  Aspect, and Agreement, contain grammatical information that is  often expressed morphologically through inflection. Different  languages make productive use of different subsets of grammatical  categories. It is the characteristics of functional categories that  establish basic sentence structure and determine typological  variation. The goal has been to uncover the syntactic structure of  ASL through examination of functional categories.       Research to date has investigated a large number of  syntactic constructions in the language, focusing most intensely  on Tense and person Agreement projections, as well as the higher  level projection relevant to the structure of questions. With  respect to these three areas, our results have diverged from  previous beliefs about ASL. We have demonstrated the existence of  lexical tense markers (contrary to the belief that ASL lacks  grammatical tense). Our discovery of non-manual syntactic  markings of agreement has provided new insights into the nature  of agreement, its representation in the syntax, and its relation  to the distribution of null pronouns. Our analysis of questions  challenges previous claims about the mechanism of question  formation in ASL, as well as claims that have been made about  purported constraints on phrase structure and movement processes  in language generally.       The syntactic research on functional categories will now  extend to several additional projections that display interesting  interactions with those that we have already studied. For  example, Aspect has not only manual instantiations (which have  been described in the l iterature) but also interesting non-manual  correlates that have not yet been examined. We will also extend  our work on agreement to number agreement, both within the clause  and the determiner phrase. In addition, we will address several  syntactic projections above the level of TP (the clause).  Finally, we will complement our studies of the functional  structure of ASL with studies of the verb lexicon, focusing on  the argument-taking properties of particular classes of verbs.",
