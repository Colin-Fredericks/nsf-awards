 "awd_abstract_narration": "This GOALI award is to support a two-month collaborative  research effort of UPI at Barry Controls of Brighton, MA.  During the first four weeks of research, the PI will review  vibration isolation system control strategies; formulate  realistic controller and actuator  models; and carry out  robust stability analysis. The analysis will demonstrate the  utility of a new analysis technique developed by the PI to  solve a real world problem. During the next five weeks, the  research will focus on power and energy consumption of an  active vibration isolation system. Power requirements with a  variety of controllers for both conventional and  regenerative control strategy, it will be possible to  quantify required power versus the performance of the closed-  loop system, which is critical for system design. For the  regenerative control strategy, the product of actuator force  and actuator velocity, when positive--denotes the power  required by the vibration isolation system; and when  negative-denotes the power to be applied to the system,  i.e., power that could actually be regenerated. A major goal  of this research is to enhance an understanding of  regenerative control as applied to vibration isolation  systems.",
