 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project initiates further research on the fields of distance\r\ngraphs and the channel assignment (also named T-coloring).  Both\r\nfields have been active research areas for years.\r\n\r\nThere are two major components in this project.  The first one\r\nextends research on problems on distance graphs and T-coloring\r\nand their connections.  The first connection between distance\r\ngraphs and T-coloring was proved by the PI [1997] and was used to\r\nobtain extend solutions on a problem on distance graphs raised\r\nand studied by Eggleton, Erdos and Skilton [1985].  A joint work\r\nwith Chang and Zhu [1997] completely solved the problem and\r\nproved the second connection which showed that the fractional\r\nchromatic number of a distance graph is equal to its asymptotic\r\nT-coloring ratio.  The latter parameter was shown, by Griggs and\r\nthe PI [1996], to be closely related to an earlier number theory\r\nproblem, namely, density of sequences with missing differences,\r\nstudied by Cantor and Gordon [1975] and by Haralambis [1977]. The\r\nproject will follow this direction of research to explore other\r\nuseful connections between distance graphs and T-coloring, to\r\nobtain further results on distance graphs including their\r\nchromatic number, circular chromatic number and fractional\r\nchromatic number, and to study a generalization of the problem of\r\nEggleton, Erdos and Skilton.\r\n\r\nMotivated from practical situations in the channel assignment\r\nproblem, several variations of T-coloring have been studied.  The\r\nsecond part of this project will extend the research of the PI's\r\npast and current work and joint work on two variations of\r\nT-coloring, namely, no-hole T-coloring and distance two labelings\r\nof graphs.  Research on the distance two labelings will also\r\nbenefit the practical two-level-interference channel assignment\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nFor update references and works of this project, readers are\r\nwelcome to visit the PI's web site at:\r\nwww.calstatela.edu/faculty/dliu/dliu.htm or email to:\r\ndliu@calstatela.edu.\r\n\r\nThis POWRE project is supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA).",
