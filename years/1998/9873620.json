 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research seeks to understand when and if immersive virtual environments make it easier for students to understand complex ecological processes compared to what they can learn from desktop simulations and other experiences.  The immersive and non-immersive learning materials will be built from databases and models developed by the PRISM project.  This project models environmental interactions in the Puget Sound.\r\n\r\nThe framework that guides this project is built from an understanding of three properties of VEs; their ability to induce \"presence\" in users; their ability to support extensive, natural interactions with objects; and thier ability to make accessible to the senses events that are normally undetectable.  These properties of VEs have the potential of supporting constructivist approaches to teaching and learning and thus helping students develop scientifically correct mental models of scientific phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe study will focus primarily on college age students.  However, in the latter part of the study, they will include high school seniors.",
