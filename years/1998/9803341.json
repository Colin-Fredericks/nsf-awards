 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Proposal: DMS-9803341  Principal Investigator: Richard M. Schoen    This proposal deals with three geometric variational problems.  The  first is the problem of minimizing the volume for lagrangian  submanifolds of symplectic manifolds.  This theory provides an  approach to constructing special lagrangian submanifolds of  Kahler-Einstein manifolds.  The second problem is the study of  harmonic maps which are equivariant with respect to general isometric  actions of discrete groups on spaces of nonpositive curvature.  This  theory may be applied to study many general rigidity questions for  both finite and infinite dimensional representations of discrete  groups.  The third problem concerns the variational problem for  Einstein metrics, where the problem is to compute the Yamabe invariant  in more generality, and to show that standard metrics achieve this  min-max variational characterization.    Minimization problems occur in many branches of mathematics and  science.  For example, linear programming concerns the problem of  minimizing a function (such as cost) subject to a set of constraint  inequalities, problems of navigation involve finding paths of least  length on the earth's surface, and in continuum mechanics, the  equilibrium position of an elastic membrane is determined among the  infinitely many possible positions by the condition that the potential  energy be as small as possible.  This proposal deals with certain  geometric variational problems, of which the first is the problem of  minimizing a potential energy for mappings subject to the constraint  that the mappings preserve the area.  Such problems arise in nonlinear  elasticity where the mapping represents the deformation of an elastic  body.  The problems also arise in geometry where one can use such  minimizing configurations to understand complicated geometric spaces  that arise in string theory (physics).  The second part of this  proposal deals with maps which minimize a potential energy subject to  the conditi on that they are symmetric for a complicated symmetry  group.  For example, if you consider the curve of least length which  surrounds a given area, you get a circle, while if you choose curves  which surround regions whose translates (under a fixed symmetry group)  fill up the plane, then the solution is typically a special type of  hexagon (the regular hexagon of the honeycomb if the symmetry group is  chosen suitably).  The main goal is to use the symmetric minimizing  maps to understand the possible symmetry groups and how they can arise  in important geometric situations.  The final part of the proposal  deals with equilibrium solutions of the Einstein equations of General  Relativity.  The full Einstein equations may be thought of as  describing the vibrations of the gravitational field which determines  the geometry of spacetime.  The corresponding equilibrium problem is  important in geometry, and the third part of the proposal deals with  the question of the extent to which equilibrium solutions can be  expected to minimize the potential energy.",
