 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803219\r\nAktosun\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to study certain inverse scattering problems arising in \r\nquantum mechanics and wave propagation.  Such problems are governed \r\nby the Schroedinger equation, its variants, the wave equation and the \r\ntelegraphy equation in the frequency domain.  Using techniques related to \r\nRiemann-Hilbert problems, operator factorizations, and spectral analysis \r\nof differential operators, the aim is to recover coefficients appearing in the \r\nrelevant differential equations in terms of a suitable set of scattering data. \r\nIn addition to their practical importance in physics, engineering, and other \r\napplied fields, these inverse problems contribute mathematical techniques \r\nto various areas of mathematics such as nonlinear differential equations, \r\nintegral equations, boundary value problems, and applied functional \r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\nThe inverse scattering problems under study are motivated by their \r\nimportant applications in many areas such as materials science, \r\nnondestructive testing, acoustic imaging, seismology, geophysics, and \r\nremote sensing.  In materials science the solution of the inverse scattering \r\nproblem amounts to determining surface and subsurface structure of \r\nmaterials by analyzing neutron beams scattered off the materials, for \r\nexample, helping to understand bonding of polymer components.  In \r\nquantum mechanics it corresponds to the determination of forces holding \r\nmolecules, atoms, and subatomic particles together by analyzing colliding \r\nbeams of particles.  In remote sensing it helps to profile unknown targets \r\nby analyzing acoustic or electromagnetic waves scattered off such targets.\r\n",
