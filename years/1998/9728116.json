 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728116  Thompson  Total internal reflection with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy will be used to determine the factors which govern the translational mobilities and concentrations of fluorescent proteins adjacent to single phospholipid bilayers deposited on transparent planar substrates.  An argon ion laser beam will be internally reflected at the substrate/solution interface, creating an evanescent field that extends only a small distance into the adjacent solution.  Along with the evanescent depth, an aperture placed at an intermediate image plane of an optical microscope will define a small volume next to the membrane surface.  The fluorescence arising from molecules within this small volume, collected with a high aperture objective and detected with a fast silicon avalanche photodiode, will fluctuate with time as individual fluorescent proteins move in and out of the observed volume.  The normalized fluorescence fluctuation autocorrelation function will provide information about solute translational mobility and concentration.  A large variety of biological processes involve the interactions of molecules in solution, such as proteins, with receptor molecules present on the surfaces of biological cells.  The details of these interactions, which result in specific biological behavior, are predicted to depend strongly on the concentrations and movements of the proteins in solution directly adjacent to the cell surfaces.  These two properties, concentration and translational mobility, will be measured for fluorescent proteins next to models of cell surfaces constructed on transparent planar surfaces, by using newly developed methods that employ laser excitation and optical microscopy.  The results will be used to expand the current level of general knowledge about how cells detect and respond to their environments, giving rise to biological function.",
