 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9806127  Stewart      The control of cell growth involves a number of processes to  which protein synthesis is central.  The broad term  objectives of this research are to understand the mechanisms  of cell signaling that lead to the regulation of protein  synthesis and cell growth.  Drosophila melanogaster will be  used as a model system in these studies since many cellular  components involved in protein synthesis are highly  conserved between flies and mammals.  In mammalian cells,  the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase, p70 S6K, lies on a  cellular signaling pathway that ultimately leads to  alterations in protein synthesis.  The Drosophila p70  ribosmal protein S6kinase homologue and mutations affecting  this gene have recently been identified. Site directed  mutations of this gene will be made and transgenic flies  bearing mutant versions of this gene will be generated.  This POWRE award will permit the PI to learn and establish  the technique of microinjection into embryos required for  transformation, and to perform pilot experiments.    ***      This is a POWRE award which will enable the investigator to  learn and establish the necessary techniques to make  transgenic flies expressing mutants of a protein critical in  protozoon synthesis and other cellular processes. This will  enable further experiments to determine it role.",
