Herwig  of  the  Department  of  Physics and Astronomy of the  University  of  Missouri  at  Columbia will investigate processes  in  which  one  chemical component in a fluid mixture preferentially adsorbs on a  solid surface.  Such processes occur widely in materials science.  A case of particular interest is the preferential adsorption from  solution  of  long flexible-chain molecules, a process  which  is  important  in  such  applications as lubrication,  adhesion,  and  coatings.   Whereas  considerable  progress  has  been  made   in  understanding the structure, thermodynamics, and, on  macroscopic  time  scales,  the  kinetics  of such polymers  near  interfaces,  little  is  known of the dynamics of these systems at the  atomic  level.  In simplest terms, the questions to be addressed are  how  do  polymer  chains move so as to anchor, diffuse, and eventually  desorb  from  a  solid surface.  Both linear and branched  alkane  molecules  of  intermediate size (containing between  20  and  40  carbon atoms) on graphite and Ag(111) substrates will be used  as  prototype   systems  for  studying  the  dynamics  of   selective  adsorption. Quasielastic neutron scattering will be used to study  the  diffusive  motion  within  the  alkane  films,  while  their  structure  will be investigated by neutron and synchrotron  x-ray  scattering.   The  interpretation  of  the  experiments  will  be  assisted  by  detailed  computer  simulations.  Experiments  will  utilize  existing  state-of-the-art facilities  at  the  Missouri  University  Research Reactor and both the Intense Pulsed  Neutron  Source and Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory.  %%%  In  this research program, Professors H. Taub and K.W. Herwig  of  the  Department  of  Physics and Astronomy of the  University  of  Missouri  at  Columbia will investigate processes  in  which  one  chemical component in a f luid mixture preferentially adsorbs on a  solid surface.  Such processes occur widely in materials science.  A case of particular interest is the preferential adsorption from  solution  of  long flexible-chain molecules, a process  which  is  important  in  such  applications as lubrication,  adhesion,  and  coatings.  Unfortunately very little is known  at the microscopic  level about the dynamics of how such polymer molecules anchor  to  a  solid  surface, then crawl about, and eventually  desorb.   In  this  project  intermediate-length   hydrocarbon-chain  molecules  (both  linear  and  branched alkanes), which  are  the  principal  constituents of commercial lubricants, will be used as prototypes  for  studying the dynamics of selective adsorption.  Quasielastic  neutron  scattering  will  be used to investigate  the  molecular  motion  within the hydrocarbon films, while their structure  will  be investigated by neutron and synchrotron x-ray scattering.  The  interpretation  of the experiments will be assisted  by  detailed  computer simulations. Experiments will utilize existing state-of-  the-art  facilities at the Missouri University  Research  Reactor  and  both  the Intense Pulsed Neutron Source and Advanced  Photon  Source  at  Argonne  National  Laboratory.   This  research  will  provide training of graduate students in fundamental  aspects  of  polymer science, preparing them for careers in the petroleum  and  rubber industries.  ***",
