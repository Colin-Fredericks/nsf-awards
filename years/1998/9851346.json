 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stimulated by advances in molecular and cellular biology, a new and evolving research activity within biomedical engineering is the application of engineering at the bimolecular, cellular and tissue levels. The overall goal of this research is to produce natural or modified therapeutic biomolecules and the design of hybrid tissues and organs. As a result of the importance of this developing activity, the objective of this proposal is to integrate biomolecular, cellular and tissue  engineering into the undergraduate curriculum. We propose to achieve this objective by modifying and expanding the laboratory component of three required courses in biomedical engineering and two electives and to provide increased opportunities for independent study coursework in this area.  Laboratory projects will complement class material by directly demonstrating fundamental concepts and illustrating relevant biomedical examples and applications of the material using modern instrumentation and techniques. This equipment will also be available for use in undergraduate independent study research. Matching funds will be provided by the School of Engineering and the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Duke University. Additionally, one  of the Co-investigators will work to increase the presence of underrepresented groups in independent study research. Co-investigators on this project teach the courses which will be revised and supervise independent study research by undergraduates in bimolecular, cellular and tissue engineering.",
