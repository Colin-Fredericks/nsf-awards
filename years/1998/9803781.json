The goal is to provide powerful, low-noise, compact, and efficient local oscillators for receiver systems.  The cost advantage of our approach would stimulate the development of commercial and military applications in the millimeter/submillimeter-wave region.  This effort is motivated by the PI's recent theoretical and experimental results demonstrating that high performance (RF output power > 100 mW) can be obtained from InP Gunn oscillators operating in the fundamental mode at D-band (110-170 GHz) frequencies.\r\n\r\nGunn device structures with a graded doping profile in the active region will be designed, fabricated, and tested.  The design of the Gunn devices will be performed using a Monte Carlo simulator developed by the investigators.  The Hewlett-Packard High-Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) will be used to analyze and design the resonant waveguide cavity.  Realistic estimation of the RF output power levels will be obtained by coupling the Monte Carlo and the HFSS results in a harmonic-balance technique.  These estimates will significantly expedite the optimization process.\r\n\r\nThe research effort will be conducted as a collaboration of SUNY at Stony Brook and the University of Michigan.  The design of the device and the resonant circuit will be carried out at Stony Brook by the PI and a graduate student.  The mount and device fabrication as well as the measurements will be conducted at the University of Michigan by Dr. Eisele and a graduate student. During the first year, a new processing technologies using beam leads and/or micromaching will be developed to simplify the packaging step as well as improve heat management, package parasitic, and reliability.  In the second year, oscillators will be developed for frequencies between 200 GHz and 260 GHz while in the final year oscillators will be developed for frequencies from 260 GHz to 300 GHz.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of the project will provide compact and reliable locate oscillators with low noise and high performance in the upper millimeter-wave region.  This will either eliminate any varactor multiplier stage or at least greatly reduce their number in a local oscillator system, thus simplifying the design of such a system in low-noise receivers.\r\n\r\n",
