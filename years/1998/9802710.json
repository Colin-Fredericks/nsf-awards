 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802710  Lander  This project involves a worldwide expansion to the tsunami  database and an extension of the catalog to the end of the  millennium, adding data from upcoming symposia and workshops and  checking local marigrams for magnitude 6 or greater earthquake  data for unreported minor tsunamis.  The manuscript will be put  online to allow for peer review and adaptation of currently  available digital technology applied to updating this catalog for  future tsunamis compilations.  This expanded database will be  available to the research and education communities on the World  Wide Web.  These innovations in catalog compilations should  increase the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the catalog.   Photographic data will also be included.  Extracts of events in  respective areas will be sent for review to International  Oceanographic Commission National Representatives.    A history of the occurrence and effects of previous tsunamis is  the essential starting point in devising an effective mitigation  plan and a component of many research efforts.  Tsunamis  histories, both regional and global, have been produced for this  purpose.  However, there is no annual summary or single place  where information on recent tsunamis can be found.  The final  report of this project will carry information on the availability  and effectiveness of warnings, the awareness of the population to  the possibility of a tsunami following a strong earthquake, and  the listing of each tsunami and a summary of effects at each  observed locality, as well as a geographical index so that  effects for a region can be quickly located.  ***",
