The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and  experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Jesus Pando to work with Dr. Alain Blanchard at  the University of Strasbourg, Observatoire Astronomique de  Strasbourg in France.  They will study the cosmological  structure formation using a wavelet transform technique.  Measuring these structures will help to determine the  initial seeds and exact mechanisms that led to large-scale  structure formation in the universe.  The primary focus will  be the study of correlations in the Cosmic Microwave  Background and in the absorption spectra.  They will analyze  both data sets to determine if there is Non-Gaussian  (abnormal) behavior in these distributions by using the  moment spectra and to determine if there is hierarchical  structure by using the scale-scale correlation functions.    Wavelet transformation as a tool is at the forefront of  modern scientific analytical methods.  It can be used not  just for cosmology studies, but also those of biological  systems, for pattern recognition in experimental particle  physics or for any problem where space-scale correlations  exist.  For Dr. Pando to be at Strasbourg is to place him in  the center of wavelet research.  ***",
