 "awd_abstract_narration": "9808763\r\nCupp-Vickery\r\n     Cytochrome P450 monoxygenases are a widely distributed class of b-type heme-\r\nproteins that catalyze mixed function oxidations of hydrocarbon substrates. In\r\nmammalian physiology, P450 monoxygenase systems participate in the metabolism of\r\nsteroid hormones, vitamin D, bile acids, and provide one of the primary means by which\r\nthe body rids itself of toxic substances.  The studies focus on two macrolide\t\r\nhydroxylases from Saccharopolyspora erythraea which are involved in erythromycin\r\nbiosynthesis: the C6-hydroxylase P450eryF and the C-12 hydroxylase P450eryK. The\r\nspecific aims of this project are to:\r\n\t1. Characterize and crystallize P450eryK for structure determination.\t\r\n\t2. Determine the structure of steroids complexed with cytochrome P450eryF.\r\n\t3. Determine the mechanism of flavonoid activation of P450s.\r\n\r\n    The long range goal of this work is to determine the active site three-dimensional structure and specific protein-substrate interactions which dictate substrate and hydroxylation specificity of cytochrome P450 enzymes. The crystal structure of P450eryK will contribute to the determination of the active-site three-dimensional structure and specific protein-substrate interactions which dictate substrate and hydroxylation specificity. In addition, the P450eryF/steroid structures will be the first P450/steroid structures and will identify the steroid-protein interactions which may be critical for binding and hydroxylation specificity. Furthermore, the determination of the P450eryF/flavonoid complexes will identify the flavonoid binding site and provide insights into the mechanism of flavonoid activation of P450 enzymes. The results from these studies should lead to a better general understanding of cytochrome P450 function and structure, and they should enable us to develop better models of the active sites of mammalian P450 enzymes and their complexes with steroids and modulators.\r\n",
