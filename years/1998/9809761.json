The Geology Explorer is a computer-based educational environment for teaching aspects of physical geology.  This takes the form of a synthetic, virtual space where students are given the means and the equipment to undertake geologic exploration.  This pedagogical approach gives students an authentic experience that includes elements of exploration of a spatially oriented virtual world, practical, field oriented, expedition planning and decision making, and scientific problem solving (i.e. a \"hands on\" approach to the scientific method).  The pedagogical goal of the Geology Explorer is to teach students a framework of basic principles and approaches that can be used to solve science-based problems while at the same time introducing students to the content of their discipline.  The Geology Explorer implements educational tools and methods that deliver the principles but also teaches important content material in a meaningful way.  By its nature, geology is a highly visual science.  The need is for implementation of a graphical environment for navigational ease, spatial authenticity, engaging students, and visualization of geologic objects, contexts, and processes.  A highly graphical and interactive Geology Explorer will be implemented in order to meet these objectives by supplying a graphical user interface layered on top of the existing networked multi-user database and messaging system.  The Java/MOO visual component of the Geology Explorer will accomplish this using client software written in Java that is a viewport into the server.  In it, objects are represented by graphical elements that can be manipulated in a way that makes sense to the domain.  Virtual environments, such as the Geology Explorer, enable students to undergo experiences that would otherwise be impossible or impractical: distant worlds, subatomic spaces, or dangerous places.  The potential impact of this virtual environment approach is that it will help solve many of the problems facing the modern university: distance learning will become a reality, learner diversity will be accommodated (both in terms of learning styles and life styles), and in many cases the curriculum will become more active, more role-based, more self-paced, and more \"learn by doing\" than \"learn by listening.\"\r\n",
