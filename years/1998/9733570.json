 "awd_abstract_narration": "Communication of cells with their environment is made possible through a process called signal transduction.  This mechanism is mediated largely by calcium channels which allow the passage of calcium ions to the inside.  Intracellular calcium elicits various responses such as muscle contraction or neurotransmitter release.  Calcium channels are formed by different subunits.  The central ideal of this project by Dr. Garcia-Martinez is to determine the role of the alpha-2-delta subunit in signal transduction in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and neurons.  This will be accomplished by measuring levels of the alpha-2-delta subunit during development and correlating these levels with changes in signal transduction.  A blend of powerful techniques, including electrical recording of calcium-channel activity and molecular analysis of the calcium-channel protein conformation, will be used.  Determining the function of the alpha-2-delta subunit in signal transduction is crucial for understanding cell physiology.  The education plan includes the creation of a new course on several topics in physiology and biophysics of ion channels.  The goals of the course include teaching students to think analytically and to stimulate their interest in research.  Another aspect of the education plan is to attract and retain students from traditionally under-represented ethnic groups.  With this project, the PI will continue to make significant contributions to research and education.",
