This  fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain  additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue innovative and imaginative research into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular, cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled genetic  mechanisms and consequences of mating system divergence in  the Mimulus guttatus species complex: a case study of  adaptive evolution. This project addresses fundamental  questions about the action and interaction of genes of major  effect in adaptive evolution. Introgression lines based on a  linkage map of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in  mating system divergence in Mimulus will be used to estimate  direct and epistatic effects on floral morphology, mating  behavior, and fitness. Measures of male fitness define the  genetic constraints on the selfer transmission advantage  assumed by most models of mating system evolution. The  research also evaluates the impact of the observed genetic  architecture on the speciation process by measuring  reproductive isolation between divergent taxa.",
