Such  crosslinks can occur spontaneously under mildly oxidative  physiological conditions.  Oxidative amino acid sidechain  crosslinks can serve useful purposes, to provide structural  stability to proteins (tyrosinase) or to provide novel built-  in redox cofactors at enzyme active sites (galactose  oxidase, glyoxal oxidase, and methylamine dehydrogenase).  Oxidative amino acid sidechain crosslinks are also an  undesired but inevitable consequence of oxidative  metabolism.  For example, ortho-tyrosine and dityrosine are  believed to be markers for oxidative stress and for aging  processes.  Irreversible oxidative crosslinking of amino  acid sidechains may be more widespread than currently  believed.  Such crosslinks could be easily overlooked using  existing methods to analyze for amino acid composition of  proteins.  This research will develop a novel, general and  highly sensitive method for fluorescence detection of  sidechain crosslinked amino acids in proteins utilizing  excimer formation by pyrene to make the sidechain  crosslinked amino acids \"light up\" and uniquely stand out  against a background of normal amino acids in fluorescent  HPLC analysis of complete protein digests.  Mass spec  troscopic analysis of isolated purified HPLC fractions will  identify the amino acid compositions and chemical structures  of crosslinks.    Combustion of food provides the energy necessary to support  life. Approximately 1-6% of the oxygen used to burn food is  not completely consumed but instead produces reactive oxygen  species (ROS).  ROS damage molecules, cells and organs in  the body.  This research project will develop a new method  to detect oxidative damage to proteins.  Proteins are major  building blocks of living things.  There are many possible  applications of the method both in fundamental biochemical  and applied biomedical research.",
