 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this Renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   is continuing support for Dr. Mark Distefano at the University of   Minnesota - Twin Cities.   The objectives of the work are to: 1) improve   the activities and enantioselectivities of transaminating catalysts based   on protein cavities of mutant FABPs (Fatty Acid Binding Proteins), 2)   assess the effects of cofactor structure, 3) expand the scope of reaction   types to include C-C bond formation, 4) develop methods to prepare and screen rapidly catalyst candidates, and 5) develop a phage display   system to select protein cavities that can bind pyridoxamine analogues   noncovalently.  Dr. Distefano is developing a series of novel semisynthetic enzyme-like   catalysts based on a class of proteins (FABPs) that contain a large   empty central cavity, which can be used to hold organic substrates while   they are operated on by cofactors that are chemically linked to the   protein.   The FABPs can be easily cloned and efficiently expressed,   allowing considerable variability in their size and composition.   Such   catalysts could be very useful in the preparation of a wide variety of   specialty chemicals.   Because they operate in water under mild   conditions and are prepared from biodegradable materials, they are also   environmentally attractive.",
