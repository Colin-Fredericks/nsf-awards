 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9800589  Sheble    This project proposes the use of adaptive agents to demonstrate the effective behavior of the electric markets presently being implemented around the world.  The market exchanges to be emulated include: United Kingdom Norway-Sweden (Denmark-Finland), New Zealand, Australia, and California.  The adaptive agents will use spot and bilateral markets to maximize profit subject to the operational constraints and the market rules.  The agents will use multiple markets for ancillary services when appropriate.  The agents will be bound to the contracts matched on the markets according to the penalty clauses envisioned for each market.  The artificial life paradigms of genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks will update the adaptive behavior of the agents during the bidding process for the spot market and for the openly negotiated bilateral market.  The cost of search for the bilateral market will be included as well as the cost of the spot market.  The resulting simulations should enable verifications of the price clearing capability of each market and the cost of price determination for each market. The impact of this research would be a comprehensive list of the benefits and the detriments of each market for comparison.  It should be expected that no one market would overshadow any other markets.  Thus, it should be demonstrable that other markets improving the efficiency of each market in turn could capture the benefits of some markets.  The overall impact on the educational process will be the training of several students in the combined art of economics and power engineering.  Such students are in short need at this time due to the changes in the regulatory environment around the world.  The impact on the undergraduate curriculum will be demonstrated by the need for economic understanding to maximize the benefit of the engineer on the company's bottom line profits.",
