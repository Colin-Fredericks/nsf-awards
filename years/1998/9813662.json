 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Sixth International Conference on Biophysics and  Synchrotron Radiation will be held at the Advanced Photon  Source, Argonne National Laboratory, from August 4-8, 1998.  The conference will feature invited talks, extensive poster  sessions, juried \"Hot Topics\" talks by students and  postdocs, informal \"Meet the Experts\" sessions, and a tour  of the APS. Scientific topics include macromolecular  crystallography, with a particular emphasis on the  applications of synchrotron-based crystallography to  problems in cell biology; X-ray scattering from non  crystalline systems such as solutions, fibers and membranes;  spectroscopies ranging from the hard X-ray to the UV and IR  regions of the spectrum; microscopies; medical imaging;  apparatus and experimental techniques; and the impact of  synchrotron radiation on biophysics (past, present and  future). These fields have been expanding very briskly, in  response both to earlier scientific successes and to the  availability of the new, thirdgeneration synchrotron sources  at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble,  France, the Advanced Photon Source itself, and the SPring 8  facility under construction in Japan. The expansion is also  fueled by strong industrial interest, principally from the  pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The conference  is likely to attract up to 650 participants, ranging from  beginning graduate students to Nobel Laureates.",
