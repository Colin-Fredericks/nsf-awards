 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Heinz D. Roth, of the Department of Chemistry at Rutgers, the   State University of New Jersey, carries out chemical and spectroscopic   studies of organic radical cations with the support of the Organic and   Macromolecular Chemistry Program.  Organic radical cations are generated   by photo-induced electron transfer and by chemical oxidation in a range   of media, including fluid solutions, frozen glasses, and solid supports   (zeolites).  Spectroscopic techniques, including optical spectroscopy,   electron paramagnetic resonance, and chemically induced dynamic nuclear   polarization, permit the study of the structures of these radical   cations.  Through a combination of experimental and theoretical   techniques, Professor Roth explores the regiochemistry of radical cation   reactions, focusing on ring strain, extent of conjugation, and steric   hindrance as determinants of regioselectivity.  Also explored are issues   relating to the reactions of triplet radical pairs, including biradical   formation, generation of biradicals or triplet states from `vertical`   radical cations, formation of perpendicular triplet states, and   generation of extended biradicals by coupling of triplet ion pairs.  Many chemical reactions proceed via a sequence of chemical steps, each   producing a reactive intermediate species which undergoes further   reaction, ultimately leading to the final reaction product.  The   intermediates in chemical reactions often display unusual chemical and   structural features, and often bear a positive charge (`cations`) or   negative charge or a lone electron (`radicals`).  With the support of the   Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Heinz D. Roth, of   the Department of Chemistry at Rutgers, the State University of New   Jersey, studies the formation, structure, and reactivity of reactive   intermediates containing both a positive charge and an unpaired electron.    Through the application of a variety of physical and chemical   techniques, complemented by calculational studies, Professor Roth   elucidates the chemical nature of these `radical cations,` contributing   to our fundamental knowledge of how chemical reactions occur.",
