 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonacs  9808788         Wasp nests in the genus Polistes are often initiated by  several cooperating females. Such nests grow to considerably  larger sizes than nests initiated by a single wasp. However,  most of the offspring are the progeny of one dominant female,  which leads to a question of why do the other females accept  their subordinate status rather than nest on their own. One  explanation is the theory of 'social contracts', where  dominants cede to subordinates a fraction of the reproduction  as incentive to stay and help. That is they allow the  subordinates to rear some of their own young. This fraction  can be either in sons or daughters, which makes the social  contract dependent also on the sex ratio produced by the  entire nest. However, sex ratios are potentially affected by  environment as well as social interactions taking place on  the nest. Experimental manipulation of wasp nests in the  field and genetic analysis of foundresses and offspring in  the laboratory will directly measure the lifetime  reproductive success of subordinate wasps and test several  theoretical models of sex allocation.       Wasps exhibit complicated social interactions and have  extensive parental care for their young not unlike birds and  mammals. Therefore the theoretical insights resulting from  this research are relevant for many social species.  Furthermore, the wasps' greater abundance and ease of  observation makes them an ideal model system for testing  general questions about social evolution and parental  behavior. A better understanding of the colony initiation  process will also have practical considerations in pest  control.",
