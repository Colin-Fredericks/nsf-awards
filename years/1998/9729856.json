Northeastern University    CISE Research Instrumentation : Development of a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Compilation Testbed    This research instrumentation grant enables the following projects: - Digital Signal Processing Applications in Telecommunications and Magnetic   Recording Systems, - Improved Program Layout for High Performance Signal Processors, and   - Dynamic Compilations for Networked Signal Processors.    Digital Signal Processors are commonly used to execute a range of performance-critical signal processing applications.  High-level language compilers have only recently been targeted for DSPs.  The optimization technology provided in these compilers lacks the level of sophistication commonly found in most microprocessor compilers, and has discouraged the use of high-level languages for performance-critical DSP applications.  As a result, assembly-language programming still dominates DSP development, and there can be very high costs associated with maintaining legacy assembly code.    New code generation technologies must be developed which capitalize both on the characteristics of signal processing algorithms and on the resources available in modern DSPs.  Compiler technologies that exploit the evolving architectural features present in state-of-the-art signal processors must also be used to develop highly performance-tuned signal processing applications.  The equipment requested by this grant will be used as a DSP testbed by the principal investigators to develop new signal processing and telecommunications applications, as well as to investigate new compilation techniques which address the issues of producing maintainable, high performance signal processing software.",
