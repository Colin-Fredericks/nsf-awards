 "awd_abstract_narration": "9713110  Gangadharan  The two previous research grants awarded by the National  Science Foundation led to: (i) understanding of the adhesion  characteristics of Enteropmorpha clathrata and their  consequent effects on the hydrodynamic drag of flat plates;  (ii) the design, construction and operation of a cost-  effective water tunnel at Harbor Branch Oceanographic  Institution, and (iii) experimental and theoretical  investigation of the flow characteristics (lift, drag and  pitching moment) over fouled and unfouled bydrofoils.  The  current research is an extension of some of this work with  the intention of first, continuing the investigation of the  adhesion of Enteropmorpha clathrata on hydrofoils,  subsequent impact on flow field cavitation, and hydrodynamic  response characteristics on hydrofoils and marine  propellers; secondly to develop a detailed theoretical model  of Enteromprpha clathrata fouling on hydrofoil surfaces,  perform extensive experimental testing on hydrofoils in the  water tunnel using the Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV)  system, develop a model from experimental results using  response surface methodology and correlate the results  obtained from theory and experiments and thirdly to  theoretically investigate the impact of fouling of the hull  on propeller vibrations and noise.    This 3-year research project will be separated into three  phases:  Phase I (Year 1): Involves the study of the flow  characteristics around the fouled hydrofoil surface using  the Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) available at the water  tunnel facility at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution.  Phase II (Year 2): Involves the investigation of the impact  of fouling on cavitation.  The hydrofoil model will be  treated as a single blade of a propeller and allowed to  cavitate with fouling.  The LDV system will be used to  characterize the flow patters at Harbor Branch Oceanographic  Institution.  Phase III (Year 3): Efforts will be primarily  concentrated in arriving at a relationship between  the  biological material properties and cavitation by inducing  biological growth or to remove/minimize the biological  growth on marine surfaces by inducing cavitation.  ***",
