Materials  of  this  class  are  among  the  most remarkable conducting materials ever discovered,  and  have many novel and potentially useful properties.  In  part  the work will build upon the recent demonstration by van der Zant  et  al at the Delft University of Technology, that thin films  of  CDW  conductors  can  be prepared, patterned  and  characterized,  which  indeed  demonstrate the novel and potentially  useful  CDW  phenomena. Collaboration with this group and the Buhrman group at  Cornell  will explore pulsed laser depostion of these  materials.  Methods  for  patterning and for attaching contacts to  indvidual  grains,  and for preparing heterostructures with other  materials  will  be  investigated. These films make possible a broad variety  of  experiments  to probe mesoscale aspects of CDW  physics,  and  several such experiments are planned. In addition, memory devices  based   on   metastable  CDW  states  will  be   fabricated   and  characterized. Mesoscopic structures will be used  to  study  CDW  phase slip and vortex dynamics. MOSFET-like heterostructures will  allow  modulation  of  the  CDW wavevector,  gap  and  collective  conductance. Such devices may be useful as detectors and  mixers.  CDW-superconductor  heterostructures  will  be  used  to  explore  proximity  effects due to the competing pairing  interactions  in  these  two ground states. Preliminary efforts to test predictions  for  the  properties  of mesoscale CDW-insulator-CDW  and  normal  metal-insulator-CDW  heterostructures will  also  be  undertaken.  This  research  project is interdisciplinary in nature  and  will  involve   graduate  and  undergraduate  students  who   will   be  excellently  trained  for  careers in  industry,  government  and  a cademia.    %%%    This  experimental  project is based  on  novel  and  potentially  useful   electronic  conducting  films  of  \"charge-density-wave\"  conductors.   In  these  materials,  which  are  typically   very  anisotropic,   often  needle-like  in  their  shape,   electrical  conduction  occurs in a completely different way than  in  common  metals  such  as  copper  and aluminum.  In  these  conductors  a  cooperative   motion   of  charge-carrying   \"domains\"   provides  conduction, with many novel and potentially useful properties. In  this  project,  thin  films  of  such  materials,  suitable   for  incorporation  into  electronic device  configurations,  such  as  \"mixers\"  of use in high frequency communication equipment,  will  be  fabricated  and studied. Heterojunctions of such  films  will  resemble in some cases the \"MOSFET\" structures well known in  the  silicon  device technology, and will be explored for their  novel  properties. This work will lead to a much better understanding of  the electrical behavior of interfaces between conventional metals  and  insulators and the novel charge-density-wave conductors, and  will  possibly  lead  to new applications  in  electronics.  This  research project is interdisciplinary in nature and will  involve  undergraduate  and  graduate students  who  will  be  excellently  trained for positions in industry, government and academia.  ***",
