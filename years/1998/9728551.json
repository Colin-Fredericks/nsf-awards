In vertebrates, lowered levels of  this   amine,   possibly   coupled   with   elevated   levels   of  norepinephrine, have been linked to a particular kind of impulsive  violence. While great interest is centered on this research, it is  difficult  in vertebrate systems, because of the large  number  of  neuronal elements involved, to link amines and aggression  at  the  level  of  single neurons and the precise changes taking place  in  the  nervous system accompanying violent behavior. In invertebrate  systems, with their limited numbers of large identifiable neurons,  the analysis of complex behavioral processes, like aggression, can  be  brought  to  the  level of the precise  cells  thought  to  be  essential for the behavior.        This  application continues our studies exploring  the  function  of  identified single nerve cells from the lobster central nervous  system  (cns)  that contain and utilize the amines  serotonin  and  octopamine  (the  invertebrate equivalent of  norepinephrine).  We  believe  that these two amines have opposing actions on  at  least  the  postural component important in agonistic (fighting) behavior  in lobsters. The serotonin cells that are the focus of our studies  are  neurosecretory cells. These cells release  serotonin  at  two  sites:  (i) within the central nervous system, where it influences  pathways  having to do with posture and escape; and (ii)  directly  into  the  haemolymph  (blood) of the  lobster,  where  the  amine  changes  the  ways that muscles and sensory neurons  function  for  prolonged  periods of time. Within the cns, much in the  same  way  that  dimmer  switches work on electrical circuits, the  serotonin  cells  function  as  \"gain-setters\" that make particular  pathways  function better or worse for lengthy periods of time. The  present  studies  will  continue our investig ations  of  these  interesting  neurons,  asking  how they are activated, and will  begin  studies  aimed  at  asking whether these serotonin-containing neurons  show  any  changes in functioning as a long-term consequence of  changes  in social status. With the octopamine neurosecretory cells we plan  studies aimed at defining their physiological roles, learning  how  they  are  activated, asking how and where they interact with  the  corresponding  sets  of serotonin-containing neurons,  and  asking  whether  a  subset of these cells that selectively  innervate  the  claws, serve any direct role in the switch to subordinate behavior  seen when animals lose one of their large claws.        The  emphasis  in all of our studies is on understanding,  at  a  neuronal  level,  the short-and long-term consequences  of  social  interactions  between animals. With its well studied biochemistry,  physiology,  anatomy  and  behavior,  the  lobster  model  we  are  examining, offers many advantages in addressing such issues.",
