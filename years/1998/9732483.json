 "awd_abstract_narration": "9732483  Ediger    Many important properties of synthetic polymers are controlled by  the local segmental dynamics of the polymers.  These include the  glass transition temperature(Tg), the temperature dependence of  viscous flow, the diffusion coefficients of small molecules, and  the rates of physical ageing.  Optical experiments and NMR  spectroscopy will be used to investigate the relationship between  local segmental dynamics and these important properties.  One  project will explore the molecular basis for physical ageing in  polystyrene and polycarbonate.  The goal is to understand why  different observables age differently and how ageing times below  Tg are related to equilibrium relaxation times above Tg.  The  prediction of long term properties of polymer glasses depends  upon the answers to these questions.  A second project explores  spatially heterogeneous dynamics in polymer melts and their  influence on the diffusion coefficients of low molecular weight  species.  It is important to understand why these heterogeneous  regions are more important in some melts than others so that  technologically important diffusion coefficients can be  accurately predicted.  The lifetimes of these regions will be  explored because this determines how larger length scale motions  will be influenced by these regions.  A third project uses  variable-field NMR spectroscopy to study polyethylene and atactic  polypropylene melts.  These two simple systems are ideal for  exploring the relationship between local dynamics and viscous  flow, and for understanding the polymer motions which are  responsible for the glass transition.  It is expected that these  results will contribute to an understanding of the industially  important flow properties of branched polyethylene.  A fourth  project uses molecular dynamics trajectories to test the  interpretation of 2D NMR and neutron spin echo experiments.  This  investigation may result in more reliable microscopic inferences  being drawn from these experimental ob servables.  %%%  The utility of polymers in our society is based upon the wide  range of properties which can be obtained by changing the  chemical identity of the repeat units, e.g., some structures  produce rubbery materials while others produce hard plastics.  This proposal investigates how some important properties are  controlled by chemical structure.  This fundamental understanding  will be applied to some problems of industrial interest in the  proposed work and will suggest strategies for solving a broader  range of practical problems.  ***",
