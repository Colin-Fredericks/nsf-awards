 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental problem facing most real-world decision-making groups is the uneven distribution of decision-relevant information among members. Due to differences in day-to-day experience, formal training, and work roles, some group members frequently encounter a certain amount of decision-relevant information that others in the group do not possess. This uniquely held knowledge is referred to as unshared information, and stands in contrast to shared information that many group members hold. Despite the potential value of this unshared information, past research has consistently shown that groups tend to make decisions that are more consistent with the implications of their shared rather than their unshared information. The purpose of the current research is to investigate the proposition that group members who possess more widely shared information actually have greater influence in decision making groups than do group members who possess less widely shared information. The research will provide new insight into the processes and problems associated with distributed information in decision-making groups. A better understanding of the problems faced by decision-making groups will facilitate the development of methods for overcoming those problems in the future. The research also contributes to the Knowledge Networking focus of NSF's Knowledge and Distributed Intelligence (KDI) initiative.",
