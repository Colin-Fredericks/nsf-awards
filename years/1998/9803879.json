 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803879  There is a substantial body of literature devoted to directed  testing methods, which manipulate the choice of test inputs so as  to increase the probability and/or rate of fault detection. These  include most well-known testing methods, including functional and  structural testing.  A recurring problem with these methods has  been determining when to stop testing.  In contrast, a variety of  reliability growth models provide quantified measures of test  effectiveness in terms that  are directly relevant to project management, but at the cost of  restricting testing to representative selection, in which test  data is chosen to reflect the operational distribution of the  program's inputs. This research seeks a common ground between the  areas of directed testing and reliability modeling, allowing  statistical management of software testing without severely  restricting the choice of test method.  It explores reliability  models that can be applied to non-representative test processes  and improved data collection processes for reliability modeling.  Specific avenues of investigation include: 1) an order statistic  model of reliability growth based upon fault failure rates, 2)  the potential for employing fault failure rate information with  existing reliability growth models, and 3) the relative efficacy  of different techniques for measuring fault failure rates.***",
