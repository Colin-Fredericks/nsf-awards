 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) operates the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).    NCAR, with UCAR's leadership, will contribute to strengthening the atmospheric sciences.  NCAR and UCAR will also continue to contribute strongly to the overarching goals in NSF's strategic plan.  NCAR's priorities over the next five years fall into six main areas: \r\n(1) Fundamental Research.  In keeping with the mission of NSF, the foundation of NCAR's program is fundamental research, particularly research of sufficient complexity to command the resources of a national center.  This program includes solar physics, fluid dynamics and turbulence, cloud and precipitation physics, atmospheric chemistry mesoscale meteorology, and climate.  \r\n(2) Understanding and Predicting the Earth System.  Building on the broad base of fundamental research, NCAR and its many university collaborators will carry out major crosscutting efforts toward understanding and predicting the earth system.  This includes research on prediction of weather on short temporal and small spatial scales, longer-term prediction of monthly and seasonal means, and studies of the influence of human, solar, and other forcing processes on weather and climate.\r\n(3) Advanced Scientific Facilities.  NCAR will continue to put a high priority on developing new and cutting-edge scientific facilities that can be efficiently and cost-effectively supplied by a national center.  This effort will include computing systems, instruments and observing systems, community models, datasets, advanced networking and communications tools, and provision of these facilities to the community.\r\n(4) Human Dimensions and Societal Impacts.  NCAR will place increasing emphasis on studying the impacts of climate and weather on society; on human influences on the climate system; on society's ability to cope with weather- and climate-related impacts; and on the use and value of meteorological, climate, and other atmospheric-related information in a variety of contexts.  \r\n(5) Education and Training.  NCAR will continue and strengthen its efforts in education.  The Advanced Study Program will support a strong postdoctoral fellowship program and graduate research assistantships to encourage the development of creativity, independence, and breadth in young scientists.  Other educational activities will increase diversity in the atmospheric sciences.  \r\n(6) Applications and Technology/Information Transfer.  NCAR will transfer information, technology, and research results to the public and private sectors and to university colleagues and constituents in three major ways.  Through direct transfer, public domain access to make information freely available to the broadest audience, and licensing. \r\n",
