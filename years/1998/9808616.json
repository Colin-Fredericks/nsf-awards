 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN98-08616  VILLALOBOS      Choline is an immediate precursor to acetylcholine, the  neurotransmitter for the central neuronal pathways involved in  sleep-wake cycling and learning or memorization.  The amount of  choline is rate-limiting in the synthesis of acetylcholine.  Therefore, maintaining appropriate levels of choline in the fluid  that bathes the neurons in the brain is critical to both their  individual and integrative function.  Most of this extracellular  fluid is produced by the choroid plexus, a very small non-neuronal  organ, weighing about 2 grams in the average adult human.  It is  located in the ventricles, or cavities, of the brain.  The choroid  plexus also plays an important role in regulating the levels of  choline, as well as other inorganic and organic ions, in the  extracellular fluid by transporting choline from the brain into  the blood.  More precisely, specialized cells of the choroid  plexus are responsible for the transport of choline out of brain;  however, the mechanism that mediates choline transport remains  poorly understood.  Dr. Villalobos will define the mechanism by  which choroid plexus transports choline and will investigate how  this mechanism might be modulated.  The movement of choline by  plexus can be most directly and effectively studied in tissues  that are isolated and allowed to grow and reform a single sheet of  interconnected cells.  Using choline labeled with radioactive  isotopes, Dr. Villalobos will determine how choline is transported  into and out of the choroid plexus under different conditions.  In  this manner, for example, the dependence of choline transport on  sodium and potassium can be determined.  In addition, a  specialized microscope will be used to visualize the internal  scaffolding, or cytoskeleton, of the cell and to study how  modulation of elements of the cytoskeleton may alter the ability  of choroid plexus to transport choline. With these methods the  effects of physical and chemical stress on choline transport will  a lso be investigated.  Determination of the cellular mechanism by  which choline is transported from the brain to the blood by  choroid plexus will provide the basic information necessary to  probe further both the regulation of this specific transport  process and the regulation of choline levels in the brain.",
