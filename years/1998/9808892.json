 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This award is for support of a collaborative research project between Dr. F. Bary Malik, Professor of Physics at Southern Illinois University and Dr. Arun Kumar Basak of the Physics Department at Rajshahi University in Rajshahi, Bangladesh.  The proposed work is for theoretical studies of alpha particle-nucleus interaction (for light target nuclei) in the low-to-medium energy regime.  The aim is to determine alpha-nuclus interaction for medium-light nuclei from the analyses of elastic, inelastic and particle transfer data and from an inverse scattering theory.  The large enhancement of cross sections at back angles in the noted reaction has, in many cases, remained unexplained.  The plan is: (1) to expand the functional form of interaction to include both monotonic and non-monotonic functions (or molecular potential) and emphasize surface absorption, (2) to incorporate channel coupling using both types of potential, (3) to allow for actual resonance terms in scattering amplitude, if necessary, and (4) to determine the potential from an inverse scattering theory, particularly if the phase shift analyses are available.   Scope: This project will support collaboration between two teams with complementary capabilities and institutional facilities.  The US P.I. is well-respected researcher with a long publication record.  The foreign collaborator has done significant work in the past.  The topic of this research is important, with potential for significant contributions to nuclear reaction theory and should help clear some longstanding issues.  The collaboration will have major impact on the ability of the Bangladeshi institute to do this important research and to have access to results from international research.  It will also help the US scientist accelerate his research work by having the excellent scientific talent available at the foreign institute.  The project fits within the objectives of the Division of International Programs.",
