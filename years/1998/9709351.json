 "awd_abstract_narration": "9709351  Ibers    This project aims at the synthesis, characterization, and study  of physical properties of solid-state metal  chalcogenides, which  are a class of materials that contain sulfur, selenium or  tellurium.  Among areas to be investigated are (a) ternary and  quaternary chalcogenides of the Group IV metals;  (b) quaternary  rare-earth chalcogenides;  (c) structural distortions exhibited  by these materials, and the corresponding band-structure  calculations;  (d) chalcogenides of rhenium.  Characterization of  the new materials will include structure determinations by single-  crystal X-ray methods and the measurement of transport  properties, especially electrical conductivity and magnetic  susceptibility.  %%%  Since it is felt that the chalcogenides may provide a rich source  of novel materials, it is important to expand the synthesis of  these compounds as a possible source of technologically relevant  new materials with predictable chemistry, structure and  property/structure relationships.  The ultimate goal is to  provide through the integration of research and education  students as future scientists and engineers able to provide novel  classes of solid-state materials that exhibit semiconductor,  insulator, or magnetic properties.  ***",
