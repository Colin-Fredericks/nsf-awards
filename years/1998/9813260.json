 "awd_abstract_narration": "9813260  Ro  This project is aimed to provide a general framework to  achieve robust control of class of systems that are  nonlinear and non-affine in the input.  Other additive  mechanical nonlinearities can also be included.  The  framework allows to cover a wide variety of computer  controlled mechanisms, including electromagnetically driven  systems, underwater ROV's (Remotely Operated Vehicles), and  automobile suspension control systems.  To achieve this  goal, the research will be divided into three separate  tasks,(i)formulating a modified sliding condition and an  equivalent control action for non-affine systems with smooth  and invertible input nonlinearities, (ii) evaluating the  proposed scheme using a specific example of magnetic servo  levitation, and (iii) extending the concept to non-affine  systems such as underwater vehicles and automobile  suspension systems.  The impact of the proposed work is  expected at two levels:  First, a vast number of mechanical  systems that involve (a) computer control of  electromechanical systems, and (b) nonlinear activation  forces that can be modelled by memoryless nonlinearities,  can benefit from this work. Second, the proposed framework  can open doors to the development of a more advanced sliding  mode control scheme for non-affine systems with nonlinear  actuator dynamics.  ***",
