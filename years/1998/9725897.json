 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725897  Rossman    This grant provides partial support of the costs of acquiring a  new Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer for structural  mineralogic and petrologic research at the California Institute  of Technology.  A state-of-the-art Nicolet FTIR spectrometer will  replace Caltech's current Nicolet 60SX FTIR spectrometer which  was purchased in 1984.  This new instrument will provide over an  order of magnitude greater sensitivity for analyses of volatile  components (primarily H2O and OH-) within minerals and glasses  relative to their current FTIR spectrometer.    Rossman's research focuses on the quantitative analysis of  hydrous components (H2O and OH-) in minerals and glasses and has  shown hydrogen to be one of the most pervasive elements in the  crust and upper mantle.  This research has had a major impact on  our understanding of the hydrogen budget of the Earth and has  profound implications for the rheology and electronic properties  of the crust and upper mantle.  This grant provides the latest  tool for continued research in mineral spectroscopy including  studies of the behavior of water and hydroxide through mineral  phase changes and studies of volatiles in inclusions, mantle  silicates, basaltic magmas, experimental high-pressure run  products and synthetic zeolites.  ***",
