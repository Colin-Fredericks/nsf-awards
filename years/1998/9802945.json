 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802945  Cooper       Cooper will be working in collaboration with Kerckhoff (Stanford)  and Hodgson (Melbourne) on a proof of the Orbifold Theorem of Thurston  as well as connections between combinatorial group theory and Kleinian  groups.  Long's projects include the continuation of joint work with  Cooper on results concerning incompressible immersed surfaces in  3-manifolds and on braid group actions on buildings.  In addition, he  plans to study the questions that arise from trying to understand  which number fields can be trace fields for finite volume manifolds.  Scharlemann's main interest now centers on the structure of Heegaard  splittings of 3-manifolds, particularly their characterization in the  presence of geometric or other large-scale structures, and with  problems of uniqueness and stabilization.       The orbifold theorem describes the ``shape'' of certain ``spaces.''  An analogy is the shape of crystals studied in chemistry.  Besides the  specific chemical properties, there are certain geometric properties  that control much of the crystal's properties.  The field of  crystallography uses the mathematical theory developed by Bieberbach  at the turn of this century that describes the possible shapes for  crystals.  The orbifold theorem describes what crystals are possible in  non-Euclidean geometry.  As a result of Einstein's theory of general  relativity, we know that our universe has a non-Euclidean geometry,  but at the comparatively small scale of human existence, this geometry  is very nearly Euclidean.  The orbifold theorem is therefore not of  interest to chemists, but it may one day perhaps help shed light on the  large-scale structure of our particular universe.  ***",
