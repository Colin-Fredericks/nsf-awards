 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9760840  Leaskey    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore self-lubricating ceramics.  Silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic composites, containing two different lubricating phases, will be evaluated for current as well as potential new applications.  An innovative processing technique will be examined for:  (1) low cost processing; (2) attaining high densities without pressure-assisted sintering; (3) near-net-shape fabrication of parts to accurate dimensions; and (4) flexibility to tailor composition to specific applications.  Two different SiC-based systems with potentially self-lubricating properties will be investigated.  Characterization of composites will include evaluation of microstructure and measurement of strength and tribological properties.  Friction and wear screening will be performed by a major equipment manufacturer.  Phase II would pursue comprehensive testing of prototype diesel engine components in a single cylinder research engine.    Potential applications include high-temperature wear parts, such as machine tool components, bearings, chemical processing equipment including mechanical seals, and valve guides and seats.  ***",
