 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870437  Lin  This project probes the effects of confined geometry on the  diffusion of an isolated colloidal sphere using optical tweezers  combined with digital video microscopy. The program is divided  into two distinct groups of experiments based on the nature of  the confined geometry. In the first group of experiments, the  diffusion of an isolated sphere near one planar wall or confined  between two parallel planar walls will be studied. Optical  tweezers will be used to manipulate the position and the  diffusion range of the sphere with respect to the walls. The main  issue in these experiments involves the effective wall drag force  on a neutral or charged sphere from a neutral or charged smooth  glass wall or from a \"structured wall\" such as a 2D colloidal  crystalline surface. In a second group of experiments, the  diffusion of a sphere trapped in a one-dimensional tunnel or  two-dimensional network of tunnels will be studied. The tunnels  or tunnel-network with a well-defined spatial structure will be  fabricated by microcontact printing. These experiments probe the  correlation of the diffusion of a sphere to the spatial structure  of the ambient patterned confined geometry. The issues being  addressed are of fundamental interest for understanding colloidal  hydrodynamics. The model systems noted above are limiting cases  representing problems associated with diffusion of macromolecules  either at interfaces or in random porous structures. Examples  include transport processes such as \"single file diffusion\" in  physical mixing processing, electrodiffusion of polyelectrolytes  in confined environments (electrophoresis in sequencing large DNA  molecues), microbubble diffusion at liquid/crystal interfaces of  a growing crystal front, fine particle migration and flow of  stable emulsion drops in porous media (relevant to oil recovery  processes).  %%%  This is a research enhancement grant made under the Professional  Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE)  program. T he research will contribute new materials science  knowledge at a fundamental level.",
