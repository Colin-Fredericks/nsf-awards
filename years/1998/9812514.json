The new   sensor will offer the capability to measure the full dissipation   spectrum directly via backscatter. It will also permit the analysis of   statistics of the dissipation variable. Initial development of the   single-axis laboratory prototype of this sensor was funded via an NSF   SBIR grant (95-60930), and follow-on funding for final development was   recommended by the Phase II SBIR technical panel (see reviews for   97-10425), but was not ultimately obtained.   This proposal is a collaborative proposal with Dr. John Trowbridge at   WHOI (98-12514). First, the PI proposes further development of the   instrument, which is necessary since a two axis system will be required   for a field instrument and the PI plans to incorporate a new fast   Doppler signal processor and data storage media. Secondly, the PI and   Dr. Trowbridge (WHOI) will conduct a bottom boundary layer   inter-comparison experiment on the south shore of Martha's Vineyard.   The object of this experiment is to examine dissipation as measured   directly by the laser sensor, and as deduced from turbulent spectra   using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter.",
