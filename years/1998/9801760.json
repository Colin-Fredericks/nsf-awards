Chang of the Department of Physics of  Purdue  University describes an experimental research program  in  two  fundamental  areas of the behavior of  contemporary  quantum  solids,  namely the behavior of chiral Luttinger liquids  at  the  edge  of  fractional  quantum Hall fluids,  and  the  interaction  effects in the quantum chaos phenomenon, as well as contributions  to the development of Coulomb Blockade Single Electron Transistor  (SET) technology.  This research utilizes advanced crystal growth  and   nanolithography  techniques.   Devices  fabricated  by  the  Cleaved-Edge-Overgrowth technique developed  by  the  PI  play  a  major role in this work.  GaAs/AlxGa(1-x)As crystals will be used  to investigate unusual non-Fermi liquid tunneling characteristics  of chiral Luttinger liquids.  Further, the effects of interaction  on  quantum chaos will be studied in versatile, nanoscale  multi-  gate   quantum   dots.    Lastly,  the   program   envisions   an  investigation of SET devices and logic circuitry lithographically  defined  on  the  conventional planar  as  well  as  cleaved-edge  geometries for functionality and optimization.  %%%  This proposal by Prof. A.M. Chang of the Department of Physics of  Purdue  University describes an experimental research program  in  two  fundamental  areas of the behavior of  contemporary  quantum  solids.   Special  crystal  growth techniques  developed  by  the  principal  investigator  will  be used  to  produce  the  crystal  materials  suitable  for this research.  This  will  be  done  in  collaboration   with   staff  scientists  at   the    AT&T/Lucent  laboratories.   The  synergism  between  academia  and   industry  expressed  by  this  collaboration is a major advantage  of  this  program.  The results of the research will serve to clarify  many  issues of the properties of contemporary quantum solids and  will  assist in the development of improved technological devices.  ***",
