 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to provide prospective elementary and middle school teachers the opportunity to develop and utilize their own imagery and spatial sense.   In particular, Towson University Mathematics Department is revising the way it teaches geometry to prospective elementary and middle school teachers by infusing computing technologies in their mathematics content courses. The objective of the project is to establish a computer classroom to be used in this innovative geometry course for prospective teachers.     Sixteen desktop computers with appropriate geometry software will be installed in a classroom. These computers will also be connected to the Internet so that the existing electronic materials may be fully utilized, including web-based materials we are developing. Additional laptop computers will allow instructor demonstration and students' sharing of their ideas in regular classrooms.     Data will be collected to identify how and how often computing technologies are utilized in the geometry course. Course activities generated by our instructors will be available to other instructors at Towson and other institutions.",
