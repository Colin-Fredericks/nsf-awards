 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804327  Kumar    The primary focus of this work is to establish the molecular  bases for the miscibility of model polymer blends in the bulk and  near surfaces.  These issues are interesting and relevant since  polymers used in practice are frequently blended to tune  properties and the phase state of the resulting mixture plays a  critical role in this context.  The consequences of phase  separation in a thin film on the nanostructure of flexible  confining boundaries, such as the air surface, will also be  studied in this work.  This is practically important since the  roughness of the air-polymer interface crucially affects the  gloss of a coating film.  The primary tools to be employed in  this work are relatively novel scattering probes  including small  angle neutron scattering applied to ultrathin films and wide  angle x-ray scattering  and computer simulations.  These methods,  in combination with standard statistical mechanics, will be used  to incisively establish the connection between the local  structure of the molecules, local packing  obtained from wide  angle scattering  and the macroscopic thermodynamics  small angle  scattering  for the bulk and the confined systems.  The approach  outlined above is in contrast to most past work, which have  treated the bulk and surface behavior as two separate problems.  Consequently, very little molecular based understanding of these  interrelated situations exists at this time.  It is this void  that the proposed work will fill.  %%%  The proposed work, which will utilize novel experimental and  theoretical tools in an integrated fashion, will aid in the  efficient design of polymeric materials with desired properties  for use in practical applications, ranging from the ubiquitous   e.g., packaging  to \"high-tech\"  e.g., lubricants for hard  discs, adhesives .  ***",
