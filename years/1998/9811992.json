 "awd_abstract_narration": "More and more human knowledge is being stored electronically, in the form of files, databases and Web pages. Unfortunately, most data stores are not designed for preserving information over very long periods of time, as technologies and organizations evolve. Furthermore, the information is often stored in an un-coordinated and un-integrated fashion. This can lead to the loss of important components of the intellectual record. The goal of this project is to design and implement a modern, scalable digital library repository (DLR). The DLR offers its clients a variety of services for managing intellectual property, for safeguarding information, for payment of royalties, for accounting, and for importing information from other sources. The DLR employs a scalable and distributed architecture (ranging from tens to thousands of gigabytes, and tens to hundreds of sites); allows autonomous organizations to collaborate in setting up a shared repository; and preserves documents for hundreds of years or more. Research topics currently addressed include the identification of digital objects in a distributed and changing environment; the replication of digital objects for archiving; the management of metadata; distributed indexing mechanisms; and robust and scalable awareness schemes. This research will yield insights into the options available for repositories, and their associated performance, cost, functionality, and usability. The results may impact the ways libraries and organizations store and organize digital information in the future, leading to repositories where information of different types is better structured, managed in accordance to intellectual property laws, and available for future generations. \r\nhttp://www-db.stanford.edu/archivalrep/\r\n",
