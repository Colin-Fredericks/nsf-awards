 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract     Sensory Drive in a Variable Signaling Environment: An  Investigation of Surfperch (Embiotocidae) Visual  Communication     Animals living in optically variable habitats encounter  unique visual challenges when using color to communicate.  Color patterns can change in appearance as the ambient light  varies in its spectral distribution.  The Californian  coastal marine environment exhibits a wide range of spectral  conditions depending on depth, water column productivity,  and kelp canopy cover.  Surfperch are a family of fish that  live along optically variable Californian coast and have  evolved diverse color patterns and distinct visual courtship  signals.  The specific goals of this research are to  determine whethersurfperch species selectively court under  specific spectral conditions, and whether female preference  for males is affected by changes in spectral conditions.  To  investigate the first question, measurements of the visual  pigments of the different fish species, the color patterns  of the fish, and the ambient light conditions during various  fish activities are collected with emphasis on comparing  light conditions between courtship verses non-courtship  activities.  The second question will be address with a tank  experiment that manipulates the light environment and  observes female response to male courtship under different  optical conditions.    The primary significance of this project is in gaining a  greater understanding of the evolution of signal diversity  across the animal kingdom.  However, the significance of  this study reaches beyond evolutionary biology and into the  fields of optical oceanography and visual science as it is  the first study to examine the spectral variation in the  shallow near-shore environment, and will provide a better  understanding of the selective forces on the visual system  by studying a visual properties of animals with particular  environmental constraints.",
