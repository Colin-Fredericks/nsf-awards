 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9710631/9711231    Prem Kumar/Martin Fejer    This proposal is to develop compact and reliable sources of highly-squeezed light using lithium niobate waveguides.  The proposed experiments rely on traveling-wave degenerate second-harmonic generation and optical pamaretric amplification exploiting the (2 nonlinearity of lithium niobate.  The group has done a theoretical work on this subject and predicting the squeezing of both the fundamental and the second harmonic fields even in the presence of phase mismatch.  The work in the present proposal is to build the waveguide devices and to verify the theoretical prediction.  An integrated device that can produce squeezed light to expedite the transfer of such research into devices for practical applications.  The development of such a source would remove an important barriers to the application of squeezed light.    The PI has submitted a revised work statement and the corresponding budget for one year.   The Program Directors have reviewed the work statement and the revised budget.    The proposal is also being submitted from Stanford University with an identical project description, but with budgetary details relevant to the work to be carried out a  Stanford.  The funds sought by the Stanford  proposal are included in the budget as a subaward.",
