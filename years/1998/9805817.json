The objective of the proposed research program is to bridge this gap in a principled yet practical manner.  The primary question to be studied is how and when a given complex manipulation task can be composed from simple provably correct control-level components in such a way as to guarantee correctness of task performance.  A related question is how large-scale motions can be divided up into smaller segments so that a homotopy method can be used to sequence these short visual servoing tasks.    Another objective of the proposed research is to develop methods for specifying hand-eye coordination tasks which are manipulator and environment invariant using object-attached coordinates. This approach to visual task specification is to be experimentally tested through implementation of a human-machine interface where the operator interactively specifies object-centered manipulation tasks.    The impact of this project is the realization of previous theoretical developments by the PI within the context of a large, complex hand-eye system.  These developments can in turn be expected to motivate additional theoretical and practical questions related to high-level specification of hand-eye coordination tasks.",
