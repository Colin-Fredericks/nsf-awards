 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Sergei Ostapenko and a graduate student from the University of   Southern Florida in a collaboration with J\u00bcrgen Werner of the Department of Physical   Electronics at the University of Stuttgart.  The collaboration brings together the   complementary capabilities of the German and U.S. groups to study the effects of   ultrasound treatment on hot-wire hydrogenated polysilicon thin films on glass and   polysilicon solar cells.  Defects in the polysilicon determine the electronic quality of the   material formed, and one way to improve the quality is to passivate the defects by   hydrogenation.  In addition to exploring the effects of ultrasound, the research will apply a   combination of traditional and novel characterization techniques to monitor those effects.    The research will use experimental facilities of both institutions, and the exchange of   personnel and graduate students will strongly benefit the transfer of advanced knowledge   and capabilities. The results of the research could have an impact on a new generation of   low-cost solar cells and high-performance thin-film transistors used for active-matrix   liquid-crystal-display technology.",
