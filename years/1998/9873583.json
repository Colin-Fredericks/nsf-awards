Spillane, Northwestern University\r\n\r\nThe Practice of School Leadership and the Improvement of\r\nMathematics and Science Instruction in Urban Elementary Schools\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing a theoretical model of distributed leadership; the project seeks to generate a comprehensive model of leadership practices in schools.  The research program seeks to identify and explore relations between leadership practice and teachers\u00c6 efforts to improve mathematics and science education.  The proposal states that leadership in an effective school can be from principals and other formally designated staff.  However, it is often the case the leader is a teacher or other staff person.  The study also seeks to understand how the leader and the followers affect each other in a dynamic process. The study also theorizes there may be differences in the relationship of leaders to the improvement of mathematics instruction as compared to science instruction. \r\n\r\nThe project will conduct a series of case studies of schools in the Chicago area that are considered effective.   The work will consist of intensive site visits, analysis of student achievement on a variety of measures, interviews with parents, teachers, school administrators and staff of the Chicago Urban Systemic Initiative.\r\n\r\nThe PI plans to disseminate findings of the study to the Chicago school system in meetings and to the school community through publications and presentations to appropriate professional organizations.\r\n\r\n",
