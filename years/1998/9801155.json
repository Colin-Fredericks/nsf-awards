The research will take advantage of program activities now underway among local governments in states that have mandated the preparation of local government comprehensive plans and among local governments that are participating  the Federal Emergency Management agency's Community Rating System (CRS) and have prepared flood plain management plans.  Data will be gathered from a sample of 100 local governments within Florida and Washington.  Case studies will also be conducted in three jurisdictions with exemplary citizen involvement efforts in order to see if statistical results can be replicated using qualitative methods, shed additional light on the processes through which citizen involvement is, or is not, translated into commitment by public officials to address hazards, and to reveal how various public involvement techniques affect these processes.  This research will have implications for various kinds of natural hazards.\r\n",
