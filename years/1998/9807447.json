 "awd_abstract_narration": "Linkage disequilibrium can be defined as the nonrandom association of alleles at two or more genetic loci.  Such an association is usually observed when the loci are located very near each other on the same chromosome, a condition known as linkage.  When genes are tightly linked, they are only rarely separated by recombination, that is the exchange of genetic material between chromosomes.  Because of the combined effect of mutation and recombination on shaping the pattern of genetic variation, linkage disequilibrium is a powerful tool to investigate recent evolutionary events such as those that are likely to have characterized the evolution of modern humans.  In particular, the study of variation at tightly linked loci in the major ethnic groups will be used to discriminate between different scenarios of demography and population structure.  This will be achieved by reconstructing haplotypes, the joint presence of alleles at closely linked loci, at anonymous genome regions in ethnically diverse human populations and by measuring pairwise linkage disequilibrium, as well as the extent of haplotype sharing, within and between the population samples.  These studies are likely to contribute to our understanding of human origins and the elucidation of the structure of human variation.  In addition, they will provide the necessary background information for studies aimed at detecting the signature of natural selection at the molecular level.",
