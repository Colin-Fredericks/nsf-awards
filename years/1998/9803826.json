 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803826  Schultens       This research project concerns the relation of Heegaard splittings  to manifold decompositions, a relation that has been studied in a particular  case under the guise of tunnel numbers of knots.  The tunnel number of a  knot has been shown to behave quite erratically under the operation of  connected sum of knots.  The project entails a more general investigation  into the role of incompressible surfaces as they relate to Heegaard  splittings.  In particular, it should provide information on (1) lower  bounds of the tunnel number of knots relative to their generalized prime  decompositions; (2) bounds on the degeneration of tunnel number under  connected sum of knots; (3) torus decompositions of manifolds; (4) the  Heegaard genus of Haken manifolds; and (5) stabilization problems.       The general philosophy of this project stems from a realization that  3-dimensional manifolds have been studied from several viewpoints.  Two of  these viewpoints involve cutting the 3-manifold along surfaces into basic  building blocks.  The idea of cutting along a surface to understand the  3-manifold in which the surface lies, is a natural extension of the idea  of cutting along circles to understand the surface in which the circles  lie.  In the case of surfaces, the analysis of the circles contained in  the surface suffices to characterize the surface.  A complete classification  has been obtained.  3-manifolds have proven to be far less tractable  objects.  In fact, extending the idea that has been so successful for the  analysis of surfaces has engendered two very different viewpoints in the  study of 3-manifolds.  The investigator endeavors to reconcile these two  viewpoints.  ***",
