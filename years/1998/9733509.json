 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Christofides - 9733509    The objective of this research is to develop a general and practical framework for the synthesis of nonlinear model-based feedback controllers for transport-reaction and particulate processes that achieve the desired stability and performance specifications in the presence of model uncertainty.  The motivation is provided by: a) the abundance of highly nonlinear transport-reaction (for example packed-bed reactors and chemical vapor deposition processes) and particulate (for example crystallizers and aerosol reactors) processes; b) the need for excellent control of these processes in order to minimize energy consumption and cost, achieve tighter performance specifications, and meet environmental and safety regulations; and c) the lack of practical nonlinear control methods for transport-reaction and particulate processes.  The specific research projects planned include: 1) control of diffusion-convection-reaction processes with time-dependent spatial domains, 2) control of transitional (not fully turbulent) fluid dynamic systems based on Navier-Stokes equations, and 3) model reduction and control of particulate processes based on population balance models.  The research will provide a fundamental understanding on the nature of the model reduction and control problems for transport-reaction and particulate processes.  It will also synthesize practically-implementable nonlinear feedback control algorithms that enforce the requested stability and performance specifications in the closed-loop system in the presence of model uncertainty.  The control algorithms will be applied to chemical vapor deposition processes, crystal growth processes, transitional channel and boundary layer flows, crystallizers and aerosol processes.  The development of a software package and the collaboration with companies (specifically, Trikon Technologies and Beta Squared) will be the means for transferring the results of the research to the industrial sector.    As part of this CAREER a ward, several educational activities are also planned, including: a) the integration of the model reduction and control methods into the undergraduate math and control courses, b) the development of an undergraduate process control lab, c) the development of a graduate level course on model reduction and control of nonlinear distributed parameter systems based on the results of the research, d) the design of open-ended projects for undergraduate students based on the research, e) the development of an industrial/graduate student internship program with companies in the microelectronics area, and f) the establishment of a unified control curriculum in the School of Engineering and Applied Science at UCLA.",
