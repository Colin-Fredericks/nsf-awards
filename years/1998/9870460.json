 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of two longitudinal studies to examine the extent to which working memory (WM) capacity is involved first in the production and maintenance of life event stress, and second in the effectiveness of an intervention that has been shown to reduce the negative consequences of such stress.  The first study tests the hypothesis that naturally occurring changes in life stress levels will predict subsequent inverse changes in WM capacity and that these variations in WM capacity will affect subsequent life stress levels.  Life stress will be measured with a self-report checklist.  Working memory span will be measured with an operation-word span task designed to measure the amount of activation available on a `moment-to-moment basis.`  The second study is designed to test the hypothesis that people who write briefly about a stressful life event will enjoy increases in WM capacity and that this increase will be greatest for people whose essays show increases in linguistic categories indicating cause and insight.  In previous research people who wrote brief essays about a stressful topic experienced improvements in long term health, behavior and affect compared to people who wrote about a trivial topic.  Recent reviews indicate that these benefits are linked to the development of a coherent narrative but it is not known how these linguistic changes affect health.  It is proposed that narrative coherence reflects the development of a mental model of the stressful event that consumes fewer WM resources than the original cognitive representation, making more WM resources available to anticipate and cope with aversive life events.  The scientific significance of the work is its potential to isolate working memory, a process critical to problem solving skills, as a factor in both the generation of stressful life events and the beneficial effects of expressive writing about stressful experiences.  There is evidence that people with high life event stress do have lower working memory (WM) capacity compared to people reporting fewer negative events, but it is not known whether WM deficits and associated impairments in problem solving contribute to life event stress nor whether WM is affected by writing about such experiences.  The present work presumes that cognitive representations of stressful life events are stored in large poorly organized networks that compete for WM resources, leaving highly stressed individuals with fewer resources for problem solving.  If writing about aversive life events produces improvements in WM capacity that subsequently affect problem solving ability, an important link between cognition and health will be established.  This project fits the POWRE criteria in that the application of cognitive models to the area of life stress is a new line of inquiry.  The investigator will gain new skills, particularly the application of structural equation modeling to longitudinal data and the utilization of the text analysis program that will benefit her research program and contribute directly to her career objectives.",
