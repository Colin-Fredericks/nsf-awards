 "awd_abstract_narration": "At the same time that theoretical work sought to understand the cause of counter cyclical job reallocation, new empirical work has shed doubt on the proposition that all job reallocation is counter cyclical. There is good evidence that job reallocation is procyclical in many non manufacturing industries. This new job creation and destruction evidence challenges all theories of counter cyclical job reallocation. This research addresses this challenge by applying the dynamic microeconomic theory of a competitive industry to study differences in cyclical dynamics between young and old plants and to study the industry dynamics of a single service industry, restaurants.  This study consists of two projects. The first analyzes observed life cycle differences in cyclical behavior between young and old plants. The hypothesis is that one difference between young and old plants, (their adjustment costs), is responsible for the many measured differences in their employment dynamics. Rather than assume that young plants have lower adjustment costs then old plants in an ad hoc fashion, such a difference are derived endogenously by giving managers a choice of organizational technology.   Because of their simplicity, competitive models of industry dynamics make stark predictions regarding the effects of demand shocks on prices and quantities. If entry can occur quickly and congestion does not affect costs, then demand shocks have no effect on prices or incumbent plants. In this case, the dynamics of individual producers and that of aggregate variables have no connection with one another. If entry takes time or if congestion increases costs, demand shocks affect both prices and incumbent plants. The second project will determine which competitive model best describes the restaurant industry; and it will provide a more detailed characterization of the response of net entry, average firm size, and other size distribution statistics to a demand shock than can be gained from theory alone. The approach is to identify local demand shocks with local military basing and defense contracts and estimate their impact on restaurant prices and quantities, revealing whether the short run supply curve is flat or increasing.",
