 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714198  Wen  This mid-career PI has been awarded a grant to continue his  work on various aspects of the problem of strongly  correlated electrons.  These problems are integral to our  understanding of the quantum Hall effect and the  properties  of high Tc superconductors.  This PI has been widely known  for his innovative approaches to problems, often bridging  two components of his broad background, particle theory and  condensed matter.  His specific projects include, (1)  underdoped high Tc superconductors, (2) random critical  points and transition between quantum Hall states and (3)  non-abelian fractional quantum Hall states and a theory of  topological orders.  %%%  This is a mid-career PI who is  well recognized for original  and innovative contributions to the physics of  electrons in  very high magnetic fields and high Tc superconductors.  In  this renewal grant, he is being supported to continue his  work in (1) the special magnetic properties of the  materials, at doping levels less than when they are  superconducting and  (2) some recent theoretical  developments in the properties of both the integer and  fractional quantum Hall effects.  ***",
