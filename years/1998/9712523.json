 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712523  Perpezko    Under most conditions, metal alloy solidification is  initiated by a heterogeneous nucleation event. While the  study of homogeneous nucleation requires a sample free from  all external nucleants, the study of heterogeneous  nucleation requires a sample which contains only well known  and characterized nucleants.  To circumvent difficulties  encountered in bulk systems, a droplet sample technique is  utilized to examine nucleation catalysts during  solidification.  In this approach a bulk liquid is dispersed  into many fine droplets to limit the influence of extraneous  nucleants.  By using droplet samples in peritectic or  eutectic alloys that exhibit a high undercooling before  nucleation and equilibrating the alloys in the liquid-plus-  solid two-phase field, the catalytic effects of the  different primary solids on subsequent nucleation in the  liquid are examined without the possible influence from a  foreign substrate.  A new approach with droplet samples  involving pure metals with incorporated stable solid  particles has been established which extends the scope of  nucleation catalysts that can examined.  With this approach,  reproducible experimental studies of heterogeneous  nucleation can be designed under well-defined conditions for  analysis of the nucleation kinetics.  The process is modeled  using the spherical cap model which has a number of  deficiencies that are addressed in order to develop real  understanding of catalysis reactions.  In past research  nucleation kinetics measurements during continuous cooling  in a well defined system have been conducted.  The results  indicate the importance of nucleation site dynamics, but  also point out limitations of  continuous cooling approach  to nucleation kinetics.  As the result, an alternate, more  effective approach based on isothermal holding treatments  has been developed and will be applied in this renewal  effort.  A suitable system based on Bi-Cd alloys, where  single nucleation kinetics has been isolate d, is examined  and selected sample modification to include alloying of both  the substrate or the nucleus is pursued to provide  quantitative evaluation of the effect of disregistry on  nucleation kinetics behavior.  %%%  Nucleation is an important aspect in metal alloy  solidification. This effort represents the most  comprehensive quantitative heterogeneous nucleation kinetics  evaluation during solidification that has been conducted to  date.  ***",
