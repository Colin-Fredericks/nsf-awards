This special satellite symposium will take  place at the 1998 meeting of the International Behavioral  Neuroscience Society. This unique society is comprised of  members from 29 different countries and meets on an annual  basis alternating between the USA and other countries.    The project will focus on the role of the hippocampus in  learning and memory. The speakers will focus on a variety of  approaches to this question ranging from an examination of  the role in specific forms of learning and memory such as  declarative memory, associative learning, and spatial memory  to theoretical explanations of the multiple contributions of  the hippocampus to learning and memory. The project will not  simply involve presentation of data from the laboratories of  the speakers, but in addition, will highlight important  theoretical contributions from the speakers and allow  integration across theoretical approaches to hippocampal  function. This mix of data and theory and the integration  across laboratories will present the current state of the  field to the international community of neuroscientists. The  neuroscientists who come to the IBNS meeting are from many  disciplines within neuroscience, including psychology,  pharmacology, molecular and cell biology, ethology, etc., yet  all of them have an interest in behavior. Presenting these  theories and findings to the IBNS membership will serve to  educate the membership about the most current issues and  theories in this field and encourage more research in the  area with an interdisciplinary emphasis and collaboration  across national boundaries.",
