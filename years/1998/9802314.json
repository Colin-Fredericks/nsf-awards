 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the exploding demand in Internet applications and  multimedia communications, image compression has become one  of the most important areas in signal processing and  communication. Well compressed images are close to the  original images, but take much less space to store or are  faster to transmit. Indeed, the network computing trend is  moving towards high quality images for Web surfing and real-  time video for video conferencing, and compression is  necessary for their real-time transmission and reasonably  small memory storage. Much engineering wisdom and heuristics  have accumulated on image compression in recent years, and  adaptivity (to the local characteristics of an image) is  found to be the key to efficient image compression. This  research follows an approach underlying many, if not all,  important developments in statistics. That is, it aims at  identifying problems from an applied field --(wavelet) image  compression, developing their solutions in a statistical  framework, and seeking answers and insights in this  framework relevant to the original image compression  problems. On one hand, this research uses and extends modern  statistical estimation theory; on the other hand, it  summarizes or formalizes engineering heuristics. Therefore  it builds a bridge between image compression and statistical  estimation literatures.  The investigators are studying adaptive thresholding methods  for wavelet image coding from the point of view of denoising  and compression. They are also studying estimation and  adaptive quantization methods based on quantized data for  general digital signal compression including wavelet-based  image compression. The statistical research establishes a  framework for adaptive wavelet thresholding for images, and  provides solutions to the general statistical problem of  estimation based on quantized data, which are available in  large quantities in the modern communications age. A level  of effort statement.  At the recommended level of support, the PI  will make every  attempt to meet the original scope and level of effort of  the project.",
