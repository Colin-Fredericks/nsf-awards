It integrates activities for creating  nanocrystalline quantum dots, surface derivatization, self-  assembly, and ultra-sensitive electronic measurements and  spectroscopy, to explore the chemistry and physics of single  and coupled nanocrystalline quantum dots. The investigators  will develop control of spatial positioning of  nanocrystallites on a nanometer scale. Proteins or  oligonucleotides which self-assemble will be used as  directing agents for the formation of nanostructures. Each  of these biomolecules can be engineered to bind to a  specific ligand on the surface of a nanocrystalline quantum  dot. The biological system then serves as a template for the  controlled positioning of quantum dots on a surface. Ultra-  sensitive charge sensing methods will be used to probe the  electronic structure of such quantum dots. These  measurements will address both the energetics and the extent  of delocalizaton of charges inside or localized on the  surface of the quantum dots. Additionally, it is planned to  spectroscopically characterize charged single quantum dots.  The spectroscopic properties of nanocrystalline dots are  expected to strongly depend on the number of charges present  in the dot, analogous to the filling of atomic orbitals;  this may lead  to control over the interaction of photons  with the nanostructures through adjustment of the charge  density on the dots. Such a capability opens the possibility  of using nanocrystalline quantum dots as building blocks for  microphotonic devices. The interdisciplinary collaboration  combining sensitive electronic measurements with the  chemical control of the dots, their environment, and their  spatial positioning may allow optimization of the chemistry  of the self-assembled nanostructures and the observation of  new physics of confine d electrons.  %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical  area of science and engineering having high technological  relevance. The research will contribute new knowledge at a  fundamental level to important aspects of  electronic/photonic devices. The basic knowledge and  understanding gained from the research is expected to  contribute to improving the performance of advanced devices  by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for  designing and producing improved materials, and materials  combinations.  An important feature of the program is the  integration of research and education through the training  of students in a fundamentally and technologically  significant area. Graduate students will be co-advised by  the four investigators across the disciplines of Chemistry,  Physics, Chemical Engineering, and Materials Science  integrating research and education from an interdisciplinary  perspective. This research grant is made under the  Nanotechnology Initiative (NSF 98-20), and is co-funded by  the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities(OMA), the  Division of Chemical and Transport Systems, and the Division  of Materials Research.    ***",
