 "awd_abstract_narration": "As increased knowledge has been obtained about dynamics interactions among physical systems that are associated with climate variability and climate change, increased attention has focused on the need to increase understanding about the consequences of change on people and ecosystems.  To enhance that process, the agencies participating in the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) have initiated a process that will result in a national assessment of the consequences of climate variability and change.  Seven workshops focusing on regional impacts were held earlier in 1997.  On November 12-14, 1997, a National Forum on the consequences of climate variability and change will be convened at the National Academy of Sciences.  This award provides support to the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council, which is helping to conduct the National Forum.  More than 600 individuals are expected to participate in the National Forum.  The funding for this award has been provided by the U.S. Department of Energy on behalf of all USGCRP agencies.  The National Forum is a critical step in the process of conducting a national assessment of the consequences of climate variability and change by the end of 1999.  The forum will continue a process that began with a series of regional workshops earlier in 1997, and it will accelerate the process of bringing scientists together with business leaders, government officials, and members of the general public, thereby enhancing the utility of scientific knowledge in service to society.",
