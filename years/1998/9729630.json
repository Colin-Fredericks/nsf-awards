 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729630  Lee  The overall objective of the US-PRC Protocol for Cooperative  Research in Earthquake Engineering is the continued  collaboration between the National Science foundation and  the People's Republic of China for the advancement of  earthquake engineering and consequently earthquake hazards  reduction.  The purpose of this request is to seek NSF  support to allow the National Center for Earthquake  Engineering Research (NCEER) to assist NSF in organizing its  annual protocol coordination meetings between US and Chinese  representatives.  NCEER proposes to provide administrative  and logistical support, and participant support, toward  coordination and implementation of three (3) US meetings,  and participant support for two (2) meetings in China under  this program.  These meetings will take place over a five  year period, beginning in the fall of 1997.    Through the implementation of this agreement, NCEER will act  as an agent for NSF, assuming responsibility for organizing  annual protocol coordination meetings between the US and the  People's Republic of China.  As such, NCEER proposes to  effectively coordinate all logistical details as required by  NSF for the organization and conduct of three US meetings  during years 1, 3, and 5 of this agreement.  In addition to  organizing the three US meetings, NCEER will coordinate US  and Chinese participation, accounting for participant  expenses for approximately six Chinese participants, with an  additional four US participants to be supported at the US  hosted meetings.    NCEER's technical focus and international reach has allowed  the Center to become recognizable worldwide, with  international cooperation becoming a more prominent  component of its research program with each additional year  of operation.  NCEER continues to strengthen its  international ties, and handles a myriad of details, in both  the technical and logistical sense, while hosting and  visiting its many international partners.  The current  administrative infra structure facilitates the execution of  the programs that are currently in place and embraces new  opportunities to expand on this strong capability and assist  NSF.  ***",
