 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is the continuation of an internationally  collaborative (U.S.-French-Australian) study of katabatic  winds along the coast of East Antarctica.  It is based on two  lines of automatic weather stations, one from Dumont  d'Urville, the French station, inland to Dome C at an  altitude of greater than 3200 meters, the other along the  coast.  The coastal array includes stations at Cape Denison  and Port Martin, which have recorded the highest average  surface wind speeds on the globe (a monthly average of 62  mph).  One additional automatic weather station will be  installed 15 km inland where model results predict even  higher average wind speeds.  These winds drive the sea ice  offshore, and are responsible for extremely high heat fluxes  from the ocean to the atmosphere.  Satellite-based active  microwave imagery (Synthetic Aperture Radar) will be combined  with the observed meteorological data to analyze the  formation persistence and size of offshore polynyas as a  function of wind speed.  The effort to produce a numerical  model of the regional atmospheric structure will continue,  with the incorporation of a more detailed terrain map, and a  new mesoscale model developed by the principal investigator's  French colleagues.  In conjunction with the Australian and  Japanese station networks to the west of this study area,  this work will allow an assessment of the influence of  cyclonic storm systems on the drainage flow along the  antarctic coast.  ***",
