The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Alexander Katz to work with Dr. Mir Wais  Hosseini at the Institute Le Bel, University Louis Pasteur  in Strasbourg, France.    This project involves the supramolecular synthesis of enzyme-  mimicking materials.  They will use metallorganic molecules  as building blocks for engineering catalytic sites. The PI  will incorporate catalytic molecules into a metal oxide  framework for rigidity and to protect the active site.  The  catalytic reactions can emulate the naturally occurring  catalytic reactions of enzymes and antibodies. This will  lead to the engineering and construction of more intricate  and complex catalytic sites.      Dr. Mir Wais Hosseini is internationally renowned for  developing self-assembling organic systems.  His lab is  known as a mecca for supramolecular chemistry.    ***",
