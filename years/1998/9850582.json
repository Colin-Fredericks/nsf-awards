 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science literacy is an increasingly important competency for the university non-science major. Rapid changes in medicine and biotechnology and their influence on society and industrial practices make it essential that students possess the ability to make informed decisions about science issues on a personal, community, and global level. This project is creating a course in which students develop an intrinsic, life-long interest in biology. Our objectives are 1) to increase student understanding of basic concepts in biology, and 2) to impart an appreciation for the nature of science and the scientific method. We are converting an existing audio-visual tutorial lab in Human Biology to a lab in which students access network-based, interactive multimedia that promotes active/collaborative learning of fundamental concepts. This course is offered as a series of modules that deliver concepts in the form of text, audio, animations, video clips, and other media. Included are activities that engage students in making observations, predicting and interpreting results, answering lower- and higher-order questions, reconstructing concepts, relating concepts to current research and events, and analyzing the process of learning itself. We are focusing on measuring knowledge, comprehension, and synthesis of key concepts in biology. We also are measuring student attitudes towards science before and after the course. This project is being developed in conjunction with the San Francisco Bay Area Collaborative for Excellence in Teaching Preparation (CETP) and San Jose State University's Science Education program. It will serve as a model for future science teachers in the San Francisco Bay Area, thereby promoting science literacy and life-long learning of science across generations.",
