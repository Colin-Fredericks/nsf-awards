This phylogeny will  establish the patterns of speciation and test hypotheses of  diversification by establishing the relative importance of different  arenas and speciation mechanisms. Cowries are an ideal group for testing  speciation processes in the Indo-West Pacific because 1.) they are  extremely diverse; there are 148 extant species of Indo-West Pacific  cowries that have been derived from 15 independent lineages, one of which  has given rise to 69 species since the Miocene, 2.) they have a good  fossil record, 3.) their geographic ranges are well-documented, 4.) many  sister species still retain non-overlapping distributions, 5.) geographic  variation is common within many species, and 6.) an initial phylogeny is  already in hand.  Cowries epitomize the large and rapid evolutionary  radiations that so characterize the Indo-West Pacific.  The proposed work  will be the first major molecular phylogenetic attempt to analyze patterns  of speciation in this most diverse marine region, and, as it is in a group  of organisms with great phylogeographic power, it promises to test  numerous hypotheses about Indo-West Pacific biogeography and  diversification.",
