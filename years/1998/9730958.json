 "awd_abstract_narration": "9730958  Diller  This grant provides travel support for US participants in an  international symposium on heat and mass transfer in  biological tissues.  This conference will provide a forum to  bring together scientists and engineers from around the  world involved in bioheat and mass transfer research, for an  in-depth discussion and exchange of the state-of-the-art of  related theory, experiments, and applications.  The topic of  heat and mass transport in biological systems is an area of  burgeoning interest from both the scientific and  applications perspectives.  Transport phenomena govern many  processes in both biotechnology and bioengineering.  The  program includes technical sessions in a broad array of  topics which includes: (1) heat and mass transport in tissue  engineering processes, (2) energy based surgical modalities  including; microwave, ultrasound, radio frequency, laser and  cryosurgery, (3) thermally coupled phenomena in living  systems including; laser tissue optics, hyperthermia cancer  therapy, burn injury processes, and tissue and organ  cryopreservation, (4) mass transport limited function in the  design and operation of artificial organs, (5) measurement  and modeling of the thermal influence of blood perfusion in  living tissues; thermal methods to measure blood perfusion,  (6) microscale and molecular heat and mass transport  phenomena in biological systems, (7) design for commercial  scale tissue processing protocols, and (8) temperature-  triggered drug delivery in living tissues.  Participation in  this conference will be international and will include  biomedical engineers, mechanical engineers, chemical  engineers, biochemical engineers, medical scientists,  biologists, chemists, and physicists.  ***",
