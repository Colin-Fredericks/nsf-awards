 "awd_abstract_narration": "Richard J. Saykally of the University of California in Berkeley is   supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in his   continuing studies of clusters using infrared spectroscopy.  The goal is   to determine structure, force fields and hydrogen bond network   rearrangements in water clusters (hexamer, octamer and larger) using far   infrared (FIR) laser vibration-rotation-tunneling (VRT) spectroscopy or   infrared-cavity ring down laser absorption spectroscopy (IR-CRLAS).  A   water-water pair potential will be derived from analysis of the dimer   spectra, and an effective potential for the larger clusters and liquid   water will be constructed.  Prof. Saykally will also investigate   intermolecular dynamics of nucleotide bases and their hydrated clusters.    To support these studies, a number of technological advances are planned   including extension of the CRLAS deeper into the mid-IR and development   of a new FIR laser with a ring cavity design.    Establishing a detailed and quantitative understanding of liquid water   continues to be a problem of major importance.  While the intriguing   properties of supercooled water and hydrophobic interactions occupy the   interest of many prominent chemists and physicists, the more mundane   problem of accurately describing the ordinary liquid over a wide range of   temperatures is of considerable practical importance.  This project will   enhance our understanding of the liquid and solid phases of water by   examining successively larger clusters one molecule at a time, and   studying these clusters in great detail with new laser technology and   state-of-the-art theoretical methods.  The resulting data will ultimately   provide a more detailed description of the important many body forces   operating in the liquid.  The newer effort involving studies of hydrogen   bonding of water with nucleotide bases is clearly of fundamental   significance in biology.",
