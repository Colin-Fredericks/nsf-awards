 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research planning activities will involve studies and  investigations of leukemia from a biomathematical viewpoint. The  project will focus on preliminary explorations of the following:  a) Construction of mathematical models that quantitatively and  qualitatively describe and characterize leukemia; b)  Contributions to the understanding of leukemia cell  kinetics; c) Construction of models that describe treatment  schemes and protocols for leukemia; d) Studies and comparison of  various treatment protocols through the use of mathematical  models; e) Treatment optimization models; f) Suggestion of ways  to improve the treatment of leukemia; g) Development of  analytical and numerical techniques that aid in the solution of  model equations that involve nonlinear ordinary and partial  differential equations; h) Interpretation of model results and  predictions within the context of the biomedical situation; i)  Studies of leukemia data as it pertains to insights and  predictions obtained from models; j) Development of collaborative  activities with physicians, biomedical researchers, and other  mathematicians and scientists interested in this endeavor; and k)  Extensions of the studies to include other cancers.    Specifics of the preliminary studies and investigations will  include biomathematical descriptions of leukemogenesis; studies  of models of normal and leukemic cells considered as interacting  cell populations; investigations of normal and leukemic cell  behavior in the bone marrow, blood, and the active and resting  phases of the cell cycle; studies of the inherent effects of time  lags in leukemic development; explorations of leukemia from  diffusion-oriented perspectives; considerations of bone marrow  transplantation models and chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic  treatment models for leukemia. Exploratory mathematical models  will be used to investigate treatment schemes and protocols.  Mathematical techniques for the development, analysis, and  solution of models will be explo red. Particular attention will be  paid to gathering of leukemia data from various sources and  statistical analysis of such data will be pursued. Numerical and  analytical techniques for solving large model systems of coupled  ordinary and partial differential equations,  differential-difference equations, and delay differential  equations will also be explored and studied.    It is envisioned that the research planning activities will lead  to a comprehensive biomathematical research project that will  advance knowledge in understanding cancer cell dynamics,  mathematically and biomedically, and will aid the biomedical  community in its search for better therapeutic strategies.",
