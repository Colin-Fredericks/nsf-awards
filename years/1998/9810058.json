 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810058  Barnett  This project seeks to use 1-3 kev He and Ar ion beams to monitor  and modify semiconductor surfaces using the specular scattered  beam intensity to quantitatively determine surface defect  densities, surface compositions, and to influence the orientation  of grains of polycrystalline thin films. Experiments to measure  alloy composition, segregation, interdiffusion, desorption, and  surfactant effects will be carried out. The combination of  ion-beam orientation with annealing will also be investigated as  a method for preparing highly-oriented semiconductor films.  Potential applications for decreasing electromigration by  eliminating high-angle grain boundaries in metal films will also  be explored.  %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  materials science having high technological relevance. The  research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a  fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic  devices.  Experimental tools such as those being investigated on  this project allow atomic level observation of basic surface  processes which when better understood provide the basis for  advances in both fundamental and technological arenas. The basic  knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected  to contribute to improving the performance and stability of  advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental  understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved  materials, and materials combinations.  An important feature of  the program is the integration of research and education through  the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically  significant area.  ***",
