 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rules governing the interactions among group members in current shared computing applications are implicitly defined by scattered code  fragments.  A better method from a software engineering viewpoint is to explicitly define the collaboration semantics and implement them as a detached module in the system.  We call this a first-class collaboration protocol.  The advantages of this approach include ease of reading and understanding the rules, formal notation for analysis of errors, ease  of developing collaborative systems with modular components, and dynamic  adaptation of rules as collaboration progresses.  Through this research we will investigate such modular collaboration protocols, building and evaluating several complex collaborative systems that use them:  a group Web browser (CobWeb) that allows many different protocols; multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs); and an implementation of a game called Nomic, in which the only possible move  (initially, at least) is to propose and vote on rule changes.  This  research will have increasing significance as collaborative applications become more common; its impact will be to allow construction of collaborative software systems that are more reliable (provably correct), cheaper to  build, and cheaper to maintain.  Our results could find application in  teleconferencing systems, Web browsers, workflow tools, graphical virtual  environments, and CMM-compliant software development environments. http://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/nsf/iis/css98/",
