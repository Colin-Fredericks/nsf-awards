 "awd_abstract_narration": "The foci of this research include five areas of silicon and related   organic chemistry.  First, new materials containing positive charge on   silicon, germanium, tin and phosphorus will be prepared.  Second, methods   will be employed to create a variety of stable carbocations, usually   stabilized by silicon, at room temperature. Third, dendritic polysilanes   will be prepared and tested for their conductive and nonlinear optical   properties, and in one case as a molecular wire.  Fourth, a new area of   sulfur chemistry will be developed in which sulfur substituents are   exploited to stabilize positive charge.  Fifth, the practical properties   of silicates will be used to synthesize a new class of materials that are   largely self assembling, have considerable stability, offer vacancies and   channels for inclusion of guests, and contain synthetically tunable   groups that can enhance these properties.   With this renewal award, the   Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research   of Dr. Joseph B. Lambert of the Department of Chemistry at Northwestern   University.  Professor Lambert will focus his work on incorporating   silicon into normal analogues of carbon compounds or into novel   structures to create molecules with potentially important properties.    The properties may be of theoretical interest or they may offer new   practical applications.  The scope of the project is increased by   including germanium, tin sulfur and phosphorus in the synthetic plan",
