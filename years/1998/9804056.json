 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804056\r\nLasiecka\r\n\r\nThe present proposal aims at investigating mathematical aspects, as well \r\nas control and optimization properties, of models of interactive systems, \r\nwhich are described by strongly coupled partial differential equations, and \r\nwhich are subject to boundary and point control action. These are both the \r\nmathematically most challenging and the physically most relevant cases. \r\nThe systems chosen are complex and realistic enough to serve as \r\nbenchmark problems for the technological applications described below. \r\nSpecific issues to be examined for the entire structure, and/or a component \r\nthereof, include: (1) well-posedness and regularity of solutions; (2) exact \r\ncontrollability in the oscillatory case for systems such as shells; (3) \r\nuniform stability of the structure solutions as well as, in the non-linear \r\ncase, a corresponding study of the asymptotic behavior; (4) optimal \r\ncontrol theory and min-max game theory with non-definite quadratic cost, \r\nas well as robust stabilization. While in recent years these problems have \r\nreached a considerable level of maturity for single classes of dynamics - \r\ndiffusive and oscillatory - their study to strongly coupled systems with \r\ncomponents of both diffusive and/or oscillatory type is just at its infancy.\r\n\r\nControl, optimization and stability problems for dynamical systems have \r\nlong played a well-recognized and critical role on a broad range of diverse \r\napplications. In recent years, the emerging technology of smart materials \r\nand structures has brought forth to the front of scientific investigation the \r\npressing need to control, optimize and stabilize \"interactive structures\", \r\nwhose components' dynamical behavior is governed by partial differential \r\nequations. Recent civilian and military research has convincingly \r\ndemonstrated smart materials/structures to be a laboratory reality. These \r\nnew structural concepts actively damp noise and vibration, suppress flutter \r\nat the trailing edges of airfoils, suppress the airborne or water borne \r\nacoustic signatures of ground vehicles, aircraft, and submarines, and \r\nreduce the stressful noise levels within them. A realistic problem of keen, \r\npresent interest to both the civilian and military industry is the problem of \r\nreducing, or eliminating, the unwanted noise field in a three dimensional \r\ncabin with curved walls, modeled by shells, by means of smart materials \r\nsuch as piezo-electric patches or memory alloys bonded to, or embedded \r\nin, an elastic wall. When wired with an appropriate voltage (control), the \r\nresulting bending moment generated by the elastic wall is expected to \r\nproduce acoustic waves that counter the unwanted noise, thus leading to \r\ntheir elimination.\r\n",
