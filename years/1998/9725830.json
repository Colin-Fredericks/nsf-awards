For protection, these single-celled organisms  encase themselves in architecturally-elegant shells that  they construct by collecting, sorting, and cementing  together sediment grains. The unique occurrence of these  giant cells (greater than one millimeter in size) in the  shallow waters of McMurdo Sound, Antarctica allows for the  study of the cellular and molecular aspects of shell  constructions. This project will use novel light microscopic  methods to examine how agglutinated forams secrete and  sculpt the adhesive matrix that binds sediment particular in  their shells. Comparative time-lapse photography of  different foram species constructing shells will identify  key steps in the processes that lead to the various shell  morphologies. Peptide sequence analyses of the elastic  proteins of the shells will provide valuable insight into  the chemical nature of foram bioadhesives. From a practical  standpoint, these cements have important biotechnological  and medical applications. This project will also continue a  study of the effects of collection activities, as well as  natural physical disturbances, in this unique environment.  This interdisciplinary project has implications in a number  of fields, including cellular development, evolution,  paleontology, marine products chemistry, and ecosystem  management.",
