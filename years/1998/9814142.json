The overall objective of the  meeting is to provide an opportunity for investigators  involved in the development and applications of magnetic  microcarriers to discuss the current and future directions  of the field.  The conference is the second of what is  expected to be a series of meetings that were initiated in  Rostock, Germany in 1995.  The National Science Foundation  is providing funding for partial support of conference  expenses for 15 U.S. academic researchers.    Magnetic microcarriers are finding important applications in  medicine such as nanoparticle contrast agents in diagnostic  MRI procedures, drug delivery, automation of clinical  chemistry, blood flow visualization, and magnetic fluid  hyperthermia.  Ways are being investigated to introduce such  materials into viruses that seek out particular types of  cells, with the potential these could be used as probes in  non-invasive diagnostic techniques, particularly magnetic  resonance imaging.  Such microcarriers represent important  developments in nanotechnology, which is an area of research  with special interest to the Foundation.    The meeting addresses an important and emerging field of  research and application, is well organized, and contributes  to research program planning as well as the assessment of  new technologies.  ***",
