 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803445  Bonahon          The leading theme of this project is the study of rigidity problems  for hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds.  In particular, it aims at proving  that the geometry of a 3-dimensional hyperbolic convex hull is completely  determined by partial data on the geometry of its boundary.  The project  also involves several connected problems on hyperbolic and euclidean cone  manifolds, and on a generalization of curves on a surface called geodesic  laminations.  These problems are of interest by themselves, but they are also  a laboratory for developing and testing new technical tools for application  to a wider range of problems in low-dimensional geometry.  It is anticipated  that a solution to these problems will deepen our understanding of  hyperbolic geometry in low dimensions and have applications to other  branches of mathematics as well.          The project will study several geometric problems on  3-manifolds, namely on spaces of dimension 3.  Twenty years ago,  revolutionary developments in the field of low-dimensional topology showed  that hyperbolic (non-euclidean) geometry was a very powerful tool to  analyze the topology of 3-manifolds.  This breakthrough also led to the  establishment of unexpected connections between low-dimensional topology  and other branches of mathematics, such as differential geometry, complex  analysis and dynamical systems.  ***",
