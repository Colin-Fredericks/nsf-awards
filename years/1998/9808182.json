 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF) Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   enable the Department of Chemistry at The University of Washington to   acquire a DEC workstation cluster.  This upgrade will increase   computational speed by more than a factor of five and also allow large   core jobs access to a core memory capacity enhanced by a factor of eight.    These enhancements will meet the computational needs of chemists working   in a variety of research areas including (i) surface and materials   chemistry; (ii) theoretical organic chemistry; and (iii) free energies of   complex systems and Bose condensation.    A workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way   to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a `computer   network` also serves as a development environment for new theoretical   codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization   facilities, and supports research in state-of-the-art applications of   parallel processing.",
