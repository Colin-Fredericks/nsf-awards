 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to provide tools for Bayesian inference that will be used by social scientists and their students - not just specialists in statistics or methodology, but anyone who does quantitative work with data, including undergraduates.  This is an extension of a previous project that developed tools for Bayesian communication.  These tools allow the user to approximate posterior moments, modify prior distributions, combine models, and approximate posterior density functions, given the output of a posterior simulator, which can be made available by the investigator at an ftp or web site.  The proposed project extends this work by placing posterior simulators themselves at the disposal of social scientists, in an environment that meets current standards for user orientation.  Ongoing research will support the following steps to meet this objective:  1) Develop redundant algorithms for the models that form the analytic core of empirical work in the social sciences.  In large part, a generic Hastings-Metropolis algorithm will provide this redundancy.  2) Provide windowing interfaces for all procedures including posterior simulators, the Bayesian communication tools developed in the previous project, and new procedures to be developed in this project.  Make these interfaces available for all common operating systems, using the scripting language and windowing toolkit Tcl/Tk.  3) Facilitate incorporation of new models and methods in the software.  The proposed system is designed to incorporate simulators developed by third parties, with no modification of their code.  All the software developed in this project will be freely available and fully documented for anyone with an internet connection.",
