 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   program provides continued support for studies on the energetics and   mechanisms of organometallic reactions relevant to the functionalization   of alkanes by Dr. Karen I. Goldberg, Department of Chemistry, University   of Washington.  This project involves studies on the Pt(II)/Pt(IV) couple   as a general model for d8 square planar and d6 octahedral compounds as   well as for the catalytic potential of this couple for alkane   functionalization.   Mechanistic and kinetic investigations of oxidative   addition of C-H and C-C bonds to Pt(II) and reductive elimination of C-X   (X = heteroatom, H, or C) bonds from Pt(IV) will be carried out.    Mechanistic studies will also be performed to determine the ideal   ligand/metal environment required to promote the oxidation of Pt(II)   alkyls by water or alcohols to form Pt(IV) alkyl hydroxides or alkoxides   and hydrogen.  The reactivity of Pt(IV) alkoxides will also be explored   as representative of high valent late transition metal alkoxides.  The   reactivity of an open coordination site on Pt(IV) will be examined.  Such   a site is necessary for reductive elimination reactions and may also be   useful for functionalization.  Possible coordination and insertion of   small organic molecules and C-H activation by the open site will be   explored.    This project will give fundamental information on the activation and   functionalization of alkanes and provide possible new transition metal   catalysts for this important reaction.  Alkanes represent a considerable   portion of our natural gas and petroleum resources. The potential of   these enormous reserves for use in large scale chemical syntheses is   limited by the very unreactive nature of the alkane C-H and C-C bonds.    Transition metals have been shown to be capable of activating the C-H   bonds in alkanes and homogeneous transition metal catalysis is viewed as   a promising solution to the conversion of alkanes selectivity into more   usable organic products, such as the conversion of methane into methanol.",
