Craig Sargent      Non-Technical Summary        Animals acquire resources throughout their lives, which they  ultimately invest in fitness:  i.e. survival and  reproduction.  The study species for this research, the  fathead minnow, is a fish in which males perform all  parental care.  Past work with this species has shown that  males with higher energy reserves are more likely to win  contests for nest sites with other males, are more likely to  be chosen as mates by females, and are more likely to sire a  lot of offspring over an entire breeding season.  This  research will specifically investigate now males allocate  resources to their breeding coloration.  It will also study  how this coloration may function as a signal to attract  females, as a signal of dominance to rival males, or both.  Manipulation of male energy reserves, through manipulation  of diet, will be used to determine how energy reserves may  influence male breeding coloration and fitness.  The results  of this research will provide insights into how energy  reserves (and overall health) affect animal signals,  communication, reproductive success, and fitness.",
