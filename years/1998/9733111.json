The number density, luminosity function, richness distribution, and structural properties of clusters are excellent discriminators among cosmological models, particularly so at high redshifts where many of the standard models predict rapid evolution of galaxy clusters.  The sample of hundreds of clusters that will be compiled will also provide the best available measure of the high-redshift cluster correlation function and possibly outline distant analogs of the local \"Great Wall\" of galaxies.   The information gained from analyzing the magnitudes and colors of thousands, and spectra of hundreds, of distant cluster galaxies will constrain models of galaxy evolution at a redshift where there are currently very few constraints.  The information will also help to  place limits on the formation epoch of cluster galaxies.  The identification of a large sample of high-z brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), and the data from observations of these clusters, will allow us to study BCG evolution and the connection between BCGs and the cluster environment.  A novel search technique for high-z clusters will enable the compilation of data from a unique sample of hundreds of clusters and use the results of the analysis of the data to address these issues.   Recent results from spectroscopic and photometric observations have demonstrated the success of the technique.     The educational efforts are divided into four areas: (1) enhancing the education of undergraduates through course development that utilizes current technology and research-grade data, (2) establishing a central clearinghouse for web-related instructional materials that publicizes the efforts of those who are attempting to develop the Internet into an effective teaching tool for astronomy, (3) gradua te student mentoring, and (4) public outreach.   The public outreach will be both to adults through public lectures and to elementary school children through the continuation of a two-year partnership with a local teacher through Project ASTRO.  The first project will be the creation and implementation of Internet-based laboratory projects that allow undergraduate students to directly manipulate research-quality data drawn from many sources, including the survey of clusters of galaxies.  There are several laboratory projects already written and available on the Web and which have been used in courses.  The second project is to establish and maintain a central location on the Internet where instructors can share material they develop.   There will be an informal discussion group organized for mentoring of graduate students.  There will also be involvement in the summer public visitor lectures at Lick Observatory and in the Astronomical Society of the Pacific's Project ASTRO for grades 4-9.    ***",
