 "awd_abstract_narration": "9813080  Devasia  This research project addresses the vibrational problem that  limits the band-width of piezo-based ultra-high resolution  positioning stages like Inchworms and Flexural-frames - the  problem of transient errors which are caused by induced  structural-vibrations during high-speed positioning  maneuvers.  The goal is to improve speed and thereby to  increase throughput by developing the theoretical and  experimental expertise needed for high-speed positioning  stages.  The proposed paradigm uses nonlinear-inversion of  piezo-positioning-stage dynamics for finding inputs that  compensate for structural vibrations.  This approach will  lead to precision tracking of the desired maneuvers.  The  key techniques to be used include: (i) modeling of the  nonlinear dynamics of the piezo-based positioning-stages via  the Finite Element Methods; Balanced-Realization-based model  order reduction; incorporating nonlinear hysteresis effects;  and online parameter estimation; (ii) development of  nonlinear inverse of the piezo-dynamics; and (iii) an  experimental evaluation using an Inchworm piezo-stage and a  Flexural piezo-stage.  Piezo-based high-resolution  positioners are key enabling tools with applications in  advanced-technology areas like opto-electronics,  semiconductors, and smart-structures.  By achieving high  speeds in piezo-based positioning-systems, the research aims  to increase throughputs of systems which employ these  positioners.  This work also impacts other high-tech  industries from transportation to medical technology by  making rapid progress based on the ever-increasing cost  effectiveness of micro-electronics technologies.  ***",
