 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catonsville Community College, a local leader in post-secondary education as well as career preparation, has recently learned from our professional scientific advisory boards that a number of skill deficiencies are becoming increasingly problematic for students entering the workplace. These deficiencies include: (1) lack or familiarity with current technology and instrumentation appropriate to the worksite; (2) lack of ability to apply concepts learned in one situation to solve problems in others; (3) lack of confidence in handling, evaluating, manipulating, and reporting large pools of data, (4) lack of confidence and skill in troubleshooting and problem solving (5) lack of creativity; and (6) lack of ability to communicate with others, especially with individuals from related but different work areas. An Interdisciplinary Review Committee consisting of faculty from various science and mathematics disciplines determined that significant reform in introductory majors and non-majors laboratory courses in Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science and Mathematics would have significant and positive impact on student readiness for transition to work or advanced post-secondary education. This project will establish a model for integrated, multi-disciplinary science education built upon a firm foundation in mathematic competency and the use of technologically-appropriate instrumentation. Our objectives are to develop and implement two expanded multi-disciplinary laboratory exercises for each of two introductory courses in Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science and Mathematics which are student-driven and inquiry-based; equip four portable laboratories each with five Lab Works II Computer Interfaces, lap-top computers, sensors, and graphing calculators for use in laboratory exercises; and build pertinent mathematical computations and applications into all laboratory activities.",
