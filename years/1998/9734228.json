Abstract        The proposed research is related to the used of scanning probe microscopy to characterize, understand, and help improve materials issues in optelectronic devices.  Properties such as dopant distribution and the electronic and optical properties on a nanometer scale will be measured and characterized using in situ Scanning Probe Microscopy techniques. The measurement techniques and tools developed in this work will have significant impact in the area of materials characterization on a nanometer scale, and it may leads to the understanding of new phenomina and the development of novel devices. The PIs connection with outside groups who will provide him with materials was noted.  The educational component of the proposed work including the development of Junior/Senior Lab courses, and the supervision of undergraduate students projects is also considered adequate.  In general, it is felt  that  the PI is highly qualified to successfully perform the proposed work. It is because of the expected high impact of the proposed research and educational activities that this proposal was highly recommended by the panel.    Based on the panel discussion and the potential merit, this proposal is recommended for the CAREER award at $200,000 over 48 months.              February 20, 1998",
