 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made under the high performance connections portion  of NCRI's \"Connections to the Internet\" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial support for a connection to enhance and  accommodate the research needs for the University of  Missouri-Columbia (MU) by establishing a connection to the Very High  Performance Backbone Network Service (vBNS) via the MCI POP in  Downers Grove, IL.  Projects in this proposal include:  Missouri  Intelligent Networked Information System (MINIS), MU/NASA Regional  Applications Center (MURAC), The Classroom of the 21st Century (Class21),  Collaborative Information Spreadsheet of Geospatial Information (CISS),  Interactive Shared Journal System (ISJS), Distributed Genome Database  Browsing and Analysis Facility (DGDB), and Intelligent Multiagent Systems  for Networked Scientific Computing (IMSN). MINIS explores the integration  of computational intelligence methodologies and networked information.  MURAC involves the realtime collection and processing of GEOS-8/9 remote  sensing satellite hyper-image data data for distributed access by  researchers in weather, environmental and agribusiness joint projects.  Class21 involves the construction of a learning environment to permit  project oriented collaboration by students in a shared information space.  CISS involves the access and manipulation of geospatial information in a  collaborative environment by widely dispersed researchers. ISJS involves  the development of software to support new forms of teaching and learning.  DGDB provides a seamless integration of genome databases to facilitate  access and analysis by biomedical researchers. IMSN involves the creation  of a problem solving environment for scientific computing applications.  With this high performance network capability, MU will expand current  research and collaboration with both academic institutions and federal  laboratories. Collaborating institutions for this project include:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, NCSA, NAS A Goddard, NASA Ames,  JPL, Washington University-St. Louis, Monsanto Corporation, Ohio State  University, Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center, San Diego Supercomputer  Center, National Institutes of Health, and Purdue University.",
