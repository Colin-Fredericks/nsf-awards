 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lay Abstract  Lehman, Michael         A major challenge of biology is to understand how the  brain controls the secretion of hormones that regulate  fertility.  One such essential hormone is gonadotropin-  releasing hormone (GnRH).   GnRH is the master hormone  controlling reproduction in animals and man.  It is made by  brain cells, and carried by specialized blood vessels from  the brain to the pituitary gland, where it controls the  secretion of other hormones. The PI's long-term goal is to  understand the signals and neurochemicals in the brain that  regulate the activity of GnRH cells.  The model animal used  to study GnRH cells is the sheep.  Like most other mammals,  sheep are seasonal breeders, their reproductive activity  being restricted to a single breeding season during year.  Seasonal breeding is sometimes called \"nature's  contraceptive\" because it represents a natural form of  fertility control.  Yearly cycles of breeding in sheep and  other animals are primarily due to changes in the activity  of GnRH cells. During the breeding season in sheep there is  a dramatic increase in the number of inputs (or \"synapses\")  that GnRH cells receive from other brain cells. One exciting  possibility is that this change in the number of synapses is  responsible for the start of the breeding season, but more  work is needed to confirm this.  In any case, this seasonal  change is a striking example of how the brain, even in adult  life, is not completely \"hard-wired\" and is capable of  significant structural reorganization.  The work proposed  here will explore the role that thyroid hormones play in  these seasonal changes in brain structure.  Recent work has  shown that thyroid hormones are required for seasonal  breeding, act in the brain to promote this seasonality, and  play a critical role in influencing the structure of the  developing and adult brain. Furthermore, GnRH cells contain  appropriate receptors to allow them to respond to  circulating thyroid hormones.  To test the role of thyro id  hormones, we will analyze and compare the inputs of GnRH  cells between the brains of thyroidectomized and thyroid-  intact ewes using the electron microscope.  This study is a  first step toward understanding the signals that regulate  seasonal changes in GnRH cells, and will help reveal  fundamental mechanisms responsible for seasonal biology in  animals.  As an example of \"brain remodeling\", this  knowledge will also provide clues as to the factors that  promote and regulate connections between nerve cells in the  adult brain.",
