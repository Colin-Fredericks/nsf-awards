 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726713  Sandorfi    This award supports the participation of American scientists  in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Probing Hadron Structure with  Polarized Photons, to be held in Hawaii, from  February 22-25, l999.  The co-organizers are Dr. Andrew  Sandorfi of Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New  York and Professor Takashi Nakano of Osaka University in  Japan.  The seminar will focus on a study of nonperturbative  QCD dynamics of hadron structure and how these can be  effectively proved with spin observables at polarized photon  facilities in the U.S. and Japan.  The objective is to focus  on the development of collaborations between U.S. and  Japanese physicists in order to optimize the capabilities of  new facilities in the two countries, both for performing  future experiments as well as theoretical investigations.    The session will focus on four theme topics:  (l) identify  the most important problems in baryon structure that can be  addressed with Y ray beams;  (2) identify the facilities in  the U.S. and Japan whose capabilities are best matched to  the problems;  (3) identify the key theoretical areas  requiring work in order to interpret data from new  experiments; and (4) form collaborative teams to fully  address these new challenging goals.  Results of the seminar  should stimulate the cost effective use of large investments  in manpower and equipment.   The exchange of ideas and data  with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S.  participants to advance their own work, and will set the  stage for future collaborative projects.  Seminar organizers  have made a special effort to involve postdoctoral  researchers.  The proceedings of the meeting will be  reproduced as a Brookhaven Internal Report and will be  distributed to the participants, as well a to relevant  research groups in the U.S. and Japan.  ***",
