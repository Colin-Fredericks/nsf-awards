 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current research on electronic commerce focuses on means for  secure and efficient mechanisms for payments, largely supported by  cryptographic techniques. Such mechanisms are indeed necessary for  e-commerce, but they are not sufficient.  Commercial activities  are not limited to simple exchange of funds and merchandise  between a client and a vendor. They often consist of multi-step  transactions, sometimes involving several participants, that need  to be carried out in accordance to a certain policy. Such policies  may be concerned with issues that do not lend themselves to purely  cryptographic treatment, such as: preventing  certificates from  being duplicated; ensuring that credit card are used only for the  specified transactions; guaranteeing that a payment for services  is refundable under specified circumstances; securing the privacy  and anonymity of clients; providing a degree of fault tolerance;  and establishing access control. This project proposes a general  mechanism that can be used to formulate and enforce a wide range  of such policies for electronic commerce, in a unified, scalable,  and easily deployable manner.  The policy is to be stated  explicitly, and be enforced by a distributed set of trusted  generic controllers.  This mechanism is based on the concept of  ``Law-Governed interaction,'' developed under a current NSF grant.",
