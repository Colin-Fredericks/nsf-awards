 "awd_abstract_narration": "Beaupre  9728470    Animals in nature, like people, make complex decisions about how  they use their time. These decisions influence the amount of food  they obtain, and how they use that food to grow and reproduce,  which in turn, influences the size and health of the population.  If the PIs can understand how changes in an animal's environment  affect connections between time use and production (growth and  reproduction) then the PIs can make better predictions about the  responses of animals to environmental change (natural, or  human-caused). Perhaps the best way to understand how  environmental change will influence animals is to experimentally  change the environment and observe their responses. In this  project, the PI will experimentally increase feeding in a small  sample of free-ranging timber rattlesnakes, and observe changes  in their behavior, physiology and production relative to an  unmanipulated control group. The timber rattlesnake is an  excellent study animal because with the help of small surgically  placed radio transmitters we can observe complex behavior and  physiology in a natural setting. This project will be conducted  at the Ozark Natural Science Center, a non-profit natural science  education center in Northwest Arkansas. Project activities will  directly contribute to the education of children at the grade  school and high school levels, college undergraduates, and  graduate students at the Master's and Ph.D. levels.",
