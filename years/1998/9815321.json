Busch, Chemistry Department, and Dr. Bala Subramaniam, Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering, of the University of Kansas for investigation for oxidation catalysts in supercritical carbon dioxide (sc CO2).  The award is in the Technology for Sustainable Environment component of the EPA/NSF Partnership for Environmental Research, and support is provided by the MPS Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program and Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.  Olefin epoxidation, functional group oxidation and bleach enhancers will be studied.  The advantage of sc CO2 as a reaction medium is that it is non-toxic, inexpensive, and environmentally benign compared to organic solvents often used in the reactions of interest.  Emphasis will be placed on modifying the structure of transition metal catalysts in order to increase their solubility in sc CO2.  Alternatively, fluorocarbon polymer supports or macroporous templated polymers will be investigated.  Included among the metal systems to be studied are manganese complexes; rhenium oxides; salen derivatives of cobalt, iron, and chromium; and ruthenium porphyrins.  Supercritical oxidation kinetics will be performed in batch reactors under well-defined process conditions.\r\n\r\nHigh volume chemicals such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol are formed in epoxidation reactions while selective functional group oxidation is important in manufacture of many fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and bleach catalysts have potential application in sc CO2 dry-cleaning businesses.  In this project, alternative routes to many widely used oxidation reactions will be studied and optimized for use in the benign solvent sc CO2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
