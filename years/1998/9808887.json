 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 98-08887 ROBERTS.  The ultimate goal of this project is to  understand how the nervous system accurately stores and processes  the temporal flow of sensory information.  The project focuses on  the mormyrid electric fish; a nocturnal fish that senses its  environment by emitting a weak electric pulse and then detecting  the distortions caused by external objects with electrosensory  receptors in its skin.  This electrosensory system requires  exceptional timing and precision in order for the fish to navigate  through its environment and identify external objects.  The site  of initial electrosensory information processing is the  electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL).  Neurons of the ELL are  affected not only by electrosensory input, but also by signals  that are temporally locked to the motor command that elicits the  electric pulse.  The responses of these neurons in the ELL are  found to be highly adaptable to changing conditions that effect  the electrosensory system.  This adaptability leads to the ability  of these neurons to \"store\" an image of the fish's expectation of  its own electrical signal. However, due to the complexity of the  ELL, it is unclear whether the rules of adaptive learning measured  in certain experimental conditions can explain the collective  neural activity observed under other experimental conditions.  The  difficulty of experimentally exploring the roles of various  synaptic learning rules, sites of adaptive change, and  intracellular connections make theoretical and modeling work a  necessary adjunct to experimental study.  This research effort is  in collaboration with Dr. Curtis Bell who will provide data from  experiments performed in his lab.  Dr. Roberts will use  mathematical analyses and computer simulations to combine results  from different experiments to predict changes in the responses  neurons in the ELL during changing sensory conditions.  These  predictions will then be used to test different mechanisms that  may be responsible for the adaptiv e changes observed in the ELL.  Completion of the proposed research will clarify underlying  mechanisms of ELL function and illuminate the cooperative  interactions of subsystems in this and other cerebellum-like  structures.",
