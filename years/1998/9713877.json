 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California's Natural Reserve System  (NRS) provides a diversity of sites throughout  the state for such research.  Sedgwick Reserve (SR),  administered by the University of California, Santa  Barbara (UCSB) Natural Reserve System since 1993 and  located in the Santa Ynez Valley of central coastal  California, is the most recent addition to the NRS, SR  serves as a site for scientists and  educators from the  University of California and other university campuses  throughout the state and country to study ecology,  evolutionary biology, geography, soil science, geology,  agricultural science, anthropology and natural history.  Because of its recent history as a working cattle ranch  and farm, SR offers unique opportunities for studying  interactions between natural and agricultural and  rangeland ecosystems.  With its recent inclusion in the  NRS and the hiring of full-time, on-site directors,  Sedgwick Reserve is poised to develop its scientific,  education and public service missions.    SR is located 35 miles north of the city of Santa Barbara  and the UCSB campus in the Santa Ynez Valley. The 2050 ha  reserve encompassess an extremely wide variety of plant  communities including coastal sage scrub, blue oak  woodland, valley oak savanna, coast live oak forest,  serpentine chaparral, serpentine grassland, foothill pine  woodland, willow riparian forest, vernal pools, seeps and  springs.    A comprehensive planning effort by UCSB faculty and staff  is underway to develop SR's scientific, education,  stewardship and public service missions.  When fully  developed, SR  will fulfill the needs of interdisciplinary  research and instruction in the field sciences, of  preservation of critical and sensitive habitats, and of  environmental education and outreach for the general  public.    To further this multiple mission of research, education,  stewardship and community service, this project will  support a workshop to develop a long-range research plan  for SR.  The product of th e project will be a long-range  scientific research plan for the next 10 years",
