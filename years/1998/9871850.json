 "awd_abstract_narration": "9871850  Atwater  This objectives of this project are to develop the synthesis,  processing, manipulation and characterization tools to enable and  improve novel, emerging silicon nanoparticle memory and logic  devices. These devices exploit common approaches for particle  synthesis, manipulation, interface passivation and electrical and  optical characterization of ordered, passivated arrays of  size-classified silicon nanoparticles which are integrated into  larger device structures. Device structures to be addressed in  this project include: a nonvolatile memory based on discrete  charge storage on the nanoparticle floating gate of a  field-effect transistor, and a silicon nanoparticle-based  implementation for a cellular automata wire/logic gate, in which  information is propagated by cell-cell electrostatic interactions  rather than by current flow. The nanoparticle engineering and  assembly methods developed in this program may enable the first  realization of a cellular automata logic gate capable of room  temperature operation.  Key aspects of the synthesis and processing are engineering of  nanoparticle size, shape, dielectric passivation thickness and  stoichiometry, and control of nanoparticle position. Control of  position is achieved in model device structures using force  manipulation by a scanning probe microscope. Another effort is  aimed at utilizing fluid and colloidal forces to fabricate  ordered linear and planar arrays. Characterization of charge  state and morphology at the single particle level is performed  using conducting tip atomic force microscopy.  %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  science and engineering having high technological relevance. The  research will contribute new knowledge at a fundamental level to  important aspects of electronic devices. The basic knowledge and  understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute  to improving the performance of advanced devices by providing a  fundamental understanding  and a basis for designing and producing  improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important  feature of the program is the integration of research and  education through the training of students in a fundamentally and  technologically significant area. This research grant is made  under the Nanotechnology Initiative (NSF 98-20), and is co-funded  by the Directorate for Engineering, the Directorate for Computer  and Information Science and Engineering, and the Directorate for  Mathematical and Physical Sciences. The research team is a  university/industry/government lab collaboration between Applied  Physics and Chemical Engineering faculty at the California  Institute of Technology, and technical staff at Bell Labs/Lucent  Technologies and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",
