They  will emphasize regions which have not been  explored experimentally.  With the advent of  the new powerful synchrotron light sources,  including one in India, these systems will be  more readily explored in the laboratory, thus  making the proposed studies quite timely.    Scope:  The results will provide further  insight into the basic nature of fundamental  atomic processes which are important in plasma  physics, atmospheric, solar and astrophysics,  and radiation physics.  In both countries, the  research provides training for graduate and  advanced undergraduate students in methods of  calculating and understanding atomic and  molecular structure and collisions.   Additionally, for India the  collaboration  facilitates the build-up of an internationally  competitive research program at the IIT,  Madras.        ***",
