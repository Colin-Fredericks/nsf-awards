 "awd_abstract_narration": "Release of fine sediment from small reservoirs along  mountain channel creates hazards for aquatic biota, and  adversely impacts recreational channel use.  One means of  minimizing the sedimentation hazards associated with these  releases would be to specify the discharge regime necessary  to flush fine sediments form channel reaches of critical  aquatic habit.  This research project will use a  representative case of recent reservoir sediment release to  address the basic objectives of : (1) evaluating the ability  of for existing hydraulic models to simulate sedimentation  patterns along the type of mountain channels affected by  reservoir sediment releases; and (2) developing a conceptual  model of reservoir-release sedimentation patterns along  mountain channels as a function of channel geometry,  discharge, sediment volume, and  grain-size distribution.  Data on channel response to reservoir-sediment release come  form the North Fork Poudre River, Colorado, which had a  sediment release in September 1996.  Monitoring along the  North Fork Poudre River since October 1996 has created a  database of changes in velocity distribution, bedload and  suspended load transport, and channel geometry as a function  of discharge.  The research seeks to integrate existing knowledge so as to  most effectively apply that knowledge toward mitigating a  widespread problem.  It will provide resource managers with  the information necessary to choose the most appropriate  model for a given situation, as well as providing modelers  with specific data on the strengths and weaknesses of  existing models when applied to sedimentation along mountain  channels.  It is likely the model study will yield some  basic insights into the importance if increased boundary  roughness and secondary flow.",
