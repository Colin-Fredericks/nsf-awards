 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733587  Guloy    The research component of this proposal aims to investigate ways  to tune the electronic structure and properties of Zintl phases  and layered intermetallic oxides.  The research plan outlines  unique strategies to:  1) apply and assess the Zintl concept and  its limits to the synthesis of `electron-deficient' Zintl phases  - a new class of inorganic pi-systems; 2) design and synthesize  new complex layered intermetallic-oxide intergrowth structures by  using layered intermetallic and oxide structures in a rational  building-block-multilayer approach.  Since unique structures and  properties are already apparent in normal Zintl phases and polar  intermetallics, it is anticipated that exploratory synthesis and  characterization will produce unusual crystal chemistry and novel  physical properties.  These unusual materials represent a  promising class of electronic and magnetic materials with  potential properties ranging from semiconductors,  thermoelectrics, superconductors and giant magnetoresistance.  The general aim of this research is to establish  useful structure(chemical bonding)-property  relationships and to improve our chemical  understanding of the region between metals and  nonmetals.  The educational plan of this proposal  includes the development of courses in graduate and  undergraduate levels that will emphasize the  importance of materials chemistry, inorganic solid  state chemistry, and descriptive chemistry of the  elements. Undergraduate and graduate training will be  supplemented by collaborative activities with other  educational institutions and industrial research  groups.  %%%  The challenge to synthesize new materials and  understand, control and predict the structures and  properties of solids continues to fuel the search for  new technological materials of relevance to the  industrial sector.  The discovery of new classes of  materials such as the Zintl compounds, together with  a deeper understanding of their diverse properties,  and the impact of  their development and application  forms the basis for undergraduate eductaion  activities being developed in this cutting-edge area  of solidstate chemistry and materials science.  ***",
