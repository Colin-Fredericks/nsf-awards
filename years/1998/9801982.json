The electrical  conductance  and  other  properties of these nanostructures are predicted, and  observed,  to  display  non-classical and surprising behavior.  This  experimental  project  will  extend  our  knowledge of the superconducting  proximity  effect  by conducting the first measurements of the thermoelectric  and  magnetic  response of NS structures. In the first part of the  project,  the  energy  and  length  dependence of the electrical  conductance  of  normal  wires in contact with a superconductor will be investigated  in  order  to  verify fundamental predictions of the theory of NS  devices.  The  second part of the project is devoted to measuring the thermopower  of  so-called Andreev interferometers, which are loops in which one arm  is  fabricated from a superconductor and the other from a normal metal.  In  the  last  part of the project, the magnetic response  of  isolated  Andreev  interferometers will be measured using dc SQUID magnetometers.  These  last two properties have not been extensively studied, and their  measurement  should  further  our  understanding  of  the  correlations  induced  in the normal metal by its proximity to a superconductor.  The  samples  for  these experiments will be patterned and fabricated  using  electron-beam  lithography. Their low temperature transport  properties  will  be  investigated by linear and nonlinear multiprobe  differential  resistance  measurements  as  a function of  temperature  and  magnetic  field.  The low temperature magnetic properties will be measured  using  ultra-sensitive  dc SQUID magnetometers. Post-doctoral  associates  and  graduate  students trained on this project will be exposed  to  a  wide  variety  of  experimen tal techniques which will  be  useful  in  future  careers in either industry or academia.  %%%  This  experimental  condensed  matter  physics  project  addresses  the  fabrication  and  characterization of ultra-small normal  metal  (N)  -  superconductors (S) structures. Superconductors have unusual electrical  and magnetic properties at low temperatures, the best known being their  ability  to  carry  an  electrical current  without  resistance.  These  properties  form  the basis for a number of practical devices  such  as  very  high  field  magnets. When a superconductor  is  placed  in  good  contact  with a conventional normal metal such as copper or gold,  some  of the superconducting properties \"leak\" a very small distance into the  normal  metal.  With modern lithographic techniques borrowed  from  the  semiconductor  industry, it is now possible to probe the properties  of  normal  metals on these very small size scales. The aim of this project  is   to   investigate  the  electrical,  thermoelectric  and   magnetic  properties of such small normal metals placed in close proximity  to  a  superconductor.  In  the  first part of this  project,  the  electrical  properties of normal metal wires in proximity to a superconductor  will  be  studied to verify and further our current theoretical understanding  of  the nature of the superconductivity induced in the normal metal. In  the  second  and third parts of the project, the consequences  of  this  induced superconductivity on the thermoelectric and magnetic properties  of  the  normal metal wires will be explored. These last two properties  have  not  been yet been studied experimentally, and these measurements  will  help  us  gain  further  insight  into  the  interaction  between  superconductors  and  normal  metals on very  small  size  scales.  The  samples  for  these  experiments  will  be  fabricated  using  advanced  electron-beam  lithography techniques, and measured using sophisticated  resistance  and  magnetic sensors a t temperatures near  absolute  zero.  Post-doctoral associates and graduate students trained on this  project  will  be  exposed to a number of experimental techniques which will  be  useful in future careers in either industry or academia.  ***",
