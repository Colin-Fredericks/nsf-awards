E. Druffel  and J. Bauer, will measure carbon isotopes in samples to  be  collected in collaboration with Dr. Ken Smith.  A record  of  deep  ocean sediment fluxes has been initiated by Dr.  Smith  using moored time-series sediment traps at a site previously  occupied  by  this group for a period of  7  years.   It  is  hypothesized  that  the  current El Nino  will  dramatically  alter carbon fluxes, and hence have a significant impact  on  the  cycling of organic carbon (OC) in the water column  and  the delivery of OC to the seafloor and hence the response of  the  benthic community. The 1997-1998 El Nino is  considered  to  be a major event within this century and the opportunity  should  not  be missed to collect and analyze  these  unique  samples.   Such  data  would provide new  insights  into  OC  cycling, provide important constraints on the effects of  El  Nino  on  the  benthic  communities,  and  would  allow  for  improved  understanding  and  planning  of  future  El  Nino  studies.   Due  to the rapid response required  to  initiate  this  study  during  the ongoing El Nino  season,  the  SGER  process  is  being  used to continue the time-series  record  though  1998  and  to conduct studies of sediment  community  response (Ken Smith, lead PI OCE-9807103).  Drs. Druffel and  Bauer  will  use  14C and 13C isotopes and  measurements  of  particulate, dissolved and sinking OC to evaluate the effect  of  the El Nino on OC distributions and turnover under these  anomalous conditions.",
