 "awd_abstract_narration": "9720634     Shreeve  EPSCoR involves Idaho's three universities - University of Idaho (UI),  Idaho State University (ISU), and Boise State University (BSU) - as  well as all other two and four year institutions in the state working  in the research areas of molecular ecology and environmental science  and engineering. Project funds will be directed to the research areas  under this broad umbrella which have been carefully nurtured and which  will continue to be strengthened.  A portion of EPSCoR funds will be  allocated on a competitive basis to junior faculty who direct research  in these focus areas of importance to Idaho and its research  universities.  Funds will also be used specifically to increase the  long-term productivity of Idaho's young research faculty by improving  the research tools and human talent available to them for furthering  their ongoing investigations.  In some instances, this improvement  will be achieved by providing startup funds to our newest, tenure  track faculty for research program initiation.  In addition, multiuser  instruments that will improve the research capabilities of several  investigators or of multidisciplinary faculty research teams will be  purchased. A significant portion of the available funds will be  reserved to support individual researchers including faculty  development positions at Idaho State University and Boise State  University that will allow newer, less experienced faculty to gain  sufficient research expertise to increase their confidence and their  ability to compete.  A least one new joint (UI/ISU) professorship at  the Idaho Falls campus will be created.  A competitive seed grant  program to stimulate new initiatives by beginning investigators and  undergraduate research experience programs to provide top quality  Idaho undergraduates the opportunity to work with university  researchers will also be conducted as will programs for high quality  undergraduate women and minority students.",
