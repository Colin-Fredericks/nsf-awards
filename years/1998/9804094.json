The research is focused on the study of the  structure  of  quasi-crystals by means  of  magic-angle  spinning  (MAS)  NMR.  Diffraction studies of quasi-crystals show that  the  patterns are very sharp, which indicates some sort of long  range  order.   These  quasi-crystals  possess  five-fold  symmetry,   a  symmetry which is predicted not to exist for a periodic structure  according  to classical group theoretical arguments.   Discovered  in  1984,  these quasi-crystals pose new problems for  the  solid  state  physicist who now has to expand to notion  of  a  periodic  lattice  structure to allow for a quasi-perodicity.  The research  described   in  this proposal focuses on the TiZrNi metal  system  which  will  be  studied by 2D MAS NMR.   The  proposed  work  is  outside the realm of investigations of well established problems.  It  is  therefore high-risk research which has the  potential  of  good  scientific  payoff. Besides the two co-PIs  the  work  will  involve the participation of undergraduate students.  %%%  This  is  a  new  proposal  from   an  undergraduate  institution  prepared  by  two  PIs who equally co-share a  tenured  assistant  professor position in the Physics Department of Knox College,  in  Galesburg, Illinois.
