 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main purpose of this project is to develop multimedia software modules for a PC/Windows platform which focus on the development of 3-D spatial visualization skills.  This project builds on a previous NSF project in which the PIs wrote a textbook titled \"Introduction to 3-D Spatial Visualization\" with an accompanying computer lab manual.  The software to be developed could be used either as stand-alone exercises in the development of 3-D spatial skills or as a supplement to the text.  The text, which was written primarily for freshman engineering students, is also appropriate for college freshmen in general and/or for high school students.  The computer lab manual from the original project, however, is written for use with I-DEAS software and Unix baxed workstations.  Consequently, it is unlikely that the computer component developed for this text could be used by most high schools and by those colleges without Unix based workstations or access to I-DEAS software.  The development of stand-alone, multimedia software modules was not part of the original project.  This project represents a significant software development effort -- it is not merely the conversion of existing software from one platform to another.  Development of stand-alone software modules for the PC will enable larger dissemination of the computer component of this course and has been requested by many teachers.      A secondary purpose of this project is to develop a workbook that students will write in as they are using the software.  The workbook will contain spaces for sketching objects and answering questions as they work through the software modules.    Prentice-Hall has agreed to assist in the dissemination of these materials.  If possible, the software that is developed as a direct result of this project will be made available on the World Wide Web.",
