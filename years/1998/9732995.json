 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this project is to develop an analytical, multidisciplinary  approach to research and education in Image Processing, integrating important  aspects of engineering problems that are often treated separately.  In  particular, this study incorporates realistic statistical models for image data  and physical sensors, and seeks solutions to estimation and compression problems  based upon fundamental statistical principles.  The educational component of this  project aims at better preparing students for their engineering careers by  developing their multidisciplinary and analytical skills, and exposing them to  multiple facets of complex engineering problems.  This theme is present at all  levels of this project: Firstly, motivated undergraduate students are encouraged  to participate in the research.  Secondly, an undergraduate Image and Video  Processing course and laboratory exercises allow the students to learn, visualize  and assimilate fundamental concepts.  Thirdly, an advanced graduate Statistical  Image Processing course is being developed with the objective of integrating,  applying and solidifying concepts taught in Information Theory, Estimation  Theory, and Statistical Optics.  Fourthly, an interactive, virtual Image  Processing lab is being developed as part of two Distance Learning projects.    The research component of this project addresses key problems in image  restoration and compression and quantifies the benefits that may result from the  use of more accurate and sophisticated models.  The methodology developed is also  applicable to ill-posed statistical inverse problems such as Synthetic Aperture  Radar imaging, astronomical imaging, and tomography.  Complexity regularization  theory plays a central role in this research.  Complexity-regularized estimators  are inherently in compressed form, and fundamental relationships between  estimation performance and rate-distortion theory are explored in that context.   Additionally, novel techniques for optimizing for  optimizing the operational  rate-distortion performance of several image coding systems are being developed.",
