 "awd_abstract_narration": "9811362  dePamphilis      Support is requested to study the history of a Group I intron found at an  identical location in the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I (coxI) of  diverse flowering plants.  The intron is homologous with and has key  structural elements of a well-studied infectious intron in fungi.  The  intron occurs in numerous unrelated lineages of flowering plants, while  being absent from the vast majority of flowering plants examined.   Surprisingly, the intron is particularly concentrated in parasitic plants,  which have intimate symbiotic associations with other plants and fungi.   This pattern, and features of the biology of parasitic plants, suggests the  possibility that some parasitic plants are capable of incorporation of  foreign DNA sequences and/or may have played a role as an intron source in  genetic transfers to host lineages.  The proposed research will test  biologically-based hypotheses that may explain the presence and movement of  the coxI intron among plant lineages.  The data collected will define the  precise distribution of the intron across parasitic and nonparasitic plant  groups, the genic and cellular location of the sequences, and phylogenetic  comparisons of coxI intron and exon sequences.  A second mitochondrial  gene, atpA, will also be examined, to improve the phylogenetic resolution  and reliability of the coxI exon (ie., plant mitochondrial) history.      This research will represent the first comprehensive analysis of a plant  mitochondrial gene and its intron; the results will have important  implications for our understanding of organelle genetics, mobile genetic  elements, and fundamental problems of molecular evolution and systematics.    In addition, the broader significance of this project to society includes:  1) Training of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scientists; 2)  Potential for the identification of invasive genetic elements in plant  organelle sequences, 3) Development of phylogenetic approaches to the study  of intr ons that may have broader application to understanding other  invasive elements in biology, agriculature, and medicine; 4) Contributing  to an understanding of parasitic plants, which could aid efforts to control  harmful parasitic weeds in agriculture.",
