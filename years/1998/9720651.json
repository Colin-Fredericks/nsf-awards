 "awd_abstract_narration": "9720651  Williams  The EPSCoR program has served as a major stimulus to improvements in  the competitiveness of Oklahoma researchers and the status of  university science and technology research in Oklahoma.  The state and  the three comprehensive universities (The University of Oklahoma and  its Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma State University, and The  University of Tulsa) have demonstrated a commitment to develop their  research bases and to improve the quality of their science,  mathematics, and engineering research.  Oklahoma EPSCoR  will focus on  three Science and Technology Centers:  the Oklahoma Biotechnology  Network; the Center for Environmental Applications of the Oklahoma  Mesonet; and the Center for Photonic and Electronic Materials and  Devices.  The Oklahoma Biotechnology Network will stress technical  support for core facilities, technical workshops as a primary outreach  mechanism, and selected new initiatives in bioinformatics, mass  spectrometry, and DNA chip technology.  The Center for Environmental  Applications of the Oklahoma Mesonet, a network of 114 automated  environmental monitoring sites across Oklahoma that relay data via  radio links to a central location, will stress accessibility and  usability of Mesonet data, add Mesonet stations and sensors around the  Norman Landfill, and will develop an aerobiology sensor network in  western Oklahoma.  The Center for Photonic and Electronic Materials  and Devices will stress pre-competitive applied research projects to  establish linkages with private sector companies and will provide  support to research facilities and for selected equipment upgrades.   The goal of the Cooperative Agreement is to make the three Centers  self-sufficient and to graduate them from EPSCoR support by the end of  the award period. This will be accomplished by providing support to  the underlying research infrastructure in the Centers, through  selective funding for new initiatives, and through support for  research outreach and project developme nt. These initiatives will be  directed towards securing non-EPSCoR support for the research projects  and research infrastructure from federal, state, institution, and  private sources.  A co-funding initiative in high capacity computer  networking will support ongoing efforts and new initiatives to expand  Oklahoma's capabilities in networking.  The Centers and Network goals  are complemented by: support for research outreach and proposal  development; technology showcases to bring together university  researchers and the private sector; programs to promote public and  legislative awareness of university research; a new Faculty Fellows  program for senior research faculty to interact with state leaders;  and, human resources programs including two Women in Science  conferences and an entrepreneurship program.",
