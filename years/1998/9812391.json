 "awd_abstract_narration": "The El Verde Field Station has been a vital location for  research and training in the only neotropical rain forest  under the jurisdiction of the United States.  The field  station is located in the Caribbean National Forest,  which is an Experimental Forest, a Biosphere Reserve, a  research site for the University of Puerto Rico Center  for Research Excellence in Science and Technology, and  the site of the Luquillo LongTerm Ecological Research  Program.  For more than 30 years, the field station has  been the focus of projects by scientists from more than  50 institutions in the United States and other countries.  Current research projects are funded by the National  Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration, and the  USDA Forest Service.    Research facilities at the El Verde Field Station date to  the 1930s and their current size restricts ongoing  research activities.  One weakness of the Station is the  lack of experimental plant growth and stream facilities.  Such facilities would allow plant and animal experiments  under controlled conditions.  Previous attempts to  germinate or grow high elevation plant species from the  EL Verde Area at low elevation facilities in San Juan  have shown that plants become physiologically stressed  (i.e. stunted growth as a result of extreme temperatures  and humidity).  Similarly, the amount of detail and  control needed to study the ecology and behavior of  aquatic organisms of the area is severely limited by the  lack of experimental streams.  Another important  limitation to research as well as administrative work at  El Verde is the lack of a reliable power plant to deal  with recurrent electrical power failures.    This project will enact the third of five phases  described in the Master Plan for the Development of  Facilities Operated by the University of Puerto Rico in  the Luquillo Experimental Forest.",
