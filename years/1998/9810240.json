 "awd_abstract_narration": "ENGINEERING EXPLORATION in Phoenix, Arizona, is composed of  a superb and well-tested partnership of educators, practicing  scientists and engineers, members of professional associations,  and education advocates anchored by Washington Elementary School  District, the Society of Women Engineers (Phoenix Section), and  New Frontiers/Center for Educational Development.  This project  includes:  1) an introductory exploratory activity for girls and  their parents at the new Arizona Science Center; 2) an  \"Engineering University\" where girls and their parents learn  about different disciplines of engineering and career options in  each, course prerequisites for the fields of math, science and  engineering, and ways that they can work together to accomplish  goals necessary for entry into these fields; 3) an inservice for  middle school teachers on gender equity issues and how they can  promote maximum achievement of girls; and 4) follow-up classroom  visits and training for a school equity specialist.  This system  is Arizona's largest elementary school district, with  approximately 26,000 students, and has a large number of high-  poverty and minority female students who lack role models and  family support to help them prepare for entering a  technologically demanding work place.  Highly skilled, high  paying careers in which women have been underrepresented are  currently not included in their career plans, because they have  had little or no exposure to those careers.  The overriding goal  of ENGINEERING EXPLORATION is to help female students become more  knowledgeable of opportunities awaiting them in the fields of  math, science and engineering, and to promote their developing  competence and confidence in their abilities to learn skills and  concepts related to those fields.  The project will be a major  feature on the agenda for the 1999 National Conference for the  Society of Women Engineers to be held in Phoenix.",
