In  the  work,  C-60  will  be   deposited  sequentially or simultaneously with various metals, insulators or  semiconductors. A variety of deposition techniques will  be  used  including  thermal sublimation, ion-beam sputtering and  electron  beam   heating.  In-situ  characterization  will   primarily   be  accomplished  by  electrical transport  measurements  during  and  after  deposition. These measurements involve not  only  in-plane  transport   but   also  tunneling  and  electric   field   effect  measurements.  For  air-stable or passivated samples,  additional  characterization  by  x-rays,  AFM,  STM,  magnetotransport,  and  optical  and infrared absorption will be made. The high  electron  affinity and the relative ease of intercalation of C-60  will  be  aspects  central  to  the  research projects.  One  project  will  involve  electron  tunneling in trilayer  structures  to  further  understanding of superconductivity in the alkali-doped  compounds  and to determine the interface-related vibrational and electronic  states and the expected relatively large Coulomb gap of molecules  isolated  in  the  tunnel  barrier.  This  research  project   is  interdisciplinary  in  nature  and  will  involve  graduate   and  undergraduate  students  who  will  be  excellently  trained  for  careers in industry, government and academia.  %%%  This  experimental project is based on novel and potentially very  useful   electronic  conducting  films  based   on   carbon-sixty  molecules.  Such molecules are like hollow spheres  comprised  of  sixty  chemically  bonded carbon atoms,  resembling  tiny  soccer  balls.   These  molecules  are  relatively  new  and  unexplored,  especially  in   terms of their potential for forming  insulating,  electrically conducting, and even superconducting thin films.  It  has  been  possible  to  add  alkali metals  such  as  sodium  or  potassium  to  carbon-sixty to provide \"electrical doping\"  which  fosters  electrical  conduction  and  even  superconductivity  to  temperatures  up  to about 30 Kelvin degrees. The  work  in  this  experimental project will, in part, involve \"sandwich structures\"  which could perform functions which might be useful in electronic  devices.  This  work will lead to a much better understanding  of  the   electrical  behavior  of  interfaces  between  conventional  metals, insulators, and semiconductors, with films of the carbon-  sixty molecules, and will possibly lead to applications for  such  interfaces. This research project is interdisciplinary in  nature  and will involve undergraduate and graduate students who will  be  excellently   trained for positions in industry,  government  and  academia.  ***",
