 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research focuses on computational methods and  numerical analysis for modeling and design of optical  micro-structures in linear and nonlinear optical media. The  research will extend our existing collaboration with Cray  Research, Inc., and develop a new collaboration with  Lucent Technology, Bell Labs. It will provide opportunities for  two graduate assistants to engage in University-Industry joint  research programs and make important contributions to an exciting  area of applied and industrial mathematics.    The main topics of the proposed research are as follows:  Interface least-squares finite element methods for diffraction  problems:  computation and numerical analysis.  Inverse diffraction and optimal design problems. A new  computational approach.  Modeling of nonlinear diffractive  optics. Structure enhanced nonlinear optical effects.  These problems are motivated by industrial applications.    The objectives of the training activities are to (1) prepare the  graduate students with skills and experiences that will make them  strong competitors in an academic/industrial environment and (2)  produce graduate students who have qualifications  that will make  them important contributors to science and technology  developments in an academic/industrial environment.  Together  with the College, the University will provide 50% of the total  support for the first year. Research assistantships or teaching  assistantship will be provided in the years after.  Cray Research  will support a summer internship for one graduate student of the  PI.  Guangye Li of Cray will devote time in supervising the  summer intern and working on the software development.  Cray will  also provide the PI and his students access to computers,  together with necessary technical support.    This GOALI project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
