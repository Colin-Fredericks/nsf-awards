 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9801402  Sibold    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a low cost process for toughening alumina ceramics.  These materials are widely used in anti-wear, anti-corrosion, and electrical insulation applications in many industries.  However, markets remain limited because of the brittleness of these ceramics.  While tough ceramics are available, they are six to 50 times more costly than alumina.  Phase I developed a simple water-based infiltration process that increased the fracture toughness of a commercial alumina ceramic by as much as 25% with only 50% increase in material cost.  The process was performed on simple fracture toughness testing specimens.  Phase II will develop an optimized process and material with the microstructure and fracture toughness that can be made easily and inexpensively by a commercial ceramics manufacturer.  The primary objective is a production process for tough, damage tolerant ceramics, which can be used in place of normally brittle ceramics.      The anticipated increase in toughness of low cost alumina ceramics will significantly expand the commercial applications for technical ceramics.  ***",
