 "awd_abstract_narration": "9812847  Yang  This research project is aimed to establish a design  methodology for generating new conjugate kinematic pairs.  Based on this method, new high performance kinematic pairs,  such as gears, rotors, and cams for motion and power  transmission, are to be developed. The driving motivation  behind the project is threefold: (i) The practical and  analytical signficance of creating new conjugate kinematic  pairs for mechanical systems; (ii) The advantages of  Deviation-Function (DF) method in generating new conjugate  pairs for both circular and non-circular pitch curves; and  (iii) The lack of attention devoted to this important area  of study for a relatively long period of time, particularly  in the United States.  During the research phase, it is  planned to emphasize the following four focus studies:  1.  a deviation-function based design methodology for creating  new conjugate pairs; 2. design of High-load-capacity gears;  3.  new tooth profile design for non-circular gears; and 4.  design of advanced lobe pumps.  These studies are further  broken down into eleven carefully designed sub-tasks,  namely, design analysis, design synthesis, research for high-  load-capacity profiles, evaluation on gear conjugation  properties, considerations on practicality, experimentation,  pressure angle consideration, interference avoidance, design  of high pumping efficiency, design of flow rate, and the  design and testing of high-pressure lobe pumps.  ***",
