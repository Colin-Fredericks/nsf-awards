 "awd_abstract_narration": "To  identify  and  quantify the principal processes  that  control  the partitioning  of carbon among oceanic reservoirs and between the  ocean  and atmosphere  on focal and regional scales, with a view towards  synthesis  and prediction on a global scale, is a specific goal of the  U.S. JGOFS Synthesis and  Modeling Project. As a contribution towards  achieving this  goal,  Drs. Barber,  Peng,  Chai  and Dugdale will develop  an ecosystem  model  for  the equatorial  Pacific Ocean, with a focus on  how silicate and iron affect  new and   export  productivity  and  the  partitioning  of  carbon  between  the atmosphere, surface ocean and deep  ocean.  The study  will use an  ecosystem model  embedded  in  a state-of-  the-art general circulation  model  for  the equatorial  Pacific  Ocean to  investigate how new  and  export  productivity responds to changing  physical and chemical forcing. The domain of the  model is between 30+S  and 30+N, 120+E and 70+W, with real geometry and topography, but analysis  will focus on the equatorial region from 5+N to 5+S. The recent upgrade  of  supercomputers at North Carolina Supercomputing  Center  (NCSC)  (CrayT90) and Arctic Region Supercomputing Center (ARSC) (Cray-YMP) and  the award of several hundred hours of CPU time to Peng, Chai and Barber  make  it possible  to  embed  an  ecosystem model with modest complexity  in  a  high resolution,  three  dimensional  prognostic  ocean  model,  and  to  conduct numerous  experiments on the ecosystem model structure  and parameters  in  a timely and efficient manner.       Phase  1  of  the  project  will  modify an  existing  five-  compartment ecosystem  model  by adding three more compartments (silicate,  diatoms  and mesozooplanktonic  grazers) following the approach of  Dugdale  et  al.  The preliminary  objective  of this three-dimensional  Si/N/light  model  is  to reproduce  High  Nitrate-Low Silicate-Low  Chlorophyll  (HNLSLC)  conditions. With size-dependent growth rate  responses in small phytoplankton and diatoms and  varying  grazing  vulnerability, the  role  of  new  diatom  production regulating  on Si  and Fe can be thoroughly investigated.  Also in  Phase  1, 2:CO2 and total  alkalinity () ALK) will be added in order to calculate pCO2. The  pre-  industrial  atmospheric CO2 (280 1latm) will be  used  to  hindcast air-  sea flux of CO2 in the equatorial Pacific. New production regulating  on  silicate should provide a more accurate calculation of CO2 compared to  using nitrate as a regulating nutrient. In Phase 2 the effect of iron is  added  to the  model  making a, the initial slope of the photosynthesis  vs. irradiance curve,  a  function  of  iron.  The values of  a  are  based  on  equatorial observations  of natural and experimental iron  additions. Independently,  Ks for  Si(OH4)  is  made  a  function of iron,  an effect  that  involves  only diatoms.  The `balance to bloom`  transition will be simulated with  the  two iron  effects to reproduce the  IronEx 1 and 2 phytoplankton responses  to  a transient iron addition.  This modeling study will provide estimates  of  new and export  productivity, and a formal description of Si and Fe as regulating  mechanisms in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. When new and export  productivity is  modeled accurately and validated with JGOFS studies, it  will possible to predict with increased confidence how climate change may  alter, via biogenic export,  maintenance of the air-sea ApCO2 and hence  the ocean's  uptake  and release of CO2.",
