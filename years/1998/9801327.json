This exhibit will provide the natural historical context for visitors as they explore the cultural history exhibits that will follow this section.  Together, the Museum's exhibits will illustrate the theme \"One Place Through All of Time.\"    With this award they will engage in a series of planning activities will include a front-end evaluation study of the public's knowledge and interest in this subject, consultation with expert advisors, review of related Cenozoic exhibits in selected natural history museums, and a two-day symposium which will include a dialogue about the exhibit concepts between the scientists and the public to help complete the plan.  They will also hire an educator to develop an educational plan that will link the exhibit with the needs of teachers and will address national and state science standards.  Special attention will be given to developing materials and dissemination strategies that will serve educators in this largely rural setting.  At the end of the twelve month planing period they will have a completed exhibit and education plan and will be able to move forward with the exhibit.",
