 "awd_abstract_narration": "A gene, Odysseus (Ods), which contributes to reproductive isolation in Drosophila species was recently cloned in this laboratory. Introgression of an appropriate D. maturitiana chromosomal region containing the Ods locus causes male sterility in D. simulans. Preliminary evidence suggests that Ods is a homeodomain-containing gene but an unusual one in that the homeodomain has experienced extremely rapid amino acid substitution in Drosophila species. It is suggested that its rapid evolution  coupled with its unusual expression in the male germline is expressed as hybrid male sterility. The specific objectives are 1) to prove that the cloned gene Ods is the molecular basis for hybrid male sterility by germline transformations  2) to study the expression pattern of Ods by in situ antibody staining and 3) to investigate the molecular basis of Ods divergence by exon swapping and germline transformation. The correlation between expression in male germ cells and the rapid sequence evolution of the homeodomain will be explored.    Speciation can be the result of reproductive isolation. Although that has been an accepted dogma of biology for several decades, little progress has been made in understanding the molecular genetic basis for speciation. The recent studies which have identified several genetic elements responsible for reproductive isolation between two species of Drosophila has resulted in the cloning of one of the suspected responsible genes, Odysseus (Ods). This work will continue the characterization of the Ods gene and collect supporting evidence for its role in speciation.",
