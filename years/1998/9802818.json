 "awd_abstract_narration": "McCusker  9802818  The primary objective of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research is to develop iterative cloning, a novel cloning approach for quantitative trait loci, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and to develop this species as a microbial model for quantitative genetics. The secondary objective of this research will be to initiate the molecular analysis of the cloned quantitative trait loci. This is being done with the intention of illustrating the power of a microbial (and in particular an S. cerevisiae) model for quantitative genetics and building the groundwork for long range plans for dissecting quantitative traits.  This research involves the following steps: 1.) the construction of a novel set of cloning and control plasmids through the use of Polymerase Chain Reaction, 2.) the cloning of quantitative trait loci required for growth at high temperatures using a novel plasmid enrichment scheme, and 3.) the initiation of detailed genetic and molecular analysis of the cloned high temperature growth           quantitative trait loci.    The significance of this research is that it deals with quantitative traits (polygenic, with primarily additive interactions), one of the most complex and least understood problems in biology today. Quantitative traits have been worked on for some time in higher eukaryotes, primarily through genetic mapping, but are not understood in anything approaching precise genetic and molecular terms. The prospects are dim for a full understanding of quantitative traits in higher eukaryotes because of the genetic complexity of quantitative traits, the large population sizes necessary for mapping quantitative trait loci and, relative to microorganisms, the large genome size and genetic intractability of higher eukaryotes. A microbial model for quantitative genetics will improve our understanding of quantitative traits, and S. cerevisiae is the ideal microorganism for this purpose because of the ease of manipulating S. cerevisiae (transformation, gene replacem ent, stable haploid and diploid forms) and the immense species database, which includes the complete genome sequence. The goal of this work is to develop S. cerevisiae as a microbial model for quantitative genetics, to develop novel technology to clone quantitative trait loci and, in the long term, to understand how quantitative trait loci interact to produce a particular phenotype in precise genetic and molecular terms. The iterative cloning strategy for quantitative trait loci has a number of advantages over the mapping of quantitative trait loci. A full understanding of quantitative genetics in a eukaryotic microbial model system will provide an intellectual framework for the understanding of quantitative genetics in higher eukaryotes. The iterative cloning approach could be modified for work in other microorganisms and could be adapted for the interspecific reconstruction of quantitative traits. The interspecific reconstruction of quantitative traits would be particularly valuable when dealing with microorganisms that are difficult to manipulate and/or lack a sexual cycle, where mapping of quantitative trait loci is not possible.",
