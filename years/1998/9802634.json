 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802634  Hsu    This project aims to use scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) for  the characterization of submicron inhomogeneities in several  materials systems, including heteroepitaxial quantum dots, Si3N4  membranes, GeSi buffer layers, SrRuO3, YBCO, and copolymer films.  The goal of the project is to gain detailed understanding of the  effect of defects and inhomogeneous strain on  electrical(transport) and optical anisotropies, potentially  providing valuable information to aid in the tailoring of  materials properties for particular functions/applications. The  approach is to map optical anisotropies with sub wavelength  resolution using NSOM to determine the role of strain and defects  in producing these anisotropies, and then to correlate these  strains with growth/synthesis parameters for development of  understanding of their origins and how to achieve desired strain  levels and patterns.  The program is collaborative involving  Lucent Technologies(GeSi), Cornell University(Si3N4 membranes),  and Duke University (YBCO films), along with the University of  Virginia.  %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  materials science having high potential technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at  a fundamental level to new aspects of electronic/photonic  materials.  Experimental tools are now available to allow optical  observation of elementary surface processes and related phenomena  which when better understood allow advances in fundamental  science and technology. The basic knowledge and understanding  gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving  the performance and stability of advanced devices and circuits by  providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing  and producing improved materials, and materials combinations.  An  important feature of the program is the integration of research  and education through the training of students in a fundamentally  and technologically  significant area.  ***",
