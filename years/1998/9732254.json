 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site, operated by the Graduate Program in Nutrition, offers undergraduate students research experience in the biology and chemistry of nutritional processes.  This experiential-learning program builds on the commitment and capabilities of 15 faculty members who will serve as mentors for the students.  A 10-week summer program aims to immerse students in the excitement of scientific inquiry and to provide knowledge of approaches, techniques and critical thinking skills used in research; practice and improvement in communication skills; and guidance in planning graduate programs and careers.  Participants will include minority students and students from institutions without broad research activities, as well as students from Penn State.  Communications between each student, his or her mentor, and the program director will be established before the student arrives at the University Park campus and will continue after the student returns to his or her home campus.  Working with a team including a faculty mentor and a graduate student or other staff member, each undergraduate student will design a research project that can be completed successfully within the summer time period.  Students also will attend special seminars on improving scientific-communication skills, both written and oral.  Social events will complement the scientific community developed within the mentors' laboratories.  All students will participate in a Career Opportunities Workshop that explores the merits and means of obtaining a M.S. and/or Ph.D. degree.  The summer will culminate in a research symposium attended by faculty, staff, and students.",
