 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental geometric problems in computational geometry and  those that arise in VLSI computer-aided design will be  investigated in this project.  A new model of Voronoi diagram  based on distance measures that are not symmetric is proposed  and its characteristics and efficient algorithms for its  computation will be thoroughly studied.  Bi-criteria optimization  problems in the plane, such as shortest path tree or minimum  spanning tree routing with constraints on maximum delay, Steiner  minimum tree routing with fixed orientations,  and other optimization problems such as topological via  minimization will be investigated.  Not only the computational  complexity of these optimization problems will be studied, but  also efficient heuristics and implementations will be developed.  Web-based visualization software tools that help design and  dissemination of usable geometric codes will be implemented.  All software will be implemented in C++ and Java programming  languages with the use of visualization package developed at  Northwestern University.    The goals of this research are to apply geometric techniques  to tackle problems that arise in computational geometry as well  as other engineering fields in general and VLSI CAD in  particular, in order to increase the real impact of computational  geometry on applied areas.",
