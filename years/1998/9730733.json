 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on Domestic Violence has grown significantly over the last several decades, though few studies have examined this issue in the lives of women living in poverty. This dissertation project will document the prevalence of domestic abuse among a representative sample of welfare recipients. It will also document the incidence of sexual trauma, depression, substance abuse and homelessness within this sample. The project will explore the connection between domestic violence and welfare receipt as it impacts on education, training and employment. The role of domestic abuse, as an impediment to economic progress, will be a central focus of the study. The project will employ both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Survey data will be collected from approximately 800 participants in a welfare-to-work training program. Following the surveys, twenty-five to thirty past or present victims of domestic violence will be interviewed at length in their homes. The study will contribute to the sociological literature through empirical and analytical exploration of abuse and trauma in relationship to poverty. The investigation of the connection between domestic violence and poverty has important implications for ideological premises inherent in the welfare reform debate.",
