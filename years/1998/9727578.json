 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727578  Willis    The identification and analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) offers a  powerful tool with which to assess directly the genetic basis of evolved   differences between interfertile organisms.  One evolutionary transition in   plants that offers a unique opportunity to address the genetic basis of   adaptations is the evolution of self-fertilization from outcrossing, which   is perhaps the most frequent evolutionary transition in angiosperms.  The   genus Mimulus (Scrophulariaceae), within which are many closely related and   interfertile species or populations, provides an excellent model system for   studying the evolution of self-fertilization and speciation.  The common   yellow monkeyflowers in the Mimulus guttatus species complex are arguably   the most polytypic and most rapidly evolving members of the genus, and   populations vary tremendously in terms of the degree of self-fertilization.   There are two specific goals of the proposed study.  First, we propose to  conduct a thorough genetic analysis of the floral differences between a   primarily outcrossing population of Mimulus guttatus and a highly selfing   population of Mimulus nasutus in order to determine whether genes of large   effect contribute to the extreme floral differences between these species.   This goal will be accomplished through the mapping of quantitative trait   loci affecting floral morphology using a high-resolution linkage map of the   Mimulus genome based on microsatellite, AFLP, and RAPD markers.  Second, we   propose to test whether quantitative trait loci affecting floral traits   that are correlated with selfing actually have direct effects on the rate   of self-fertilization in a natural population.  This goal will be   accomplished by analyzing in the field the selfing rates of introgression   lines containing a M. nasutus allele for floral QTLs in a M. guttatus   background.         These experiments will address long-standing and fundamental questions  about the role of mutations  of large effect on the evolution of   adaptations.  For example, a fundamental claim of neo-Darwinian evolution   is that natural selection acts on very slight phenotypic differences among   individuals in a population.  If this subtle individual variation has a   genetic component, then adaptations will result from the steady fixation of   genes of small effect.  Conversely, others have argued that adaptation   frequently results from drastic changes at a very few genetic loci.  These   experiments will help to answer basic questions such as this.  They will   also contribute to our basic understanding of how and why   self-fertilization and other forms of inbreeding evolve in natural and   domesticated populations of plants and animals.",
