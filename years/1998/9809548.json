 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Prof. Paul Lahti at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst   is supported by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the   Chemistry Division. The theme of the research is the synthesis,   characterization  and performance of molecular organic assemblies with   multiple unpaired electrons as magnetic materials. Structural alterations   will be developed in both polymeric arrays and solid state crystalline   arrays which optimize interactions among the unpaired electron spins.    Specifically, polymeric free radical systems will be made which maximize   planarity, stable free radicals systems which interact through hydrogen   bonded assemblies will be investigated, and free radical systems that   assemble through metal chelation will be studied. The stable free radical   types employed will be nitronyl nitroxides, iminoyl nitroxides and   benzonitroyl nitroxides. Characterization will be by elemental analysis,   ESR, NMR and GC-MS. Magnetic performance measurements will be carried out   through established collaborations.  This highly interdisciplinary research addresses fundamental mechanisms   of organic ferromagnetism based on long range assembly of electronic   spins.  The combination of organic synthesis, stable free radical   characterization, and magnetic performance measurements will provide an   ideal environment for the training of students in problems of both   fundamental interest and technological relevance.  Additionally, many of   the precursor and free radical species involved may have medicinal and   pharmacological activity and will be made available for biological   screening.",
