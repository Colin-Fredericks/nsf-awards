The investigator and\r\nher colleages explore the coupling of the internal\r\nforce-generating mechanisms of the organisms with an external\r\nviscous, incompressible fluid.  A unified computational approach\r\ncan be adapted to model the internal axoneme mechanics of a\r\nbeating cilium, the force-generating internal flagella of\r\nspirochetes, as well as the coupling of active and passive tissue\r\nproperties to the swimming mechanics of a leech.  In addition to\r\nmodeling the dynamics of a single organism, the collective\r\nhydrodynamic interactions of groups of organisms and their\r\nenvironment can be examined.  The investigator has developed a\r\nmathematical model designed to study the coupled mechanical\r\nsystem comprised of the fluid and the immersed organism.  The\r\nnumerical method used is the immersed boundary method.  The full\r\nincompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved in a domain of\r\nfluid within which neutrally-buoyant organisms undergoing\r\ntime-dependent movements are immersed.  The salient feature of\r\nthis method is that the suspended organism is replaced by\r\nsuitable contributions to a force density term in the fluid\r\ndynamics equations.\r\n     This interdisciplinary project employs modern methods in\r\nscientific computing to study important biological processes.  The\r\nunderstanding of bacterial motility and aggregation is of vital\r\nimportance in bioremediation, the process by which bacteria are\r\nused to degrade toxic chemicals.  In addition, the study of the\r\ninternal mechanisms of cilia, flagella and spirochetes has\r\napplications in medicine and biotechnology.  The computational\r\nalgorithms developed in this project will be useful in studying\r\nother biofluiddynamic problems as well as contributing to\r\nexpertise in high performance computing.\r\n\r\n",
