 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pointer analysis has become one of the most critical components of  modern C and C++ compilers. In Java, it is also critical to derive  alias relations between object references to enable aggressive  optimizations. The objective of this project is to develop an  accurate and efficient pointer analysis framework based on the  alias-pair approach.  The key ideas are: (1) a new multirelation  alias graph representation to allow accurate derivation of  transitive alias relations, (2) a new interprocedural analysis  framework based on the multirelation alias graph to derive  accurate parameter and global alias information at very low cost,  (3) a new context sensitive function-level analysis framework  based on Static Single Assignment (SSA) forms to achieve high  accuracy at low cost, (4) an iterative application of (2) and (3)  to approach the accuracy of context sensitive analysis at much  lower cost, and (5) to distinguish between maybe and definite  aliases to make effective use of run-time disambiguation support  in future high performance instruction set architectures.  Theoretical results and empirical experiences based on prototype  compiler implementation and large C, C++ and Java input programs  are published to advance the state of the art of pointer analysis.",
