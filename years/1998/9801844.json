Innovative acoustic and optical techniques are used to study  liquid interface (surface) dynamics, including liquid  coalescence, bubble entrainment, droplet impact, and similar  phenomena. The experiments are designed to test or extend  theories of the behavior of liquid surfaces currently being  developed in condensed matter physics. The main focus is on fluid  droplet impact and the mechanisms of entrainment gases in the  mode believed responsible for generation of underwater noise.  While most existing measurements and theoretical models have been  for water, the proposed experiments will make use of liquid  helium, whose high purity and ability to be precisely and  accurately controlled over a wide range of parameters make in  uniquely suited for quantitatively testing current fluid dynamics  theories. Drops will be made to collide with the bulk liquid  interface, and the rapidly changing stress field occurring at the  interface rupture will radiate sound waves which will be detected  with a temporal resolution of 10 ns, approaching rupture time  scales at the molecular level. The research program will provide  unique training opportunities for graduate students in methods of  acoustics, an area often overlooked in contemporary physics, and  involving special, often-subtle experimental methods. This is a  fundamental project but the results are potentially relevant to a  range of practical situations including industrial processes  involving foams and emulsions, in commercial blenders and  sprayers, application of ultrasound in medicine, generation of  underwater noise by rain, which is important in military and  environmental monitoring, etc.  %%%  This is a low temperature physics research project that makes use  of liquid helium, a highly characterized quantum liquid.
