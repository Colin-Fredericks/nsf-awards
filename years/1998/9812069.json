 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in otolith microchemistry have provided researchers with a powerful means of tracking fish dispersal throughout ontogeny. The approach provides both spatial and temporal information on fish dispersal and movement. While the use of otolith microchemistry for reconstructing environmental histories of marine fishes is well recognized and reported, the fundamental question, whether fish otoliths can function as `faithful environmental chronometers?` remains largely untested. This project tests the hypothesis that otolith strontium is reflective of changing salinities during the early ontogeny of estuarine and marine fishes. The hypothesis will be evaluated in the Chesapeake Bay because this system contains extreme ranges in environmental gradients. The research will rigorously test the hypothesis that otolith strontium is reflective of salinity in both laboratory and field environments. The approach will be three-tiered, including: 1) retrospective elemental assays of otolith strontium of individuals reared under constant and fluctuating schedules of salinity and temperature levels; 2) elemental assays of otolith strontium of wild caught and caged individuals, and the relation otolith strontium to ambient salinity as a means of field verification; and 3) measurement of broad scale (e.g. estuarine ingress and egress) and fine scale (within estuary movements) patterns of dispersal by young of the year (YOY) estuarine fishes in the Chesapeake Bay. Spatial behaviors will be measured for five ecologically important estuarine species with contrasting early life tactics: American eel Anguilla rostrata, American shad Alosa sapidissima, white perch Morone americana, spot Leiostomus xanthurus, and hogchoker Trinectes maculatus. S pecies  specific estimates of accuracy and precision of the Sr:Ca ratio will be used to evaluate whether otolith strontium can measure dispersal along a salinity gradient and hindcast spatial histories of YOY fishes.",
