Polymers carrying only positive or negative charge are  called polyelectrolytes.  The net charge of polyampholytes,  e.g., proteins, is determined by the pH of the aqueous  solution.    Long-range Coulomb interactions are responsible for the rich  behavior of these polymeric systems and for the difficulties  in developing theories to describe them.  While the coherent  picture of polyelectrolytes and their interactions with  surfaces is beginning to emerge, the theoretical description  of polyampholytes is lagging far behind.  In particular,  there is no satisfactory theory of polyampholyte adsorption.  Such a theory is necessary for understanding the details of  interactions of latex particles stabilized by  polyampholytes, adsorption of proteins on cell membranes,  complexation of polyampholytes with polyelectrolytes and  related problems.    In the current research both analytical and numerical models  of polyampholyte adsorption on charged surfaces will be  constructed and solved.  The problems addressed will  include: the adsorption of a single polyampholyte chain,  multi-chain adsorption, and the kinetics of polyampholyte  adsorption.  %%%  Charged polymers have recently attracted much attention due  to their unique properties and their technological  importance as rheology modifiers, dispersing aids,  stabilizers, gelling agents, binders, etc.  Polyampholytes  are polymers carrying both positive and negative charges.
