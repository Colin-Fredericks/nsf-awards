 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute for Environmental Catalysis (IEC) at Northwestern University, directed by Dr. Peter C. Stair, supports an interdisciplinary research program on selective oxidation catalysis in industry and in the environment as well as a wide range of educational activities, including development of instructional materials and training programs for K-12 teachers.  The IEC is supported as an Environmental Molecular Science Institute (EMSI) and jointly funded by the NSF Division of Chemistry, MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and Division of Chemical and Transport Systems, and by the Chemical Sciences Division of the Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Department of Energy.\r\n\r\nThe IEC is organized into four collaborative research groups: molecular science of catalytic oxidation, chemical processing, emissions treatment, and natural environment.  Specific catalytic oxidation processes will be studied in the latter three while the first group will develop and provide tools required to obtain the molecular level information needed by the other groups.  Because of its importance in a broad range of industrial activities, the catalytic oxidation of organic compounds will be emphasized.  Examples of some problems that could be addressed more effectively by improved knowledge of catalysis are:  removal of NOX from combustion exhaust, efficiency of fossil fuel combustion, clean production of many useful chemicals, removal of pollutants from waste water streams, and transformation of pollutants to biodegradable forms.  The Institute is expected to have a major impact on improving process efficiency and reducing chemical waste from industrial processes and to serve as a national resource on environmental catalysis. \r\n\r\nThe 49-member team of investigators includes 21 faculty from four Northwestern departments plus nine researchers from Argonne and Pacific Northwest National Laboratories, and 19 researchers from five (Allied Signal, Dow Chemical, Engelhard, Union Carbide, and UOP) industrial laboratories.  Approximately four postdoctoral fellows, 20 graduate students, and five undergraduates will participate each year.",
