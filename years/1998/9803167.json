The proposal is motivated by recent results on a\r\nremarkable mathematical structure underlying a fundamental problem in\r\nthe study of two-dimensional Stokes flow.  Crowdy and Tanveer have\r\ndevised a new global theoretical approach to the problem of 2D Stokes\r\nflow which resulted in the identification of an infinity of conserved\r\nquantities associated with a large class of exact solutions for a\r\nsimply-connected fluid region, and the discovery of the first-known\r\nexact solutions for doubly-connected fluid regions.  These significant\r\nmathematical results will be developed in various directions.  Of\r\nprimary interest is the important and highly non-trivial question of\r\ngeneralization to three-dimensional Stokes flow.  Preliminary numerical\r\nstudies by Nie and Tanveer have shown that axisymmetric (3D) Stokes\r\nbubble exhibits very similar qualitative behavior to its\r\ntwo-dimensional analogue (e.g. formation of near-cusps and topological\r\nchanges).  The results on two-dimensional Stokes flow will be\r\ngeneralized in various directions.  Exact solutions in regions of\r\nconnectivity greater than two is of great interest.  Moreover,\r\nadditional physical factors will be studied including electrostatic\r\n(electric fields) and thermo-capillary effects.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mathematical problems to be studied are of great physical interest\r\nand application. The solutions serve as useful models in the physical\r\nprocess of viscous sintering. Sintering is a term broadly referring to\r\nthe consolidation of an assemblage of particles in which the mass\r\ntransport is driven by surface tension and there exists a huge\r\nliterature on the subject spanning many disciplines from materials\r\nscience to environmental engineering.  Understanding such sintering\r\nprocesses is very important, for example, in fiber-optic and\r\nopto-electronic technologies.  The study of the boundary evolution of\r\nsmall blobs of viscous fluid in the presence of an electric field is\r\ncrucial for the understanding of ink-jet printing technologies. The\r\nproject also has potential biotechnological relevance -- cells\r\nstructures and membranes are often modelled as (charged) blobs of very\r\nviscous fluid kept together by surface tension forces on the boundary.\r\nThis project will provide an understanding of the mathematics\r\nunderlying these important physical models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
