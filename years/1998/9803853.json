 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803853  Information Theory-Based Measurement of Software Designs is a  research project that is defining and validating a new generation  of software design metrics, based on information theory, which in  turn, will facilitate a new level of cost- effective improvement  to software quality. This project is developing metrics of  cohesion and coupling on abstractions of software that are  created during high-level design, so that quality problems may be  detected early in the life cycle. Since many design abstractions  are represented by graphs, metrics of graph attributes will  likely find broad application. Many traditional software metrics  count features, as if all items were equally important in the  design process. Information theory is an alternative approach  that focuses on the amount of information in an attribute, rather  than a count. This project is establishing a new generation of  information theory-based software design metrics by definition  and empirical validation of metrics for cohesion and coupling.  Collaboration with a large telecommunications equipment  manufacturer is providing the basis for credible case studies,  where the system studied is being developed by a group of  professionals in an industrial environment, and is large enough  to be comparable to other industry projects.***",
