 "awd_abstract_narration": "Survey results in Piedmont Technical College's seven-county service area parallel a national trend: a severe shortage of well-trained microcomputer service technicians. . Employers are eager to here people who can establish and maintain networks, set up and upgrade microcomputers and software, and troubleshoot problems arising from the interaction of hardware, software, and networks, and pay them well (an area average of over $32,000/year). Yet there is no program in the area to systematically train such technicians.    This project will create a 39-credit, three-semester Microcomputer Service Technician Certificate which will efficiently and effectively move students from turn the computer on\" to \"set up, manage, and troubleshoot a network\". The thirteen courses (six new and seven modified) will equip students to: (a) install, configure, and troubleshoot operating systems; (b) install and replace cards, boards, and peripherals; (c) install, upgrade, and troubleshoot applications software; (d) establish, maintain, and upgrade microcomputer networks; (e) diagnose freestanding and networked microcomputer problems using standard diagnostic equipment and software; and (f3 develop and manage internet website.  The coursework building on the capabilities of a 25-station dedicated microcomputer lab, will be highly interactive, with student projects ranging from assembling and disassembling basic rnicrocomputers through creating and operating \"mini-networks\" using multiple network software. The three strands of activity will focus on: microcomputer basics (e.g. operating systems, basic programming, and applications packages); internet basics (both programming and website development); and networking (including LAN service, support, and management). In keeping with the national need, proactive dissemination will target both internal and area audiences and regional and national groups.",
