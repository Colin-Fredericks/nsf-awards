The targeted areas include development of  computational capacity and computer networking for scientists and  engineers at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) and the  University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) and enhancement of research in  peptide-based bioorganic chemistry at Creighton University (CU).   Infrastructure enhancement in these areas builds on strengths of the  participating research universities, is consistent with on-going  program development and strategic plans, and seeks to improve the  state's R&D competitiveness in specifically identified areas.   Infrastructure developments in the three targeted areas will involve  up-grading computational facilities and computer networking  environments at UNL and UNO and obtaining state-of-the-art laboratory  equipment at CU.  Mechanisms, including training and maintenance, to  assist faculty and student researchers in the use of these  improvements will enhance research competitiveness in a broad range of  disciplines that require computational and analytical capabilities.   The infrastructure improvements will greatly enhance the range and  depth of research projects that are not presently possible with the  existing infrastructure. Nebraska EPSCoR will continue to provide  opportunities for planning and development of the state's science and  engineering research capacity as well as assist the Nebraska  Technology Development Corporation in enhancing private sector  interactions and development of SBIR/STTR grant proposals.",
