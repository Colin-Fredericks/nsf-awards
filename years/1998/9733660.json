 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733660  Heineman  This research focuses on novel techniques for designing  software components that provide a mechanism for adapting  their behavior. Traditional approaches to component reuse  are limited in that a component must exactly meet the needs  of an application builder before it can be reused. This  research proposes a new direction by suggesting that  component-based software development will only occur when  application builders can adapt software components to suit  their needs. The first objective is to aid component  designers in designing and implementing highly reusable  components. The language-independent solution proposed by  this research applies equally well to components written in  C, C++, or Java. The second objective is to provide an  architectural description language for specifying  adaptations to individual components as needed for a target  application. The third objective is to construct a design  tool that helps users compose applications from adaptable  components. A fourth objective is to define a reengineering  methodology for retrofitting existing legacy code into  adaptable components. A final objective is to train our  students in designing highly reusable software components  and building applications from software components. This  research will greatly increase the ability to create large,  complex systems from independently implemented software  components.  ***",
