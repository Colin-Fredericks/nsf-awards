 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9810081  Khammash    In recent years, the North American Electric Interconnection has undergone major changes with the advent of a competitive market place, and deregulation.  These changes will impose new requirements on system operation and planning. It is likely that the emergence of open access, and wheeling of power in a competitive market place will drive the need to operate and plan the system at higher levels of loading, leading to further stress on the system.  To a large extent, adequate system dynamic performance will depend on the proper operation and performance of critical controls.  Proper design and robust performance of these controls are essential for the reliable operation of the interconnected power system.  This proposal deal with development of techniques to apply modern robust control methods to design and analyze controls for large scale power systems.    We propose to extend existing methods of robust stability analysis to deal with large scale power system problems.  Specifically we intend to use the Structured Singular Value approach, and develop analytical and numerical techniques to exploit the structural characteristics of large power systems.  We will investigate and develop numerical techniques which are suitable for large scale problems.  The developments would involve issues related to uncertainty characterization and parameter selection, frequency sweeps, state space methods utilizing branch and bound techniques, and efficient techniques for control synthesis.  The methods developed will be applied to realistic test systems obtained from two North American Electric Utilities.",
