Jedlicka, Russ  New Mexico State University    MRI: Development of WISTE: Wireless Indoor Space-Time Environment    The objective is to develop and operate a wireless indoor environment within New Mexico State University's electrical engineering building which is capable of measuring and statistically quantifying the space-time characteristics of the indoor wireless channel.  Such an environment would provide benefit to wireless researchers as well as promote interest among university engineering students.  To the researchers, the experimental results will provide an ability to infer appropriate signal-processing and channel-coding strategies.  The instrumented environment will allow assessment of various hypotheses by providing measurements and models that help researchers better understand the spatial and temporal aspects of the wireless indoor channel.  Measurements and statistical models will be made available to researchers nationwide through the Internet.  This mechanism allows effective and timely dissemination of needed information on wireless communications and networking.  To the university student, the environment will promote the graduate research programs due to the equipment's visible presence within the EE building and its use in both undergraduate and graduate classes.  Furthermore, undergraduate students' participation in performing such experiments will provide hands-on experience for those heading into industry.",
