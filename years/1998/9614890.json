 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614890  Nelson    This project is the third phase of Project INDEPTH (INternational  DEep Profiling of Tibet and the Himalaya), a collaborateve,  multinational, multidisciplinary program to investigate the  lithosphere beneath the Himalaya/Tibet  Plateau collision zone.   Support is provided by NSF (Continental Dynamics Program), the  Chinese National Natural Science Foundation, the Chinese Ministry  of Geology and the DeutschesForschungs Gemneinshaft (Germany).   Project INDEPTH has completed two field Programs in southern Tibet  aimed at elucidating the structure of the lithosphere beneath this  key region.  The first, undertaken in 1992, was a feasibility study  of deep reflection profiling on the high Tibetan Plateau that had  the additional scientific goal of tracking the top of the Indian  plate underthrusting the Himalaya (INDEPTH I).  The second,  undertaken in 1993-94, was a much more substantial program  involving the acquisition of complementary CMP reflection, wide-  angle reflection, broadband earthquake, magnetotelluric, and  surface geological data along a transect (including INDEPTH I)  extending approximately 300 km north of the crest of the Himalaya  (INDEPTH II).    The combined INDEPTH I-II results yeild a refined and exciting new  view of the lithosphere beneath southern Tibet.  They support some  previous hypotheses while necessarily contradicting others.  Among  other things, the INDEPTH data imply that: 1)Indian continental  crust does not extend as a coherent unit in the footwall of the  India-Asia decollement for a significan distance north of the  Tsangpo suture (and may not extend that far); 2) in contrast,  Indian mantle lithosphere in contact with the overlying crust  apparently does extend at least 150 km north of the suture; 3) the  Tsangpo suture is not currently a lithosphere-penetrating  structure, but rather is cut off in the mikkle crust by a younger  feature, and finally, perhaps of greatest global significance; 4)  the new data strongly imply the existence  of a widespread mid-  crustal partial melt layer beneath southern Tibet.  Taken together  the data lead to a model for the current behavior of the southern  Tibetan Plateau lithosphere wherein the Indian continental crust  underthrusting the southern margin of the Plateau partially melts  in the vicinity of the North Himalayan domes, thereby contributing  to a partially molten effectively fluid, mid-crustal layer that  underlies the Plateau to the north.  These results have important  implications for how the Himalaya/Tibetan Plateau as a whole has  evolved, and for our concepts of lithosphere formation and  modification during continent-continent collisions in general.    The purpose of INDEPTH III is to address three fundamental,  interrelated issues about the nature and evolution of the  lithosphere beneath the region.  These are: 1) What is the  magnitude and mechanism(s) of accommodation of Neogene/Quaternary  deformation within the Tibetan Plateau? 2)Is there an areally  extensive mid-crustal partial melt layer within the Tibetan crust  that has exerted a primary control on the Neogene/Quaternary  structural evolution and present morphology of the Plateau? and 3)  What is the nature and cause of the reported first-order south to  north change in the character of the mantle lithosphere beneath the  Plateau?  The program includes magnetotelluric profiling and  broadband earthquake recording to assess the bulk electrical  resistivity and velocity structure of the crust and upper mantle  beneath the region.  These data will provide primary information on  the presence or absence of seismically attenuating crustal melt  within the interior of the Plateau, and characterize the south-to-  north upper mantle transition beneath the region.  These efforts  will be augmented by a modest controlled-source \"test\", and a  modest field geology program aimed at delineating the geometry of  upper crustal structure, the distribution of Neogene/Quaternary  shortening, and the existence of a mid-crustal brig ht-spot horizon   which, if present, may indicate a mid-crustal partial melt zone.  ***",
