 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation enhancement grant supports a graduate student, Mr. Braimah Apambire, working under the guidance of Dr. John Hess, Research Professor and Executive Director at the Water Resources Center with the University and Community College System of Nevada, to do field research in Ghana.  High levels of fluoride have been identified in the domestic water supplies in the Upper East Region (UER) of Ghana, and dental fluorosis (tooth mottling) is now occurring in children.  But little is known about the origin or concentrations of the fluoride in this region.  This project will combine hydrogeologic information from the UER with geochemical modeling to determine the source and distribution pattern of groundwater fluoride.  Mr. Apambire hypothesizes that:  1) sources of fluoride in the aquifers are florine-bearing minerals contained in the rocks underlying the area; 2) distribution of the fluoride in the aquifers is primarily influenced by the area's geology, the solubility of the mineral fluoride, and concentrations of various fluoride complexes; and 3) distribution of dental fluorosis is primarily a result of elevated concentrations of fluoride in the groundwaters.  Using multivariate statistical techniques, Mr. Apambire will analyze rock and water samples from the UER to determine the mineral sources in the aquifers and the geochemical controls on fluoride distribution.  Dental information on children and young adults from rural communities in the UER will be collected by a senior dental surgeon from the Bolgatanga Hospital, with assistance from Mr. Apambire and others.  This information will also be analyzed to identify correlations between the dental status of the different age and gender groups and the fluoride concentration levels in the groundwater.  Staff members in the Department of Geology at the University of Ghana and the dental unit at Bolgatanga Hospital will collaborate with Mr. Apambire on this project.\r\n\r\nThe results of this study will increase the knowledge about the geochemical origin of fluoride and the distribution patterns of groundwater fluoride.  The new information will be a valuable resource for policy makers, water resource managers, and dental health educators.  Additionally the grant will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong, independent research career.\r\n\r\nms and the Division of Earth Sciences are jointly providing funding for this project.\r\n",
