 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Ken Leopold of the   University of Minnesota-Twin Cities Campus in his Fourier-transform   microwave (FTMW) spectroscopic studies of the structural and electronic   properties of Lewis acid-base complexes.  In these studies, he will focus   on complexes in which the donor-acceptor bond is only partially formed,   i.e., a bonding regime intermediate between van der Waals and chemical   interactions. In previous work, Prof. Leopold observed that gas phase   species which lie in the intermediate regime between van der Waals and   chemical bonding undergo enormous changes in structure upon   crystallization.   In these studies, he will (1) extend this work to a   wider number of complexes to investigate the effects of Lewis acidity and   basicity on the nature of the donor-acceptor bond, (2) measure dipole   moments of partially bonded molecules, and (3) characterize larger   clusters containing a partially bonded unit.    Partially bonded species are important in a variety of areas of   chemistry.  One of the most interesting aspects of partially bound   systems is their hypersensitivity to a surrounding medium.  The   phenomenon is most apparent when comparing gas phase species with their   crystalline analogues.  These studies will provide an experimentally   grounded complement for a growing body of theoretical work aimed at   further understanding the nature of the electron pair donor-acceptor   bond.",
