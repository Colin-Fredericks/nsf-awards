Sex differences and estrous cycle changes in hippocampal  information processing: Relating learning to hippocampal  single unit network representation    The long-term objective of the research is understanding the  neuronal mechanisms that underlie learning and memory  processes; examining the relationship between behavioral  ability and the activity of brain cells.  The focus of the  work is the hippocampus, a brain structure important for  establishing new memories and for navigation.  There is  evidence of sex differences in the hippocampus, and it has  also been shown that there are changes in this brain region  over the course of the female rat's natural estrous cycle.  Male and female rats will be tested on a series of memory  and navigation tasks.  Solving some of the tasks depends of  having an intact hippocampus while the rest are hippocampus  independent (this has been shown by others in experiments  where the hippocampus is removed).  Sex differences in  hippocampal related abilities will be examined; in addition,  the female rat's estrous cycle will be monitored to  investigate whether sex differences found are related to  this natural cycle.  Some of the animals will have  electrodes implanted into their  hippocampus.  This will enable us to monitor the activity of  individual cells in the  hippocampus as the animal performs the different tasks.  The  distinctive aspect of the research lies in combining the  behavioral analysis with the monitoring of the neuronal  activity.  This research will enhance our understanding of  how memories are formed and provide a basis for the  development of therapeutic intervention in cases of memory  dysfunction.",
