Yours,     Nigel       ------------------------------------------------------------------    The large scale geometry of groups and spaces plays a determining role in   the calculation of invariants in C*-algebra theory and topology. The   investigators aim to explore the effect of the geometry and topology of   group boundaries (defined using large scale geometry) on the harmonic   analysis of groups and the determination of their C*-algebra K-theory. The   Baum-Connes conjecture proposes a means of calculating the K-theory of   reduced group C*-algebras which blends group homology with the   representation theory of finite subgroups.  The conjecture, if true, would   have a number of implications in geometry and topology, and a fascinating   circle of ideas is coming into view which links the Baum-Connes conjecture   to aspects of the harmonic analysis of groups and the geometry of group   actions on boundary spaces.  The investigators will attempt to clarify   these relations.  A long term goal is to prove the Baum-Connes conjecture,   and more importantly to understand better its meaning, for classes such as   the hyperbolic groups of Gromov.  More immediate objectives include   clarifying the relationships between existing proofs of partial forms of   the conjecture for these groups, and developing further the connections   between C*-algebra K-theory, manifold theory, and controlled topology.    Although the tools used to investigate it are rather elaborate, the idea   behind large scale geometry is very simple:  ignore the local, small scale   fluctuations in a quantity and concentrate on its large scale, or long   term, behaviour.  By doing so, trends or qualities may become apparent   which are obscured by inconsequential, small scale fluctations.  The   investigators have developed tools to distinguish between different sorts   of multi-dimensi onal, large scale behaviour in geometry.  Somewhat   surprisingly, aside from their intrinsic interest, their tools have found   application in ordinary, small scale geometry.",
