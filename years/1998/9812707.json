The goals for the course are to introduce students to the diversity of biological organisms in Antarctic polar regions and to study unique aspects of biology that permit life in such extreme environments. Long-standing questions in evolution and ecology (such as cold adaptation and food limitation) concerning the biology of Antarctic organisms will be examined through physiological experiments with organisms, studies of isolated cells and tissues, experiments on protein structure and function, and molecular analysis of genetics systems.  Lectures will emphasize physiological, biochemical and molecular biological approaches to understanding the ecology and biological adaptations of Antarctic organisms. Student research projects will follow these interwoven themes. The students will gain a rigorous understanding of the power, but also the limitations of physiological, biochemical and molecular biological methods are they are currently being used to answer research questions  in environmental science and biological adaptation. The course will be held in the Crary Science and Engineering Center, located at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. This modern research facility provides state of the art laboratory facilities within a short distance from the marine and freshwater environments where biological observations and collections of material will be made. The course will be taught as four modules: Biological Diversity of Antarctic Organisms: Evolution and Molecular Phylogeny; Ultraviolet Radiation: Effects on Antarctic Organisms;I nvertebrates: Physiology, Energy Metabolism and Development; and Fish: Biochemical Adapations. The course, which will attract an extremely competitive group of young scientists, will introduce new researchers to Antarctica, and will teach students to use modern research methods to study the mechanisms that are unique to biology in Antarctica.\r\n",
