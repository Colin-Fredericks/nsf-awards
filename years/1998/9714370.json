 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is investigating the issues related to designs and performance  evaluations of several innovative disk I/O architectures. These architectures may  improve the I/O response time by orders of   magnitude over current state-of-the-art disk architectures for office/engineering  workloads.  The focus of the research includes:    * Minimization of disk write times by means of disk caching disk (DCD). This is  a technique of using a small disk to cache writes sequentially, as in a  log-structured file system, then using the log to update the file   system on the larger disks.    * Using a combination of DRAM and DCD to replace non-volatile RAM caches that are  currently used in RAID systems.    * Using DRAM as a component of the file system to allow fast reads and writes.   In this scheme, a log of files written to RAM will be kept in either NVRAM or on  disk, but only the RAM access will be in the critical   path.    * Upgrading existing file servers to emulate DCD using multiple existing disks.    These architectures will be investigated using simulation to compare them to  existing architectures under a wide range of I/O workloads.  New analytical  models will also be devised and used in evaluation of architectures.  Actual  implementations of the DCD architectures will be carried out using disk  partitions as caches on the computers in the department.  Performance  measurements will be performed on the DCD implementations and used to compare  with existing disk architectures.",
