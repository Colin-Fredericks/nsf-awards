The research  will address long-standing questions on electron  correlations in high temperature superconductors.  Intense  theoretical effort to understand these materials has been  hampered by the lack of effective computational algorithms.  Such algorithms are essential in order to solve model  systems to compare with experiment and guide the selection  of analytic approximations.  Among such model systems the  Hubbard model, believed to contain the gross features of  electron correlations in high temperature superconductors,  has received an unprecedented level of attention.  Yet many  basic questions remain open on its properties.  By  developing new algorithms for scalable high-performance  computing, we will perform accurate computations of electron  correlations in this and related models.    The objective in education is to incorporate computing into  the curriculum in a seamless way.  High-performance  computing impacts more than research and presents enormous  opportunities.  To fully take advantage, students must be  adequately prepared with skills in computation.  By  curriculum development, outreach and mentoring, and cross-  disciplinary collaboration, the gap in computational science  in the William and Mary curriculum will be filled and  students will be involved in state-of-the-art computational  physics research.  %%%   This is a CAREER award which integrates research and  education in computational materials physics.
