 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a collaborative team of five  institutions-Hofstra University, New York Institute of  Technology, the Uniondale Union Free School District, the  Hempstead Union Free School District, and Citizens  Environmental Research Institute.  The project targets (1)  seventh and eighth grade girls; (2) girls of color; and (3)  low income girls in an effort to increase the number of  girls who participate in mathematics and science activities.  The project seeks to develop female friendly classroom  practices and science and mathematics curriculum and to  place that curriculum within the formal structure of the  district instructional requirements.  Three hundred girls,  three hundred boys, 200 parents, and 30  teachers/administrators will be served.  Project  deliverables will be suitable for use nationwide.    The strategies to improve attitudes toward and participation  in mathematics and science activities by girls include:  (1)  a core project on environmental social justice encompassing  the issues and data from the communities in which the girls  live; (2) integration of the project into the seventh and  eighth grade core science curriculum of the schools; (3)  development of the project so that it responds directly to  The Learning Standards for the New York State Mathematics,  Science and Technology Frameworks; (4) combination of single  sex and coeducational classroom, summer, Saturday, and after  school experiences; (5) development of CD ROM and other  instructional materials as models for 7th and 8th grade  instruction in New York State and the nation; (6) training  of teachers and parents in the curriculum materials, in  gender and learning issues, and in the objectives of the  program; (7) development of a seventh and eighth grade  science curriculum that is gender fair, encourages girls and  children of color to pursue science and mathematics and that  can be used with all children to satisfy New York State  Learning Standards for Mathematics, Science, and Technology;  (8) inv olvement of teachers in the humanities and the  arts-in addition to science, math and technology-to further  the goals of the project; and addition of computer  technology and learning in the classroom experience and in  teacher skills.    In addition, the project staff includes specialists in all  targeted areas.  The project will be led and staffed by  female school district and university personnel with  expertise in environmental justice, science instruction in  the middle school, gender issues in science, adolescent  female development, minority science participation,  classroom curriculum, biology, chemistry, mathematics,  social science, computer science, and environmental science.",
