 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the need to upgrade the controllers of two stiff testing machines which were based on a 286 computer and became obsolete due to changes in computer hardware and software.  Additionally, the lack of manual overrides in the controller does not allow for operation of these machines manually.  Both machines will be retrofit with modern controllers, composed of state of the art computers and software, as well as install manual controls.  The structural and hydraulic components of the stiff testing machines remain unchanged and will allow for at least another 20 years of research and instructional use with these upgrades.  Both machines, which are basic tools in rock mechanics, have been heavily used in research, graduate instruction, and undergraduate instruction since their acquisition ten years ago.  The rock mechanics laboratory at the University of Kentucky is a regional center of excellence, and plays an important role for the College of Engineering, the Department of Mining Engineering, and the large mining industry in the state.",
