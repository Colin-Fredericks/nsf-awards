 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project's goal is to study the impact of the new capabilities of high-speed networks on the design and performance of data management protocols. In particular, the focus is on high-speed wide-area networks (WANs) where the propagation latency is the dominant communication cost, the migration of large amounts of data is not an issue, and efficient multicasting and guarantees on network Quality of Service (QoS) parameters are available. In this project, existing concurrency control, commit and recovery protocols are being evaluated with respect to performance scalability under the new network assumptions. Further, new protocols are being developed that utilize the huge bandwidth and minimize the number of sequential phases of messages exploiting the multicasting capability and the provision of QoS guarantees such as bounded end-to-end packet delay and packet loss. At the same time, because of the need to scale to thousands of clients and servers, not all of which may be operational at any given time, the new WAN data management protocols are designed to achieve higher site autonomy in a cooperative manner, reducing global synchronization and supporting disconnected operations. The various protocols are empirically evaluated using computer simulation under different scenarios. The results of this research are expected to provide a better insight into the synergy between database and network technologies. This, in turn, will facilitate the deployment of future high performance WAN data server systems which are part of the necessary infrastructure that will support important nation- and world-wide applications such as electronic commerce and other web-based applications. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.cs.pitt.edu/admt/projects/wands.html\r\n",
