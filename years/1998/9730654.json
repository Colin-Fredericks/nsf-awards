This grant renews support for the six CEME seminars in Bayesian Inference, Time Series, Forecasting, Microeconometrics, Decentralization, and General Equilibrium.   The purpose of this ongoing conference series is to stimulate discussion and research on the frontiers of econometric and economic theory, and to investigate the application of mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques to empirical economic studies.  It is intended to both encourage research on new topics and speed the dissemination of the latest findings by leading scholars.  To this end, these meetings have been exceptionally successful, providing forums for the exchange of ideas in economic theory and methods which are not constrained by more formal frameworks of journal publication.  The informal channels of communication opened by affording specialists in selected topic areas to meet regularly at widely dispersed institutions and for longer periods than is generally possible at meetings of professional society has been especially fruitful, particularly for young scholars at the beginning of their professional careers.  Since its inception, seminar groups have produced hundreds of working papers, books, and articles in professional journals, which have been broadly circulated, making the contents of the seminars more broadly available.  A number of collections of papers presented at CEME meetings have been published in special issues of professional journals.          ??",
