By virtue of their structural relationship to the  purely organic polyolefins and such inorganic polymers as the  polysilanes, polysiloxanes and polyphosphazenes, these hybrid  inorganic/organic backbone polymers provide a unique opportunity  to examine the effects of the polymer backbone on the structure  and properties of linear polymers with structure-directing groups  or side chains.  This study will employ synthesis methods  recently developed in the PI's laboratory to prepare a senes of  monosubstituted and symmetrically disubstituted polymers having  fluorine, cyano, n-alkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, and mesogenic side  chain substituents.  Preliminary work on some of these polymers  indicates the existence of novel structural transitions and  properties.  Prior work on related hybrid polymers provide  directions for future synthesis efforts that seem likely to yield  new polymers with interesting behavior. These polymers will be  examined by a wide range of characterization methods, including x-  ray diffraction, optical microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance  and differential scanning calorimetry.  The structures and  properties of the PSMs will be compared with those of the related  organic and inorganic backbone polymers.  Molecular modeling  methods will also be employed for selected polymers in an effort  to provide an understanding of the observed structures and  properties and the role of the polymer backbone in determining  their behavior.  %%%  In addition to a better fundamental understanding of structure-  property relationships in polymeric materials this study may lead  to new functional polymers that may be useful as NLO, electro-  optic, and piezoelectric materials in devices for optical storage  and processing.  ***",
