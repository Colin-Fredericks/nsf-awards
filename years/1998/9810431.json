 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9810431    Project summary    The Antarctic Deep Freeze Association, Inc., with independent historian Dian O. Belanger will produce a two-part study that will document and preserve the history of one of the most important and fruitful periods of human activity in the Antarctic.  The historian will conduct oral history interviews with veterans of Operations Deep Freeze I and Deep Freeze II, the military and civilian pioneers who helped plan and implement the most comprehensive construction program ever attempted on the polar continent.  The 35 to 40 interviews with selected individuals will be professionally researched, prepared, and conducted on audio tape.  The tapes will be transcribed, soft-bound, indexed, and deposited in up to four repositories for preservation and use.    Complementing the oral histories, and relying significantly on them as resources for a primary theme-that of developing a workable infrastructure for polar scientific investigation-the historian will write a history of the U.S. presence in Antarctica from the post-World War II period through the formulation of the Antarctic Treaty of 1959.  During this crucial time the United States asserted itself on the continent by mapping vast areas, constructing seven widely scattered facilities to support or conduct scientific research, participating in the huge antarctic research program of the International Geophysical Year, and leading efforts to formalize continuing peaceful, cooperative activity through the Antarctic Treaty, which went into force in 1961.     This publishable manuscript of 200 to 250 pages will build from works such as Bertrand's Americans in Antarctica, 1775-1948 and provide a basis for further historical investigation of this singular environment.  Written in a lively, engaging style, using the participants' own words as possible, the book will adhere to established standards of professional historical scholarship.  These histories will be a resource for historians, scientists, civilian and military poli cy makers, and the public.  ***",
