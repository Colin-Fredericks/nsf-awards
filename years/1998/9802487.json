Schoen, of\r\nvariational problems for lagrangian submanifolds: Let M be a\r\nsymplectic 2n-manifold equipped with a compatible metric.  Given a\r\nhomology class in M that can be represented by an immersed lagrangian\r\nsubmanifold, find a lagrangian that minimizes volume among all\r\nlagrangians that represent this homology class.  The minimizer is\r\nknown to exist as a lagrangian rectifiable varifold, so the focus of\r\nour research is on the regularity of these minimizers.  When the\r\nambient manifold M is Kaehler-Einstein it may be possible to show that\r\nthe lagrangian minimizers are stationary, in the classical sense.  We\r\nhope to develop a good regularity theory of lagrangian minimizers and\r\nthen to use these minimizers to study the geometry of the ambient\r\nKaehler or symplectic manifolds.\r\n\r\nMany problems in physics and mathematics have solutions that are \r\nobtained via an optimization procedure.  In this project we will study \r\na minimizing procedure in differential geometry.  We minimize volume \r\namong generalized surfaces (immersed submanifolds) that satisfy a \r\ngeometric constraint (that are lagrangian).  Because we require our \r\ngeneralized surfaces to satisfy this constraint many new difficulties \r\narise.  However our solutions often have interesting and important \r\ngeometric properties.  This problem has many features in common with \r\nproblems in nonlinear elasticity.  It is hoped that our techniques \r\nwill be of use in that subject.  However it should be emphasized that \r\noptimization procedures in the presence of geometric constraints have \r\nnot been studied before.  This idea will eventually be useful in many \r\ndifferent contexts.\r\n",
