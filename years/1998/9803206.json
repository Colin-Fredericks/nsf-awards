Meeks III    The general goal of this research proposal is to get a deeper  understanding of the global geometry of surfaces in three-dimensional  Euclidean space.  One goal is to understand the topology, asymptotic  geometry and conformal structure of properly embedded minimal  surfaces.  A second important goal is to apply these results to  understand the convergence of bounded genus minimal surfaces in  three-manifolds.    The field of minimal surfaces has its roots based on geometric studies  by the major mathematicians of the previous century.  However, the new  analytic and geometric techniques developed in the past twenty years  have made the theory of minimal surfaces an essential research tool in  other fields.  These fields include Topology, Algebraic Geometry,  geometry of black holes and elementary particle Physics.  I propose to  characterize how these infinite surfaces behave geometrically and to  classify them.  Recently certain examples of these surfaces were used  to model interfaces in coblock polymers and one of my classification  results shows that these are the only possible examples.  The primary  goal of this proposal is to prove some beautiful conjectures  concerning these surfaces, whose solutions will have important  applications to other parts of Mathematics and Science.",
