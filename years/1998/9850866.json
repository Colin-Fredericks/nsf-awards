 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project entails the development of a geographic information systems (GIS) laboratory with at least 8 personal computers, a dedicated server, and 1 graphics workstation. This laboratory will be used to teach undergraduate students the principles of geographic analysis, computer cartography, remote sensing, and geographic information systems as well as provide hands-on experience in research methods in the social and natural sciences.     At present, faculty teach courses in GIS, computer cartography, and remote sensing using personal computers in laboratories shared with the rest of the University community.  The requested equipment is necessary to efficiently run state of the art GIS software currently available across the University, and to support and efficiently manage improved instruction in a newly revised Geography curriculum.      A dedicated GIS laboratory will be established within the Department of Geography.  It will offer opportunities to students in a variety of human and natural science disciplines across the campus.  This project will also allow the enhancement of faculty and undergraduate research at DePaul, and will contribute to the University's missions of public service to a diverse urban community.",
