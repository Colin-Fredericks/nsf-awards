A critical need has been documented through teacher and school survey of the need to bring about reform in science instruction at the middle school levels (i.e., 6-8).  A teacher leadership project will be planned to provide teacher leaders in Washington, DC public schools that will assist in working with science teachers, mentoring them, assisting and directing inservice workshops, and facilitating change using classroom change models.\r\n\r\nThe planning process builds upon preliminary work already completed.  By bringing together all stakeholders in the DC publci schools, including representatives of other funded science programs at the elementary level, a comprehensive vertical alignment of teaching strategies and science curriculum implementation will be developed and established to begin to bring about major change in the Washington, DC public Schools' science program. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
