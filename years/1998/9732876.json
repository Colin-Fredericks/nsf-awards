The proposers have  established striking progress in these areas, and propose here to develop  systematically an effective theoretical and computational methodology for their  study.  The central intellectual challenge in the study of layers and fronts  involves the complex interactions of physical processes with disparate length  scales.  The length scales of key microscopic processes within a layer are  typically orders of magnitude smaller than those of the ambient fluid in which  the layer is embedded, yet they may have a profound effect on the macroscopic  structure of the fluid flow.  For this reason, direct numerical simulation  requires special algorithms to resolve the important layer microstructure  accurately with reasonable computational resources.  The theoretical challenge  is two-fold, as the problem requires scale-up techniques to understand the  effects of the microscopic processes at the macroscopic level, and then methods  to express the nonlinear coupling of distinct physical processes operating on  comparable length scales.  While the study of layers and fronts is at least a  two-scale problem, the interest here is in practical applications, which  usually involve multiple length scales within a layer.  This project will  provide (a) the theoretical and algorithmic basis for a new class of production  codes for the simulation of complex fluid flow and solid deformation; (b) the  theoretical basis for understanding turbulent multiphase flow and fluid mixing;  (c) validation of turbulence and mixing models, through exploration of  parameter regimes in highly resolved simulations that are in step with physical  experiment; and (d) a new mathematical theory for the interaction of nonlinear  hyperbolic waves, including an understanding of phenomena which can in some  cases prevent or overcome the poor perform ance of simulation codes.    When the surface of contact between two distinct materials is unstable, small  random disturbances on the surface will develop into interpenetrating  structures, such as fingers, jets, droplets, and bubbles.  These structures are  complex and chaotic, and together they comprise a \"mixing layer.\"  Mixing  layers are of fundamental importance in natural phenomena such as supernova  explosions, and in technological applications such as inertial confinement  fusion (ICF), where they are known to be a major limiting factor in the  performance of ICF capsules.  Typically a mixing layer is embedded in a  large-scale fluid or solid flow, and in this case the precise resolution of a  mixing layer by computer simulation is impractical (if not impossible) if the  computer code is to be used to make quantitative predictions on a regular  basis.  For this reason, a scientific theory is required to capture the  unresolvable microstructure of mixing layers in a macroscopic framework which  is amenable to computer simulation.  The goal of this project is to develop  such a theory and to demonstrate its validity by comparison with computer  simulation and physical experiment.  This work will require new ideas, as  described in this proposal, and will contribute to the fundamental knowledge  base of science, of significance to a broad range of scientific phenomena.",
