 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800885  Strauss  Plant traits that affect herbivory are usually studies without considering effects on pollination, or vice versa. This may result in an incomplete understanding of selection on these traits. Two species of Castilleja hemiparasites, which can obtain alkaloids from Lupinus host plants, will be used to test whether chemical defense against herbivores also deters pollinators. Castilleja species will be grown with either low-alkaloid or high-alkaloid varieties of conspecific lupines to test the consequences of alkaloid uptake on herbivory and pollination. Preliminary data support the hypothesis that these is an ecological tradeoff between herbivore defense and pollinator attraction. If such a tradeoff exists, it suggests new possibilities for constraints on the development of chemical defenses. The proposed research integrates chemical ecology at the whole plant level, advances basic knowledge of the ecology of parasitic plants, and develops a new methods to assess consequences of novel defensive chemicals in vivo. The concept that plant-animal interactions may be constrained by multiple selection pressures has broad applications in both natural and agricultural systems.",
