 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Society for American Archaeology provides an annual Arthur C. Parker Scholarship which permits Native American and Native Hawaiian students to obtain training in archaeological methods. Applications are solicited and a review panel selects individuals who, in 1998, will participate in summer field training programs. The Society has sufficient funds to permit one award. This National Science Foundation grant will enable an additional two students to participate in this program. MS Norrie Judd who is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park's museum collection will attend a Collections Care and Maintenance Training Program taught by the University of Missouri-Kansas City's Continuing Education Division. MS Meredith Laine Vasta, a graduate student in Anthropology at the University of Connecticut will attend Hunter College's archaeological field school in Iceland to obtain advanced and specialized training in the analysis of faunal remains.  While much of American archaeology focuses on Native American prehistory, very few Native Americans themselves are involved, at a professional level, in this research. The Parker Foundation fellowships attempt to remedy this situation.",
