In the current proposal, the two PI s, one senior and one a  recent Ph.D. will be joined by several undergraduates in a  joint project that will combine the glassmaking and property  characterization capabilities of the Coe College group with  the expertise in nonlinear optics resident in Dr. Wang  Wencheng's group in the Laser Physics and Optics Lab at  Fudan University, Shanghai.  The main scientific goal is to  investigate the second-order nonlinear optical properties of  poled bismuth and lead borate and silicate glasses.  Most of  the manufacturing and measurement work at Coe will be  carried out by undergraduate students.  Sharing of  facilities and expertise is at the core of the proposal.  The glassmaking equipment and knowledge necessary for the  project is unavailable at Fudan University, while the Coe  College group has a long tradition of manufacturing novel  glasses at extreme compositional limits.  On the other hand,  the group at Fudan is internationally recognized for their  expertise in nonlinear optics, which is lacking at Coe.  Support on the Chinese side will be provided by the National  Natural Science Foundation of China.",
