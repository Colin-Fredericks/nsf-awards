 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zera  9808249    One of the most important differences among species is  variation in life history traits, such as longevity, the age  at which reproduction begins and dispersal capability.  Almost nothing is known about the biochemical-genetic basis  of life history variation within species, which provides the  raw material for the evolution of these traits.  This study  constitutes the first detailed investigation of this issue  and will use wing polymorphism as a model.  The polymorphism  is common in insects and consists of a long-winged (LW) form  which is capable of flight but which delays reproduction,  and a short-winged (SW), flightless form which reproduces  early in adulthood.  The LW form produces large quantities  of lipid flight fuel which reduces egg production relative  to levels found in SW females.  This study will identify the  features of lipid metabolism which differ between the wing  morphs and which account for both the greater amounts of  lipid and the reduced egg production in LW females.  Rates  of lipid biosynthesis and catabolism and the enzymes  involved in these processes will be compared between  genetically determined LW vs. SW individuals.  In addition,  the biochemical and hormonal mechanisms by which increased  lipid accumulation causes decreased egg production in the LW  form will also be investigated.  This study will contribute  importantly to our understanding of the biochemical genetic  mechanisms responsible for the evolution of life history  traits.",
