Stockbridge\r\n\t    University of Kentucky\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nIn recent years the importance of stochastic analysis and stochastic\r\ncontrol theory in financial applications has become apparent.  The best\r\nknown example is the Black-Scholes option pricing formula which has\r\nspawned a $15 trillion industry in options trading.  The significance\r\nof this connection is demonstrated by the work of the 1997 recipients\r\nof the Nobel Prize in Economics, Professors Robert Merton and Myron\r\nScholes.  One of the crucial assumptions which underlies the theory of\r\nBlack, Merton, and Scholes is that full information is available about\r\nthe markets.  Markets for which this is true are known as complete\r\nmarkets.  Current research concentrates on incomplete markets.\r\nIncompleteness of the markets corresponds to partial observations in\r\nstochastic control theory.  Recent advances in the theory and numerical\r\napproaches for these type of problems make it desirable to bring\r\ntogether leading specialists from academia and research groups of\r\nfinancial institutions.  This is even more imperative since very often\r\nin the past efforts within academia have been expended on finding\r\nhighly technical answers to the wrong questions.  This conference will\r\ninclude practitioners who are well-acquainted with the sophisticated\r\nmathematics used in mathematical finance to present to the academicians\r\nthe real issues and problems of interest to the financial industry.\r\n",
