 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to advance our understanding of the relationship between spatial language and spatial cognition, specifically by asking how non-linguistic spatial cognition supports the fundamental human capacity to talk about space.  Modern theories of cognition and cognitive development assume that language reflects thought, and that  understanding of space is critical in supporting the ability to talk about objects, their spatial relationships, and their motions through space. However, we have only a very limited understanding of how these two cognitive systems interact as knowledge of space is translated into language and vice versa.  Our research seeks to delineate more fully the nature of the interactions, by asking what elements of non-linguistic spatial cognition are necessary for the acquisition and use of spatial language, and how changes in spatial cognition affect the ability to talk about space.  We examine these interactions by studying the emergence of spatial cognition and spatial language among children and adults with Williams Syndrome (WS), an unusual genetic defect in which spatial cognition appears to be severely impaired but language is generally unimpaired.  By understanding how spatial language emerges in the absence of normal non-linguistic spatial cognition, we will be better able to understand the nature of normal human cognitive architecture that permits accurate translation between the two cognitive systems as well as the circumstances under which such translation may be compromised.  These issues will be addressed in two sets of experiments that examine the architecture of the spatial cognitive system and the nature of spatial language among WS individuals and normally developing individuals. Studies of spatial cognition include examination of how individuals solve complex spatial construction tasks, how they represent and remember objects and locations, and how they navigate through space to locate objects.  Studies of spatial language include examination of how individuals talk about objects (using nouns), motions (using verbs), and paths and locations (using spatial prepositions).  Comparison of performance on linguistic and non-linguistic spatial tasks will advance our understanding of how language typically encodes our spatial experience, and the circumstances under which such encoding may break down.",
