The spherical maximal function arises in the solution to the 3-dimensional wave equation, and its variants play a role in understanding more general hyperbolic equations. The PI will continue to investigate L^p inequalities for maximal operators over convex surfaces, especially in the range p < 2, with attention to the related problems of multiparameter variants and L^p-improving convolution operators. He will build on the recent success in understanding regularity for the oblique derivative problem by applying the techniques used there to even more degenerate boundary value problems, both linear and nonlinear. Harnack's inequality and Holder regularity extend to a large class of equations with rough coefficients in the presence of ellipticity, the permitted roughness being essential in applications to nonlinear problems. Sawyer will attempt to obtain sharp estimates in terms of the eigenvalues of the degenerate operator when ellipticity is relaxed, in order that Holder regularity of solutions follows. Applications to the Monge-Ampere equation will also be considered.\r\n\r\nPartial differential equations (PDEs) are used to model physical processes, often in an \"idealized\" way, but this very simplification usually leads to a better understanding of the role played by the various complex factors involved. Harmonic analysis is, roughly speaking, the breakdown of data into simple components which are easily analyzed under the processes being investigated. Analyzing existence, uniqueness, regularity and growth of solutions to PDEs through harmonic analysis has led to increased understanding of wave processes such as optics and electromagnetism, and more theoretical topics related to quantum mechanics. The study of averages related to PDEs has application to tomography as well as to theoretical aspects of solutions.\r\n",
