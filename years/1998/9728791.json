 "awd_abstract_narration": "Normal  locomotion in vertebrates and anlaropods is  a  complex  behavior,  and  the  neural mechanisms that coordinate  their  limbs  during  locomotion  are  not  known  with  any  certainty.  Rhythmic  movements  of the swimmerets of crayfish are known to be coordinated  by  neural networks in their segmental ganglia, and the analysis  of  the intersegmental circuit that coordinates movements of neighboring  swimmerets  holds  promise of new insights  into  neural  mechanisms  controlling  locomotion.  This proposal  presents  new  ideas  about  intersegmental  coordination in the swimmeret system.  These  follow  the  recent demonstration that an older hypothesis, which postulated  an  increased  excitability  of  local  circuits  in  segments  that  normally  lead each cycle of movements, was incorrect;  these  local  circuits   do  not  differ  in  their  excitability.  Instead,   the  intersegmental   circuit  that  coordinates   them   is   polarized.  Preliminary  physiological results show that axons of ascending  and  descending coordinating interneurons can be isolated separately,  so  the  predictions of the coupled-oscillator model will be  tested  by  selectively  interrupting these axons and comparing  the  system'  s  subsequent  performance  with  the  prediction.  The  proposal  also  presents  a new cellular model of the coordinating circuit  that  is  based  on  published descriptions of individual coordinating  units.  The  cellular model was developed by testing the performance of many  alternative  patterns of connections with components  of  the  local  circuits in each ganglion that coordinating interneurons might make.  To  test this new model, its responses to non-uniform excitation  of  local  circuits  will  be  compared with  the  swimmeret  system'  s  responses to non-uniform excitation of individual ganglia.  To  test  the  cellular model' s predictions, the neurons that are targets  of  individual    coordinating    interneurons    will     be     ma pped  electrophysiologically. In experimental preparations, firing of each  interneuron will be perturbed with injected currents. The system'  s  response  to these perturbations will be measured and compared  with  simulations of the same perturbations in the model.",
