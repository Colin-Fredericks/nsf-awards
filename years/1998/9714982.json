 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714982  Dibb     Cosmogenic isotopes represent a largely untapped source of information on transport within the stratosphere and exchange between the stratosphere and troposphere.  The Be-10 and Be-7 (beryllium) pair of isotopes is particularly useful as tracers because their sources are known, they are basically non-reactive, and their greatly different half-lives makes their ratio a useful clock over time scales of months to several years.     The principal investigator and researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) have compiled the small set of data that exist on these isotopes and their ratio.  They will increase the data base by nearly an order of magnitude by measuring and analyzing samples taken during several recent airborne sampling campaigns.  Latitudinally, the samples range from more than 70(N to 70(S, from both the lower stratosphere and the upper troposphere.  In addition, during the campaigns measurements were obtained of a variety of other tracers such as ozone, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor.  These data will be compared with the beryllium isotopes results data.  Dr. Dibb also will work with LLNL scientists who plan to simulate the transport and exchange processes of the stratosphere.  The observational data will serve as constraints for model simulations of transports in these regions.",
