The principal objective in organizing this symposium is to promulgate the science and engineering of nonlinear optical polymers (NLOP) which has emerged as an important and exciting area of research.  This symposium is designed to bring together engineers chemists and optical scientists to discuss polymer science and engineering capabilities and photonic device requirements so that their combined efforts will lead to new advances.  Schedule topics include NLO theory, optical characterization techniques, physics of glassy polymers, thin film waveguide fabrication and promising applications which will provide the researchers with a solid basis from which they may direct their research programs.  ***",
