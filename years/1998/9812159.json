 "awd_abstract_narration": "9812159 Alleman This is a project to conduct laboratory based research on the potential use of thermophilic aerobic biological processes for treatment of high strength industrial wastewaters as measured by their chemical oxygen demand.  The research involves obtaining fundamental information on performance characteristics of the processes with respect to their steady-state operation and alternative procedures to counteract the expected poor settling characteristics of the resultant biomass.  The research will be conducted using a synthetic deicing fluid as representative of the type of wastewater for which the proposed process is likely to be considered as an alternative to anaerobic microbial processes.    \r\n\r\nResults of this project are expected to provide engineering design criteria for a thermophilic aerobic treatment process to reduce the pollutional impact of high strength, biodegradable industrial wastewater streams.  These criteria are expected to include guidelines for suitable operating regimes and reliable performance characteristics with which industries can develop integrated treatment systems for addressing point-source process wastewater streams of pollutants as well as pollutants from diffuse sources.\r\n",
