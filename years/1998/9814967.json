 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two synergistic sets of activities are proposed.  The first activity is a series of case studies that document four models for spreading a coherent, inquiry-based approach to elementary science.  Two models in the U.S. will be nominated by well known U.S. science educators, researchers and policy makers.  Two models will be Japanese, selected in order to study conditions not readily available for study in the U.S.  (E.g. lesson based professional development).  Using a research approach that documents each model's \"theory of action,\"  the case studies will focus on the 1) goals, assumptions, and intervention method and 2) site and system characteristics as they provide supports or barriers to each approach.  (E.g. local, state and national policies, assessments, governance structures, standards).\r\n\r\nThe second strand of activities seeks to develop and test, from the case studies, brief written materials and video examples designed to build understanding of coherent, inquiry-based science instruction and of the systemic features that support it.  \r\n\r\nExpected outcomes include 1) increased documentation and understanding of models for the spread of coherent, inquiry-based science instruction and of the supports and barriers encountered by these models; 2) creation of video and written resources that communicate the nature of such science instruction and the inventions and policies that support it 3) increased knowledge of the important strategic audience, venues, and communication methods for supporting the spread of coherent inquiry based science instruction; and 4) examples of potential system supports.\r\n",
