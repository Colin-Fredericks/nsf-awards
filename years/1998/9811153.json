In order to arrive at a \r\nthorough understanding of this phenomenon, and to formulate and calibrate \r\nanalytical techniques to predict the occurrence of liquefaction and its \r\neffects, data has to be measured at instrumented sites where the in-place \r\nsoil properties have been appropriately established, and where ground \r\nmotions have been recorded for an earthquake strong enough to have \r\ngenerated significant increases in the pore-water pressures. Several sites \r\naround the world (e.g., Treasure Island in California) are instrumented \r\nwith accelerometers and pore pressure transducers . The pore pressures \r\nrecorded at the Wildlife liquefaction site in California during the 1987 \r\nImperial Valley earthquake, and subsequent investigations into the in-situ \r\ndynamic behavior of pore pressure transducers, demonstrated the need to \r\ndevelop a reliable pore pressure transducer design.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this research program are: (1) to refine and improve the \r\ndesign and construction of a piezometer recently developed at the \r\nCalifornia Institute of Technology (known as the \"Caltech\" piezometer); (2) \r\nto refine the piezometer field installation and in-situ calibration \r\nmethods, (3) to provide standard methods and guidelines defining the \r\nminimum requirements for the design, preparation, installation, and \r\nfollow-up in-situ calibration and maintenance of piezometers; and (4) study \r\nthe correlation between pore pressures generated in a saturated granular \r\nsoil and the liquefaction potential.\r\n\r\nFollowing successful testing, two prototype piezometers will be \r\nconstructed and installed at the Treasure Island National Geotechnical \r\nExperimentation Site, close to the existing pore pressure transducers, to \r\nprovide (1) additional instrumentation, and (2) a direct performance\r\ncomparison during future earthquake shaking of the \"Caltech\" transducer and \r\nthe existing transducers.\r\n\r\nThis project is being coordinated with a complementary research program \r\nheaded by Prof. Pedro de Alba at the University of New Hampshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
