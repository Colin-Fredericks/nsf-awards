An important component that has been missing from image synthesis is the effect of weathering.  Existing models of materials in computer graphics assume that the materials are in pristine condition, which is rarely the case.  This research program focuses on the development of computer graphics models for   materials, which will be suitable for the requirements of image synthesis. The research will address three critical aspects of this problem: (1) Taxonomy of materials --a study of a variety of materials will be conducted in order to devise a classification of materials that is specific to computer graphics. (2) Models for materials -- new material models will be developed, which will be capable of sustaining a range of appearances. (3) Assemblies of objects and materials -- data structures will be devised to handle intricate assemblies of complex geometries and materials.  The postdoctoral associate will play a key role in the formative stages of the development of the new computer graphics research group at MIT.  The associate will bring expertise in modeling and texturing, will collaborate with faculty on research projects, and will provide leadership for student research.",
