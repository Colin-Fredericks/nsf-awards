 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733030  Brenner    This work is supported by a National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career   Development Award.  The research component will focus on an array of problems   applying techniques of nonlinear dynamics to fluid dynamics, acoustics, and   biophysics.  The uniting theme is the mathematics of nonlinear partial   differential equations.  Specific projects include the breaking of fluid drops   as an example of singularity formation in partial differential equations; the   dynamical mechanisms behind electrosprays; a theoretical investigation of single   bubble sonoluminescence, the conversion of acoustic energy into light; and a   study of experiments in bacterial chemotaxis, done in collaboration with   biologists.  The educational component of this activity aims both to improve the   learning environment in applied mathematics at MIT, as well as provide concrete   mechanisms for using teaching opportunities to extend the principal   investigator's research program to new areas.  These are several specific   points:  There will be an initiative to involve undergraduate students in the   research program by carrying out simple experiments to test theories and extend   research directions.  To identify and train undergraduate students for this   research, it is proposed to develop a short course during the Independent   Activities Period on the application of mathematics to physical experiments.    The undergraduate course in basic fluid dynamics will also be revamped.  For   graduate students, several new courses will be developed that describe important   mathematical techniques in the context of current research.  Finally, a special   student seminar series for informal discussion of topics of current research   interest has been established.    The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the early development of   academic faculty as both educators and researchers.  The Faculty Early Career   Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-wide  program that provides for    the support of junior faculty within the context of their overall career   development.  It combines in a single program the support of quality research   and education in the broadest sense and the full participation of those   traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering.  This program   enhances and emphasizes the importance the Foundation places on the development   of full, balanced academic careers which include both research and education.",
