 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sensory processing involves how nerve cells handle a sequence  of signals with particular timing features.  Often there are  populations of neurons that act as filters, selectively responding  only to signal trains with particular frequencies.  The brain of  weakly electric fish provides a model system for studying these  temporal filters.  Some weakly electric fish emit a small electric  discharge at a highly regular frequency, and they have an  electrosensory system that shows high sensitivity to any changes  in the electrical pattern in the water.  When a neighboring fish  comes near, using a slightly different discharge frequency, both  fish show a 'jamming-avoidance response' in which each fish shifts  its own discharge frequency away from that of the neighbor, to  avoid signal 'jamming' and allow easier reception of its own  signal.  This project uses a novel technique of recording single  cell activity in a part of the midbrain called the torus, while  giving precise signal frequencies to the electrosensory system.  Physiological measures such as the variable conductances of the  cell membrane will be analyzed to see how temporal filtering can  be enhanced by a frequency-dependent mechanism of gain control for  the incoming signals.     Results will have a major impact because they will clarify one  of the few cases where cellular membrane properties produce  selectivity for temporally varying behaviorally relevant stimuli.  The impact will extend across all sensory neuroscience, and also  to a better understanding of central brain mechanisms.",
