 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fogleman  9806888        Cytochrome P450 genes produce enzymes that allow insects to  tolerate poisonous chemicals such as insecticides and  certain plant compounds. Some plants protect themselves from  insects (and other herbivores) by making chemical compounds  that are toxic to the animals which try to feed on them.  Cytochrome P450 enzymes detoxify chemical compounds, usually  by changing their chemical structure. The study of P450  genes, therefore, will provide information as to how insects  become resistant to insecticides and/or plant defensive  chemicals.    This proposal involves the use of an insect-plant model  system. The insects are fruit flies of the genus Drosophila,  and the plants are columnar cacti which grow in the Sonoran  Desert of southwestern United States and Mexico. A wealth of  background information on this model system has already been  obtained including data on the ecology and genetics of the  fruit flies and identification and characterization of the  toxic chemicals that the cacti produce. Employing modern  techniques of molecular genetics, previous experiments have  isolated over 100 P450 genes from desertadapted  drosophilids. Since there are multiple P450 genes in each  insect species, one of the most important and currently  unanswered questions is what is the relative contribution of  individual P450 genes to resistance? The experiments  included in this proposal will investigate this question and  will significantly contribute to our understanding of the  mechanisms by which insects evolve P450-mediated resistance.  This objective represents a major advancement in the areas  of insect ecological genetics and evolution.",
