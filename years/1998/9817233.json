 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9817233\r\nBrady Deaton\r\n\r\nThis proposal outlines a detailed plan by the University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) to recruit, and\r\ntrain 32 students as future faculty in higher education institutions, and to provide two 8-week\r\nsummer-readiness programs for 40 students, to encourage and prepare them for admission to\r\ngraduate school.  This program, entitled the MU Minority Graduate Education Project (MU-MGE)\r\nprovides a unique opportunity for us to consolidate and coordinate on-going programs designed to\r\nrecruit and train talented underrepresented students, and several programs that offer unique\r\nenrichment or development services to students at MU.  Equally important, it will enable us to\r\nimplement innovative program activities, some previously-discussed and others designed\r\nspecifically for this project, and to institutionalize those that are effective.  The program will\r\nprovide a model for how large research institutions, such as MU, can provide the necessary\r\ncomponents to advance the career goals and opportunities for underrepresented minorities to enter\r\nthe professorate in higher education institutions.\r\n\r\nThe MU-MGE project described here will have a total budget of $5,423,872, with $2,401,784\r\nrequested from NSF, and $3,022,088 in cost-sharing by the University of Missouri-Columbia.  The\r\nplan includes requesting funding from NSF to support the future faculty participants during the first\r\ntwo years, with MU providing supplemental funding during this time, and then MU providing\r\nsupport to them for the remaining three years for a total of five years of support for each.  In\r\naddition, funding for administrative costs--a Project Manager, Recruitment/Retention/Career\r\nPlanning Specialist, Secretary and 17 Graduate Assistants--is requested from NSF plus some\r\nmodest funding to support the 8-week summer readiness program and miscellaneous other costs\r\nsuch as supplies, telephone, travel, and publications to advertise the project during recruitment and\r\nto disseminate information about it once NSF funding terminates.\r\n\r\nBecause MU is committed to continuing the project by assuming responsibility for financing the\r\nproject for four additional years beyond the five-years supported by NSF, this project will continue\r\nbeyond the NSF funding period.  It is our expectation that additional internal and external funding\r\nwill be found to expand the program offerings and the time period even beyond the total nine-year\r\ncommitment of MU.\r\n\r\nThis project includes an ongoing evaluation system of every program offering and continual\r\nmonitoring of student progress.  With the collection and careful evaluation of such detailed data this will enable us to make necessary adjustments as needs arise, and especially for improving the\r\nprogram offerings from year to year.  It will provide an opportunity for MU to coordinate the efforts for the MU-MGE project with those of many others on campus, and to collaborate in developing new offerings with other program officers.  And through the Visiting Faculty Development component, relationships will be developed by these participants and MU faculty with faculty from minority-serving institutions.  These changes, in campus climate and expanded relationships, will ensure even greater success with MU's efforts to advance the opportunities for underrepresented minorities to obtain doctoral degrees and to become future faculty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
