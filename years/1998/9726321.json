The researchers will  be undertaking a joint electromagnetic experiment on Miyake-  Jima volcano in Japan and in Long Valley caldera in  California.  Electric and magnetic signals have long been  reported to be associated with volcanic activity, but a  rigorous connection  between the observations and the  precise underground physical phenomena remains elusive.  This research focuses on the measurement known as \"self-  potential\" (SP) in which the volcanic process is an  underground battery driving continuous electric currents.  It will involve careful SP measurements at volcanic  environments in Japan and California, with particular  emphasis on separating non-volcanic sources of signal from  volcanic sources and comparison with laboratory and  theoretical studies.  The researchers will attempt to  quantify the volcanic hazard associated with magmatic dikes  that have been injected at depths that are inaccessible to  direct sampling.  The objectives of the research are to  determine:  (1) the relative importance of fluid flow and  charge generation processes within active volcanoes, (2) the  relative contributions to self-potential observations from  elevation and fluid flow, (3) whether deep intrusions can be  detected on active volcanoes such as Miyake-Jima and Mammoth  Mountain and (4) The stability of SP anomalies as dikes cool  and become more resistive yet retain sufficient heat to  drive fluid and gas flow.    This project brings together the efforts of two laboratories  that have complementary expertise, research capabilities and  equipment.  Results of the research should define  the usefulness of this method for determining the location  of new and existing dikes and sills for volcanic hazard  identification.  Through the exchange of ideas and  technolo gy, this project will broaden our base of basic  knowledge and promote international understanding and  cooperation.  ***",
