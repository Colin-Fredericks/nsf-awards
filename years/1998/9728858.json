Topics to be investigated include: the development of  singularities in partial differential equations; development  of techniques for measuring and modeling well-developed  turbulence; the study of interface motions and flows; and  the study of models of granular materials.  The research  done here will be integrated within a larger effort which  involves close contact with experimentalists, computations  and mathematicians.    Specific projects include: (1) the study of singularity  development in second and fourth order partial differential  equations, in part through similarity solutions; (2) further  applications of the methods of statistical physics to the  development of dynamical theories for granular materials;  (3) development of models for turbulent behavior with  particular focus upon the time-dependence of the solutions  of turbulence models; (4) the study of interface motion,  with particular reference to chaotic dynamical behaviors and  applications to sonoluminescence.  %%%  This grant supports theoretical research and is funded  jointly by the Divisions of Materials Science and Physics.
