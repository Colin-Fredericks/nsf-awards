 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to computerize 69,000+  catalogued specimens in the Division of Amphibians  and Reptiles, Texas Cooperative Wildlife Collection  (TCWC), and disseminate information on holdings via  the WWW and the Combined Herpetological Collections  Database the Division of Amphibians and Reptiles at  Texas Cooperative Wildlife Collection houses >80,000  individually numbered specimens from throughout the  world, with exceptionally strong collections from  Texas, Mexico, and the Neotropics.  The collection's  size ranks high among university-based collections  lacking stand-alone museums.  It is the largest  collections of Texas herps by far, with more than  45,000 catalogued specimens from all areas of the  states.  Holdings from Mexico and Latin America are  extensive, and make up about 50% of the collection.  Areas of taxonomic strength include Teiid  lizards,Phrynosomatid lizards, and snakes.  The  collection contains representative of 93% of  amphibian and reptile families, 42% of existing  genera, and 22% of existing herptile species.  The  collection houses 37 holotypes and 868 paratypes.  The growth rate is 2,200 specimens/year over the last  five years and compares well with any herpetological  collection.    One of the most important outcomes of this project  will be a searchable database of holdings on the TCWC  web page.  The page will print searches to the level  of county by  species.  Data files will also be  forwarded  to the Combined Herpetological Collections Data Base,  maintained at the California Academy of Sciences.  Use of the collection will increase significantly  after computerization and dissemination of our  holdings.",
