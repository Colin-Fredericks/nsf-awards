Rovnyak    Topics in operator theory and function theory will be pursued in several directions that involve Krein spaces and indefinite inner products (as opposed to Hilbert spaces). The project will continue previous work on the theory of generalized Schur and Nevanlinna functions. Following Krein and Langer, these are defined as meromorphic functions whose associated Pick-Nevanlinna kernels have a finite number of negative squares. One topic is interpolation theory. In the definite case, a theory of boundary interpolation including problems of Loewner type was given by Rosenblum and Rovnyak, and analogous problems will now be studied for generalized Schur functions.  A unifying tool is the theory of canonical coisometric, isometric, and unitary realizations for generalized Schur functions. Related problems on the structure of state spaces and the difference-quotient transformation will also be studied. The theory takes its most concrete form for scalar-valued functions, and work of Sarason and his colleagues in the definite case suggest other directions for development. Related problems for Krein space operators will also be investigated.    The project will study several topics that extend classical problems in operator theory and function theory. The work is mathematical, but the topics are in areas that support mathematical engineering and the theory of linear systems. One topic is interpolation theory, where it is required to reconstruct a function with prescribed properties when only some of its values, the data of the problem, are known.  In linear system theory, a similar problem is to reconstruct a system with prescribed input-output characteristics; some state is input into the system, the system (itself described by an unknown state) acts upon it, and a new state is output. In the classical theory, distances between states are \"definite,\" that is, positive in the usual sense of Euclidean space.  Mathem atical models in which distances are \"indefinite,\" that is, sometimes positive and sometimes negative, have been known for a long time and occur, for example, in relativity theory.  In fact, the mathematics of linear system theory is a powerful tool for interpolation theory and will be used in the project.  The project uses \"indefinite\" as opposed to \"definite\" notions of distance, and it seeks to explore new phenomena that arise when the classical theories do not apply. Questions to be investigated include existence of solutions, uniqueness, explicit construction, and properties of the state space. The budget includes support for one undergraduate student in an REU summer research project each year.",
