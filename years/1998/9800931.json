Concerning the first   area, special emphasis will be given to the study of moment problems   associated with singular matrices, building on recent work (joint  with L.A.   Fialkow) on flat extensions of positive moment matrices, which has led to a    general framework for the study of truncated complex moment problems.    With the  aid of a new moment matrix associated to a semi-algebraic set,   progress is expected  in the localization-of-support problem.  A   characterization of quadrature domains in  terms of their moment matrices,   and further applications to quadrature and cubature  formulas will also be   sought.  As part of (ii), a characterization of polynomially  hyponormal   weighted shifts,  a structure theorem for quadratically hyponormal shifts, and   the detection of non-subnormal polynomially hyponormal operators through   the Pincus principal  function and through Putinar's 2-subscalar model, will be   sought.  The research aim  in the third area (which deals with a Sz. Nagy-   Foias dilation theory in several  variables and builds on recent work of A.   Athavale, V. Muller, F.-H. Vasilescu and  others), is to extend the existing   theory to functional Hilbert spaces over Reinhardt domains.  The suitability of   multi-shifts as standard models, the validity of von Neumann's  inequality for   special n-tuples, and the structure of C*-algebras generated by spherical   isometries, will be considered.  The fourth and final area deals with  the   invariant subspace structure of commuting contractions on Hilbert space.    Using recent results of J. Eschmeier, M. Kosiek, A. Octavio, M. Ptak, and   others, two main goals will be pursued:  (a) an extension to the Taylor   spectrum of results on spectral dominance currently available only for the   Harte spectrum, and (b) an analog of  Apostol's Theorem in several variables.       Multivariable operator theory is a rapidly evolving area of   mathematics, with deep and significant connections with areas of differential   geometry, topology, complex analysis, and algebraic geometry, and with   exciting applications to engineering, quantum and relativistic mechanics, and   computational mathematics.  The theory of truncated moment problems   provide easily accessible formulas for the evaluation of areas and volumes of   complex regions, of moments of inertia and centers of gravity. Dilation theory   and invariant subspace theory are essential tools to describe the algebraic   properties of elaborate physical or engineering systems, and the study of   transformations on function spaces has often led to the solution of problems    in control theory, intimately tied to systems theory and electrical engineering.    Our research project is aimed at resolving some outstanding problems in   multivariable operator theory, while creating recruitment and retention   opportunities for women and minorities to pursue careers in mathematics, by   engaging their participation in projects related to the interaction of   mathematics with other sciences.",
