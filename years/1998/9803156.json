 "awd_abstract_narration": "A crucial element of plant morphogenesis is the control of the three-dimensional growth characteristics of cells; that is, the direction(s) in which existing cells expand and/or the relative position of new cells, as dictated by the placement of division planes.  Thus, plant cells must respond to external signals to expand or divide in an oriented fashion. Cell polarity is implicated in diverse plant developmental processes, from pollen tube growth to the asymmetric cell divisions that generate stomatal complexes and two-celled embryos. The establishment of polarity, via specialized domains in the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, or cell wall of a cell, is an important means of providing three-dimensional information to direct subsequent morphogenesis.  Recent data in higher plants and in zygotes of fucoid algae (Fucus and Pelvetia) support the hypothesis that the actin cytoskeleton and secretion both play important roles in establishing plant cell polarity.  Fucoid zygotes have a unique advantage for investigations into cell polarity: they establish oriented molecular and developmental asymmetries in culture media in response to external gradients (e.g., unilateral light) over the course of their first 24-hour cell cycle.  Zygotes that are initially apolar orient the localized tip growth of the cell, as well as the first plane of division, with respect to the external vector, producing an embryo with two distinct cell types. An intact actin cytoskeleton and directed secretion are necessary for this process. However, the molecular mechanisms that direct secretion and cytoskeletal organization in plant cells are poorly understood.  The related, highly-conserved Rho and Rab families of small GTPases play important roles in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization and secretion, respectively, in fungal and animal cells. For example, the Cdc42p protein of S. cerevisiae (in the Rho family) is necessary for actin localization and polar growth at the yeast bud; the mammalian Rab8 protein is involved in t he polarized transport of vesicles to the plasma membrane in epithelial cells. These proteins act as molecular switches, cycling between an active, GTP-bound form and an inactive, GDP-bound form. Mutations in certain conserved amino acids in the GTPases generate either dominant active or inactive forms of the proteins, which have been introduced into cells (either by microinjection or transformation of expression constructs) to investigate GTPase function in viva. Thus, Rho and Rab GTPases are promising targets for investigation of the role of the cytoskeleton and secretion in plant cell polarity.",
