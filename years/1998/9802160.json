 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the Workshop on Managing and Mining Massive Data (M3D-98) is to foster interactions among an invited group of computer scientists who are interested in developing scalable systems for managing and mining massive data sets. The workshop is co-organized by Robert Grossman (University of Illinois, Chicago) and Reagan Moore (San Diego Supercomputer Center). The goals of the workshop are: to identify promising approaches and technologies for scaling data mining to massive data sets; to investigate how data mining can be more tightly integrated with databases, digital libraries, data warehouses, and data archives; to identify how data mining services can be integrated into the emerging national computational infrastructure; and to begin the process of developing community data sets, benchmarks, interchanged formats, and testbeds appropriate for mining massive data sets. The workshop consists of survey talks, background talks and technical talks on different aspects of data mining as well as several application talks describing data mining case studies. In addition, there are also white papers describing fundamental challenges and issues, proposed research agendas, testbeds, emerging standards, and related matters. The white papers and related materials will be available to the invited participants prior to the workshop and to the general public via a M3D web site approximately a month after the workshop.",
