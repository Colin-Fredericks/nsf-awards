 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal focusses on neutrino mass, one of the  most elusive quantities in nature.  Neutrinos are most  visible at high energies while mass is best determined at  low energies.  Currently, indirect high energy studies are  providing evidence that the mass is not zero.  Tritium beta  decay is known to be an ideal candidate for the direct  measurement of neutrino mass, but, to date, has yielded  results which appear to be unphysical.  There is a good  possibility that these results can be explained as  interference with very weak interactions which are not  included in the Standard Model description of particle  physics.  Such new interactions have been anticipated but  cannot be predicted.  To avoid conflict with other existing  low energy data, it is necessary for us to include all three  light neutrinos required by accelerator data, and to  consider the possibility that the new interactions couple  electrons to different combinations of those neutrinos than  that coupled by the usual weak interaction.  To learn  whether this interpretation is viable or not, it must be  tested against a large number of other precise low energy  measurements.",
