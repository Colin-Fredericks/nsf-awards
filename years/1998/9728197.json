 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peter J. Bryant    Molecular and genetic methods will be used to investigate the functions of a newly discovered family of Imaginal Disc Growth Factors (IDGFs) from Drosophila. The factors were discovered in conditioned medium from imaginal disc cultures, and have been shown to be related to chitinases rather than to previously known growth factors. They cooperate with insulin to stimulate the proliferation, polarization and motility of imaginal disc cells in vitro. The first goal is to identify the functions of IDGFs in vivo by isolating and characterizing mutations and deficiencies in the genes encoding these proteins. P-element mutagenesis and radiation mutagenesis will be used to produce loss-of-function mutations and deficiencies of the IDGF genes, and the mutant phenotypes produced by single and multiple losses will be analyzed. Genetic methods will also be used to determine whether individual IDGFs can compensate for loss of other members of the family, and to test the hypothesis that these proteins are secreted by the fat body into the blood. The second goal is to test the effects of each IDGF and of combinations of IDGFs, with and without insulin, on cell proliferation and polarization both in cell lines and in larval tissues. Each IDGF will be produced in a baculoviral expression system. The binding of IDGFs to cells and to proteins will be studied in order to determine whether these proteins interact with a cell-surface receptor, and the possibility that they interact directly with insulin will be tested. The IDGFs will also be tested for chitinase activity. The third goal is to test the hypothesis that the expression of IDGF genes is under the control of the known transcription factor serpent, which has an appropriate expression pattern and DNA-binding properties. The discovery of these proteins opens up a variety of new approaches to the problem of growth control in Drosophila.",
