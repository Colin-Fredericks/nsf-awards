Resasco  Institution:  University of Oklahoma    Professor Daniel E. Resasco, from the University of Oklahoma, will investigate various aspects of the selective catalytic reduction of NO with methane in the presence of oxygen, over Pd on acidic supports. This work is of relevance to various environmental concerns: it provides new scientific insights into the catalytic removal of NOx from gases of combustion, it leads to the utilization of methane, it leads to the possibility of burning fuels under leaner (oxygen-rich) conditions, and as a consequence, it allows higher energy efficiency and less generation of CO2 per unit of energy production. Three objectives will be pursued: to determine the role of acidic sites in providing SCR selectivity to Pd supported or exchanged in zeolites or supported on sulfated zirconia; to determine the possible reaction mechanisms kinetically, by infrared spectroscopy of reactants or possible intermediates, and by transient kinetics of isotopically labeled compounds; and to investigate the tolerance of the Pd catalysts during reaction in the presence of water and SO2. The state of Pd will be characterized by x-ray absorption, temperature programmed reduction, electron microscopy, and chemisorption of probe molecules. The acidic sites will be characterized by microcalorimetry and by chemisorption and temperature programmed desorption of weak bases.",
