 "awd_abstract_narration": "9809168  Kadko         One of the important unknowns in the summer surface  energy balance of the Arctic Ocean involves the fate of the  energy inputs (mostly shortwave radiation) in the  heterogeneous ice-ocean system during the melt season.  Downwelling solar radiation is the primary source for the  direct heating of the ocean through leads, but the fate of  the solar energy absorbed through the leads is not  adequately known. To understand the ice-albedo feedback, one  must know how the energy is partitioned between lateral  melting of floe edges, bottom melting of ice, or warming of  the water column.       In this work, the heat exchange between the leads and  underlying mixed layer will cosmic ray produced species  which is delivered to the earth's surface, and as such can  be used as a proxy for incoming solar radiation. Because it  has a known decay rate, it can be used to estimate the mean  exposure time of lead water to solar insolation, and the  delivery rate of solar energy to the ice bottom. The mean  life of the isotope is 77 days, and thus it is an ideal  tracer for evaluating seasonal processes.  Samples for this  analysis were collected as part of the initial SHEBA  (Surface Heat Budge of the Arctic Ocean) field program, and  measurement of Be-7 were successfully made. These are the  first measurements of this isotope ever made under the  Arctic ice.",
