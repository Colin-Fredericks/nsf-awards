 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue work that has been underway for several years.  It will focus on designing, producing, and disseminating a \"stand alone\" instructional package on a CD ROM.  This tool is designed to teach undergraduate students selected ethnographic field research methods in a life-like learning environment.  It is intended to be used as a cultural anthropology laboratory section module for introductory cultural anthropology courses, or for special projects.  Additionally, students and instructors will be able to visit a Website which will contain additional ethnographic information and multimedia materials on the ethnographic field site.      The CD package will consist of the following components:  (1) a start up and launch mechanism that provides a tutorial and brings navigation instructions to the screen,   (2) a tutorial on how to use the courseware,   (3) ethnographic background information on the region and communities, and descriptions of uses and meaning of the field research methods featured in the various field exercises in the package,  (4) three field research exercises with corresponding sets of questions or assignments for evaluating what students have learned.      Materials intended for inclusion in the CD ROM have been tested at two universities.  The work has been conducted in part with support from the Division of Undergraduate Education of the National Science Foundation.  The PI, Dr. Manual Carlos plans to publish these materials using a commercial publisher for classroom use.",
