 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate numerical algorithms for solving  moderate to large scale eigenvalue and generalized eigenvalue  problems.  A variant QR algorithm is being developed for solving  the algebraic eigenvalue problem.  The new algorithm avoids the  phenomenon of shift blurring that dramatically slows the rate of  convergence of the conventional multi-shift QR algorithm.  The  new approach shows promise of being able to use nearly any number  of simultaneous shifts without substantial adverse affect on the  converge rate.  It should achieve \"BLAS-3 71 speeds on  computers with advanced architectures including hierarchical  cache storage and instruction pipelining.  In addition, the  variant algorithm will use an early deflation procedure that  promises to substantially reduce the number of Hessenberg QR  steps needed.    A generalized algebra of relations is being used to analyze and  modify algorithms for moderately large scale eigenvalue problems.  These include the inverse free spectral divide and conquer  algorithm and other generalizations of the matrix sign function.    The location/verification problem for the large scale eigenvalue  problem will also be attacked.  The initial approach will use a  rational function approximation to the trace of a spectral  projection in order to count eigenvalues inside a target region.  The computational work required by this approach is expected not  to be closely related to the number of eigenvalues in the region.  This may make it attractive for locating eigenvalue clusters.  In  the verification setting, many eigenvalues in  the target region have already been located by some other  numerical method, e.g., a Krylov subspace method.  In this case,  the approximate trace of the spectral projector determines  whether there are unlocated eigenvalues in the target region.",
