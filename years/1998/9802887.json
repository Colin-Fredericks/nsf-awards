The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve month postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Balasingam Muhunthan of Washington  State University to work with Dr. Malcolm Bolton at  Cambridge University on the effects of microstructure on  mechanical and transport processes in soils.  Funding for  this award comes from the Hazard Reduction Program in the  Division of Engineering.  This collaboration will develop a  new framework to enable the characterization of nonlinear  and unstable materials behavior from the approach of micro-mechanics.    Dr. Bolton has made significant contributions in  constitutive modeling of soils and centrifuge testing for  geotechnical applications.  He is director of the Cambridge  Geotechnical Centrifuge Center.  ***",
