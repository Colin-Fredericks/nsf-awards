 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728756  Akins    Learning, which is a change in behavior due to experience, is perhaps the most widespread and important behavioral characteristic of the animal kingdom.  Indeed, the nature of the physical-chemical changes underlying the learning in the brain is an important fundamental question.  Since the time of Pavlov's dog, classical conditioning has been used as a model to examine the learning process.  Classical conditioning involves the pairing of a stimulus that, when followed often enough by an unconditioned stimulus, produces a response similar to that automatically triggered by the unconditioned response.  Dr. Akins is interested in understanding the mechanisms underlying learning and reproductive behavior.  She will utilize this classical learning paradigm to integrate these two lines of research.  Employing a variety of pharmacological and behavioral tools, Dr. Akins will examine the role of the dopaminergic system in the control of the unconditioned consummatory reproductive behavior as well as on the acquisition and expression of behavioral conditioning.  The outcome of these studies will provide fundamental new information as to the neural mechanisms underlying learning and reproduction.",
