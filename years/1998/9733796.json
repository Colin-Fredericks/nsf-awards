 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tianquan Lian of Emory University is supported by the Experimental   Physical Chemistry Program to investigate the dynamics of chemical   reactions occurring at the semiconductor-liquid interface of nanoparticle   colloids using femtosecond infrared laser spectroscopy.  He will focus on   two fundamental processes in these systems:  photo-induced interfacial   charge transfer dynamics and the subsequent interfacial bimolecular   chemical reaction dynamics of radicals.  The education plan of this   CAREER award emphasizes the incorporation of laser spectroscopy into the   undergraduate curricula, as well as the implementation of Problem Based   Learning techniques in undergraduate science classes.    Semiconductor nanoparticles are an important class of new materials.    They offer unique opportunities to study fundamental problems in the   interdisciplinary areas of chemistry, physics and materials science, as   well as many potential applications such as solar energy conversion,   waste degradation, and nanoelectronics.  The detailed understanding   resulting from these studies will have an important impact on the   application of semiconductor nanoparticles, since the processes to be   studied determine the efficiency and the chemical stability of any   devices made from such nanoparticles.  Results from this study will also   add to the general understanding of the dynamics in the solid-liquid   interface, which is essential for the design and application of many   important devices and processes such as the solar cell, electrochemistry   and heterogeneous catalysis.",
