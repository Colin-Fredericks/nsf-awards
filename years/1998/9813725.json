 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Harold Hietala, MS Mary Clark will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. Her research focuses on reconstructing the prehistoric social organization of the Jenne-jeno settlement complex which lies within the Inland Niger Delta of Mali, a vast floodplain characterized by a mosaic of landforms and soil types. Prior archaeological reconnaissance within the area has led to the discovery of over 400 sites within an 1100 km square area, the greatest density of which occurs within a 4 km radius around the modern town of Jenne. Here, sixty-nine mound sites ranging from 0.12 to 60 ha. have been identified, the majority of which are arranged in discrete spatial clusters. In general, the clusters are characterized by one or two larger sites and a number of smaller ones within 200 m. of each other. This pattern has been observed in at least three other basins of the Middle Niger suggesting it is not unique to one region alone and thus likely reflects a basic form of social organization. In a highly original series of studies Susan and Roderick McIntosh, the archaeological pioneers in this region suggest that a state level of organization was present and that it was based in heterarchical rather than hierarchical principles. A heterarchical organization is one where economic and political power is horizontally (spatially) dispersed and shared between several loci rather than spatially centralized. The concept is interesting because in all other areas in both Old and New World where this level of complexity is reached, organization is primarily on hierarchical lines. This suggests greater variation in the organization of simple states than generally assumed.  The McInstosh's work, while based on intensive excavation at a limited number of sites does not rest on a broad and solid regional base. To remedy this situation, MS Clark conducted a large scale survey supplemented by limited excavations. She now wishes to obtain crucial radiocarbon dates to determine which sites are synchronous with each other. She also wishes to have specialists analyze the botanical, faunal and floral remains recovered to provide insight into craft specialization and subsistence practices. With sites securely dated and the range of archaeologically visible activities determined, it will then be possible to evaluate whether a heterarchical pattern is in fact present.  This research is important for several reasons. It will evaluate evidence for a suggested unique form of spatial organization. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists and assist in training a promising young scientist.                                           ^\u00bf\u00fa             +\u2592+\u00ac                                                        \u00f3  &\u00bf^<\u00e1\u00bd\u00bc^+\u00e1(\u00f1      +\u2592+\u00ac                                                       \u00f3  &\u00bf^\u00d1\u00ac\u00bd\u00bc^+\u00e1(\u00f1      +\u2592+\u00ac                                                        \u00f3  \u00bf+\u00bd\u00bc^\u00bf\u00fa           +\u2592+\u00ac                                                        \u00f3  \u00ac\u00f1\u00ab^\u00ac\u00ae\u00bd\u00bc^\u00f3+\u00bc      +\u2592+\u00ac                                                       \u00f3  \u00ac\u00f1\u00ab^\u00ac\u00bc\u00ac+^\u00f3+\u00bc      +\u2592+\u00ac                                                        \u00f3  \u00bf+\u00bd\u00bc^\u00bd\u00ba\u00ac\u00bc^+\u00e1(\u00f1    +\u2592+\u00ac                                                        \u00f3  +|^|\u00d1^(\u00e1\u00bf<^\u00ac\u00f1\u00ab\u00ac   +\u2592+\u00ac                                                       \u00f3  +|^|\u00d1^&\u00e1+\u00f1<^\u00ac\u00f1\u00ab\u00ac  +\u2592+\u00ac                                                        \u00f3  &\u00aa(^\u00f1<\u00f1^+\u00e1(\u00f1      +\u2592+\u00ac                                                        \u00f3  \u00bf\u00ed(^(\u00bd\u00aa           +\u2592+\u00ac",
