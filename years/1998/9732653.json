 "awd_abstract_narration": "9732653  Hsaio    The main objective of the proposed research is to explore several  fundamental issues of polymer melt crystallization, which include  early stages of phase transformation, secondary crystallization  and deformation-induced crystallization.  The rationale for the  proposed study is as follows.  It is now firmly established that,  in polymer melt, long-chain molecules can crystallize into a two-  phase structure with periodic arrangement of lamellae and  amorphous interlayers under quiescent and flow conditions.  Although the kinetics of the process can be understood with  nucleation and growth theories, the mechanism of forming a two-  phase structure at short and long time scales under these  conditions, requires further clarification.  The proposed  research is intended to systematically study the fundamental  behavior of melt crystallization in polymers with different  molecular architecture, chain stiffness, molecular weight and  chain branching using several advanced characterization  techniques including time-resolved simultaneous synchrotron  SAXS/WAXD, microscopy, light scattering and thermal analysis.  %%%  The significance of this work lies in the probable universal  behavior of the phase transformation during melt crystallization,  in the enormous multiplicity of macromolecules, that is yet to be  completely understood.  With the proposed study, an in-depth  understanding about the subject may be obtained.  This can  significantly improve the ability to correlate the structure,  morphology, process and property relationships in the  applications of crystalline polymers.  ***",
