These workshops will be held  concurrently with a Latin American Symposium of Solid State  Physics (SLAFES), in Oaxaca, Mexico, January 11-16, 1998.  The topics to be discussed in the two workshops will be the  physical properties of heterostructures and the magnetic  properties of low dimensional systems.  Organizers are Dr.  Ivan Schuller, University of California, San Diego, and Dr.  Jose Luis Moran Lopez, Universidad Autonoma de San Luis  Potosi.    The physics and materials science of low dimensional systems  is an important current subject of research worldwide, but  much of the research is performed by small groups in many  institutions. Therefore, there is a strong need to bring  together this small group of researchers for open  discussions of past research and future directions. The two  workshops will meet this need, especially with the  opportunity of holding them concurrently with the Latin  American Symposium, which has had US participation since its  inception and has played an important role for the  development of American collaboration for many years.    ***",
