 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Environmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry Program   is jointly supported by the Divisions of Chemistry, Earth Sciences, and   Chemical and Transport Systems Engineering, and by the MPS Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities.  Drs. Thomas B. Brill, Chemistry   Department, and Michael T. Klein, Chemical Engineering Department, of the   University of Delaware will investigate the kinetics of synthesis of   small organic molecules in hydrothermal environments.  Conditions of high   pressure and temperature occur widely throughout the Earth's crust,   creating conditions for synthesis and alteration of organic feedstocks.    In this research, the kinetics of simple reaction pathways will be   determined at high water density in the presence of salts and particles,   modelling conditions at a hydrothermal vent.  The results are expected to   complement the thermodynamics parameters that have been determined   previously.  A high performance flow reactor, monitored by FTIR and   dispersive Raman spectroscopy, will be used to carry out the experiments   under controlled conditions of temperature and pressure.   Emphasis will   be placed on reactions of simple molecules such as urea, ammonia, carbon   dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and carboxylic acids.  The effects of various   soluble and insoluble salts as well as changes in acidity and ionic   strength will be determined.  Automated kinetic modeling (AKM) will be   used to formulate and reduce complex reaction schemes of compound   families by drawing upon a matrix of qualitative and quantitative   correlations in addition to detailed kinetics.  In the vicinity of hydrothermal vents, unusual thermodynamic conditions   lead to production of complex organic molecules by mechanisms that are   not understood.  The objective of this investigation is to determine the   kinetics of some chemical reactions under hydrothermal conditions.    Synthesis, degradation, and alteration of organic and inorganic compounds   will be modeled with newly developed computational software.",
