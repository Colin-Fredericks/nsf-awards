 "awd_abstract_narration": "A classical result in the theory of income accounting is that for the case of a time-autonomous technology with no uncertainty and a constant real interest rate, ideal Green NNP exactly equals annuity-equivalent consumption. In this case, a theoretically appealing measure of economic activity exactly forecasts a theoretically appealing index of potential future power to consume. This research will extend the basic model beyond its classical assumptions to investigate four important extensions: (1) technological progress, (2) uncertainty, (3) welfare foundations, and (4) empirical applications.  The main theoretical part of project will provide a rigorous connection between the following five concepts: (1)   Sustainable Equivalence, meaning the level of sustainable-equivalent utility the economy can provide, evaluated at the rate of pure time preference; (2) Annuitized Consumption, meaning the hypothetical stationary-equivalent consumption the economy can deliver, evaluated at the prevailing rate of interest; (3) Green NNP, meaning the most inclusive consumption-based measure of NNP that can be assembled in practice with reasonably accurate efficiency prices on investments; (4) Incompleteness, meaning the degree to which the list of available capital goods fails to account for all sources of growth, as measured by the relative strength of the residual factor; (5) Linearized Hamiltonian, meaning an affine scaling procedure that makes utility-based and consumption-based systems be comparable.  The main empirical part of the research evaluates numerically the loss of global welfare from running out of each of the major non-renewable resources, including petroleum. The research will provide actual numerical estimates of how much final consumption the world loses on average from finiteness of the earth's resources.",
