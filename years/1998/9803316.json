 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803316\r\nStallings\r\n     Stallings is working on matters connected with Grushko's Theorem, with  \r\ncertain delicate questions about surfaces involved.  One recent version of\r\nthis concerns a map of a compact connected surface T into a wedge of spaces\r\nA and B, which is surjective on fundamental groups; if the boundary curves\r\nall map to one side or the other, except possibly for one which maps with\r\nlength two, the map is homotopic to one that splits the surface into two\r\nparts along a connected piece.  He is also interested in matters concerning\r\nhyperbolic groups and cut vertices of graphs and Heegaard splittings of\r\n3-manifolds.  These naturally influence his graduate students; and their\r\nideas and plans influence him too.  One student, Kim Whittlesey, has solved\r\nan interesting problem concerning the existence of a subgroup of the \r\nmapping class group that consists only of the trivial element together \r\nwith pseudo-Anosov maps.  Another student is working on algorithmic matters\r\nconcerning free groups and is getting deeply into the theory of equations\r\nin free groups.  Another student is interested in using the computer to\r\ndiscover things about geometric objects, and another has started getting\r\ninto the theory of automatic and hyperbolic groups in some detail.  The\r\nmajor portion of the grant is for the partial support of students.\r\n     Group theory started out as the study of symmetries of geometric or\r\nalgebraic objects.  The geometry can be softened into topology, and this\r\nproduces some interesting new ideas; M. Gromov was one of the originators \r\nof this (1980's), and it has expanded considerably since his first work.  \r\nIn hindsight, one can see that geometric ideas about groups have occurred \r\nin work by Gauss (circa 1800), Poincare (circa 1900), Whitehead (1930's). \r\nThe nature of 3-dimensional manifolds is especially influenced by the\r\nfundamental group, and conversely many results simply about groups have \r\nbeen stimulated by these topological ideas.  Several logical and\r\ncombinatorial aspects of other areas of mathematics have been understood\r\nor even discovered by this approach.  There are many good researchers in\r\nthis area and many problems that are now approachable.\r\n***\r\n",
