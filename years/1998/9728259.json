 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728259  Rodionov    Microtubules (MTs) are structural elements (cytoskeleton) of the cell.  They have multiple functions, including maintaining cell shape and serving as tracks for the movement of other subcellular structures or organelles.  The movement of subcellular structures along MTs is catalyzed by unidirectional protein \"motors\" that move either to the \"plus-end\" of the MTs (i.e., kinesin) or to the \"minus-end\" (i.e., dynein).  In many cell types, the MTs are arranged in a radial array that supports traffic from the middle of the cell to the periphery.  It had generally been assumed that the organization of this radial array of MTs is a result of nucleation at the centrosome; however, it is now becoming clear that the MT array can self-organize, and that alternative cellular mechanisms exist which position the focal point of radial MTs at the center of a cell.  The objective of this research is to elucidate the mechanism of self-organization and centering of the radial array of cytoplasmic MTs.     Cytoplasmic fragments of fish melanophores (the cells in fish skin that make it possible for fishes to change color) provide an excellent model system for the study of the self-centering mechanism.  In melanophores, thousands of pigment granules move along radial MTs by means of molecular motors to the cell center to form a tight aggregate (causing the skin to appear light) or to the periphery to redisperse uniformly throughout the cytoplasm (causing the skin to appear dark).   When cytoplasmic fragments of melanophores are produced by microsurgery, the MTs organize into a radial array of correct polarity orientation (plus ends outwards) and the pigment aggregates in the center, even in the absence of a centrosome.  This organization of MTs into a radial array is fast and depends on the activity of a minus end motor (dynein).  These observations allowed the development of a model for the self-centering activity of melanophore fragments.    In the model, pigment aggregation itself induces form ation of the radial MT array.  Each pigment granule during aggregation interacts with more than one MT, and unidirectional transport of granules brings MT minus ends together.  Nucleation of MTs at the pigment aggregate contributes to self-organization.  Information about the position of the focal point of radial MTs is derived from interaction of MT ends with the surface.  The driving force for relocation to the center is provided by MT motors at the pigment aggregate or at the surface, coupled with the addition or loss of MT subunits.  The imbalance of forces which drives relocation of the pigment aggregate to the center is produced by the greater effective number of MTs which connect the aggregate to the closest edge.      The major statements of the model will be tested by a combination of cell, structural and immunochemical methodologies.  The following are the specific aims of the project:  (i) to test MT transport and nucleation models of self-organization of MTs into a radial array.  Photobleaching and photoactivation will be used to examine the behavior of MTs during formation of radial MTs and at steady state.  (ii) to test if asymmetry in effective MT number drives relocation of the pigment aggregate to the center.  Digital fluorescence  imaging will be used to test if selective stabilization of MTs at the surface causes the increase in MT number which explains the imbalance of forces driving centering.  (iii) to determine if MT asters of reversed polarity form in melanophore fragments with dispersed pigment after disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and stimulation of a plus-end directed motor.  Drugs which interfere with the uniform distribution of pigment granules will be employed to test a major statement of the model that transport of pigment granules induces self-organization of the radial MT array.    This research will increase our understanding of general principles of self-organization and positioning of microtubule arrays within cells.",
