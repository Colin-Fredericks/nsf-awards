 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project upgrades the biochemistry and biotechnology laboratories at East Stroudsburg University (ESU) as part of a comprehensive three-phase plan designed to strengthen the undergraduate curricula for biology, biochemistry and chemistry majors. Phase I (building improvements) and Phase II (acquisition of essential laboratory equipment) have already been addressed by the departments and university. Phase III, addressed in part by this project, involves curricular review, the development of new laboratory experiences in biotechnology, and the acquisition of equipment required for these new educational opportunities. Specifically, new DNA and protein workstations will be integrated into 1) the biochemistry and biotechnology courses, 2) the undergraduate research program, and 3) outreach education programs for regional high school science teachers.  The current biochemistry laboratories focus on traditional experiments involving isolation and characterization of biomolecules, with an emphasis on proteins and small molecules. A molecular biotechnology course was first offered during the summer of 1997, and a molecular-biology lecture course is being offered for the first time during the spring, 1998 semester. Thus, ESU students have had little exposure to techniques in molecular biology and biotechnology.  Proposed collaborative efforts between the chemistry and biology departments aim to address this deficiency by redesigning key laboratory courses, incorporating the new DNA and protein workstations and related equipment items. These enhancements will better prepare our students both for graduate work and for careers as teachers, researchers, industrial employees, and health care practitioners.",
