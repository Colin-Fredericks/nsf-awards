 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800257  Faber    Graded materials, by definition, have properties that vary  as a function of position.  This project offers a novel  means to microstructurally grade the properties of  single-phase materials.  A recently-developed processing  method, gelcasting, in which ceramic powders are suspended  in a polymerizable liquid is used to form the material.  At  the onset of polymerization, the ceramic particles are no  longer free to rotate or move in the gel, thus \"freezing in\"  the desired structure.  The gelcasting process has a  characteristic \"idle time\" defined as the time prior to  polymerization and gelation. Taking advantage of that idle  time allows for gradation of the microstructure.  The  project will use the idle time to grade single phase oxides  in two ways.  First, graded-density solids will be made by  making use of gravity or enhanced settling through  centrifugation.  It is anticipated that these materials can  be configured to have dense, wear-resistant surfaces, or  porous, flaw tolerant surfaces, as demanded by the  engineering application.  Aluminum oxide known for its  hardness and chemical inertness is the model graded-density  solid.  Second, graded-texture solids will be produced by  performing gelcasting in a magnetic field gradient.  The  hexagonal ferrimagnetic, barium hexaferrite, will be  texture-graded due to its high magnetic anisotropy. Since  its crystallographic texture is coupled to morphological  texture, barium ferrite is also expected to have gradients  in mechanical properties.  The field-assisted gradation  technique is applicable to ferromagnets, paramagnets, and  ferro- and paraelectrics, the latter in an electrical field  gradient. The properties of these solids will be simulated  using an object oriented finite element program (OOF) for  actual microstructures.  The simulation work will be done in  conjunction with the National Institute of Standards and  Technology.  Simulations coupled with experimental findings  will form the basis for materia ls design of density- and  texture-graded solids.  %%%  As ceramics are considered for more complex and  sophisticated applications, one component must serve several  functions and meet seemingly disparate materials  requirements.  Conflicting materials requirements beg for  graded microstructures.  Considerable emphasis has been  placed on functionally gradient materials in recent years.  This project will explore a new method for grading materials  and novel gradation architectures, that may provide  materials engineers with a low-cost, reproducible method of  producing functionally gradient materials.  ***",
