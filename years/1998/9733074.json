 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733074  Wade    Males and females are different.  Most species, including humans, are sexually dimorphic.  While body shape and size may be the most apparent, there are differences in physiology, neural function and behavior.  Considerable evidence indicates that, in vertebrates, hormones secreted by the gonads during a limited, sensitive stage of development differentiate the neural substrates underlying sexual dimorphism.  Several model systems have been developed to exploit the relationship between gonadal steroid hormones, brain structure, and sexually dimorphic behavior including bird song, rat reproductive behavior, and  electric discharge patterns of weakly electric fish.  Dr. Wade has developed a reptile model system to examine how structural and biochemical changes within the brain regulate behavior.  Reptiles are a pivotal group in vertebrate evolution since they are direct ancestors to both mammals and birds.  Using a variety of neuroanatomical, behavioral, and classical endocrine techniques, she will address what causes behaviors to be different in males than in females and decipher the factors that stimulate behaviors seasonally in adulthood.  Moreover, as part of this CAREER award, Dr. Wade will develop a course emphasizing comparative aspects of neuroanatomical and hormonal regulation of behaviors.  The integration of her teaching and research will provide students with a greater opportunity for first-hand experience in the neural and endocrine factors that influence the structure and the function of the brain.",
