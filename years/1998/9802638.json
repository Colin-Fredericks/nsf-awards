Jose Ruiz Herrera and Alfredo Martinez  Espinoza, Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados,  (CINVESTAV), Irapuato, Mexico.    The objective of the project is to elucidate underlying  mechanisms controlling dimorphism in the fungus Ustilago  maydis, the causal agent of corn smut disease.  These fungi  grow in two morphologies, as a budding yeast form or as long  tubular cells or filaments.  The yeast cells do not attack  the plants, but the filaments can.  This fungus dimorphism  is known to be affected by genetic programming and by  environmental conditions.  The two groups of researchers  have independently discovered mutations in genes that  control the ability of the fungus to alternate between the  two forms, and both have observed similar phenotypic  results.  Their overall goal for this collaboration is to  determine the interaction between the two morphogenic  triggers.  To accomplish this, they have designed an  experimental program to investigate the relationship between  the two signal response pathways and, specifically, to  determine how the environment regulates dimorphism.    The topic of morphogenic switching has fundamental and  applied significance, both within plant pathology and across  biology.  Results of the proposed research could provide  guidance for effective strategies for the control of fungal  diseases in plants.  ***",
