 "awd_abstract_narration": "9812681  Rob    This proposal looks at human relations in the workplace, and how they affect the performance of firms. The general objective is to incorporate the psychology of interactions among workers into formal (principal-agent type) models of the firm, analyze firm compensation policies when this element is present, and determine how these policies are played out in a market equilibrium context. More specifically, the following issues will be addressed.  1. Is \"corporate culture\" an asset of the firm which gives it excess profit? Why is this asset not imitable? How should management nurture a firm's culture?  2. Why different firms - even in the same industry and with the same opportunities - use different compensation packages for their employees? Some pay employees on the basis of their observed output, others pay a flat wage.       3. Why a given firm changes its compensation package over time?  4. How does the firm choose a mix of individual vs. cooperative activities and how does it direct its workers towards this mix? In particular, if too much activity is taking place in teams how should the firm direct employees towards individual activities?       5. How does cooperation propagate through the firm?       6. What is the role of outside hires vs. internal promotions?  7. When should a firm adopt a strategy of fast growth - \"go for market share\" -vs. slow but durable growth - \" build to last.\" Why do firms with the same opportunities adopt different strategies..       8. Why market leaders stumble and why might that be rational.    To address these issues the project employs the hypothesis that employees tend to reciprocate the behavior of their colleagues. If their colleagues help them execute their duties, they will feel compelled to do likewise. On the other hand, if they encounter unfriendly or hostile behavior they will feel no obligation to help others.  The method of analysis is to set up formal models of the firm which inludes two elements: (1) The compensation policy o f the firm; and (2) The reciprocity hypothesis, as stated above. The interplay between the two will determine how a firm's \"corporate culture\" evolves and how profitability differences among firms come about.   The potential impact of the project is to incorporate elements of \"organizational psychology\" into analytical models of the firm-a largely neglected element in the economic theory of the firm. Then we will study the effect that it has on workers' motivation, on the performance of firm, and on cross sectional comparisons across firms .",
