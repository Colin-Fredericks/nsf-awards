 "awd_abstract_narration": "An instructional laboratory which complements an interactive studio course will be used to teach engineering students the fundamentals of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer. Although these topics have traditionally been taught as separate courses in the mechanical engineering curriculum, in engineering practice they are often inextricably linked. In the present proposal, the study of heat transfer, fluid flow, and thermodynamics will be integrated through the use of case studies. The cases will be introduced in the studio course and further developed in the associated instructional lab for which funding is sought in this proposal Students will learn the basic theory which underlies each case in the studio course, experiment with the actual equipment in the lab, and develop a sound knowledge and understanding of thermal and fluid engineering as a result.   Four separate cases will be explored during the course of the semester. The first will be taken from automotive design and will deal with external flow, convective heat transfer, conduction heat transfer, and psychrometrics. The second will involve thermal processing of materials and will teach radiative heat transfer coupled with conduction and convection. In the third case study, thermodynamic cycles will be introduced through the use of an air conditioning/refrigeration cycle. The final case study explores reacting flow and power production in a gas turbine system. The experiments for the last two cases will be constructed with funds requested under this proposal.   Each case study builds in complexity and relies on principles introduced in earlier cases. Students are motivated to learn because they can quickly see the practical application o~ what is being taught and the relevance of the theoretical knowledge. A unique feature of this proposal is the use of the same cases for both the classroom portion and the laboratory portion of a student's education. By this integrated approach, students will develop both the fundamenta l grounding in theory that is essential in the engineering profession and the mature capability to deal with complex, realistic systems that they will encounter in engineering practice.",
