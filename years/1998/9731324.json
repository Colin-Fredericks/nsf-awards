During each year of this 3-year project there will be a project set up phase, a summer residential component, and an academic year (AY) follow-up. The summer residential component is five weeks long. The project has an emphasis on ecological and environmental research. Each year eight teams of one teacher and two students  will conduct research in a selected natural reserve of Puerto Rico. At the end of the summer teams will make a joint presentation of their findings at a selected site. Interspersed with the research activities are workshops that are intended to prepare teachers and students for research activities; measurement and data analysis skills will be mastered along with just-in-time content. The research activities will be under the supervision of a group of scientists. It is expected that teachers will integrate these experiences into school curricula in the form of forest-related research projects.",
