 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Johnson will continue his studies of the structures and dynamics of nanosolvated anions including electrons.  He will use pulsed ion beam and laser sources to synthesize and characterize (X-)(M)n clusters (X=halide or an excess electron; M=solvent molecule; n=1-100).  Using two optical parametric oscillators (OPOs), he will obtain both vibrational and electronic spectra via photofragmentation action spectroscopy.  He also has ultrafast (100 fs) pump-probe capabilities based on time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy.  Part of this work focuses on further development of the spectroscopic characterization using double resonance strategies or Raman spectroscopy.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to examine the structure and interactions involved when charged ionic species are \"solvated,\" that is, surrounded by a shell of solvent molecules, most often water.  This type of information aids our understanding of the properties of these solvated clusters as well as of the different strengths of bonds within and between the ion and solvent molecules.  With this understanding it is possible, for example, to predict the spectra of solvated ions as well as the course of ion-molecule reactions, both of which are important for applications in ionospheric or plasma chemistry and physics.\r\n",
