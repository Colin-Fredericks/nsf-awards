Couzis/CUNY    A novel idea to develop a simple, fast and cost effective, preliminary screening method will be explored for the development of modified polymers in new applications, such a gas separations and waste remorse from aqueous streams.  This method would allow for the testing of the permeation selectivity properties of a large number of polymers with various side chain structures.  In the approach used, the synthesis of these polymers will not be required, allowing running of screening experiments faster and with significantly reduced cost over the current practices.  To do the use of supported self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of surfactants as models of the polymer membranes will be explored.  The surfactant forming the SAMs will have the same side chain as the membrane-forming polymer, but they are not monomeric and cannot be used in the polymer's synthesis.  Because a very large number of these self-assembling surfactants already exists, model SAMs for a large number of polymers can be formed without the need for any synthetic effort reducing the time required to screen side chains to just a few hours for each sample.  This sample-screening tool would then become an important part in the development efforts for improved polymer membrane materials required by industry.    ***",
