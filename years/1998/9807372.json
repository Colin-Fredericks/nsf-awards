 "awd_abstract_narration": "Felker is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to   continue his ground-state spectroscopic studies of isolated, neutral   molecular clusters, using the technique of mass-selective,   ionization-detected stimulated Raman spectroscopy (IDSRS) developed in   his laboratory.  These studies focus on characterizing the intermolecular   vibrational level structures of neutral clusters, with primary goals of   obtaining information pertaining to intermolecular potential energy   surfaces and collective vibrational modes.  Systems for study include (1)   hydrogen-bonded dimers, including aromatics with water or ammonia, and   water dimers, (2) larger hydrogen-bonded and homogeneous aromatic   clusters, and (3) free radicals and their complexes with rare gas atoms   and small molecules.  The project also includes a computational effort to   simulate intermolecular Raman spectra to facilitate assignment of   observed bands and the extraction of intermolecular potential parameters   from experimental results.  The overall goal of this research program is   to advance the state of knowledge pertaining to how collections of   molecules interact with one another.   Outcomes from these studies are expected to impact the development of   force fields that are used in computer modeling of condensed phase   systems, including biologically important molecules,  molecules adsorbed   onto surfaces and new materials for technological applications.    Discovering detailed properties of water-based clusters, in particular,   could have important ramifications for improved understanding of   environmental and biochemical systems.",
