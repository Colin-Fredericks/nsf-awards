A central topic is the surface transition  from  Friedel   oscillations   to   Charge   Density   Waves.   Friedel  oscillations  at  the  surface will be  imaged  with  a  variable  temperature STM and compared to measurements of the energy  bands  (high-resolution ARPES) and to the response function at the Fermi  energy determined with momentum-resolved electron scattering. The  atomic structure of the surface as a function of temperature will  be  determined  by  combining surface  x-ray  scattering  (simple  analysis) with LEED (for surface sensitivity). The presence of  a  metal-to-nonmetal transition is observable in inelastic  electron  scattering.  Surface phonon dispersion will be measured  by  high  resolution  inelastic electron scattering, and, in collaborations  with  Hulpke  (Germany), using inelastic helium  scattering.  All  work  will  be done in close collaboration with theorists  around  the  world.  Topics of specific interest are: a)  the  transition  from  Friedel  oscillations to a CDW, b) wavelengths  of  Friedel  oscillations for a non-free-electron band structure, c)  role  of  many-body   effects   in   Freidel   oscillations   and   surface  transitions, d) difference of surface screening due to long range  Friedel  oscillations,  via  the temperature  dependence  of  the  surface  phonon  dispersion,  and e)  the  temperature  dependent  surface  structure  driven by the temperature  dependent  surface  response function. This research program is interdisciplinary  in  nature and involves several pre- and post-graduate students,  who  receive   excellent  training  in  preparation  for  careers   in  industry, government laboratories or academia.  %%%  This  experimental research project is devoted  to  the  distinct  behavior  of   the  atoms at the surface of  a  crystalline  metal  compared  to  atoms  located in the bulk of  the  crystal.  These  differences  are subtle and difficult to measure, but  they  have  practical  importance. Surface properties of metals are important  for  example  in chemical catalysis, where the chemical  reagents  involved  come  into contact only with surface atoms.  In  modern  laboratories  advanced  techniques  are  available  which  reveal  specifically the properties of atoms at the surface.  Several  of  the  techniques are the Scanning Tunneling Microscope, Low Energy  Electron  Diffraction, Angle Resolved Photoemission  Spectroscopy  and  high resolution inelastic electron scattering. All of  these  techniques  are  employed in this basic  research  project.  This  basic research will add to the understanding of atomic properties  at  surfaces,  and  could  indirectly  lead,  e.g.,  to  improved  catalysts. This research program is interdisciplinary  in  nature  and involves several pre- and post-graduate students, who receive  excellent  training  in  preparation  for  careers  in  industry,  government laboratories or academia.  ***",
