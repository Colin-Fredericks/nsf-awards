The principal investigator is Dr. Stephen Weber at the University of        Pittsburgh. A 1-day conference + workshop titled \"New Developments in        Chemical Separations from Combinatorial Chemistry and Related        Synthetic Strategies\" will be supported through this grant. The        workshop will be held on August 22nd, 1998, at Boston, in conjunction        with the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society. The role of        this conference/workshop is to bring scientists and engineers working        in separations science together to discuss novel ideas in        combinatorial chemistry that could speed up advances in separation        science. The power of combinatorial chemistry and related synthetic        strategies is being pursued intensively by the pharmaceutical industry        as an efficient way to drug development. The techniques developed by        the pharmaceutical companies have tremendous implications to materials        development and the question therefore arises - can combinatorial        synthesis and related strategies be used in the development of better        separations media?              This conference + workshop seeks to address the question. In a        half-day session, plenary talks will be held to educate across the        barriers of discipline and scale (the conference aspect). In the        second half-day session, the partic ipants will break out into small        groups to develop new ideas. To summarize, a panel will convene to        discuss and comment on the results of the breakout groups. A full        report will be submitted to NSF on the results of the panel        discussions.",
