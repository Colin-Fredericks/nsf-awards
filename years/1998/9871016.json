 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support,  Dr. Craig Spencer of Augustana College will purchase gamma counter to date 210Pb. The system, produced by Eg&G Ortec consists of an integrated system which includes a well-type, germanium detector (HPGa, GWL-120230) with an extra-low background cryostat, a lead shield and a 3-l Liter Dewar. The system includes a digital signal processing based gamma-ray spectrometer which is interfaced to a PC (Gateway Model P5-150) equipped with software developed by EG & Gortec for signal processing and data analysis. The system is designed to detect very low levels of activity, a capability particularly important in obtaining reliable dates for older sediment samples.  Dr. Spencer and his collaborators will continue their paleolimnological studies in northwestern Montana to examine human environment interactions over the last ca. one hundred years. They have collected lake cores from regions which have undergone logging and are attempting to determine the effect of logging on such variables as mass sedimentation rate. Data from logging records as well as examination of satellite photographs permit determination of number of acreage harvested. Analysis of cores can provide information on changes in vegetation and trophic state of the lake as well as sedimentation rate.  In such work accurate dating is essential an the gamma-ray spectrometer provides a means to accomplish this. Augustana College is an undergraduate institution and the instrumentation will serve an important teaching as well as research function.",
