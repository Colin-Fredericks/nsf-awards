A multi-chamber facility with molecular  beam epitaxy (MBE) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) will  allow the study of sub-monolayer films on otherwise flat surfaces  as a function of substrate temperature and elemental V-flux,  quenching to room temperature and measurement of the island  number density, island size, and island separation distributions.  From the combination of these measurements and random walk  simulations diffusion rate versus substrate temperature,  activation energy for diffusion, critical island size for  nucleation, and the role of element V-flux on the elemental III-  atom diffusion will be assessed. These studies will act as a test  bed for a variety of computational models, ranging from first  principles theory to rate equation modeling. The proposed  research provides an excellent vehicle to accomplish a broad  educational objective of expanding career opportunities for  students. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be  involved in research acquiring skills in semiconductor  heterostructure design, processing, and characterization. The PI  will also establish collaborations with national laboratories and  industry. A hands-on lecture-lab course, in which students will  utilize semiconductor samples directly from the MBE system to  fabricate and measure properties of  devices, and to participate  in quantum well laser surface science aspects of  metal-semiconductor interfaces will be developed as part of  research and education integration to enhance studentsO general  experimental and analytical skills, and to improve learning  through discovery.  %%%  The project addresses forefront research issues in a topical area  of materials science having high technological relevance.  The  research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a  fundamental level to important aspect s of electronic materials  and devices. An important feature of the program is the emphasis  on education, and on the integration of research and education  through the training of students in a fundamentally and  technologically significant research area.  ***",
