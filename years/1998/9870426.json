 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870426  Hudspeth  This POWRE study is designed to develop a nuclear based molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for the Peronomycetes (Oomycota; Oomycetes). The phylogenetic interrelationships of these diverse fungal-like members of the kingdom Straminipila, despite the major economic impact of several phytopathogenic members on crop production, is poorly understood. The primary goal is to derive a common database to infer the evolutionary relationship of major genera both within and between established orders. The database is to consist of nucleotide sequences derived from the gapC locus which encodes the essential glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. gapC loci will be amplified by PCR. The nucleotide sequence of the PCR products will be determined either by direct sequencing or by sequencing of cloned products. Taxa to be evaluated include phytopathogenic genera. The inferred phylogenies are to be used in comparison with other molecular and morphologically derived phylogenies both to minimize biases introduced into individual molecular data sets by differential evolutionary rates, and to more accurately reflect the true history of these economically important organisms.",
