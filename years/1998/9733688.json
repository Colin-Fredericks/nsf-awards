 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733688  Schrag    This  award  supports  a program of research,  teaching  and  curriculum  development focused on questions  regarding  the  history  of  oceans and climate over a range of  timescales.  In  one project, we will examine the last several decades of  ocean circulation in the tropical Pacific.  Using corals  as  stationary monitors of surface ocean radiocarbon content, we  will  examine  how bomb-produced radiocarbon has  penetrated  into  the surface ocean, and then has been redistributed  by  upwelling  and the movement of surface currents, essentially  adding  a  time  dimension  to the information  gained  from  surface  water sampling by the GEOSECS program.  The  second  project   is   concerned  with  reconstructing   interannual  variability  in the position of the Indonesian Low  Pressure  System for windows of time several thousand years ago,  with  the  objective of better understanding how ENSO responds  to  changes  in the mean climate state.  We will collect  fossil  corals from uplifted coral reefs in Indonesia from locations  where  oxygen isotope records from modern corals show strong  correlation with ENSO.  The Holocene timeseries we   produce  will  be  compared  with predictions from ocean  circulation  models.   For the teaching component, the award will support  a  new initiative which provides students in government  and  public  policy  exposure to research  in  climatology  as  a  participant in Schrag's research group.",
