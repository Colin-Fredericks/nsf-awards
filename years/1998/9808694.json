 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the nature of constraint  systems that can be used to solve problems in the compile-  time analysis of programs that manipulate arrays.  Accurate  analysis of array references is critical to the automatic  optimization of scientific programs for parallel  supercomputers.  Empirical evidence has shown that this  analysis can be described accurately using constraints  (which is not surprising), and that the resulting  constraints can be manipulated efficiently (which is quite  surprising, given the constraint system involved).  This  project will investigate the apparent discrepancy between  the worst-case complexity of the general constraint solver  (2^2^2^n) and the observed efficiency of constraint-based  dependence analysis, seeking a formal description of a  constraint system that includes many of the cases that arise  during analysis of benchmark programs but can still be  manipulated efficiently.  Such a formal description will  provide a deeper understanding of the practical applications  of constraint manipulation algorithms and provide a guide  for potential users.  The new constraint manipulation  algorithms will be implemented within the framework of the  National Compiler Infrastructure and made freely available.",
