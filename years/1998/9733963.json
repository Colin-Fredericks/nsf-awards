 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733963  Drayton  High performance in communication systems that handle large complex data formats from wireless and multimedia services is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve high frequency @ designs.  This is due to the limited speed/bandwidth capability and cross-talk/interference immunity of electronic designs.  As data size and structure increase, communication systems must operate faster.    Faster speeds can be achieved in two ways: (1) by increasing the operating frequency or (2) by using photonic circuits.  Increasing the operating frequency of electronic systems has an upper performance limit, particularly in terms of cross-talk and interference.  Photonic circuits, on the other hand, can achieve higher speeds hence wider bandwidth and offers excellent cross-talk/ interference immunity.  Unfortunately, the delivery of disparate data types at very fast rates has been achieved in telecommunication applications using photonic devices, but these designs types are not readily available for microwave applications.    This proposal will focus on developing innovative package and circuit design methodologies for HF circuits using a multidisciplinary approach.  This approach will involve three general areas: (1) advanced materials, such as polymers and M-V's, (2) advanced processing techniques, such as micromachining, and (3) design methods for microwave and optical integrated circuits.  Collectively, these areas will be used to address the research and educational needs for novel HF circuit designs and for HF designers of future communication systems.    The goals of this research plan are    - to explore the use of novel photonic designs to achieve functions traditionally performed by microwave circuits;    - to use polymers and III-V materials with micromachining techniques to develop packages and circuits based on the microwave and optical integrated circuits;    - to develop methodologies for packages and circuit components;      - to develop circuit components implemented in silico n platform for system-level integration,    - to study how photonic waves interact with high frequency electronic circuits (f > microwaves)      The goals of the education plan are    - to offer modem applied problems into conventional learning environments (i.e. the classroom and laboratory);    - to provide interactive learning methods in our classroom environment via hands-on laboratory and classroom interactions;      - to use multi-disciplinary approaches to solve classical and modem applied problems;    - to provide up-to-date learning opportunities through distance learning tools (i.e. internet and Web-based learning modules) to re-educate practicing engineers and other researchers in the field.    This plan will impact the development of novel design methodologies for HF applications.    The multi-disciplinary approach will allow advanced materials and novel fabrication processes to be investigated during the development states of design, potentially yielding low cost approaches.  Furthermore, the implementation of microwave and optical integrated circuits to achieve microwave functionality will allow the realization of more flexible design schemes in mixed signal platforms.
