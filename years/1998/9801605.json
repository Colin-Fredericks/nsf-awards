We propose to give realizations of irreducible \r\nrepresentations as holomorphic sections on a Stein\r\nextension of the Riemannian symmetric space G/K.  The advantage of \r\nthis approach is that it gives realizations of irreducible representations \r\nin a purely holomorphic setting, thus allowing methods from complex \r\nanalysis such as Hardy space techniques.  Let us call such a Stein extension \r\nM.  The important properties M should possess are: (a) M is a\r\nStein domain in a complexification of G/K,  (b) M depends only on the \r\ngroup G, and (c) A large number of representations should occur as spaces \r\nof holomorphic sections on M.  This project has two separate parts.\r\nFirst we will realize irreducible unitary representations using Szego \r\nkernels.  The representations occur as spaces of\r\nholomorphic functions on M and the boundary values and inner product will \r\nbe described in an explicit and natural way.  We will also determine the \r\nproper space M.  If G is of hermitian type then G/KxG/K is the correct \r\nchoice for M .  Otherwise there are some candidates for M, namely a \r\nparameter space of maximal compact subvarieties of an appropriate flag domain \r\nand the maximal domain in the complexification of G/K for which the Szego \r\nkernel extends holomorphically.  These two candidates may turn out to be \r\nessentially the same (as in the known cases).  We will need a simple \r\nexplicit description of M and its boundary.\r\nOur second project is to study the indefinite quantization of elliptic \r\ncoadjoint orbits.  The goal is to explicitly give the unitary structure \r\non the representations occurring in the Dolbeault cohomology of an elliptic \r\ncoadjoint \r\norbit.  This is continuation of previous collaborations.\r\n     \r\nSymmetries play an fundamental role in mathematics and physics.  Semisimple \r\nLie groups provide a technical tool for studying such symmetries.  For \r\nexample a  quantum mechanical system is, in part, a Hilbert space\r\non which the group of symmetries acts.  This is a representation of \r\nthe group.  Other representations occur very naturally in many areas \r\nof pure mathematics, such as number theory, classical analysis and\r\nprobability.  A fundamental problem is to classify all irreducible unitary \r\nrepresentations.  Along with this classification is the problem of constructing \r\nthe representations.  Our project is concerned with constructing \r\nunitary representations in a very natural way.  Such an understanding \r\nof representations will lead to more applications of the theory to \r\nconcrete physical problems as well as other areas of pure math.\r\n     \r\n     \r\n",
