 "awd_abstract_narration": "9805602\r\nTodd\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to continue a broad set of ongoing studies concerning optimization algorithms and the mathematical theory underlying them.  The project covers continuous and discrete optimization algorithms, both exact and approximate, their computational complexity, practical large-scale implementation, performance guarantees (in the case of approximate algorithms), and applications in such areas as crew-scheduling, image-processing, facility location, financial modeling, electrical power systems, and statistical learning theory.\r\n\r\nThe research to be conducted can be roughly grouped into three areas.  The first is interior-point methods, including the study of: semidefinite programming, algorithm design and analysis; infeasible-interior-point methods for both linear and convex programming, including detection of infeasibility; the complexity of target-following methods and of semidefinite programming; and methods for large-scale nonlinear problems arising in image-processing, financial modeling, and statistical learning theory.  The second area of research is combinatorial optimization, encompassing:  investigation of stable-set and crew-scheduling problems; the study of linear congruence relations and their use in branch-and-cut methods; analysis of inconsistent linear inequality systems, with applications in computer vision, data compression, and statistical discriminant analysis; and design of approximation algorithms for facility location problems.  The third is concerned with numerical linear algebra, and will study: methods to solve the linear systems that arise at each iteration of an interior-point semidefinite programming algorithm in a stable manner; and special methods for obtaining accurate solutions to ill-conditioned linear systems arising in electrical power systems.\r\n\r\nThis research will lead to improved algorithms to find exact or approximate solutions to large-scale optimization problems arising in industry, finance, the military, science, and engineering.  Emphasis is placed on the interplay between practice and theory.\r\n\r\n",
