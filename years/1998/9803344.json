 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803344  Mason   Large sample problems in probability and statistics concern what happens to   processes or statistics when the sample size increases to infinity. The investigator plans to    work in three areas in which such problems naturally arise. These are the following: 1.   self-normalized sums, 2. generalized extremes, and 3. weighted  approximations.  The   problems in area 1 originate from the long standing question concerning the possible   asymptotic distributions of the classical Student's t-statistic. Those in area 2 stem from   questions about the limiting distribution of extreme values, such as annual maximum   temperatures, river heights and largest incomes in a population. He generalizes the notion   of extremes to a multivariate setting and proposes to study its large sample properties.   Finally in area 3, he intends to look  into methods of approximating finite sample   processes that arise from testing for dependence in data by an asymptotic process. This   should provide a useful tool to determine the limiting distribution of many functionals of   such finite sample processes.   Solutions to problems in all three areas of research should have numerous   applications in statistical inference and estimation, especially in multivariate and dependent   situations, whenever large samples are available. Eventually, it is hoped that many of the   results will lead to the construction of data analytic tools which will enter into the   everyday practice of statistics. In any case they should improve our understanding of an   interesting range of random behavior.",
