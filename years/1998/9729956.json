 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Julieann Van Nest will conduct one season of geoarchaeological research at the Mound House site which is located in the Illinois River floodplain in Greene Country Illinois. The site itself documents a time span of over 10,000 years of human prehistory beginning during the Early Archaic period (ca. 8500 B.C.) and extending through 19th and 20th Century Euroamerican settlement. The most extensive occupation appears to have been made by Middle Woodland peoples (ca. 50 B.C. - A.D. 250) who built at least two and perhaps as many as five earthworks. The `moundbuilder phenomenon` is widespread during this time period in the Southeastern and Midwest United States and indicates a surprisingly advanced level of social organization which permitted relatively large numbers of individuals to work together under centralized control for extended periods of time to construct such monuments. Based on archeological evidence, the functions of the mounds varied serving as burial structures in some instances and as house/temple platforms in others. Although it has not been the focus of intense study, archaeologists have noted that various construction techniques were employed and it some cases it is even possible to note individual piles or basketfulls of earth served to form the structure. Because the sides of mounds are severely eroded, it is difficult to reconstruct the original shape.  Dr. Van Nest will pursue geological research to shed light on the construction process. She will extract a series of cores from both the mounds themselves and the surrounding region. She will also examine excavated sections within the mound and with these data work to separate human construction from the complex natural geological processes which occur on an active floodplain. Dr. Van Nest hopes to locate the specific sources for the sod and earth which was used. Preliminary research indicates that some materials were transported considerable distances. With such information it is possible to gauge the amount of person power which construction entailed.  This research will shed new light on prehistoric Native American social organization. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists and assist in the career development of a very promising young scientist.",
