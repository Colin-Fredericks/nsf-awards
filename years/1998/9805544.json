 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hoppensteadt  9805544       The investigators introduce a novel methodology for use in  mathematical neuroscience: Rather than studying a single model of  a particular brain structure, they consider the family of all its  models.  They use invariant manifold, bifurcation, and singular  perturbation theories to prove that under certain natural  conditions there is a continuous, noninvertible change of  variables that converts every member of the family into a  canonical model.  They derive canonical models for weakly  connected networks of excitable, oscillatory and bursting  neurons, arising in studies of the thalamus, hippocampus and  neocortex.       Exact equations are rarely known to describe biological  systems.  As a result, various people can use various models for  the same biological system, but obtain contradictory results.  A  reasonable way to resolve this is to study ALL possible models of  the same biological system at once.  The investigators develop and  use state-of-the-art methodologies in system science to show that  if a biological system is near a critical regime, then all its  models are related to a simpler one, called a canonical model.  An  advantage of this approach is that the plausibility of the  canonical model rests only on the plausibility of the critical  regime, but not on the choice of equations describing details of  the biological system.  This approach enables them to derive  simple but exact models for such complex brain structures as the  thalamus, hippocampus and neocortex operating near a critical  regime, such as the onset of rhythmic activity.  These models are  used to study attention, memorization and navigation in behaving  animals.  In addition, these studies may shed light on  neurocomputational properties of these brain structures with  possible applications to neuroengineering and computer design.",
