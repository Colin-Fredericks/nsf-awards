 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731677  LEE    This award initiates the Center for Power Electronic Systems, an Engineering Research Center (ERC).  The lead university for the ERC is the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and the following universities are core partners:  the University of Wisconsin at Madison, the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the North Carolina A&T State University, and the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez.  The award funds the first five years of effort under a new cooperative agreement, with a potential duration of ten years.  The vision of the proposed Center for Power Electronics System (C-PES) is to provide the nation with the technological capabilities to become a world leader in Power Electronics.  The Center's vision for power vision for power electronics technology will make the US the most efficient user of electrical energy in the world through the widespread use of power electronics systems, improve industrial productivity and competitiveness, eliminate the roadblock to further advancements in computer and telecommunication technologies, and enable the hybrid electric vehicle technology.    The C-PES strategy is to integrate research in a systems-level approach the form of Integrated Power Electronics Modules (IPEMs), and to focus upon the lower power range of power electronics (1kW-200kW), for example, packaged drivers foor air conditioning and refrigeration for domestic and industrial applications, hybrid electric vehicles, high performance adjustable speed drives for industrial automation, distributed power supply systems for ultra-low voltage and high speed very large scale integrated circuits (VLSI) and future generation of processors.  The ERC will create an affiliate program of industrial partners to initiate a demonstration program in each of the applications areas, joint with industrial partners, and concurrently transfer technology to industry.  The ERC will create an education program including curriculum developments and collaboration, cross-linking distan ce-learning (satellite, video and the Internet), joint team teaching, co-operative Ph.D. programs, a wider range of options for students, an exchange program, a Virtual Corporation.  This Engineering Research Center will significantly increase in the number of students graduating with expertise in power electronics.  The collaboration with the North Carolina A&T State University and the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez will play a strong role in increasing the number of graduates from under-represented minorities in the field.      This action is the outcome of the entry of this ERC's pre-proposal in the FY 1997-1998 Engineering Research Centers Competition under the ERC Program Announcement, NSF 97-5.",
