 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804112  This research focuses on the development of specification-based  testing techniques for concurrent programs.  The techniques being  investigated are a combination of model-based and constraint-  based testing techniques.  For a given finite-state machine M,  model-checking tools are used to find a list of temporal logic  constraints that are satisfied by M.  The constraints explicitly  characterize M's logical branching structure, which otherwise  appears only implicitly in the states and transitions of the  finite-state machine.  Test sequences are selected to cover the  logical branches identified by the constraints.  The objective of  this research is to develop a structural testing methodology for  finite state machine specifications that is not based on covering  every state or transition.  Two methods for addressing the state  explosion problem during model-based test generation are being  investigated.  The first method, called specification slicing, is  used to partition a finite-state model into several smaller sub-  models that are used for test generation.  The second method is  called compositional testing.  During compositional testing, test  coverage properties are established for sub-models and these  properties automatically hold for the whole system.  Whether  these two methods can be used to avoid the costly construction of  complete system models for test generation is being  investigated.***",
