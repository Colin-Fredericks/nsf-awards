 "awd_abstract_narration": "9807476  Bingman    A large body of research has established the crucial role of  the  hippocampus  in learning and memory.  In  animals,  the  hippocampus  is  particularly important for  learning  about  space.  Of special interest are electrophysiological studies  in  rats  that  have  demonstrated the existence  of  \"place  cells\", cells that respond when an animal is in a particular  location in its environment.  It is generally believed  that  these  place  cells participate in the neural representation  (map)  of  environmental  space  that  enables  animals   to  efficiently  navigate  among  goal  locations.   Given   the  importance of this research for understanding brain/behavior  relations, it is surprising that place cells have only  been  intensively  studied in rats.  But to  what  extent  do  the  properties  of  place  cells in  rats  generalize  to  other  vertebrate  species and to what extent are they a  necessary  design    feature    of   hippocampal    mediated    spatial  representations?   The  proposed  research  is  designed  to  investigate  the possible existence and eventual  properties  of   cells  in  the  bird  hippocampus  that  display  space  specificity  (i.e.  place-like cells).  Electrophysiological  recordings of single units in the hippocampus will be  taken  from  pigeons  allowed  to freely  move  in  an  open  field  environment.   Unit  activity data will then  be  correlated  with   simultaneously  recorded  location  information  from  pigeons to determine if a unit responds preferentially  when  a pigeon is in a particular location.  The data will then be  used  to  determine whether rats and pigeons,  species  that  have  a  hippocampus used for spatial learning but otherwise  very  different  in terms of lifestyle, behavior  and  brain  organization, represent space similarly at the neural level.  The  study  could  fundamentally  change  how  we  view  the  hippocampus  and the spatial representations it  constructs,  the   environmental/beha vioral  features  that  control  the  activity  of  hippocampal cells, and the  evolution  of  the  relationship between brain and cognition.",
