 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Dissertation Improvement research examines the process leading to both juvenile delinquency and adolescent depression among male and female adolescents.  Research on gender and delinquency consistently shows that males and females express deviance in different ways. While males are much more likely than females to engage in law-violating behaviors, females are more likely than males to suffer depression. This has led researchers to propose that: (1) delinquency and depression are the outcomes of a similar process, and (2) the process leading to these outcomes is acted upon by gender in ways that result in different forms of deviance - delinquency versus depression - for males and for females.     To develop an explanation of these differences, this research will draw on both criminological and mental health research to explore the possibility that macro-level social changes in the roles of men and women play an important part in defining persistent stress - including marital conflict, role overload, and the use of power-assertive discipline - within families. This persistent stress within families, in turn, may influence the ability of parents to raise well-adjusted, nondeviant adolescents. A central focus of this research will be on how gender ideologies influence this process to result in different forms of deviance for male and female youth who are exposed to persistent familial stress. After developing an explanation of the process leading to both delinquency and depression, the project will derive specific hypotheses and test them using data from a national sample of youth. The proposed models will be estimated separately for males and for females using the maximum likelihood procedures for covariance structure analysis in LISREL 8. These models will also be estimated simultaneously for males and females using the cross-groups option of LISREL. Cross-population models allow for the assessment of the relative magnitudes of causal paths across gender. Specifically, cross-population model s allow for tests of interactions between gender and the processes leading to delinquency and depression by constraining particular parameters to be invariant across groups.    In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.",
