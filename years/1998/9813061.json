 "awd_abstract_narration": "9813061  LYONS  The extreme environment of the McMurdo Dry Valleys will be  the focus of a Long Term Ecological Research(LTER)project  located approximately 100 km west of McMurdo Station,  Antarctica.  The dry valleys are among the most extreme  deserts in the world.  The perennially ice-covered lakes,  ephemeral streams, and extensive areas of soil within the  valleys are subject to low temperatures, very limited  precipitation, and salt accumulation.  The biological  systems in the valleys are relatively simple, with no  vascular plants or vertebrates and very few insects.  Trophic interactions and biogeochemical nutrient cycles are  largely limited to microbial populations and micro-  invertebrates.  Species diversity and abundance are low as  would be predicted for such extreme environments.  Despite  this simplicity, complex interactions among species and  between the biological and physico-chemical environment  exist in the lakes, streams and soils.  Furthermore,  interactions between various components of the ecosystem  enhance the overall productivity of the dry valley  landscapes.  All ecosystems are shaped to varying degrees by  climate and material transport, but nowhere is this more  apparent than in the dry valleys.  The obvious effects of an  extreme environment coupled with the general simplicity of  ecosystem structure makes the dry valleys an ideal location  to study these basic relationships.  Two central hypotheses  will be the focus of this research:  1) The structure and  function of dry valley ecosystems are primarily controlled  by physical constraints, and 2) The structure and function  of dry valley ecosystems are modified by material transport.  The dry valley LTER will address these hypotheses and the  five core areas of LTER research emphasis through a program  of systematic environmental data collection, long-term  experiments, and model development.  Efforts will focus on  the integration of the biological processes within and  material transport between the lakes,  streams and  terrestrial ecosystems comprising the McMurdo Dry Valley  landscape.",
