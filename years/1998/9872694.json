 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coastal  environments  in the  southeastern  U.S.  are  expected to undergo unprecedented population growth  in  the  next  20  years  (LUCES,  1996).   Accompanying  this  human  expansion will be significant increases in land use and  the  potential   for   dramatic  effects   upon   resources   and  environmental  quality.   To be  prepared  to  handle  these  issues,   our  educational  systems  need  to  provide   the  technology, methodology, and information required to assess,  predict,   and   improve   marine  resources   and   coastal  environmental quality.         African Americans remain significantly underrepresented  in  marine  and environmental science.  In early recognition  of  both  the  need for and absence of black  participation,  Savannah  State  University (SSU) applied for  and  received  assistance  from  NSF  in  1970  to  provide  and  equip  an  undergraduate  curricular option in marine  science.   Since  then,  the  College of Sciences and Technology has  added  a  program  in  biotechnology. These combined  degree  programs  provide  a  liberal arts base with fundamental knowledge  in  the  basic  sciences,  and exposure to nominal  methods  and  tools in marine and environmental science and biotechnology.  However,  predominantly  undergraduate  educational  schools  such   as   SSU   simply  do  not  have  the  resources   or  justification  to  develop  and  maintain  extensive  modern  research  facilities.  Thus their students, while  receiving  fine classroom instruction, do not have the exposure to  and  training in sophisticated research environments.  Those  who  do,  generally receive it during summer research experiences  outside   the  state  or  region.   Without  such  exposure,  students  will  be  less competitive  than  those  who  have  received formal training in research.          The CIRE project proposed here would take advantage of  a  fortuitous  geographic  and  administrative  relationship  between  SSU  and  the  Skidaway Institut e  of  Oceanography  (SKIO),  a  nearby state-of-the-art marine and environmental  research  facility, and which is an NSF  Field  Station  and  Marine  Lab (FSML).  As members of the University System  of  Georgia, which administers all of the public educational and  research  units in the state of Georgia, SSU and  SKIO  have  the  potential to create formal ties.  In the past, however,  these  relationships have developed only on an ad-hoc basis.  Here,  they  propose  a collaboration  which  would  include  diversification of existing courses at SSU by  inclusion  of  teaching  and  research  modules  by  SKIO  faculty;  formal  detailed training in research via research assistantships at  SKIO  for qualified SSU student interns; reciprocal  faculty  exchange   opportunities;   and   collaborative   curriculum  development.  Educational programs at SSU would benefit from  access to SKIO's research facilities, and SKIO would benefit  from  developing formal ties to degree-granting  educational  institutions.  In recognition of the growth and  success  of  undergraduate   degree  programs  in  marine   biology   and  environmental studies, and in view of the potential value of  this collaboration, SSU is planning to submit for approval a  new  M.S.  degree  program in Marine Science.   It  will  be  seeking support from the University System of Georgia to buy  faculty  time  at  SKIO to share their  expertise  with  SSU  students  and  faculty; this procedure,  however,  may  take  several  years  to fully implement.  The CIRE  project  will  assist that process, provide experience for faculty at  both  institutions, and give the opportunity to document  for  the  University  System  of  Georgia that  the  collaboration  is  appropriate   and   successful.   The  organization   of   a  competitive  framework for research training, the  provision  for expanding the depth and diversity of existing courses at  SSU,  and the collaboration between SSU and SKIO faculty  in  teaching,  research, and  curriculum development, will  go  a  long way towards enchancing the opportunities and quality of  training   in   marine   and  environmental   sciences   and  biotechnology at SSU.",
