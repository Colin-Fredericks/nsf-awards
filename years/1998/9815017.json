The new international study that would be designed by this project would be an outgrowth of previous IEA studies of the use of computers in the classroom.  Two research questions will be addressed: How can we improve the effectiveness of technology in supporting education and educational change? And, what types of reflective dialogue among participants from different countries are necessary to enable the transfer and adaptation of technology-based educational innovations across barriers of culture and language?  The project will compile methodologies and findings from existing studies; solicit position papers on lessons learned; compile and analyze existing exemplary projects in the U.S.; draft model research designs; assemble a working group to review progress; convene a panel of scientists to project future science uses of technology; and prepare a statement of research priorities.\r\n\r\nThe project would identify model practices, review their outcomes, and build a base of knowledge about the implementation and sustainability of these model practices.  It would work with the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA).\r\n",
