 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810466  B.Kutter    This action is to support a workshop in Davis, CA, during 1998, to  discuss  the needs in geotechnical engineering and engineering seismology  within the  proposed National Network for High Performance Seismic Simulation  (NHPS).  While the focus is on the needs within geotechnical engineering,  the  interface with facilities for structural and coastal engineering  seismic  simulation will be considered.  The proposed NHPS responds to the need, expressed via a series of  workshops extending over a period of twenty years, to obtain  experimental  data on the behavior of engineering materials, soils, and  constructed  facilities during earthquake strong-ground shaking.  Integral to  the NHPS  is the concept of connecting the experimental facilities via a  modern  high-performance computer and communication network in order to  enhance the  capabilities of the individual facilities through synergism, and  to provide  remote access by off-site users.  It is planned to extend the  network to  include key experimental facilities around the world.  The objective of this workshop is to discuss challenging research  topics  to be addressed, and the specific experimental facilities needed  to perform  the associated experiments.  It is expected that the deliberations of this workshop will: (1)  contribute to a clearer definition of the experimental facilities  to be  included within the NHPS, and the experiments that can be  undertaken using  these facilities; and (2) begin a discussion of important culture  changes  associated with the NHPS resulting from remote access  capabilities, the  rapid dissemination of results, and the need to give appropriate  authorship  credit for the rapid publication of experimental results.  ***",
