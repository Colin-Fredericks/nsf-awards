 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 98-08657  SCHMAUSS      This study uses genetically modified mice with cells that lack  two proteins known to be involved in the processing of  neurochemical information in the brain. This information is  mediated by an important neurotransmitter chemical, dopamine,  which is released as a signal by other nerve cells and normally  interacts directly with these two receptor proteins. By studying  the consequences of a \"loss of functions\" in these mice, the  experiments will define the precise functions of these two  receptor proteins. It is known, that both proteins modulate  (alter) motor, cognitive, and motivational behavior. However, how  they modulate this behavior is still unknown. The study therefore  aims to find which particular form of these receptor molecules is  targeted to which particular area of nerve cells to be made  accessible to dopamine and thus, to mediate specific functions.  Furthermore, the expression (occurrence in cells) of other  molecules of the brain whose function is tightly associated with  the activity of the two receptor proteins that are missing in the  genetically modified mice will be studied to determine whether  these molecules are also essential for mediating the effects of  dopamine. Finally, another series of experiments studies the role  of the two receptor proteins for the normal development of the  brain. Altogether, the goal of the study is to obtain novel and  important information about some of the fundamental biological  mechanisms by which the brain processes information that is  mediated by one of its major neurotransmitters.",
