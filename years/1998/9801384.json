 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9801384  Hu    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will provide a new solution to the problem of constructing the interior information of a three-dimensional object from its projection measurements acquired with a large area detector and cone-shaped x-ray beams.  This study is fundamental to the volumetric CT scanner development.  In Phase I, it has been demonstrated that a new approach, developed by the Principal Investigator using circle-and-line scan path for data collection and a \"hybrid-type\" of reconstruction algorithm for data processing, combines the strengths and eliminates the weakness of two most popular (widely-used) classes of approaches.  In the Phase II research, this new approach will be further refined and developed for final commercialization.  Its performance advantages in terms of improving information fidelity, operating speed, applicability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of the volumetric CT scanner will be further demonstrated using x-ray data from potential customers -- CT manufacturers and other research groups.  A software package of this new approach will be developed for use with the general-purpose computers.  Commercial applications of this technology will be identified.    The successful development of this new approach will accelerate the commercialization and the acceptance of the volumetric CT scanner, which in turn, will generate fundamental impacts in manufacturing industries, medicine, security and safety inspection, as well as in material science and engineering.  Successful applications in these areas can enhance national competitiveness and improve the well being of the public.  ***",
