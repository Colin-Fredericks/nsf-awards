 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at California State University, Los Angeles, wishes to establish a parallel computing environment. This will be accomplished by connecting a SUN SPARC station (as the main server) to an existing laboratory of 25 IBM compatible microcomputers, all to be connected by a network. The SUN SPARC station is a multiprocessor computer initially with four processors, but can be upgraded to six processors. The server will be dedicated to the teaching of courses in parallel and distributed computing, using shared memory and message passing interface architectures. These architectures have emerged as the most viable of various parallel architectures. Parallel and Distributed processing is now recognized as an important area in computer sciences, enabling the solution of problems with hundreds of thousands of variables, hitherto considered impossible to solve in real time. At present we offer only an introductory course parallel computing with minimal computing facility. For most students, parallel and distributed programming concepts remain abstract and difficult to understand if lecture material is not followed by laboratory exercises that crystallize the concepts and help in successful assimilation of the material. The hardware and software to be bought will alleviate this problem. Additionally, with such a laboratory setup we will also be able to teach other courses in parallel computing in the future. The experience gained through this practical approach will not only be beneficial to computer science students but also attract students from other disciplines such as mathematics, physical sciences and engineering.",
