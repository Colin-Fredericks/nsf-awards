 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800869  Yu    The investigator  proposes to study the K-theory of  Roe algebras and group C* algebras.  The  K-theory  of Roe algebras and group C* algebras both serve as  receptacles of higher indices of elliptic operators and have  important   applications to problems in  differential geometry and topology such as the existence problem for Riemannian metrics with positive scalar curvature, the Novikov conjecture on the homotopy invariance of higher signatures, and the zero-in-the-spectrum conjecture on the spectra  of Laplacians.  The methods to be employed   include controlled operator K-theory, infinite dimensional almost flat bundles, cyclic cohomology, and combinatorial Chern-Connes characters.         Manifolds are spaces glued together by Euclidean spaces. Examples of manifolds include spheres and tori. In differential geometry one studies how  manifolds are  curved. For example a flat piece of paper has zero curvature while the sphere has positive curvature. This is why we can not bend a piece of paper into a sphere.  A basic problem in differential geometry is to determine when a manifold can have positive scalar curvature. Another  important problem in   mathematics is the classification of  manifolds. By surgery theory the classification problem for higher dimensional manifolds  can be essentially  reduced to  the Novikov conjecture. The K-theoretic higher indices of certain elliptic differential operators can be used to attack the positive scalar curvature problem and the Novikov conjecture. A key step in this analytic approach is the computation of the K-theory of Roe algebras and group C* algebras.",
