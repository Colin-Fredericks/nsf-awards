Concurrently, seismic structural design practice is evolving  towards  consideration of performance-based criteria, which provide more  reliable  representations of structural behavior during earthquakes. A  missing link,  however, is empirically verified design procedures for assessing  the  effects of soil-structure interaction (SSI) on both the strong  motions  transmitted to structures and the structural response to these  motions.  Fortuitously, a significant amount of strong motion data has  become  available over the last decade which affords the opportunity to  obtain this  empirical verification.  This is the objective of this CAREER  project.    The research component of this project utilizes strong motion data  in  system identification analyses to evaluate the effects of inertial  and  kinematic interaction on the seismic response of buildings through  more  fundamental representations of SSI; namely impedance and transfer  functions. These empirical results are compiled from analyses of  data  having suitable combinations of structural and free-field strong  motion  recordings. Empirical results derived from strong motion data are  combined  with data from forced vibration testing of structures and results  of  numerical analyses to develop a framework for understanding the  factors  influencing impedance and transfer functions. These results will  elucidate  several important sources o f uncertainty in SSI analysis  procedures, such  as the modeling of non-uniform site conditions, and the effects of  foundation embedment and/or deep foundation elements (i.e. piles  and piers)  on foundation performance.    The educational component of this project seeks to improve the  teaching of  earthquake engineering at UCLA, to enhance knowledge transfer to  practicing  engineers, and to encourage pre-college students to pursue careers  in  science and technology. The teaching of earthquake- and  geotechnical-engineering at UCLA is improved at the undergraduate  and  graduate levels through curriculum reform (including the addition  of new  courses), and the utilization of an instructional style which  blends  fundamental theory with \"field\" data and practical design  problems.  Knowledge transfer to practicing engineers is facilitated through  continuing  education workshops and service on professional committees.  Outreach to  pre-college students consists of lectures and demonstrations in  local  middle- and high-school science classes. The research plan  compliments these  educational objectives by providing \"field\" data that can be  utilized in  classroom instruction.    These unified educational and research plans reflect the  philosophy that  research and teaching of complex seismic and geotechnical  phenomena must  blend sound physical principles with well documented field  performance data  in order to gain insight into a problem.      +=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=  +  Clifford J.
