 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Patrick Kirch and his colleagues will continue their highly successful archaeological research at sites located on the Hawaiian islands of Moloka'i and Maui. The team and others have located a number of house compounds and ritual structures which date from the period between A.D. 1200 - 1795 and these will form the focus for excavation. The group will collect both cultural and ecofactual data to: determine variability in territorial settlement  patterns over time; reconstruct the chronology of settlement and land use;  analyze architectural,  food resource and prestige-good variation within household units; determine the distribution of non-  local stone resources between territorial units; examine the agricultural and marine resource  production base which supported the economy; learn how ritual architecture changed over time and  space; and study the environmental effects of intensive land use.   For many years anthropologists  have used Polynesia as a unique test case to determine how state level societies evolved. The  Polynesian islands were settled by a single cultural group over a relatively short period and at the  time of contact they evidenced forms of social organization which varied greatly in complexity.  Through carefully controlled comparisons scientists have attempted to place them in a developmental  sequence and to explain the different stages reached in environmental terms. The highest degree of  complexity was reached in Hawaii and ethnographers believe that in late prehistoric times a state  level of organization was achieved. Dr. Kirch wishes to examine this process. He correctly notes that  only archaeology can produce the data which can trace this step by step, and the goal of the research  is to recover such information.  This research is important for several reasons. It will yield insight  into the processes of state formation an will provide data of interest to many archaeologists.",
