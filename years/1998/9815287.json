 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to explore the potential of Science and Technology Studies (STS) for engaging students not otherwise drawn to technical fields, particularly women and ethnic minorities, we are organizing a two-day workshop that will bring together a variety of scholars, administrators and activists to discuss environmental issues involving Chester, Pennsylvania.  Chester is home to a concentration of waste facilities that includes trash transfer operations, trash-to-energy incinerators, a medical waste sterilization plant and a regional wastewater facility.  Chester has also been the site of heated, enduring conflicts over scientific and social issues.  The workshop will consider the full range of such issues, including Chester's environmental history, the scientific community's approach to Chester's problems, and ways the university and its students might positively influence relations among the actors in this story.  We will work toward a set of practical steps that will incorporate our findings into environmental science and engineering curricula, then translate those into a broader set of tools that might have wider applicability.  Following the workshop, conference organizers and selected participants will create a workbook that will describe these curricular and institutional innovations.",
