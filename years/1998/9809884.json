 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9809884  Walker  This research is aimed at understanding how environmental factors interact with the receptors in plants to influence plant growth and development.  Because plants must adapt to an ever-changing environment it is important to understand how information is transmitted between cells and how a response is evoked in the plant cell.  This process of perception, transmission and processing of biological information is known as signal transduction.  The research in this proposal is looking at the interaction of a plant plasma membrane receptor with protein kinase activity, which has been found to interact with a protein phosphatase.  The hypothesis to be tested here is that this phosphatase dephosphorylates the activated receptor and turns off the signaling response.   The regulation of signaling receptors is an important and active area of biological research, and these studies will provide important information in this area.  ***  The research in this grant is looking at the regulation of plant receptors which respond to environmental factors and affect plant growth and development.  These studies will provide a better understanding of the molecular basis of the response of plants to extracellular signals.",
