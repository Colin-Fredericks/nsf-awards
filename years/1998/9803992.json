 "awd_abstract_narration": "Levine  9803992       The investigator and his collaborators develop models of  angiogenesis.  Angiogenesis is a process whereby capillary sprouts  from a pre-existing vasculature are formed in response to  externally supplied chemical stimuli.  The sprouts, driven by  endothelial cell migration and mitosis, develop and organize  themselves into a dendritic structure.  Angiogenesis has been  observed for example during embryogenesis, wound healing,  arthritic development and during the growth of solid tumors.  This  process is thought to occur in three steps: the degradation of  the vascular membrane and interstitial matrix by endothelial  cells, the migration and proliferation of the latter, and finally  tubulogenesis.  This project is specifically directed at  constructing and analyzing mathematical models of tumor  angiogenesis.  These models are based on the idea of reinforced  random walks combined with nonstandard reaction-diffusion  mechanisms to describe how capillary sprouts are formed and how  endothelial cells migrate into the interstitial cellular matrix.  In particular, the modeling includes chemo-attraction via certain  tumor angiogenesis factors emitted from the tumors and haptotaxis  via secretion of fibronectin from the endothelial cells.  Fundamental objectives of the study are to suggest testable  hypotheses for the capillary sprout formation and to understand  the mechanisms for anastomosis and the branching of capillaries.  The goal is to use the models to suggest strategies whereby  capillary sprout growth can be impeded and consequently inhibit  the spread of capillary networks.  By preventing the capillary  dendritic structure from reaching the tumor, the tumor will be  starved of a blood supply.  Consequently tumor cells will be  prevented from metastasizing to other parts of the body.       Several years ago, Dr.  Judah Folkman of Children's Hospital,  Boston, proposed a model for malignant tumor growth.  It is known  that an avascular tumor (a tumor without a blood sup ply) can only  grow to a certain size before it begins to die because of oxygen  insufficiency.  Folkman suggested that as it dies, it sends out a  chemical signal that induces the body to produce a second  chemical (called a tumor angiogenic factor, TAF).  TAF, in turn,  diffuses through the surrounding body tissue to nearby capillary  vessels where it creates openings in the capillary walls.  The  (endothelial) cells that line all capillary walls are then able  to leak through these openings and follow the chemical trail left  by the TAF back to the tumor, forming new capillaries as they go.  These secondary capillaries then deliver oxygen directly to the  tumor, enabling it to grow more rapidly than it could in the  avascular state.  In order to inhibit the tumor growth, it has  been suggested that it might be possible to use certain  anti-angiogenic factors (antigens) to inhibit the action of the  TAF and thus not only starve the tumor by preventing the growth  of these secondary capillaries but also prevent the spread of  tumor cells to other parts of the body through the circulatory  system.  The investigator and his collaborators aim to put  Folkman's mechanism on a quantitative footing by developing a  mathematical model that is both descriptive and predictive.  That  is, the model will not only aid in the understanding of Folkman's  ideas at a fundamental scientific level but can also be used to  suggest strategies whereby capillary growth can be impeded and  consequently inhibit the spread of capillary networks.  The model  should ultimately suggest optimal dosages of antigens needed to  prevent capillaries from reaching the tumor, thus minimizing risk  to the patient as the tumor is deprived of a blood supply.  On a  more positive note, the same models could perhaps also be used to  effectively model a mechanism by which capillary sprout growth  can be encouraged, such as in embryo development or wound  healing, by isolating those factors that encourage such growth.",
