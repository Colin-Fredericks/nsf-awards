Materials being studied include a  newly discovered zirconium-titanium-copper-nickel-beryllium  bulk  metallic   glasses,  as  well  as  highly  ordered   hydrogenated  amorphous  silicon made by hot filament assisted  chemical  vapor  deposition.  The  main tool of investigation is nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR) which probes structural dynamics at  the  atomic  level. Of interest is the rate of structural relaxation and other  atomic   motion   toward   equilibrium,  especially   below   the  calorimetric  glass transition temperature, Tg, in  the  metallic  glass. The diffusion dynamics of hydrogen in amorphous silicon is  a  long  standing  problem  that  will  also  be  addressed.  The  materials  in this project have important applications  including  micromachines  and  solar energy. The research  involves  quantum  mechanics,   computer  simulations  and  laboratory   skills   in  electronics and low temperature physics. The project trains under  graduate  and  graduate  students in a  range  of  techniques  in  physics,  material  science,  computer  simulation,  experimental  skills, and communication skills with other scientists.  %%%  This  research  project in condensed matter  physics  deals  with  atomic-level  motion  in  metallic and  semiconducting  amorphous  systems  that are on the verge of \"freezing\" into nanocrystalline  solids.  The main experimental tool is nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR)  which is particularly appropriate for detecting  the  slow  atomic  motions accompanying the phase behavior. Materials  being  studied include newly discovered zirconium-titanium-copper-nickel-  beryllium  bulk  metallic  glasses, as  well  as  highly  ordered  hydrogenated  amorphous  silicon made by  hot  filament  assi sted  chemical   vapor  deposition.  These  materials  have   important  applications  including  micromachines  and  solar  energy.
