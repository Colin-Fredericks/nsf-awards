The objective of  this project is to provide support for relating a prior National  Science Foundation initiative that supported an experimental program  of research in appropriate technologies to current interests in  application of ecological principles to solutions of environmental  problems.  In the process of relating accomplishments of the prior  initiative in appropriate technology to the practice of ecological  engineering and concepts emerging from work to characterize industrial  ecology, it is expected this project will provide insights into  research needs, results of which will support advancement of  engineering practice as applied to solution of environmental problems.    The students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute who work on this  project will utilize their report to meet a requirement for successful  participation in an Interactive Qualifying Project the intent of which  is to have students complete a project during their work toward an  undergraduate degree that links issues of science and technology with  their social implications.  One of the final products of this project  is expected to be a substantive report that identifies research needs.  ***",
