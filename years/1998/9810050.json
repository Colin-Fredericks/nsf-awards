 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aron Kuppermann is supported by the Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program to use massively parallel computers to investigate   resonances and electronically non-adiabatic effects in state-to-state   triatomic reaction dynamics, and to generate benchmark state-to-state   tetratomic reaction cross sections.  Accurate three-dimensional quantum   mechanical reactive scattering calculations will be performed to study   the geometric phase effect and other electronic nonadiabatic coupling   effects on tri- and tetratomic scattering processes.  New algorithms and   computing methodologies will be designed and implemented.  Elementary bimolecular chemical reactions are the basic steps of complex   technologically important systems, such as combustion processes,   atmospheric chemistry, chemical lasers, and plasma reactors.  Many   reactive species are short-lived and not experimentally isolable, and   thus studying their reaction rates theoretically is often the only   approach to elucidate the molecular-level details.  In this project,   high-performance computing resources are essential to advancing our   understanding of important gas-phase chemical reactions.",
