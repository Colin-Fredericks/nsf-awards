 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop is on evaluating priorities for research within the VLSI testing  field, with the intention that the results of the meeting aid in refocusing the  field on research necessary to algorithms, techniques and methodologies for  testing deep submicron VLSI chips. Future priorities for research and education  are considered. Research areas that are already well-served by the test  communities in academia and industry and are unlikely to require major new  methods or technological breakthroughs are being examined. The workshop report  includes: (1) a statement of the most pressing problems to solve within the next  decade, (2) recommendations regarding the style and kind of research to be  conducted and suggestions to the community as to how to implement these  suggestions, and (3) viewpoints on increasing the impact of the VLSI test field  on education in electrical and computer engineering.",
