 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ta'asan\r\n9805582\r\n     The investigator and his colleagues develop multiscale\r\nnumerical techniques for dealing with phenomena on a wide range\r\nof scales.  The main aspect of the research is the numerical\r\nconstruction of macroscopic equations in the form of partial\r\ndifferential equations from microscopic models such as molecular\r\ndynamics models.  The numerical techniques focus on fluids\r\nmodeling starting from molecular models.  Special emphasize is\r\ngiven to models involving mixtures of several types of\r\natoms/molecules that may be governed by different interactions.\r\nSuch molecular models give rise to complicated physical phenomena\r\nincluding multiphase flows.  A sequence of models is constructed\r\nnumerically in an hierarchical manner starting from molecular\r\ndynamics.  Each level in this hierarchy represent a larger scale\r\ndynamics (in time or space or both) of the previous level, and is\r\nconstructed using statistical tools (regression analysis) applied\r\nto the data resulting from a simulation of the previous level.\r\nThe finest level of modeling is given by Hamiltonian dynamics and\r\nis deterministic.  Stochastic particle dynamics models are\r\nconstructed from the finest level model, and represent the\r\nphysical phenomenon on time scale of the order of the relaxation\r\ntime.  Further coarsening (averaging) in space-time results in\r\ndeterministic density evolution models, which can be identified\r\nas finite difference approximations to some partial differential\r\nequation that is the macroscopic limit.\r\n     Numerical techniques have been used extensively for several\r\ndecades to obtain approximate solutions of partial differential\r\nequations in different fields, and have improved significantly\r\nscientific insights and engineering tasks.  The derivation of\r\nthose equations, which describe physical phenomena in different\r\nareas, was done by analytical techniques whose use is limited to\r\nrelatively simple cases.  The treatment of more complex models\r\ncannot, in general, be done analytically and it calls for another\r\napproach.  This is the subject of this work: the use of numerical\r\ntechniques for 'deriving' macroscopic dynamics equations from\r\nmore basic principles given at microscopic levels.  This task is\r\ncarried out by large scale simulation of the detailed microscopic\r\nmodels and appropriate statistics.  The problems treated in this\r\nwork are limited to multiphase fluid flows, which are crucial in\r\nmany areas of applications, including medical inhalation devices,\r\nauto and aerospace industries (engines), computer industries\r\n(printers), and more.  The techniques developed here, however, are\r\nquite general and apply to other areas in chemistry, physics and\r\neconomics, from fundamental questions to real world applications.\r\n\r\n",
