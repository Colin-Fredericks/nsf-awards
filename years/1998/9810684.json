 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the next four years approximately 120 bridges will be destroyed and rebuilt as part of the 1-15 reconstruction through Salt Lake City, Utah.  This is a rare opportunity to destructively test older bridge structures constructed in the 1960's.  The researchers have been given access to a nine span bridge, the South Temple overpass bridge.  This bridge will be accessible for testing on about March 1st, for a period of about six weeks.  The availability of this bridge provides the initial opportunity to investigate the potential of using forced vibration analysis and dynamic characterization as a non-destructive evaluation technique.  After the bridge has been damaged the dynamic characteristics will be redetermined.  The damage in the structure should be manifest in the change of the natural frequencies and mode shapes from the undamaged to the damaged state of the bridge.  This evaluation approach would be especially applicable to structures where damage might not be readily visible at the joint between a column and pile cap, or concrete structures where plastic hinges that form might not be immediately obvious or hidden by architectural coverings.  This project is a test of an application of proven theories of structural dynamics.",
