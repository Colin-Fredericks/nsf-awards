 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800829  Tarn  The study of autonomous Underwater Robotic Vehicles (URVs) and their application is a dynamic research area in oceanic engineering.  This project will investigate fundamental theoretical problems which arise in the coordination and control of autonomous URVs.  It is also devoted to the development of a systematic methodology for designing, simulating and implementing intelligent controllers for autonomous URVs.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to model, develop and stimulate a new integrated control methodology for the automation of mission planning and control for the operation of autonomous URVs.  The proposed research will focus on the following specific problems:  (i) Use of Max-Plus Algebra to develop a new methodology for modeling, analysis and design of task schedule and action plan in the perspective frame, (ii) Nonholonomic analysis and control for underactuated underwater robotic vehicles, and (iii) Simulation studies and tests of the obtained theoretical results.\r\n\r\nThis development, consolidated with perceptive sensing, will use new definitions of action reference parameters for multi-segmented tasks in an underwater environment.  It will enable a flexible concurrent sequencing of subtasks in scheduling schemes.\r\n\r\nThe research goals are as follows:\r\n1.   Create a perspective frame that adapts the scheduling, planning and execution of cooperating URV tasks to the geometric and dynamics uncertainties automatically.\r\n\r\n2.   Improve the safety and reliability of the operation of autonomous  URVs.\r\n\r\n3.   Contribute to the scientific base and a better understanding of the use of robotic vehicles in the ocean.\r\n ***\r\n\r\n",
