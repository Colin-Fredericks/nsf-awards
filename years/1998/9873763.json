Colby clearly recognizes the importance of the integration of research and education and continues to develop institutional wide initiatives that incorporate research into the undergraduate science pedagogy.  With the creation of a new interdisciplinary curriculum, Colby faculty has redesigned courses to include open-ended, innovative approaches that are more successful in teaching critical thinking for science and non-science majors.  The College has initiated a new science planning process, which ensures students learn the scientific method by enhancing the discovery experience. \r\n\r\nColby's efforts to integrate research and education were designed with the following outcomes in mind for all students: (1) enhancing independent and critical thinking skills; (2) improving writing and presentation skills; (3) formulating questions, solving problems, and designing and completing projects; (4) acquiring analytical thinking and problem solving skills; (5) learning new technical skills; (6) enhancing teamwork skills; and (7) developing inquisitiveness that lead to life-long inquiry.  Additional outcomes and impacts include fostering new connections through enhanced interdisciplinary linkages within and beyond the sciences that further integrate research and education, and fortifying the research-oriented culture. \r\n\r\nThe College is being awarded  $500,000 to advance institutional goals of integrating research and education, document and disseminate information of its exemplary activities, and expand the integration of research and education by conducting outreach activities over the coming three years. To complement their successful science programs, Colby will use some of the award funds to establish a Postdoctoral Teaching Fellowship. A major key of the program is to provide undergraduates with mentors who will assist students in their independent research studies. In addition to providing a valuable service, Fellows will gain invaluable experience in undergraduate teaching and will learn methods of enhancing science education through research.\r\n\r\n",
