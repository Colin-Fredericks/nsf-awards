Wesleyan University  Title: An International Workshop on the Methodology of  Incorporating Adaption into Assessments of the Impact of Global  Climate Change: Pittsburgh, PA; Fall 1998    The proposal requests the National Science Foundation support for  a three or four day international workshop designed to further our  ability to assess the impact of climate change across the globe  when adaption is based on limited information and constrained by  local political, cultural, social and economic structures.  The  proposed workshop will focus on sea level rise and coastal  management, but it will be conducted with an eye toward producing  generalizable insights that can both support the inception of  coastal studies for Egypt and the Indian subcontinent and offers  researchers in other sectors some guidance in creating fruitful  methods of analysis.    The workshop should produce significant results in two distinct  directions.  First, collaboration of active researchers will allow  the principal investigators to work with others to contribute a  methodologically focused paper to the literature that will inform  not only the next generation of coastal analyses extended beyond  developed market economies, but also (and more importantly) the  broader IPCC interest in working adaption throughout the  contributions of Working Group II to the Third Assessment Report.    The workshop will also build understanding of the differences  between the various models that have developed specially to examine  the impact of sea level rise.  It is expected that differences will  be found along both natural and social dimensions; and a paper that  explores their resources and consequences should feel well into the  IPCC TAR process.    The comparative and development work will, in addition, provide  insight into (1) representing sea level rise more appropriately  into sufficiently desegregated integrated assessment models and (2)  including impacts more broadly defined in the g rowing list of  \"vulnerability assessments.\"",
