 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop and implement a statewide support system focused on bioscience technician development. This project focuses on the development of a coordinated response to the statewide need in Maryland for programs to prepare students at the community college level for technician careers in biotechnology, one of the most rapidly growing industries in the state. The rapid expansion of the biotech industry, the specialized focus of different aspects of biotechnology within the state, and the essentially local nature of community college programs require the development of a consortium to establish cost-effective introduction of biotechnology courses at several locations, and an articulated program in cooperation with high schools in each community college primary service area.     Catonsville Community College will coordinate the development of a powerful consortium comprised of four community colleges with their articulated high school tech prep partners, four University of Maryland Biotechnology Institutes and statewide biotechnology industry representatives. The unique component of the  project is the development of a cooperative relationship between the world-class University of Maryland Biotechnology Institutes, regional community colleges, and biotechnology industry partners. This consortium will provide community college teaching faculty and their high school teacher partners (hereafter referred to as \"the teaching faculty\") with rich opportunities to upgrade skills, increase their depth of scientific background, and acquire computer technology skills in order to infuse biotechnology into existing bioscience programs at their schools and/or to develop a comprehensive biotechnician training program. A three-year phased implementation plan ensures a viable model for replication and provides structured opportunities to adapt or customize the program to meet the needs of the individual educational institutions. Effective components resulting from the project will be nationally diss eminated as models for integrated yet differentiated curricula and training programs preparing the future workforce for jobs in the biotechnology industry.",
