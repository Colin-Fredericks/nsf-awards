 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lord  9801157         The  change  from  cross- to self-pollination is  a  common  trend  in  flowering   plant  evolution  and  domestication.  A  common  syndrome   of  characters  is associated with this change, including specific  changes  in  flower form. Relatively little is known about the developmental and genetic  basis of these changes in flower form. The proposed study will examine  the  developmental  basis for differences in mature flowers, in closely  related  lines of wild tomatoes. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping will then be  used   to  estimate  the  minimal  number  of  loci  responsible  for   the  morphological  changes,  and  to find their  general  location  within  the  genome.         This  study  will be significant in several respects. It will  utilize  relatively  new  molecular  and  statistical  techniques  to  address   the  long-standing  question  of  quantitative  trait  evolution,   using   both  developmental and genetic approaches. It will examine what is considered to  be   the   single  most  common  trend  in  the  evolution  of   angiosperm  reproduction: the shift from outcrossing to inbreeding. It will  utilize  a  subject  plant,  tomato,  which is economically  important,  and  which  is  becoming  a  major focus of both pure and applied research.  It  will  also  advance   our  knowledge  of  the  genetic  control  of  flower  form   and  development.",
