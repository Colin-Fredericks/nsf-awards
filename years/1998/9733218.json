 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Benjamin J. Schwartz   of the University of California in Los Angeles in his transient   absorption studies of solvent effects on chemical reaction dynamics.    Prof. Schwartz will carry out femtosecond experiments in order to examine   the dynamics following excitation of the charge-transfer-to-solvent   states (CTTS) of solvated halide anions.  These experiments will test the   predictions of quantum non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, thus   providing detailed information about the role of the solvent in this   simplest of charge transfer reactions.  Parallel experiments and   simulations studying the CTTS transitions of novel solvated alkali metal   anions will provide further insight into the role of the solute   electronic structure in controlling charge transfer reactions.  The goal   of these studies is to identify the solvent motions responsible for both   the solvation and non-radiative relaxation of solute electronic excited   states in solution.  The results will help to provide a complete   molecular picture of how the interplay between solvation dynamics and   non-adiabatic relaxation controls chemical reactivity in solution.  The   education plan of this CAREER award emphasizes the strengthening of   critical thinking skills in students.  In addition, a new curriculum   focusing on condensed-phase physical chemistry will be introduced.    The science targeted in these studies, electron transfer and solvent   reactions, is fundamental in the area of chemical dynamics, and the novel   combined theoretical and experimental tools that will be brought to bear   will provide unprecedented detail and scrutiny.  Given the ubiquity of   these processes in nature and in all condensed phase processes, these   studies will have far reaching implications.",
