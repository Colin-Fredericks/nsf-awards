 "awd_abstract_narration": "The South East Advanced Technical Education project is a consortium of five two-year colleges in Tennessee with their associated school districts along with four year universities and communications industries that have already worked together to develop and implement case studies.  The goals of the project are 1.) to provide national leadership in the development and implementation of case studies for technological education; 2.) to provide professional development of participating faculty; 3.) to evaluate the effectiveness of the case study method in teaching technology-related content; 4.) to disseminate nationally information about the case studies and the outcomes of their use.  The project will assemble experts in case studies and their use from different disciplines to inform the project.  The case studies, that mirror real-world workplace problems from industry, are created by interdisciplinary faculty teams that include faculty from science, mathematics, engineering and computer technologies, and communications with input from the industry.  Professional development of faculty includes field trips, three-week internships in communications industry to keep abreast of recent developments in the industry and workshops to learn to teach using cases. Dissemination includes professional development for faculty in two-year colleges in other areas of the nation and publication of both the forums on case studies and of the case studies themselves.  The use of the case study method is extensively evaluated.",
