 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pore water and benthic flux chamber concentration (ECO2) and  isotopic  composition (o13C) measurements will  be  used  to  investigate the factors which control the rate of  carbonate  dissolution at the sea floor.  The major goal of  this  work  is  to  document  the occurrence and impact  of  \"metabolic\"  carbonate   dissolution,  dissolution  driven   by   benthic  decomposition  reactions  in  sediments  above  the  calcite  saturation   horizon,   where   the   bottom   waters    are  supersaturated with respect to calcite.  Pore water  samples  will  also determine the /\\14C of dissolved inorganic carbon  and dissolved organic carbon.  The field work for this project will be carried out during  two upcoming process studies of benthic carbonate  dissolution.  PIs. R. Jahnke, W. Martin, and F. Sayles have  been funded to carry out coordinated dissolution studies in  the eastern equatorial Atlantic Ocean (Cape Verde Plateau  and Sierra Leone Rise) in 1998 and on the continental margin  off North Carolina in 1999.  Jahnke will carry out direct  flux measurements (oxygen, nutrients, alkalinity, and  calcium) using benthic flux chambers, and Martin and Silks  will use in situ sampling techniques to measure pore water  profiles of oxygen, nutrients, alkalinity, ECO2, calcium,  iron, and manganese.  Samples from Jahnke's benthic flux chambers and from Sayles  and Martin's in situ pore water will be analyzed in this  study using del C-13.  These samples will provide  independent estimates of the relative contributions of  decomposition-derived CO2 (o13C = -20 o/oo) and dissolution-  derived CO3 -2 (o13C = 0 o/oo) to the flux of ECO2 out of  the sediments.  It is particularly important to make these  independent isotopic estimates because alkalinity and  calcium flux estimates from Jahnke's benthic flux chamber  and from Sayles' and Martin's in situ pore water sample  yielded conflicting results in a previous dissolution study  on the Ceara Rise (western equatorial Atlantic).  In that  Ceara Rise s tudy, both pore water and benthic flux chamber  o13C results agreed with the pore water alkalinity and  calcium data (and with microelectrode profiles of pore water  pH and oxygen), indicating substantial metabolic dissolution  at and above the saturation horizon.",
