 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kalisz  9726980     A plant's mating system (the degree to which it outcrosses rather than self  pollinates) is a vital determinant of genetic variability at the population  level.  While theoretical studies have demonstrated that either complete   outcrossing or complete selfing are stable evolutionary states, mixed   mating (whereby progeny are sired by a mixture of self and outcross pollen)  is not as easily explained. Yet in nearly half of the animal pollinated   plants studied, intermediate outcrossing rates (those between 20-80%) are   observed.  The current study utilizes the winter annual, Collinsia verna,   the Blue-eyed Mary, as a model organism to examine the consequences of   variability of pollinator activity over the flowering season and its   influence on the evolution of self pollination as a back-up strategy (i.e.,  reproductive assurance selfing). Using clonal replicates of individual   plants in a series of integrated field and controlled environment   experiments, the correlations between specific floral attributes conferring  delayed selfing, fruiting success via self pollination, and the degree of   inbreeding depression expressed by those individuals will be quantified.   These measurements will be interpreted in the light of a novel field   bioassay which allows us to quantify the frequency of pollinator failure   from the perspective of paired flowers which are experiencing common   resource conditions.  Field estimates of pollinator failure and selfing   ability will be compared with estimates of the natural outcrossing rates   derived for three populations across the flowering season and across two   years.         The proposed research addresses the links between selective pressures on   delayed selfing via pollinator mediated pollen limitation, the expression   of mixed mating, and inbreeding depression expressed in natural populations  of Collinsia verna.  The actual, physical process of reproductive assurance  selfing has been characterized for very few species.  Q uantifying the   timing of self-pollination within a flower, and the associated   morphological traits will address an important issue in evolutionary   ecology: how developmental processes (like the timing of anther and pistil  elongation) contribute to selfing rates and how they evolve. Moreover, this  research will be the first to test the mixed mating model of Schoen and   Brown (1991) which indicates that when environmental variation in   pollinator availability exists, reproductive assurance is more important in  driving the evolution of a mixed mating system than is inbreeding   depression.  As a result, this work will be of interest to plant   geneticists, crop breeders and conservationists who work with species which  may become pollen-limited due to unusual weather patterns or regional   epidemics in key pollinators (e.g. as has happened recently to honeybee   populations).",
