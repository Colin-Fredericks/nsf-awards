 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates use of an additional layer of structure, called a meta-document, to organize decentralized network-accessible information, such as that found on the World-Wide Web. By developing meta-documents, documents whose components are themselves documents, discovered information can be placed into context and communicated to others. Consequently meta-documents hold promise of being useful in applications where information, created and maintained by others, needs to be transferred; educational applications at all levels have this characteristic. To make meta-documents effective, basic issues in information representation, presentation, personalization, structuring, location, and exploration are explored in this project. In addition, practical study is required of the means for authoring meta-documents and the means for keeping them in synchrony with the rapidly shifting contents of the Web. The resulting concepts have theoretical implications in understanding how to structure and communicate network-based digital information. They also have immediate practical application in producing materials that can be used in teaching and in providing overviews that will help the general public better identify relevant Web-based information on selected topics.\r\nhttp://www.csdl.tamu.edu/walden/\r\n",
