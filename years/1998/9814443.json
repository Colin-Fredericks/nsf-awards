 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is great excitement over the prospect of comparing the sequences and contents of as many as 15-25 microorganism genomes over the next year or two, and of learning how these sequences operate to control specific genomes on a global basis.  Using both genetics and functional genomic studies of different types to understand how whole genome sequences operate will be the focus of many laboratories.  Considerable integration of different aspects of microbiology will undoubtedly take place, including new perspectives on evolution and the requirements for life.  Lessons learned regarding biology, analysis techniques and data management should have application in other genome projects, including those of humans and other eukaryotes.  Escherichia coli, whose genome was completed last year, will continue to provide precedent and paradigm for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, since the extensive physiologic, biochemical, and genetic analysis of E. coli over the last four decades make this the best studied microorganism, and one of the model systems to which all others are compared.\r\nThe goal of this conference is to provide a regular forum for these interactions to occur.  To this end the conference will include active genome researchers, such as sequencing experts and informatics specialists working in database design, sequence analysis, or simulation; geneticists developing new methods to take advantage of genomic information, e.g. for functional analysis; and cell biologists and biochemists who have specialized in areas now ripe for genomics such as metabolism, chromosome structure, protein structure, or gene regulation.  While there have been a number of recent genome conferences, continuing completion and release of new genome sequences and developing momentum for analysis of this huge amount of information means the community has continued need of such meetings.  This meeting has become established as a major regular annual bacterial genomics conference during the last seven years and has assured status and quality.  \r\n",
