 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the acquisition of equipment to  significantly upgrade facilities available in the Woods  Hole, Massachusetts scientific community for optical  characterization of microbial populations, tissue cultures,  microscopic particles, and/or the processes dependent on  visualizing these assemblages and constituents.  Funds are  requested for the purchase of a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur  flow cytometer and Zeiss inverted light microscope and image  analysis facility.  These instruments are essential and  complementary for a wide array of applications among the  scientific staffs of the Woods Hole Oceanographic  Institution (WHOI) and the Marine Biological Laboratory  (MBL).  The light microscopy facility will include two  condenser systems to accommodate a range of magnifications  and specimen holders, a temperature-controlled stage for the  examination of specimens and cultures at experimental or in-  situ temperatures, a micromanipulation system for  establishing cultures and cell lines, cooled CCD camera,  high quality image analysis software for documentation of  particle sizes, abundances, and other characteristics,  particularly very low fluorescent signals.  The flow  cytometer that has been purchased is the latest version of  the `workhorse' of the field, known for its reliability and  versatility.  This instrument will be equipped with a sorter  that will allow verification sorting of microbial groups for  chemical/biological analyses or culture initiation, and a  carousel loader to enable multiple sample processing and  mixing.  These specific instruments have been chosen because they  combine (1) highly complementary measurements of microscopic  organisms or particles, (2) they are major advancements over  the present capabilities within the Woods Hole scientific  community, (3) they are user-friendly and will therefore  have much wider use than more sophisticated but more  specialized equipment of this nature, and (4) they are cost-  efficient to run and maintain becaus e of the larger number  of potential users.  The microscopy and flow cytometry  facilities will be a direct benefit to the research programs  of at least two dozen laboratories within WHOI and MBL.  Their availability will address long-standing deficits in  the common use equipment at WHOI, and they will favorably  affect the successful completion of projects totaling more  than 50 federal and other grants, contracts, and awards.",
