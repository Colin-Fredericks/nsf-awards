California Institute of Technology    MRI: Equipment Acquisition for Research in Enabling Technologies for Volumetric Imaging, Responsive Displays and Telecollaboration    This proposal pertains to equipment, which will support an integrated research program in enabling technologies for volumetric imaging, responsive displays, and telecollaboration.  The PIs' vision is that of an effective virtual workspace for collaborative scientific discovery and design.  This requires fundamental research in the areas of geometric modeling, visualization, concurrent computation and human-computer interaction.  Integrating these elements will enable us to develop new approaches for managing-and gaining insight into-complex processes and data.  It will also lead to the exploration of new computing paradigms at the confluence of graphics, scientific computing, volumetric imaging, human-computer interaction, and concurrent computation.  Target applications include scientific visualization, conceptual design, and rapid scientific experimentation both in synchronous and asynchronous collaboration settings.  In support of this research agenda the PIs are seeking funding for the acquisition of equipment necessary to create the associated research facility.  The centerpiece of the facility will be two state-of-the-art responsive workbenches, 3D stereoscopic display devices.  Additionally the lab will contain a responsive whiteboard display to integrate the research into classroom settings.  The support request will provide: (1) the high-performance computation and graphics hardware needed for interaction with large datasets on the responsive workbench; (2) equipment to construct a companion device, the responsive whiteboard; (3) prototype optical trackers, and (4) a fiber optic link to connect the 2 Caltech responsive workbenches.",
