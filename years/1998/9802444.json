 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802444  Eom    This University/Industry collaborative GOALI proposal aims for  greater understanding of  barrier phenomena/physics in oxide  ferromagnetic-insulator-ferromagnetic trilayer junctions,  interfacial effects, and the electronic structure of (Sr,Ca)RuO3.  Professor Chang-Beom Eom at Duke University is collaborating with  Jonathan Z. Sun at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center. The  approach involves the study and control of the growth mechanism  and domain structures of individual layers, and the investigation  of junction properties to obtain reliable and low defect density  interfaces and insulating layers. The project also addresses the  mechanism for spin-dependent transport across the barrier region,  the bias and temperature dependence of junction  magnetoresistance, and the relationships between transport  behavior, barrier synthesis/processing conditions, and chemical  compositions. The project is co-supported by the DMR Electronic  Materials Program and the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities).    %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  materials science having high technological relevance. The  research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a  fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/magnetic  devices.  Experimental tools are now available to allow atomic  level observation of basic surface and interface processes which  when better understood will allow advances in both fundamental  and technological arenas. The basic knowledge and understanding  gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving  the performance and stability of advanced devices and circuits by  providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing  and producing improved materials, and materials combinations.  An  important feature of the program is the integration of research  and education through the training of students in a fundamentally  and technologically significant area, and in providing an  impor tant opportunity through the GOALI aspect of the project for  students to experience both academic and industrial research  approaches and environments.  ***",
