 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707815  Wicker        While progress has been made over the last decade on  understanding the  dynamics of tornadoes and their parent storms, much is still  unknown concerning the  factors that cause tornado genesis and that control the intensity  and longevity of any   given tornado.  In this research, the Principal Investigator will  investigate how the  large scale environment conditions (e.g. wind shear and buoyancy)  control the  intensity and longevity of tornadoes within supercell  thunderstorms.  This work  builds on and is a logical follow-up to the Principal  Investigator's previous research  on the development of low-level rotation and tornado genesis within  supercell  thunderstorms.        Two separate lines of research will be pursued.  First, the  Principal  Investigator's current research will be extended down to the  tornado scale in an  effort to advance understanding of tornadogenesis. The previous  work has resulted in  refinements to the Rotunno and Klemp paradigm for origins of  low-level rotation in  supercells. The Principal Investigator s new theory demonstrates  the dynamical role  the inflow environment's near-surface horizontal vorticity has on  mesocyclogenesis  and can be used to predict the near-surface vertical wind shear  profiles which are  optimal for the generation of strong low-level mesocyclones within  supercells.   Extension of this work includes examining whether tornado-scale  circulations are  directly related to the mesocyclone circulation, as well as a study  to understanding  the role of shear and buoyancy in determining the spatial scales  and magnitude of  the low-level circulation and convergence needed for the generation  of tornadoes.        Second, an attempt will be made to explicitly model a  particular supercell and  tornado observed during the Verification of Origins of Rotation in  Tornadoes  Experiment.  This part of the study will provide a much needed  evaluation of the  current state of cloud simulation realism and hopefully identif y  specific aspects of  convective scale modeling which need to be improved.        Potential benefits from this research are many.  Aside from  increasing basic  understanding of storm and tornado dynamics, the operational  community will  benefit from this research.  Understanding which particular  environmental profiles of  wind shear, temperature and moisture that are most conducive for  tornadoes will  enable operational forecasters to pinpoint and focus on small  regions where the  conditions are favorble for the formation of intense tornadic  storms.  By more fully  understanding the dynamics associated with these supercells and  their tornadoes,  improved severe weather forecasts and Doppler radar observations  can then be used  more effectively to forecast and detect tornado formation and warn  the public.  ***",
