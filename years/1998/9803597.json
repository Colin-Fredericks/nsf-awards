 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803597  Peres   The principal investigator will analyze various random processes on graphs. For   instance, a model of  noisy propagation on trees has been studied independently in   Statistical Mechanics, in Computer Science and in Genetic Reconstruction. This model is   well understood only when the propagating variables take two values, when it can be   identified with the Ising model. There are two distinct critical temperatures, one for   uniqueness of Gibbs states and another for purity of the Markovian state that corresponds   to free boundary conditions. The second critical temperature is not known for the Potts   model, where the propagating variables can take more than two values. To study large   homogeneous graphs that are not trees, the investigator will apply a new \"mass transport   method\" developed recently with several collaborators. Problems on the geometry of the   planar Brownian path will also be investigated; a key tool will be the intersection   equivalence of the paths with random sets constructed via \"fractal  percolation\".   Mathematical biologists studying the spread of genetic mutations in a family tree,   and computer scientists studying the propagation of errors in a noisy communication   network, were led independently to the same mathematical model that was considered   earlier in statistical mechanics. The principal investigator will attempt to unify and extend   some of the earlier results on these models, by using recent probabilistic techniques; some   of this involves collaboration with computer scientists. Recently, new methods have   emerged to exploit symmetries in the geometry of the underlying network, to obtain   better understanding of random processes on it; the investigator will develop and apply   these methods further. Finally, the trace of the erratic random motion of a particle has   been studied intensively by probabilists; this research will investigate certain new   approaches to these traces to try and elucidate their geometric structure.",
