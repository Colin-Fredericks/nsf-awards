 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cameron  9727738  Cytochrome c oxidase is an enzyme complex required for respiration in all eucaryotes and some procaryotes. The enzyme complex is the terminal member of the electron transport chain, responsible for transferring electrons from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen. Electron transfer is coupled to proton pumping, and the ensuing proton gradient is used to drive the synthesis of ATP. The number of subunits in the complex is variable, ranging from three or four in bacteria to as many as 13 in the bovine enzyme. The three largest subunits, subunit I, II and III are encoded on mitochondrial DNA in eucaryotes and are homologous to the three subunits found in some procaryotes. Therefore, it is likely that these mitochondrially encoded subunits represent the catalytically significant subunits of the enzyme. Subunit I is required for both electron transport and for proton pumping. Subunit II has been shown to carry a binuclear copper center, which is the initial site of electron transfer from cytochrome c. In contrast to subunits I and II, the function of subunit III is not well understood, and it has not been demonstrated to have a role in either electron transfer or proton pumping. Subunits II and III are encoded by simple, unspliced genes and all three of these genes contain regions of amino acid sequence which are conserved in all organisms in which the genes have been studied.  To better understand the function of subunits II and III of cytochrome c oxidase, yeast strains with defects in the enzyme due to mutations in these two mitochondrial genes have been identified. Such defects lead to loss of the ability to carry out cellular respiration. A number of strains bearing mutations in the gene encoding subunit II ( COXII ) and three frameshift mutations in the gene encoding subunit III( COXIII ) have been identified and analysis of some of these strains has been completed. The remaining strains are being investigated in detail. In addition, the collection of strains bearing mutations in t hese two genes will be enlarged by identification of additional spontaneous mutants and by construction of specific mutations of interest using site-directed mutagenesis. Once strains with mutations that have the potential to shed light on the function of the subunits have been identified/constructed, the investigation will be extended to revertants of these strains, where the revertants have recovered function. Classes of revertants that may be obtained are true revertants that restore the wild type sequence, pseudo-revertants where a different amino acid codon is substituted for the one which originally resided at that site, intragenic suppressors where a mutation in one region of a polypeptide chain can compensate for an alteration in another region, and strains carrying extragenic suppressors. Among the latter group may be gene products, both nuclear and mitochondrial, that interact directly with these two subunits or are involved in their expression. This analysis will yield information concerning functionally critical amino acids in the proteins and possibly about interactions between oxidase subunits.   Undergraduate students will be involved in both the research and analysis of the results.    Because the subunit amino acid sequences are so highly conserved, information deduced about the function of these proteins in yeast should help to elucidate the function of these proteins in higher organisms. Such an understanding is of importance to understanding how organisms use oxygen in the process of generating energy.",
