 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anne Myers of the University of Rochester is supported by the   Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in her continuing studies in   which she uses resonance Raman and fluorescence spectroscopies to   characterize the coupling of electronic transitions of a chromophore to   nuclear degrees of freedom in the surrounding environment in liquids and   amorphous solids.  Three types of experiments will be carried out:  (i)   Raman linewidths for molecular ions will be compared under resonant vs.   nonresonant excitation conditions to test the hypothesis that the   previously observed increase in linewidth on resonance is due to coupling   of the chromophore-localized vibrations to solvent or intermolecular   phonons; (ii) resonantly excited emission spectra will be measured as a   function of temperature and the spectra will be modeled to better   understand the temperature dependence; (iii) low-temperature fluorescence   line-narrowing spectra will be measured in chromophore/matrix   combinations to investigate the chromophore dependence of the coupled   phonon frequencies and coupling strengths.    These investigations will provide insight to the processes that are   responsible for the broadening of electronic absorptions in condensed   media and to processes that affect chemical reaction rates in condensed   phases.  Efforts to develop practical optical memory devices based on   persistent spectral hole burning in solids will be aided by a better   understanding resulting from this research.",
