These  experiments will probe the role of molecular ordering and thermal  fluctuations in determining interfacial phenomena .  The areas of  interest  are as follows.  (1)  Study of interfacial profiles  at  the  oil-microemulsion and microemulsion-water  interfaces as the  degree of internal order in the bulk phases is varied. (2)  Study  of  the behavior of fluctuating interfaces interacting over short  distances  in thin wetting films. (3)  Study of the  behavior  of  the  binary  alkane-water interface over a wide  range  of  chain  lengths and for temperatures near the melting temperature of  the  bulk alkane.  (4)  Study of surfactant organization at the liquid-  liquid  interface  in  a  well defined  chemical  system  as  the  amplitude of interfacial fluctuations is varied over one  to  two  orders of magnitude.  %%%  Non-technical  The  existence of a surface tension is evident by  poking  a  pin  into  the  surface of water.  This tension is determined  by  the  free  energy  required to take molecules from  the  bulk  of  the  liquid  and  create  a unit area of surface or  interface.   This  energy  depends upon the molecular organization at the interface.  Many  processes that depend upon the interfacial structure  occur  at  liquid-liquid interfaces, such as the transport of  molecules  across  the interface.  These processes are important for  making  new  materials,  understanding  interfacial  chemistry,  and   in  biological  interfaces  such as membranes.   Unfortunately,  very  little  experimental information about this interfacial structure  is  available.   We  propose  to use powerful  synchrotron  x-ray  sources  to  study  this  structure at liquid-liquid  interfaces.  These  st udies will include measurements on oil-water  interfaces  commonly   encountered   in  daily  life   (and   in   industrial  manufacturing) and also on some exotic interfaces that  fluctuate  wildly on their own.  ***    p:\\toulouse\\abs98",
