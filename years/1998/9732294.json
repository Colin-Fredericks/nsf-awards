This three-year program will bring eleven outstanding undergraduate students on campus for a 10-week intensive summer research experience.  The objectives of the REU Site program will be: 1) to provide students who are traditionally underrepresented in environmental science and engineering (women and minorities) with an opportunity to conduct independent research; 2) to teach these students about the process of conducting sound research and the importance of research in solving environmental problems; and, 3) to expose students to the importance of graduate school as an integral part of the educational pipeline leading to successful careers in applied and basic research.    The primary component of the program will be the completion of a research project in the area of multiphase environmental systems.  Undergraduates will be assigned a self-contained aspect of a larger research project and will work with graduate students and faculty in the Departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Chemistry, and Biology to complete their project.  Students will be matched with these faculty based on the interests and abilities of the students and the specific needs of the faculty.  Dissemination of the research results will be emphasized; all students will participate in research group meetings, write a report, and present their work at a University-wide undergraduate research symposium.  A seminar series that covers issues related to conducting sound research and graduate school will add some breadth to the students'experiences.  The final component of the program will be several community-building activities designed to foster cohesiveness among the students and enhance their appreciation for belonging to a multicultural group.  Assessment of the program will i nclude continual evaluation and improvement of our program to ensure the stated objectives are achieved.",
