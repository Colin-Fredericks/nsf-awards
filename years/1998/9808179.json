 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Baron-Ferejohn model (BF) of legislative bargaining is one of the most widely used formal frameworks in the study of legislative politics.  Variants of the model have been used in the study of legislative voting rules, committee power, pork-barrel programs, government formation, multi-party elections, and inter-chamber bargaining.  In considering a simple version of the model where there are three political parties with no party having a majority of the votes in the legislature, the BF model predicts that the party with proposal power will propose a minimal winning coalition.  This will consist of it and one other member, leaving the third party with zero.  As in the Rubinstein model the proposing party will give its proposed coalition partner just the amount necessary to secure an acceptance.  The amount (or continuation value) equals the coalition partner's expected pay-off if the proposal was rejected and the bargaining continued.  Proposals are thus always accepted in the first round.  The investigators note that the proposing party will always choose as its coalition partner the party with the lowest continuation value.  The division of spoils will in general be highly unequal, especially if the parties' discount factors are low.  The research team has conducted a series of experiments testing the predictions of the BF model in a controlled laboratory environment.  The preliminary research shows that the BF model's predictions are rarely supported.  In particular, proposers often allocate to all three players and, in two-player coalitions, allocate more proportionally than predicted.  In this project the researchers investigate why the predictions fail, both theoretically and empirically.  The first goal in the project is to examine the robustness of the findings to changes in the game form.  In the preliminary experiments five and four period models used.  One may object, for instance, that these models are too demanding for subjects to fully comprehend.  the first priority is thus to replicate their findings in a simpler game with fewer periods.  Thus, the researchers conduct new treatments with two and three period versions of the game.  Next, the researchers intend to investigate possible theoretical accounts for earlier findings of equal splits and then test them in the laboratory.  In their investigation of these theoretical accounts they conduct additional experiments and, in some cases, computer simulations, as well as the theoretical research.  They focus on three possible explanations for the results:  1) equilibrium concepts with non-trivial error, 2) norms of fairness or altruism, and, 3) conventions and focal points.  Since the Baron-Ferejohn model is a widely used approach to understanding legislative majoritarian bargaining, the proposed research should help in understanding the limits of the model and, legislative majoritarian bargaining as a consequence.",
