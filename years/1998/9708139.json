 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Eric J. Enholm, of the Department of Chemistry at the   University of Florida, is supported by the Organic Synthesis Program for   his studies of new reactions and methodology using radical anions.  These   studies focus on metal- and silicon-associated ketyl radical anions,   representing bifunctional intermediates with both free radical (single   electron) and anionic/nucleophilic (two electron) behavior.  Professor   Enholm exploits the reactivity of these intermediates to develop novel   allylation, ring scission, radical trapping, alkylation, and sigmatropic   rearrangement chemistry.  Reactions of allylstannanes with allylic   O-stannyl ketyls represents a mild and chemically neutral alternative to   classic Michael-type additions of organometallic reagents.  Silane-based   analogues of these reactions promise both to provide environmentally   benign alternatives to tin reagents and to allow access to asymmetric   reactions through the use of optically active O-silyl ketyls.  Tin(IV)   enolates undergo (3,3)-sigmatropic shifts via formation of intermediate   allylic O-stannyl ketyls, offering entry to the ABC ring system of   phyllanthocin, a novel bisabolene glycosidic inhibitor of several cancer   tumor cell lines.  Carbometallation reactions mediated by tin(IV)   enolates permit the formation of products similar to those obtained via   Conia ene reactions but at greatly reduced temperatures.  With the support of the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor Eric J.   Enholm, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida,   explores and exploits new reactions of radical anions, a class of   reactive compounds which contain both a negatively-charged site and a   site bearing a single unpaired electron.  By taking advantage of the   reactivity of each of these sites, Professor Enholm is able to prepare a   wide variety of carbon `skeletons` which can serve as intermediate   scaffolds for the construction of various natural products, medicinal   agents, and biologically active molecules.  His studies also target the   development of silicon-based alternatives to the more traditional   tin-based reagents for the formation of organic radicals, offering   promise for the development of environmentally friendly alternatives to   the toxic tin reagents.",
