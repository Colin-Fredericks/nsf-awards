 "awd_abstract_narration": "06/19/98    A major application of microarray technology is quantitative  monitoring of gene expression patterns.  Microarray  experiments have been described recently in which dozens of  new differentially expressed genes have been discovered  using microdissected tissues and radioactive labeling and  detection methods.  Fluorescent detection methods afford the  bast quantitation, permit co-hybridization of two samples  labeled with different fluors to the same microarray grid,  and permits resolution of very closely spaced microarrayed  spots.  However, it does have the drawback of increased  expense and requires a much higher amount of starting  material than radioactive detection methods.    This proposal will support the purchase of instrumentation  for a state-of-the-art facility that will use microarray  technology for genomic analyses.  Two instruments will be  purchased: a confocal laser-scanning and imaging devise for  reading high-density microarrays hybridized with probes  labeled with fluorescent tags and a phosphoimager for high-  resolution scanning of microarrays hybridized with probes  labeled with radioisotopes.  The research to be supported by  this technology include combining microarray analysis with  engineered transcriptional repressors for identification of  target genes, fundamental studies of transcription  regulation in yeast, studies of cellular pathways involved  in transformation and apoptosis, novel approaches to  elucidate the biological function of subnuclear cytological  structures, studies of tissue regeneration and T-cell  development in mice, analysis of subtelomeric variation and  transcription patterns in humans, and the development of  novel peptide-nucleic acid detection strategies.    Graduate students and postdoctoral associates at the Wistar  Institute will have access to this emerging technology,  allowing them to incorporate this powerful new methodology  into their research projects as they develop.  More  importantly, they  will see the exciting new opportunities  microarray analysis offers for understanding basic  biological processes, and will begin to develop fresh  approaches to biological problems that may have been seen as  difficult or insoluble using non-global approaches.",
