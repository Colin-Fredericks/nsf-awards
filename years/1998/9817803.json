The IFMBE Administrative Council meets twice each year to oversee the management of the IFMBE and entail strategic planning of the organization, planning of scientific meetings, publications, dissemination of scientific information, and initiation of advanced projects in critical and emerging areas.\r\n\r\nThis project provides partial support for the United States representation to the Administrative Council of the IFMBE to attend its meetings over a period of three years in Asia, Latin America, and Europe.  United States representation to the Administrative Council of the IFMBE is under the aegis of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE).  Representation on the Council provides the United States with the opportunity to develop new lines of communications and collaborative projects among biomedical engineering researchers from many countries, thereby  extending our leadership role in medical technology research and development. Information about Council deliberations is to be disseminated by AIMBE to a wide audience through articles in various technical publications, specialized workshops and seminars, and electronically on the Internet. \r\n\r\n",
