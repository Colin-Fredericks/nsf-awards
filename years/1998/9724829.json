Edwards, Washington  State University , and Drs. Manuel Pinto and Claudio  Pastenes, University of Chile.  The major objectives of the  proposed study are to identify specific  alterations in  photochemical,  biochemical and physiological processes of  photosynthesis induced by supplementary UV-B radiation in  bean (C3 species) and maize (C4 species), and to evaluate  the relationship between these alterations and the  loss/change in photosynthetic rate.  The purpose is to  determine if modifications in photochemical efficiency and  photosynthetic enzymes correlate with changes in  photosynthetic capacity by UV-B treatment.  The hypothesis  is that the decrease in photosynthetic capacity in bean  caused by UV-B radiation would be related to changes in key  photosynthetic enzymes and/or changes in photochemical  efficiency.   For this study, representative bean cultivars  with contrasting tolerance to UV-B will be used.    Over the past three decades, there has been a significant  increase in research involving the effects of UV-B radiation  on plant systems.  Based on those studies, it is estimated  that about one half of all plants species, (especially  herbaceous species) are negatively affected by that  increased radiation. However, because some species are known  to be well adapted to high UV-B radiation environments, a  comparison of changes in enzyme activity versus protein  content during UV-B treatment will allow the researchers to  assess if the changes in protein amount or activation state  is responsible for the loss/change of photosynthetic  capacity.    Interactions between plants and their environment are  complex, but important to our understanding of plant  productivity.  Reduction of stratospheric ozone, which  primarily absorbs UV-B radiation, has raised concerns about  the potential implications of rising UV-B radia tion at the  Earth's surface.  ***",
