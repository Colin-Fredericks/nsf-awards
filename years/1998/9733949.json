 "awd_abstract_narration": "Murphy  9733949    This  is a CAREER Award to a female scientist. The research deals  with  special  types  of electronic excitations  which  occur  as  spatially  extended  quasiparticles in  two-dimensional  electron  systems.  It  is  often  advantageous to  sort  such  excitations  according  to whether or not they have a non-zero winding  number  or   twist.   Excitations  possessing  a  twist  are   known   as  \"topological excitations\" and include solitons, vortices,  domain  walls and dislocations. They cannot decay for the same reason you  cannot untwist a phone cord without picking up the receiver:  the  excitation  or  winding  can only be removed  by  a  large  scale  reorientation of the entire system. This translates to long  term  stability  as  evidenced  by the use of a topological  excitation  known  as a soliton as a signal carrier in transcontinental fiber  links.  The  concept  of  a  topological  excitation  has  proven  exceptionally useful in physics: Rather than attempt to  describe  the  behavior  of  the entire system, a more manageable  approach  focuses  on  just the stable configuration of these  excitations.  Thus  the tornadoes in a storm, the dislocations in a crystal  or  the  domain walls in a ferromagnet are studied to obtain a  great  deal about the system at hand. This proposal details an extensive  study of the topological excitations occurring on two-dimensional  electronic systems in a magnetic field.  %%%  This  is  CAREER Award to a female scientist. The research  deals  with special types of electronic excitations known as topological  excitations.  These excited electron states  possess  a  kind  of  twist, like a screw. Previously studied as mathematical oddities,  they  have  recently  been  found in  nature  in  two-dimensional  semiconductor  structures, known as Quantum Hall  systems.  These  stable  excitations are more than a new language  for  many  body  electron   interactions,   they  are  real   spatially   extended  quasiparticles.  The   experimental goal of  this  proposal  is  a  greater  understanding of the role of topological excitations  in  two  dimensional  electronic systems. The second  focus  of  this  CAREER   proposal  is  the  adaptation  of  novel   instructional  approaches,  commonly used at the introductory  level,  to  upper  level  physics courses. While introductory physics education  has  benefited  from  these  new techniques,  there  has  been  little  application to more advanced undergraduate material. The plan  is  to  introduce concept based questions in conjunction  with  group  learning  techniques  into  the more advanced  curricula  and  to  facilitate  this  introduction by the development  of  a  concept  question website.",
