 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from the University of New Mexico.  The student will conduct ethnographic research in a forested area of Paraguay, among the Ache Indians. The research will evaluate models of costs and benefits of social foraging, to test hypotheses concerning gender, the role of variance in food intake and other factors, on local residential group size and composition.  Methods include participant observation, a sample survey of individuals, focal follows on foraging and hunting expeditions, and measurement of food output.  This research will provide theoretically significant data on how and why people hunt in this environment which will be useful in improving our understanding of hunting as a mode of life in general.  There are ever fewer opportunities for empirical research on real-life hunting societies.  In addition the project will contribute to the training of a young social scientist, and add to our knowledge about this important region of the world.",
