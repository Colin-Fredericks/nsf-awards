 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT         Penn State's Mathematics Department aims to become a leading training   center for the next generation of mathematical scientists.  The   Department's rise to research prominence in recent years has placed it   in a position from which a comparatively modest investment will lead to   exceptional returns in training effectiveness. The Department has   planned an integrated program of training initiatives at all levels,   from K-12 through postdoctoral.  It builds upon the Department's current   strengths: its research excellence in several areas; its MASS program,   which was founded in 1996 to provide an intensive learning environment   for talented undergraduates from around the country; and its unique   fluid mechanics laboratory.         The Department will expand its recently instituted Chowla postdoctoral   program from one to three three-year appointments per year.  These   positions will include a limited, carefully designed, supervised   teaching component.  Many postdoctoral fellows will be associated  with departmental centers of excellence; some will be selected for   interdisciplinary research; and some will be closely involved with our   fluids laboratory.         The Department will increase the attractiveness of its doctoral program   to the country's best students by creating three annual fellowships,   called VIGRE Traineeships, with special terms of appointment. Features   will include periods of concentration on learning and thesis research,   along with a program of closely supervised teaching at various levels.   The target time-to-degree for VIGRE Trainees will be five years.  Formal   graduate training will be extended to the summer months by programs of   intensive summer courses and industrial internships.         The Department will solidify its innovative MASS program, expanding its   visibility and securing its funding.  It will also institute a program   of six-week summer research experiences for undergraduates (REU's). MASS   students and instructo rs are expected to be involved prominently in  the REU program. In addition a vigorous program is planned to develop   mathematical thinking and enthusiasm for mathematics among area high   school students.         The Department is responsible for the mathematical education of future   scientists and engineers within the largest undergraduate student body   in Pennsylvania, and must at the same time promote mathematical literacy   across the full breadth of Penn State's student population.  To make   certain it meets these challenges as effectively as possible, the   Department will undertake a thorough review of its entire undergraduate   curriculum.  A task force will lead a broad effort to generate, discuss,   select, and implement the most effective curricular reforms, emphasizing   the relation of mathematics to other scientific disciplines and   industrial applications.         The Department will strengthen the educational and research missions   of its Pritchard Fluids Mechanics Laboratory by according it a  high priority in the selection of some graduate and postdoctoral   fellowships, and by building experimental apparatus which can be used   for undergraduate research projects, faculty demonstrations, and K-12   outreach activities.         The vertical integration of students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty,   both in research and training, is already central to the Department's   activities: intensive and extensive interactions among all three groups   are day to day realities.  Future initiatives will further strengthen   vertical integration in a number of very definite ways.  For instance,   graduate students funded through VIGRE fellowships and participating  in the MASS program as assistants will benefit from a double mentoring   relationship: they will work closely with an accomplished researcher   and teacher while themselves being mentors for talented and committed   undergraduates.  Postdoctoral fellows affiliated with the fluids   laboratory will assist faculty and, in  turn, assist graduate and   undergraduate students in carrying out the research and training   activities of the laboratory.  The teaching program planned for all   postdoctoral fellows will bring them into contact with other faculty   as mentors and with both graduate and undergraduate students in the  classroom.  It presents opportunities to develop innovative teaching and   learning strategies, while still providing a structured environment with   defined goals.         This project is being supported by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities within the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and the Division of Elementary, Secondary, and Informal Education within the Director of Education and Human Resources.",
