The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Robert R. Reynolds of the University of  Arkansas to work with Dr. Victor M. Alexandrov at the  Institute for Problems of Mechanics, Russian Academy of  Science in Moscow on the development of an improved method  of predicting and analyzing the vibrations of structures  that are subject to transient loads.  This procedure, known  as Transient Asymptotic Modal Analysis (TAMA), will permit  design engineers to estimate these responses using only a  small personal computer.    Dr. Alexandrov has been working in mechanics research for  over 36 years, and has made significant contributions in the  field.  He will provide a unique perspective that is not  available to the applicant in the U.S.  This institute has a  reputation as being one of the premier research  organizations in the world.      ***",
