 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Functional Nanotechnology award to Professors Josef Michl and John   Price at the University of Colorado-Boulder and Professor Mark Ratner at   Northwestern University is supported by the Advanced Materials and   Processing Program in Chemistry, the Surface Engineering and Tribology   Program in the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems, the Western Europe Program in the Division of International Programs  and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences   Directorate. The research deals with the design, synthesis and   characterization of nanometer scale surface-mounted molecular dipolar   rotors and rotor arrays. The basic device will be a surface-mounted   molecular dipolar rotor, whose base attaches covalently to a flat   insulating surface and supports an axis mounted perpendicularly to the   surface, which in turn supports a balanced 1-2 nm diameter rotor with a   large in-plane electric dipole moment.  The bearing, a fundamental   element of molecular-scale mechanics will consist of a metal-to-pi-face   bond. Both single rotors and self-assembling arrays of interacting rotors   will be constructed.  The size and moment of inertia of the rotor, its   height above the surface, the rotational friction, the magnitude of the   dipole, the spacing of the dipole array and its Curie temperature,   propagation velocities and dissipation will be controlled by appropriate   design of  chemical structures.  Rotor arrays have many potential applications as ferroelectric,   piezoelectric and pyroelectric materials, and will be useful in reducing   the size of voltage-tunable filters, oscillators, phase-shifters as well   as sensors, actuators, delay lines and resonators.  Such advances would   ultimately contribute to miniaturization of RF products such as cellular   handsets and wireless modems. Synergistic interactions between the   participating investigators in synthesis, characterization and theory   will provide a valuable, interdisciplinary learning experience for the   students involved.",
