The principal objective of this POWRE program proposal is to learn the necessary skills to take advantage of recent advances in the development of chemical fiberoptic sensors for biomedical, industrial and environmental remediation applications to adapt and optimize the technology for making analyte-specific sensors for biogeochemical processes studies.  My ultimate goal is to be able to utilize the capabilities of fiber-optic chemical analyte sensors for monitoring in situ, pore-water solute concentrations and fluxes resulting from sedimentary microbial activities, and to biogeochemically detail microenvironments associated with redox boundaries (i.e. around biogenic structures).  The application of sensor technology for such studies has tremendous potential for increasing sampling resolution, for increasing the number of simultaneous measurements that can be made, and for reducing sample processing time from hours or days, to minutes.  I initially intend to utilize the sensors developed in a series of laboratory experiments which will monitor bacterial activities and remineralization processes within sediments by directly measuring changes in solute fluxes and pore-water concentrations of O2, \u00d5CO2, NH4+. Fortunately, there are several renowned experts in engineering, marine biogeochemistry, and high-pressure geochemistry at SUNY Stony Brook with whom I can work and collaborate.  This is an ideal situation that will allow me to meet my teaching and family obligations while enabling me to develop new skills and methodologies.  I expect that the new skills and the collaborative relationships forged during this project will have a critical impact on my academic career by allowing me to expand my expertise technologically, increase my competitiveness for funding, and enable me to make a contribution to biogeochemical process studies..\r\n",
