 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the anticipated ability to build chips containing one billion transistors,  a larger amount of memory and functionality may be available on a single chip.   One challenge is how to manage and configure all these resources for optimal  performance and power dissipation.  This research explores the problem of  determining optimal use of all available resources on chip on an application by  application basis.  Where reconfigurable logic is available for use (either on  chip or off) synthesis tools can be used to determine optimal hardware/software  partitioning of the application as well as to architecturally synthesize the  hardware portions onto reconfigurable logic.  Tools are being developed to  produce high-performance power-conscious designs.  Various applications are being  explored to determine the effectiveness of these tools. The applications are  being run on reconfigurable computing platforms designed at Brown's computer  engineering laboratory. The topics of low-power and high-performance computer  design, and advanced computer architecture design are being introduced to the  curriculum via new courses and the modification of existing ones. Approaches to  advising and mentoring students at levels from pre-college to graduate are being  developed. Emphasis is in mentoring and outreach services to young women just  entering a career in science or engineering.",
