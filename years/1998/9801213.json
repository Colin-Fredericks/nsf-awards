 "awd_abstract_narration": "Schaal  9801213           The process by which populations within a species diverge over time to   form new species is poorly understood.  Schaal and Olsen propose to   study this process of genetic divergence, using two species in the plant   genus Manihot as a study system.  They will examine patterns of genetic   differentiation within and among the three subspecies of M. esculenta, as   well as between M. esculenta and the closely related species M. pruinosa.   Using a combination of DNA sequence data and other molecular genetic   markers, they will study how present-day population genetic structure   reflects historical relationships among populations in the study system.    Their analysis is specifically designed to discriminate between the effects   of gene flow (migration) between populations and the random sorting of   genetic variation (lineage sorting).       Understanding the process of genetic divergence at the boundary between   populations and species is crucial to understanding speciation and   evolutionary diversification.  This issue is thus of fundamental importance   in understanding the process of evolution.  The study proposed by Schaal and   Olsen offers several advantages for studying this speciation process.    Because their study system involves populations within a species as well   as between species, their analysis explicitly encompasses the   population-species interface.  Moreover, because interspecific   hybridization has been proposed to occur between the two species of   Manihot in the wild, the potential influence of gene flow is relevant at   both above and below the species boundary.  In addition, one of the three   subspecies of M. esculenta is the cultivated crop cassava, which is the   fourth most important starch crop in the world and a staple food for over   500 million people.  The proposed study will help to shed light on the   evolutionary and geographical origins of cassava, and will therefore   have important implications for approaches to conserv ing genetic diversity   in this crop.",
