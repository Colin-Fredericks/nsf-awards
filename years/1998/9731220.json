 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731220  Friedman    This award provides funds to support a twelve-month research  visit by Dr. Barry Friedman, Department of Physics, Sam  Houston State University, for collaboration with Dr. Shuji  Abe, Fundamental Physics Section, Electrotechnical  Laboratory (ETL), Tsukuba, Japan.  The collaborators will  conduct research to better understand non adiabatic  processes in low dimensional systems.  Surface hopping  methods have been developed which allow one to incorporate  the effects of non adiabatic processes in molecular dynamics  simulations.  The collaborators will use these non adiabatic  molecular dynamics techniques to study pi electron systems.  The particular systems include photo induced charge transfer  in conducting polymer C60 composites and the photo induced  conformation change of the visual pigment rhodopsin.  Both  of these systems are important due to their intrinsic  physical and biophysical interest and from the standpoint of  possible technological application.    Dr. Shuji Abe and his team at ETL are experts on the photo  physical processes in conducting polymers and fullerenes,  while Dr. Friedman has gained expertise in the use of non  adiabatic molecular dynamics.  Although adiabatic molecular  dynamics has been widely applied to pi electron systems, the  simulation of non adiabatic processes is relatively  unexplored.  Non adiabatic processes are important in these  systems, but they have been neglected due to the former lack  of computational tools.  The collaborators expect the  research to be very fruitful because it will combine the ETL  team's knowledge with Dr. Friedman's experience with non  adiabatic molecular dynamics.  This project is supported  under the Science Fellowship Program between the National  Science Foundation and the Japan Foundation Center for  Global Partnership.  ***",
