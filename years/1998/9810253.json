 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a retreat and-post-retreat activities designed to (1) integrate ethics into the business, science and engineering curriculum at the University of Puerto Rico at-Mayaguez (2) integrate business, science, and engineering content into ethics and values studies courses there, and (3) place this teaching firmly in the Puerto Rican cultural, economic, and political context.--The heart of the effort is a retreat scheduled to take place December 13-18, 1998.  This-retreat has workshop sessions designed to help university faculty select and prepare case-studies that can be used effectively in science, engineering, business, and humanities courses.  It also has sessions designed to acquaint business, science, and engineering faculty with the ethical approaches and issues-that are involved in the practice of business, science, and engineering in Puerto Rico.  To provide a foundation for a successful retreat, a-series of pre-retreat activities has been conducted, including a planning and scoping workshop that selected cases to be discussed in the retreat, and developed the retreat structure and expected outcomes.  Other preparatory activities included a forum that investigated ethical problems in science and engineering and an experimental class of business ethics designed specifically-for engineering students offered in the-spring semester of 1998.  The cases and other materials developed at the retreat will be introduced into university classes, and several post-retreat evaluation measures will be carried out.  Results will also be more broadly disseminated in Latin America and the U.S.",
