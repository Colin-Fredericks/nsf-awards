The main objective of the research is to construct a physical understanding and consistent mathematical description of the manner in which small and large-amplitude three-dimensional disturbances evolve in the flow. It is intended that  the mechanisms that provoke instabilities and the critical conditions leading to the various types of breakdown will be determined.  It is hoped that the study may lead to techniques to control these phenomena for variety of applications in mechanical and aeronautical engineering technologies.    The program will build on the methodology developed during a theoretical study  of the three-dimensional dynamics of swirling flows through pipes and in swirling jets that was completed under previous NSF support.  During this effort, the framework of research for the study of axisymmetric vortex flows will be extended to the general case of three-dimensional instabilities.  The proposed theoretical approach will combine classical techniques of asymptotic analysis with modern mathematical tools from functional and global analysis, theory of dynamical systems. and theory of nonlinear  partial differential equations.   The study will also be guided by experimental investigations that are currently being carried out at the Technion, as a collaborative effort between the principal investigator and Dr. J. Cohen, supported by a grant from the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation.  Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) and Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the velocity fields and flow visualization techniques are used to study the flow dynamics.  The theoretical and numerical studies will model the experimental conditions and the analytical predictions will be correlated with the measured data as well as acting as a guide for the experiments.  2      1",
