 "awd_abstract_narration": "CTS-9734153 Auerbach    Most environmentally friendly technologies rely on  separations that remove pollutants from benign materials. Zeolite  molecular sieves, consisting of regularly spaced, molecular-sized cages  shown below, are ideally suited for these separations. Although much is  known about zeolites, no simple theory exists for accurately predicting  how molecules diffuse through them. This is because of the difficulty in  modeling infrequent event dynamics coupled with strong  adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. Furthermore, zeolites are ignored by  the single most important class in physical science: freshman chemistry.  To address these issues, the Principal Investigator will develop novel  educational techniques and molecular transport theories aimed at  accelerating material and process screening of emerging chemical  technologies.     The mobility of many hydrocarbons in industrially important  zeolites is exceedingly sluggish, precluding the use of straightforward  molecular dynamics simulations, and hence requiring modeling techniques  specialized for infrequent events. Previous transition state simulations  of diffusion in zeolites were performed at low loadings, so that  adsorbate-adsorbate interactions could be neglected. These conditions  are irrelevant to industrial processes, which are carried out at  essentially full hydrocarbon loading. To model transport in zeolites  under industrial conditions, the Principal Investigator will develop a  hierarchy of three new techniques with varying accuracy and speed. An  accelerated molecular dynamics algorithm that adds a novel boost  potential for reducing site-to-site activation energies will predict  essentially exact diffusivities provided that the boost avoids  transition states. A lattice Monte Carlo simulation will be developed  that includes a new treatment of activation energies modified by  adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. Finally, a completely analytical  theory will be derived that synthesizes for the first time fluctua ting  activation energies with the mean field theory of fluids. This new  hierarchy provides the opportunity of choosing a model based on the need  for speed or accuracy in process optimization. These models will be  incorporated into a freshman chemistry module entitled: \"Zeolites in  Industry,\" involving new Web-based, interactive software that mimics the  physical and chemical properties of these systems.     This research will impact science and society on many levels.  First, incorporating zeolite science and technology into freshman  chemistry will excite and inform thousands of students about real-world  benefits of industrial chemistry and engineering. Second, this novel  combination of chemical reaction dynamics and mean field theory will  yield the first truly molecular theory for transport in zeolites,  elucidating how the competition between host-guest and guest-guest  interactions controls these transport processes. This will guide and  complement new diffusion measurements, and will accelerate screening of  new chemical processes. Third, when applied to aromatic separations and  hydrofluorocarbon separations in large-pore zeolites, these calculations  will help guide scientists and engineers in choosing optimal zeolite  Si:Al ratios, zeolite channel structures, temperatures and pressures for  carrying out efficient and cost-effective separations.",
