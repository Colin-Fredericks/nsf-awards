 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the Internet today, packet losses are typically recovered using  retransmission, as for example in TCP. The mechanism employed in TCP  works well in the unicast environment. In multicast environment,  however, such as the MBone, the TCP approach does not work  well, especially when the multicast groups are very large. Difficulties  arise because of two main problems: implosion and exposure.  Implosion  occurs when following a packet loss, many receivers multicast the same  request; implosion also occurs when in response to a request, many  receivers multicast the lost packet. Exposure occurs when requests and  retransmissions reach members that have not experienced loss. Both  implosion and exposure cause unecessary overhead.    Existing solutions are not general because of the trade-offs they offer  for reducing implosion and exposure.  SRM for example, trades latency  for reducing implosion, and uses a crude method for reducing exposure.  RMTP, TMTP and LBRRM reduce both implosion and exposure by arranging  members in a tree.  The tree, however, is hard to construct and  maintain in the face of dynamically changing groups without any access  to topology information.    We propose a new scheme to perform reliable multicast which overcomes  the limitations of existing solutions. Our scheme is based on a dynamic  tree hierarchy, but pushes the task of costructing and maintaining the  tree to the network, where it can be done very efficiently.  To achieve  this, we enhance the IP Multicast service model by adding new  forwarding services to the routers.  The scheme combines three ideas to  achieve near optimal performance: (a) electing a replier link at each  router to eliminate implosion, (b) defining the concept of a \"turning  point\" to discover the subtree where loss occurred, and (c) using  \"directed multicast\" to limit replies to the loss subtree. These ideas  minimize recovery latency and allow group members to be completely  isolated from the details of group topology, thus allowing fast   adaptation to dynamic membership changes.",
