 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fogelson\r\n9805518\r\n     The investigator undertakes modeling and computational\r\nsimulation of platelet aggregation and coagulation.  These are\r\nthe components of normal blood clotting and of the\r\nlife-threatening blood clots associated with vascular disease and\r\nwith the use of cardiovascular prostheses.  The investigator and\r\ncoworkers continue to explore and refine their models of platelet\r\naggregation in small and large diameter vessels; continue\r\ndevelopment of models of coagulation including the effects of\r\nflow, transport, and surface reactions; and integrate the\r\nplatelet aggregation and coagulation models to form a more\r\ncomprehensive model of the hemostatic and thrombotic processes.\r\nThese models use coupled systems of nonlinear partial and\r\nordinary differential equations to describe interactions between\r\nthe blood's fluid dynamics, the transport of platelets and\r\nchemicals in the blood plasma, the mechanics and chemistry of\r\ndeveloping aggregates, and the solution-phase and surface-bound\r\nbiochemistry of the coagulation process.  The models present\r\nsubstantial computational challenges that require development and\r\nuse of state-of-the-art numerical methods for their solution.\r\nThese include immersed boundary methods for fluid-material\r\ninteractions, high-resolution finite-difference methods combined\r\nwith Fourier-collocation spectral methods, immersed-interface\r\nmethods for handling transport in regions of complex geometry,\r\nand parallel computation.  This work involves extensive\r\ncomparisons between computational results and laboratory\r\nexperiments and is aided by collaboration with leading experts on\r\nflow and thrombosis.  The proposal is also concerned with\r\ndeveloping state-of-the-art parallel computational methods for\r\nsimulating biofluid dynamic flows like those involved in\r\naggregation and coagulation, and with including these\r\ncomputational tools in a powerful and easy-to-use problem solving\r\nenvironment that facilitates solving a wide range of complex\r\nbiofluid dynamic problems.\r\n     Thrombosis, which is the formation of blood clots within\r\nvessels of the circulatory system, is the proximal cause of most\r\nheart attacks and of other severe cardiovascular problems such as\r\nischemia and angina.  It is also a major problem associated with\r\nthe use of blood-contacting prostheses such as mechanical heart\r\nvalves.  The process by which these blood clots form is very\r\ncomplex and involves many dynamic, sometimes competing, sometimes\r\nmutually-reinforcing, biophysical and biochemical processes.  A\r\nmajor part of this project involves developing powerful\r\nmathematical and computational tools for studying this complex\r\nprocess, and using these tools to probe the factors that effect\r\nthe location, extent, and speed of formation of thrombi.\r\nComputational modeling complements traditional experimental\r\napproaches and provides a way to simulate complex dynamic events,\r\nlike the dynamic interactions among fluid, blood cells, clotting\r\nfactors, and blood vessel or prosthesis surface that lead to\r\nthrombosis, that are beyond the reach of current laboratory\r\ntechniques.  Such simulations can give new insights into the\r\nbasic mechanisms that control this important biological process,\r\nand can ultimately help in the more rational design of\r\ntherapeutic interventions and prosthetic devices.  Many other\r\nchallenging biological and biomedical flow problems have features\r\nin common with that of simulating thrombosis, and so the\r\nstate-of-the-art parallel computational methods developed for\r\nthis project potentially have wide-spread application to problems\r\nimportant to basic science, health care, and biotechnology.  To\r\nhelp realize this potential the investigators develop and\r\ndisseminate an easy-to-use software package that facilitates\r\nusing these computational methods to set up and carry out\r\nsimulations of important biofluid dynamics problems.\r\n\r\n",
