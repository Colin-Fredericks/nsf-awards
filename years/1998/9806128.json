 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 98-06128  HUDSON     The blood-brain barrier (BBB) forms a unique boundary between the  circulating blood and the tissue of the brain and spinal cord.  Normally the barrier prevents the entry of most immune cells  (cells participating on the body's immune response to foreign  pathogens), bacteria, viruses, antibiotics, and chemotherapy drugs  into the nervous system. The BBB is formed by \"endothelial\" cells  lining the capillaries that exhibit \"tight junctions\" between  adjacent cells.  The presence of these tight junctions, which can  be recognized by their special dense appearance in electron  micrographs, stands  in contrast to the situation for endothelial  cells of other organs. The formation of the tight junctions is  induced by a certain type of cell from the nervous system, termed  an \"astrocyte.\"  Astrocytes have processes which make contact with  the endothelial cells. The role of astrocytes and other \"glial\"  cells (cells closely associated with nerve cells) such as  microglia in influencing additional BBB functions is not known.  Certain immune cells are capable of adhering and penetrating the  BBB, surveying the nervous tissue for antigen, and continuing to  the lymphoid tissues for immunity functions. What is not clear,  however, is the mechanism for selecting which immune cells  penetrate the BBB. Experiments in this project are designed to  determine if astrocytes and microglia, stimulated by factors found  in circulation, can alter the ability of immune cells to adhere to  and penetrate the endothelial cells of the brain. This will  primarily be accomplished using cell culture methods in various  combinations of endothelial cells, astrocytes, and microglia,  stimulated and unstimulated. Immune cells will be applied to the  combinations of cells and the ability of immune cells to penetrate  the cell layers will be determined using staining techniques and a  special microscope that allows the cell layers to be visualized in  3 dimensions. Because adherence and trafficking of i mmune cells in  non-nervous tissue is controlled by activation of endothelial  cells with increased expression of adhesion molecules, it is  possible that astrocytes and/or microglia influence expression of  adhesion molecules in brain endothelium through secretion of  \"cytokines\". The presence or absence of adhesion molecules will be  detected through staining techniques specific to each. Results of  this project will expand understanding of BBB function and  immunity in the nervous system of mammals.  This POWRE award will  promote the further development of Dr. Hudson's research career in  this important area.",
