 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigators conducting research on human decision-making frequently have been deterred from working with people of varying experience, expertise, age, socioeconomic status, culture, etc. because of logistical difficulties.  Recent developments in computer technology may provide a solution to many of these logistical problems.  Potential participants may be reached at home or in their offices through the Internet using aesthetically enticing video and audio materials.  The primary goal of this project is to develop and test a prototype Internet-based Decision Research System (IDRS).  This system will be capable of reproducing simulated decision environments and conducting research using other typical laboratory procedures at remote locations while gathering many of the measures typically obtained in the laboratory (e.g., time spent accessing different sources of information, order of access, self reports of confidence, subjective probability estimates).  The efficacy of the IDRS will be tested in a demonstration project aimed at an important applied problem: providing a better understanding of the information processing and decision-making strategies used by aircraft pilots.  Pilot errors are blamed for most aviation accidents and incidents.  Understanding how pilots make decisions and how the strategies they use change with experience could help in the development of improved training materials and safety procedures.  In this study, pilots will participate in simulations of typical aviation problems.  What information they access and what strategies they follow in making their decisions will be analyzed.  If the IDRS proves to be useful, this system and others like it could dramatically alter the way behavioral research is conducted.",
