When more than one neural system is involved in guiding  and directing behavior on the basis of experience, there are three  possible ways that these systems can logically interact during a  learning situation: A) they may operate independently and  simultaneously, in a parallel redundant fashion, B) one system may  predominate over the other(s) to control behavior, or C) multiple  systems may need to cooperate in order to solve a given task. The  goal of the proposed experiments is to collect preliminary data on  the neurochemical basis of these interactions in order to develop  in vivo animal model systems for the complex cognitive control of  behavior.    The proposed preliminary research utilizes behavioral tasks  that have been used previously with permanent and reversible  lesion methodologies to focus on the second logical form of  interaction, one neural system predominating over the other(s). To  investigate the roles of specific neural structures in the  functional and neurochemical relationships among multiple memory  systems, the experiments employ two complementary techniques. The  first is in vivo microdialysis coupled with high pressure liquid  chromatography (HPLC) to measure neurotransmitter release in  structures important for learning and memory (i.e., hippocampus  and dorsal striatum) during ongoing learning and behavior. The  second is site-specific direct brain injections to alter the  activity in specific neurochemical systems during learning and  behavior. The findings are anticipated to provide the basis for  understanding the mechanisms und erlying the allocation of control  over behavior by specific neural systems. The aim of future  studies is to describe and categorize further the neuroanatomical  and neurochemical bases of interactions among multiple memory  systems. Greater understanding of these interactions is necessary  to develop accurate models of the ongoing complex control and  direction of behavior. Such refined models would be of value to  other fields of inquiry ranging from the basic neurobiology and  neuroethology to the design of complex computational neural  networks.",
