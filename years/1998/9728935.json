 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728935  Trelease    Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-enclosed compartments (organelles) in which various   cellular functions are carried out.  This isolation of various functions within physical   boundaries is critical to the life of the cell:  it allows the cell to regulate the functions of   each compartment separately; and it prevents the contents of each compartment from   interfering with others.  However, it does require that the cells have mechanisms for   sorting and translocating individual proteins to their proper subcellular locations.  One   type of intracellular compartment is the peroxisome, which occurs in virtually all   eukaryotic cells.  Peroxisomes participate in a very wide range of metabolic pathways,   depending on the cell or tissue type in which they function.  The overall goal of this   project is to understand the complicated means by which peroxisomal membrane proteins   (PMPs) become selectively integrated into the boundary membrane of peroxisomes   (glyoxysomes) in oilseed seedlings, and to understand the functions of such PMPs within   the membrane as the seedlings develop.    Three specific objectives are proposed relative to the biogenesis of plant peroxisomes.    The first aim is to discover the putative membrane peroxisomal targeting signal (mPTS)   responsible for targeting peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase (pAPX) to glyoxysomes, and   define the topographic orientation of the protein within the membrane. This information is   particularly relevant for oilseed glyoxysomes, to understand how the membrane is   protected from abundant reactive oxygen species and to understand the pathway for   regeneration of NAD+ required for conversion of storage oils into carbohydrates.  The   second aim is to test the hypothesis that a 73 kilodalton membrane-bound polypeptide,   PMP73, is a novel \"peroxin\" which functions at the boundary membrane as a molecular   chaperone in the uptake of proteins from the cytosol.  The third aim is to try to discover   additional plant PM Ps, using polyclonal rabbit antisera raised previously and already used   successfully to discover PMP73 and pAPX.      It is likely that, in addition to the overall goal of understanding peroxisomal biogenesis and   function in developing oilseed seedlings, the results of these studies will provide more   general insight into peroxisomal biogenesis that will be applicable to diverse species and   tissues.",
