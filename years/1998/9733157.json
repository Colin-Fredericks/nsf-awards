The objective of the program is  twofold:  (1) Research:  Develop NDE sensors for high-speed  monitoring of defects in rail tracks and (2) Education:  Develop problem-based learning modules and interactive  course materials by bringing exciting research activities  into classrooms and the Internet.    This project is outlined as follows:              The needs of high-speed monitoring system for assessing         rail condition and integrity are addressed.  It is pointed         out that a critical requirement is to develop a sensor         system that does not require contact with the rail surface.                          Needs of NDE Education:  The needs of introducing         innovative and cohesive NDE engineering curricula for         educating today civil engineering students are addressed.         The importance of educating students with multidisciplinary         background is pointed out.  Also discussed are the demands         of dynamic revision and practice-oriented civil engineering         curricula.    Major impact of the project is the development and transfer  of technology to industry, and the potential to address  future engineering education curriculum.  ***",
