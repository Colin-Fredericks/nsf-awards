 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum mechanics is a theory of microscopic physics  that underlies many of the technological advances of the  century.  Nevertheless, there continue to be puzzles  connected with its interface with the macroscopic world. The  systematic study of that interface, within statistical  mechanics, has puzzles of its own connected to the origins  of irreversibility.  The Investigator has suggested an  intertwining of these problems with a common resolution, and  has summarized his previous publications in a recent book,  `Time's Arrows and Quantum Measurement` (Cambridge Univ.  Press, 1997).  Continued research in this area will consist  mainly in the sharpening of experimental tests proposed in  the book.  An encouraging aspect of this project is that the  experimental techniques involved are similar to those  presently being developed for quantum computing and quantum  cryptography (especially some of the EPR pair work).  Other  research by the Investigator will concern developments in  the Feynman path integral, especially its application to  Lagrangian-only theories. Finally, collaborative work in  statistical mechanics will involve abstract studies on non-  equilibrium systems as well as practical applications to  zeolites and other problems in photochemistry.",
