 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Environmental Molecular Science Institute (EMSI) on Chemical Sources and Sinks at Liquid/Solid Interfaces at Columbia University, directed by George W. Flynn and Richard M. Osgood, supports an interdisciplinary research program on the behavior of contaminants in subsurface environments as well as a wide range of educational activities, including special programs for K-12 teachers, high school students, and the public.  This Institute is jointly funded by the NSF Division of Chemistry, MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and Directorate for Education and Human Resources and by the Chemical Sciences Division of the Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Department of Energy.\r\n\r\nThe Institute is organized into three collaborative research groups:  molecular scale processes on mineral surfaces and in pores; fundamental chemical and biological reactions and transport processes in microscopic porous media; and macroscopic chemical transport and dispersal.  The results at the three length scales (molecular, microscopic, macroscopic) will provide input to a chemical and transport model that will be tested in the \"real world\" by partners at industrial laboratories and at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).  Particular emphasis will be placed on organic contaminants on iron oxide surfaces and their degradation by enzymatic or photochemical processes.  Examples of some problems that could be addressed more effectively by improved knowledge of subsurface transport are: behavior of pollutants on hydrated metal oxides and soils; mechanism and dynamics of chemical decomposition on surfaces; and migration of organic contaminants.  The Institute is expected to have a major impact on the development of new tools to predict and remediate contamination by organic chemicals. \r\n\r\nThe 22-member team of investigators includes 16 faculty from five Columbia departments and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, plus one faculty member from Barnard College and five researchers from PNNL.  Additional collaborators are located at GE, IBM, DuPont, Exxon, and Inrad.  Approximately four postdoctoral associates, 20 graduate students, and 20 undergraduates will participate each year.",
