 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803735  Mayer  The goal of this proposed research is to determine whether  the eye behavior of mammographers is correlated to their  diagnostic accuracy.  A clear understanding of the  relationship between diagnostic accuracy and eye behavior  has the potential to save many of the lives of the estimated  180,200 woman afflicted with breast cancer each year.  The  information from studying the visual processes of  mammographers can be used to develop effective training  methods and computer aided diagnostic algorithms to reduce  the occurrence of false positives and false negatives  associated with this disease.  To test the research  hypothesis, an unobtrusive PC based eye-gaze system, called  ERICA, will record the visual pattern that mammographers  utilize while screening mammograms.  The ERICA hardware,  positioned beneath a lightbox, can capture the visual  process a reader uses in mammographic screening.  The ERICA  system captures eye position and pupil diameter as a  function of time.  Mammographic experts from the University  of Virginia Health Sciences Center will screen 200 randomly  selected mammograms over the course of a year, Cases will be  selected from an existing telemammography project at the  University of Virginia, which includes 400 mammograms.  ***",
