 "awd_abstract_narration": "9730606  Thier    The thirteen SEPUP (Science Education for Public Understanding Project) modules, previously developed, are revised to update the science issues and evidence in the modules, to align them more closely to the science standards and to develop an authentic assessment system for them.  The assessment system is based on that used in SEPUP developed course, Issues, Evidence and You.  At the request of teachers, an additional module on energy is developed with partial funding from EPRI.  The SEPUP (formerly CEPUP) modules have been used nationwide to change the way science is taught and learned primarily in the middle schools.  The target of the revised and enhanced modules is grades 7 - 9.  A Guide to SEPUP Modules and the Science Standards correlates each module to the Standards and Benchmarks and recommends groupings of modules to address different content areas at different grades.  A video on Issue Oriented Science Using SEPUP illustrates for teachers how the modules address standards for content, assessment and teaching and how they can provide access for students with different learning styles.  Teachers are involved with the revision and testing.  The modules contain suggestions for including educational technology.  LAB-AIDS continues to distribute the printed materials and kits.",
