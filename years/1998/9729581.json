This excess  cell formation is particularly noteworthy in the nervous system,  where individual cells have unique roles.  Programmed cell death  (PCD) plays a central role in the elimination of excess cells and  in sculpting developing systems.  The goal of this project is to  improve our understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying  PCD, using the central nervous system of the moth Manduca sexta as  a model system.  Programmed cell death is a common feature of  Manduca's postembryonic development.  During the larval stage,  thousands of adult-specific neurons are added to the ganglia of  the central nervous system, and throughout this period of cell  addition, cell death is also observed.  In addition, the  transition between the larval and adult stages is characterized by  the death of obsolete larval muscles and neurons that are not  required by the adult.  Previous research has shown that the  pattern of cell death observed in Manduca depends on such things  as the cell's lineage, segmental identity, and time of birth.  This complex pattern of cell death most likely results from  differences in the mechanisms underlying PCD in different cells.  Dr. Booker will carry out a series of experiments that are  designed to investigate these mechanisms.  A series of endocrine  manipulations will be used to determine whether the steroid  hormone ecdysone plays a role in regulating the neuronal PCD  observed in the larval stage, and after the onset of  metamorphosis.  During postembryonic development, the level of  cell death is higher in the abdominal compared to the thoracic  ganglia.  To learn more about the role of segmental identity in  the regulation of PCD, a moth homeotic mutant, in which one  thoracic segment is duplicated, will be examined to determine if  its pattern of cell death is altered.   A biochemical  characterization of PCD within the nervous system will be  done  using a series of specific inhibitors of the ubiquitin-dependent  proteolytic pathway, because preliminary evidence suggests that  this pathway plays a key role in PCD in the moth.  Dr. Booker's  group has found that application of potent inhibitors of the  ubiquitin-dependent pathway can selectively block the PCD of  muscles in the developing moth.  This finding will allow them to  directly test which cell types, at which developmental stages,  utilize this mechanism of PCD.  The results obtained from this  series of experiments will improve our understanding of the  biochemical mechanisms involved in PCD, and how PCD can  selectively occur in different cell types at different times.",
