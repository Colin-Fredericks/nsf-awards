The  experiments depend on measurement of electron drag, which  directly determines electron-electron scattering rates between  closely spaced but electrically isolated two-dimensional (2D)  gases. The experiments will investigate the influence of atomic  disorder in the 2D planes on the electrical transport, and will  probe exchange and correlation effects via determination of the  spin polarization of 2D electrons subject to an in-plane magnetic  field. The research is unique in providing direct measurements of  parameters that can be directly compared with important  theoretical predictions for the behavior of electrons in low-  symmetry environments. The work will deepen our understanding of  disorder and correlation effects that are of fundamental  importance in the microelectronics and magnetism industries. The  work provides a valuable arena for training graduate students in  both advanced technology and fundamental physics.  %%%  This condensed matter physics project investigates the influences  of disorder and correlation effects on electron systems.
