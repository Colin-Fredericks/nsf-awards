 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  Chandra  9761291    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore a novel technique of using silicon (Si) tubes for the production of polycrystalline silicon, a material critical for electronics, photovoltaics, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and many other devices.  A current worldwide shortage of polysilicon material may become acute in the future.  Bulk polysilicon is currently produced by chemical vapor deposition of Si on a hot thin crystalline silicon rod.  The diameter of the rod increases with the deposition, but the process is very slow in the beginning because of small surface area.  Two different Si tube-based deposition techniques will be examined.  The first will increase yield by 15-20% by allowing deposition on both inner and outer surfaces of the tube (with simple retrofitting), whereas the second scheme will lead to a much simpler reactor design with a much reduced energy requirement, better control, and higher yield.  Phase I will establish the relative feasibility of the two concepts through theoretical research, design studies, and industrial testing.    Potential commercial applications are expected production of polysilicon in the semiconductor and solar industries  ***",
