 "awd_abstract_narration": "A shortage of well-trained Braille teachers increases while case loads that may span hundreds of miles soar.  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Exceptional Teaching Aids will create unique speech-assisted Braille mathematics in the form of a stand-alone self-study system.  Speech Assisted Learning (SAL) system utilizes synthesized speech for tutorials, verification of Braille symbols, and feedback.  No keyboarding skills are required.  The overall objective of Phase I is to determine whether visually impaired individuals can augment Braille math instruction via the SAL.  The research design includes developing a prototype, developing curriculum, and evaluating human performance.  Successful  research and development of such a system will benefit visually impaired persons of all ages having a variety of abilities and needs.   The versatility and user friendliness of the proposed SAL system makes it broadly appealing and would greatly increase Braille math literacy.  For the first time, Braille math instruction will be available in schools, offices, libraries, government agencies, or community centers.  Moreover, instruction in all academic areas could be offered.",
