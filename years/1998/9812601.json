 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a workshop on Distributed Information, Computation, and Process Management for Scientific and Engineering Environments, held in Herndon, VA on May 15-16, 1998. The workshop organizer is Professor Nicholas M. Patrikalakis from MIT. Workshop participants are researchers in the field of computer science and domain specialists from the sciences and engineering disciplines. Advances in the research on complex physical and man-made systems, especially those exhibiting interacting dynamic processes and disparate spatial and temporal scales, generate new requirements for information and computational environments and infrastructure. Towards the goal of satisfying these requirements, the primary topics of the workshop include the application of digital library technology for scientific simulation; the design and implementation of cross-domain simulation integration; metadata models and search/retrieval mechanisms for scientific software; networking issues for transparent access and sharing of data, including automatic generalized data translation and remote software invocation; and emerging standards for distributed simulations. The goal of the workshop is to stimulate research activities in fundamental technologies that will enable easy access to distributed computational, data and various information resources by scientists and researchers in diverse fields. The workshop will produce an advisory document outlining open problems and proposed avenues of research in distributed simulation, analysis, and information systems. The report will be widely disseminated and also available on-line. The application of further research efforts along these lines will help to increase the availability, effectiveness, and utilization of large-scale, cross-disciplinary distributed scientific systems, and facilitate research activities.     http://deslab.mit.edu/DesignLab/dicpm/",
