 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870435  Miller  The addition of disinfectants such as free chlorine to  drinking water can greatly increase corrosion of the  distribution system pipes.  Many small communities which do  not currently disinfect their drinking water may soon need  to do so under the proposed Ground Water Disinfection Rule.  It is anticipated that the sudden addition of a strong  oxidant such as free chlorine will lead to additional  corrosion of the aged iron pipes found in these small water  systems, but this area of water chemistry has not been well  studied.  In this project, several traditional and newer  corrosion assessment techniques will be applied to the study  of iron corrosion.  Pipe loop studies will be combined with  electrochemical analysis and material (scale) analysis to  give a more complete understanding of the chemistry of water  distribution systems, including the chemistry of scales.  It  is anticipated that the results of this project will help  the water community to better interactions between oxidants  and pipe scale.    This project will allow the P.I. to develop experience in  the use of analytical techniques which have traditionally  not been applied to the study of corrosion in aged pipes.  The electrochemical analytical work, in particular, will  expand the research capabilities of the P.I., and will allow  her to do future work involving electrochemistry and the  application of this field to Environmental Engineering.  ***",
