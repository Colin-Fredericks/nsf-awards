The research will focus on the development of techniques for future LIGO interferometers that will operate in the LIGO facilities after the first interferometers have completed their studies.\r\n\r\nOne of the key problems in the LIGO interferometers is the reduction of noise in the suspensions of the test-masses.  This noise reduction can be achieved by developing the highest possible quality factors for the suspensions' pendulum and violin modes and by suppressing excess (non-thermal, non-Gaussian) noise of various sorts.  The members of the MSU group have made substantial progress in this direction over the last five years.  Their past studies revealed a number of new aspects of suspension noise and fabrication that will be important for future LIGO interferometers.  Following up on the previous results, they have chosen the principal goals of the research to be done under this grant to be:\r\n\r\n  I.     To realize further improvements of the quality-factors of the pendulum and violin modes of the suspensions (Q-factors greater than about 100 million are expected).  These will be achieved by the identification and reduction of a variety of dissipation mechanisms, including losses caused by electric and magnetic fields that actuators apply to the test masses, and surface losses in the suspension fibers.\r\n\r\n  II.    To carry out experimental and theoretical investigations of excess noise in suspension fibers at a level which is much less than thermal equilibrium energies.\r\n\r\nThe MSU group has also worked in the past on \"quantum non-demolition\" techniques for precision measurements.  In collaboration with Professor Thorne of Caltech they will pursue a third goal:\r\n\r\n  III.   To devise and to analyze theoretically schemes for gravitational-wave antennae in LIGO, and readout systems which can overcome the \"standard quantum limit\" while using light power that is low enough to be practical.\r\n\r\nThe grant provides for travel funds so the Moscow group can transfer to the LIGO team the techniques, and technology that they develop for high-Q fused silica suspension systems, and for the reduction of various kinds of dissipation and excess noise in the test masses and their suspensions.  The Moscow group will also provide advice to the LIGO team about various aspects of the LIGO interferometer R&D program, including R&D for enhancements of the first LIGO interferometers.\r\n*** \r\n",
