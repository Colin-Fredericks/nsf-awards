 "awd_abstract_narration": "9734236  Anseth  Treatment of bone fractures through fixation requires the  use of materials with sufficient strength to allow fixation,  good tissue/material compatibility, and facile molding (into  potentially complex shapes) for easy placement by the  surgeon.  In addition, controlled degradation is imperative  to restore optimum bone function upon healing.  The material  must initially re-establish the mechanical integrity of the  bone and subsequently degrade to allow new bone ingrowth.  Hence, degradable polymeric materials provide an important  alternative to widely-used metallic implants.  Degradable  polymers eliminate the need for a second surgery and, if  carefully designed, can release compounds to accelerate  healing or prevent infections.  The research component of  this CAREER plan targets the development of a new class of  high-strength, surface-eroding, photocurable (i.e., react  upon exposure to light) polymers for orthopaedic  applications such as fracture fixation.  In particular, the  rationale for this work is driven by three key hypotheses:  i)  photopolymerization allows in vivo curing, which will  provide great flexibility for the placement and handling of  implantable polymers for surgeons; ii) crosslinking of  polymers will provide an effective tool to control the  physical and mechanical properties of materials without  major modifications to the backbone chemistry, which can  alter biocompatibility; and iii) surface-eroding  polyanhydrides networks, which degrade in a controlled  fashion and maintain the structural integrity of the  polymer, will be advantageous for orthopaedic applications.  The educational component of this CAREER plan is intimately  linked with the research plan.  Special opportunities for  undergraduate research (e.g., senior thesis projects) and  incorporation of team-oriented research projects in advanced  elective courses will be developed.  Outside of education  through research, new courses will be developed to examine  engineering aspects o f the human body and the use of  engineering skills to address medical problems.  Finally,  the University of Colorado has completed its Integrated  Teaching and Learning Laboratory (ITLL).  This facility is a  national model for future directions in engineering  education, and the integrated learning approach (addressing  learning styles and cross-departmental teamwork) will be  incorporated and piloted in a new polymer courses.  ***",
