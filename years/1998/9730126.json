 "awd_abstract_narration": "9730126  Heeger    Semiconducting polymers offer important advantages as potential  laser materials, e.g., High photoluminescence efficiency (PL),  low self-absorption, emission wavelengths that span the visible  spectrum, easily processed into optical quality thin films, and  electrically pumped in a diode configuration.    The high PL efficiency and large cross-section for stimulated  emission persist to high concentrations.  In contrast to  traditional laser dyes, conjugated polymers function as high gain  laser materials in the solid state, neat and undiluted.  To  obtain lower thresholds and to generate coherent laser light, it  is necessary to incorporate the conjugated polymer into a  resonant structure.    The goal of this research is to achieve low threshold optically  pumped polymer lasers through improvements in materials and  materials processing and through the creation of novel resonant  structures.  With sufficiently low thresholds, lasing structures  fabricated from semiconducting polymers can be developed as cw  lasers.  For example they could be pumped with conventional light  sources, or with blue-emitting LEDs (e.g. using the InGaN  technology), or with solar radiation (solar powered lasers!).  To  accomplish this goal, significant improvements in the polymer  materials are required to enable the high-Q resonant structures  that are needed.  These improvements and the related achievement  of high-Q resonant structures with conjugated polymers as the  gain media are the goals of the proposed research.  The actual  work will include:  measurements of gain and loss in photopumped  semiconducting polymer films; materials development including  fabrication of high quality, low-loss optical thin film  waveguides and expansion into new conjugated systems (new PPV  derivatives, polyfluorene derivatives and spiro-conjugated  materials);  development of cladding materials; and evaluation of  these conjugated materials in microcavities, in distributed  feedback structures and in `whispe ring gallery mode' structures  (micro-disks and micro-rings).  %%%  This research will provide fundamental understanding and  potentially new and improved devices in the area of laser  materials and electrically active polymers.  ***",
