The proposed activities will be centered around the theme of her research utilizing high risk, complex and automated systems for monitoring and control of numerous environments.  Techniques and methodologies for successful human and intelligent system interaction with respect to emergency alerting systems will be explored.  Human performance to alarm situations with and without the presence of the intelligent agent will be evaluated (response time and accuracy of results).",
