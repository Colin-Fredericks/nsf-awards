 "awd_abstract_narration": "This agenda-setting workshop responds to recent renewed interest in the geographies of children and youth.  This interest stems from a more critical perspective on what constitutes childhood and youth, with specific focus on how the production of space disenfranchises and marginalizes children and youth in contemporary urban society.  Additional concerns to be addressed by the workshop include how children embrace identity politics and create space, how childhood is commodified and exploited, and how symbols between adults and youths are being homogenized.  The workshop will bring together international scholars from a broad range of disciplines to discuss and probe this topic with the intent of identifying a focused research agenda for the near (ca. 5-10 yrs) future.  This is an exciting, emerging, and potentially important area of research in Geography, and it shares similarities with other investigations focusing on the importance of spatiality to issues of race, class, ethnicity, gender, diversity, and physical disability.  This workshop on Young People's Geographies will explore these commonalities and thereby may yield added insight into a broad range of theoretical and empirical concerns within the discipline.  Moreover, the specific research area will undoubtedly lead to a deeper and nuanced appreciation for childhood and youth within modern urban environments, and this would be an essential contribution to contemporary political debates on public policy directed toward concerns of crime, parenthood, and the overall moral fiber of society",
