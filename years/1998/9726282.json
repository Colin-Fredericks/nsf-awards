Conflicting morphology-based hypotheses of phylogenetic relationship have hindered attempts to understand the evolutionary origins of various unique ecological and behavioral characteristics (e.g., ant-mutualism, parental care, anointing behavior) and the possible roles that the acquisition or loss of such traits played in the diversification of the group. This project will provide increased resolution of the phylogenetic relationships among membracoid family-group taxa by adding characters from nuclear ribosomal  (28S) and protein-coding (elongation factor l-alpha) gene sequences for a large sample of leafhopper and treehopper species. Analyses of these data will address a number of long-standing questions, including: (1) Did the initial divergence of treehoppers coincide with the loss ofjumping ability and acquisition of a sessile, cryptic juvenile stage, or are these retained ancestral characteristicsT; (2) Did treehoppers arise prior to the break-up of Gondwana, as implied by one morphology-based phylogeny, or did this lineage arise in South America after the isolation of that continent, as implied by the fossil record?; (3) Did shifts in habitat, host, and/or feeding stragegy promote the diversification of certain leafhopper and treehopper groups?; and (4) Were ant mutualism and egg-guarding behavior acquired independently in several different lineages?",
