This proposal is for an international conference on the  diversity of form and function found among complex molecules  of the membrane of living nerve cells.  The molecules of  interest are of two sorts:   \"Ion channels\" allow charged  small molecules such as sodium, potassium and calcium ions  to pass into and out of the nerve cells.   \"Receptors\" react  to signal molecules (neurotransmitters) released by other  nerve cells to communicate the signal to the interior of the  cell.   Together, these molecules are responsible for some  of the key steps in the processing and storage of  information and the regulation of behavior by the nervous  system.  The program will bring together eminent scholars  and junior scientists with overlapping interests in a very  dynamic field of study.  The goal is to examine and share  new technical advances in the area and to consider the  conceptual foundations of ion channel biophysics and  physiology.  These goals are central to our progressively  better understanding of the brain.",
