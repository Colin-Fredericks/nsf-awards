 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802685  Lampert    In recent years, a number of researchers, designers, and practitioners around the country have been exploring the design and use of visual and multimedia technologies in support of the learning and study of teaching.  At the same time, teachers and teacher educators have been creating and using cases of practice as tools for teacher development.  It is not possible to expand the use of these materials to broader communities and audiences through communications technologies.  We propose that communications be established among the various interest groups by initiating communication around a set of identified problems and a set on examples of ongoing approaches to these problems to culminate in a workshop in early summer, 1998 at the University of Michigan.  A report will be produced from this workshop to guide the design, development, and use of multimedia and communications technologies for the study of teaching.",
