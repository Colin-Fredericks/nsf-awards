 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727728  Haimo    Melanocytes from fish scales and frog skin have been studied extensively as model systems for studying bi-directional transport of cell organelles, the pigment granules, along polarized microtubule tracks.  Current evidence indicates strongly that two separate force-generating motor proteins are involved, each responsible for movement in one of the opposing directions.  The motor kinesin is believed responsible for dispersion of granules, and dynein is believed responsible for aggregation.  These motors bind to the organelles and then interact with the microtubules to generate the directed forces.  A central question, however, is what regulates these motors to turn them on and off in a coordinated manner so that only one of the two opposing forces is generated at any given time.  One possibility is that directed movement is regulated by differential binding of the motors to the organelles.  A second possibility is that both motors bind stabily to the organelle, but that only one is active at any given time.  The present studies are based on preliminary evidence that supports the second hypothesis.  To confirm this hypothesis, dynein and kinesin will be isolated from organelles under conditions when one or the other motor is active, and then their properties will be compared.  The separate motors will be added back to reconstituted systems in which their ability to bind to microtubules and to generate force will be assayed.  Since a likely means of regulating the motor activity would be the reversible phosphorylation of the motor proteins, evidence for differential phosphorylation of the motors will be sought.  Putative phosphorylation sites will be altered to determine if these sites are directly involved in regulating the activity of either or both motors.  These experiments address the fundamental question of coordinate regulation of multiple motors involved in organelle movement.  Results will be directly applicable to an understanding of these and similar motors in a wide v ariety of cells.",
