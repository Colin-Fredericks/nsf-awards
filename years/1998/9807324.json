 "awd_abstract_narration": "9807324  Brown  Reproductive success is central to individual fitness and to survival of populations. It has received renewed attention with the increase in long-term studies, yet because so few studies last longer than 30 years, much remains to be learned about long-term aspects of reproductive success. Aphelocoma ultramarina is a species that is well suited for studies of long-term patterns of reproduction. It is long-lived, has extremely delayed reproduction for a passerine, has probably the most conservative dispersal behavior of any North American bird and has already been studies for 29 years. This, it provides a rare opportunity to study the role of kinship in dispersal. This research will focus on three conceptual areas: 1) Using a natural experiment that controls for environmental influences and a new method of analysis (nest mate dyads), patterns of dispersal in relation to avoidance of close kin and the danger of inbreeding depression will be investigated. 2) The expected decline in reproductive success with advanced age will be studies in relation to the costs of reproduction and the possible role of helps in offsetting costs. 3) Finally, the potential effects of global climate change on natural populations will continue to be investigated. In particular, the statistical relationships between ENSO events and reproduction with regard to yearly variation in precipitation. This study represents an important, long-term data set that has implications for understanding how climatic events effect fitness over both short and long time scales.",
