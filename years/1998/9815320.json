 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made to Dr. Philip G. Jessop of the Chemistry Department,   University of California, Davis, for investigation of the dependence of   the selectivity of some organic reactions on the pressure of   near-critical supercritical fluids (SCFs).   The award is in the   Technology for Sustainable Environment component of the EPA/NSF   Partnership for Environmental Research, and support is provided by the   MPS Organic Dynamics Chemistry Program and Office of Multidisciplinary   Activities.  Homogeneously catalyzed asymmetric syntheses, such as   cyclopropanation, deprotonation, and alkylation reactions, will be   studied.  The pressure dependence of enantio- or diastereo- selectivity   will be tested as the critical point of the solution is approached.  For   each system that shows a pressure dependence, the effect of several   additional parameters will be determined, including temperature, choice   of SCF (carbon dioxide, xenon or fluoroform), side groups on the ligands,   choice of substrate, and use of binary supercritical fluid mixtures as   reaction media.  Activation volumes will be calculated from the effect of   pressure on reaction rates.  Many organic compounds are asymmetric, that is, can be present in right-   or left-handed forms.  Particularly in pharmaceutical applications, it is   important to synthesize the specific form that has the desired biological   effectiveness.   If the correct form can be made with high selectivity,   then the industrial process is more efficient, both economically and   environmentally.   In this project, supercritical fluids, some of which   have low environmental impact, will be tested for their suitability as   solvents for a variety of asymmetric organic reactions.",
