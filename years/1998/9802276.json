Platz from the Department of Chemistry at the Ohio State   University.  Professor Platz will establish a collaboration between the   Department of Chemistry and Franklin County High School chemistry   teachers and students.  In Phase I of the project, Dr. Platz will teach   introductory organic chemistry at Centennial High School in Columbus,   Ohio.  The course will be taken for college credit by the students and   will be team taught with the local chemistry faculty member who will   teach the course in later years.  In Phase II, high school teachers will   spend sabbatical visits to the the Department of Chemistry at Ohio State   to allow them to team teach introductory chemistry classes with the   faculty and staff  at Ohio State.",
