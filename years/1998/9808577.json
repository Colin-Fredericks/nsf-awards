 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT        Miami University and the Willard Sherman Turrell Herbarium will    purchase new herbarium  cases and 2) employ graduate teaching fellow equivalents to process and  curate (including barcoding) approximately 105,000 specimens  acquired  as gifts, bequests, orphan collections and backlog during 1994. The  project will upgrade the herbmum faclity by the acquisition of seventy  herbmum cases, forty five of which represent replacements for cases  that have exceeded their useful life and are in such poor condition as  to jeopardize the collections housed in those cases. Twenty-five new  cases will complete the current herbarium facility and to allow for the  processing and intercalation of approximately 105,000 specimens.  Acquiring new herbarium cases will also allow for the total  reorganization of the Herbarium so that it is a more user friendly  facility for both teaching and research by faculty and students at  Miami University as well as a significant visitor and borrower  population. It is anticipated that the completion of intercalation and  reorganization of the collection will better serve the environmental  and conservation community that depends of the collection and  associated data in the development of various management strategies  both within    and outside the state of Ohio.               Once the specimens have been processed and intercalmed into the  Herbarium it will be ranked as the largest herbarium facility in the  state of Ohio. The collection will be especially valuable because it  will represent one of the major non-vascular plant holdings in any  university in the mid-western United States with approximately 180,000  algal, bryological and mycological specimens and approximately another  260,000 vascular plant specimens. The herbarium's mycological  collection will be among the ten largest in a university setting in the  United States. This project is a necessary prelude to computerization  of the collection in the near future.",
