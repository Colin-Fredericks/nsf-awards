 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729610  Keller          Cells use intracellular messengers to coordinate their responses to environmental cues.  Certain environmental stimuli cause the unicellular biflagellate green alga Chlamydomonas to rapidly activate a set of coordinated responses that include excision of its flagella, transient upregulation of a set of around 200 genes encoding flagellar protein subunits, and initiation of the outgrowth of a new pair of flagella.  Although independent, each of these responses depends on the second messenger Ca.  In this research a genetic approach will be used to identify components of the signaling pathway leading to flagellar shedding.  Mutants that fail to shed their flagella in response to stimulation will be isolated.  These mutants will then be characterized by genetic, molecular and cell biological approaches to determine the number and order of steps in the signaling pathway leading to flagellar shedding.  The proposed experiments will yield insight into cellular signaling in the Chlamydomonas flagellar regeneration system, and serve as a model for several fundamental processes in biology including the integration of signal transduction pathways, the coordinate induction of a large set of genes and the de novo assembly of complex cell organelles.      The green algae Chlamydomonas responds to some environmental stimuli by shedding its flagella, expressing genes for flagellar proteins, and growing a new pair of flagella.  The research here will use a genetic approach to identify components of the signaling path that leads to flagellar shedding.  This system serves as a model for many fundamental cellular processes including cellular integration of signal transduction pathways, coordinate induction of genes and the formation of complex cell organelles.    ***",
