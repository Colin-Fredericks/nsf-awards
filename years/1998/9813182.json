 "awd_abstract_narration": "9813182  Kelkar  The main objective of this research project is to develop a  unified framework for the stabilization and control of  underactuated linear and nonlinear nonholonomic systems.  In  particular, it is aimed to develop a methodology for the  control of nonlinear underactuated nonholonomic systems  which will include open-loop unstable and/or non-minimum  phase systems.  As a special case, the methodology will be  applicable to linear systems as well.  Similarly, the  methodology will also be applicable to holonomic systems.  The proposed research will yield a methodology to obtain a  class of controllers (and not a specific controller) for  stabilization and control of underactuated nonlinear  systems.  The proposed method has great potential in the  design of robust controllers and fault-tolerant controllers  for difficult-to-control nonlinear systems, leading to the  development of a software tool (toolbox) which can generate  controllers for a given underactuated system.  The  methodology is based on the construction of a class of  auxiliary stable systems each of which will be equivalent to  the original system with a proper choice of controller.  The  simulation results for an underactuated 2-d.o.f. inverted  pendulum-cart system are included and compared with the  existing recent results as a validation of the theory. The  methodology will advance the state-of-the-art in the area of  control of nonlinear systems as well as nonlinear  controllers.  The results of this research will enhance  ability to control a large class of real life systems, for  example, aircraft and spacecraft in actuator failure mode,  underwater vehicles, and biped locomotion.  To demonstrate  the viability of this methodology, a series of control  experiments will be developed.  Each apparatus will  represent a class of underactuated nonlinear mechanical  systems with two or higher degrees-of-freedom.  ***",
