 "awd_abstract_narration": "In nonlinear evolutionary problems of physics, one is typically concerned \r\nwith the analysis of observable dynamical behavior, which impacts large \r\nclasses of initial states. Dynamical systems theory offers a powerful \r\ngeometric tool, invariant manifolds, to tackle such problems. Invariant \r\nmanifolds are capable of acting as organizing structures in the phase space \r\nof a system, as well as creating complex or chaotic behavior for sizable \r\nsets of initial conditions. Examples of these phenomena include chaotic \r\nmixing, fast energy transfer, and diffusion in finite dimensional  systems, \r\nand jumping behavior and pulse generation in evolution equations. This \r\nproposal suggests novel extensions and new applications of invariant \r\nmanifold theory in an array of areas, ranging from difficult open questions \r\nof applied analysis to concrete problems in laser optics,  oceanography, \r\nand atmospheric science.\r\n\r\nMost phenomena in nature are dynamic in nature, i.e., one observes them \r\nchange in time. Such phenomena include ocean currents, atmospheric \r\nevents, and the motion of planets. The mathematical discipline that deals \r\nwith the description of these time-varying phenomena is called dynamical \r\nsystems theory. The main concern of this theory is to understand the \r\nevolution of the studied phenomenon in terms of mathematical formulas \r\nand predict its future for long times. This theory has already showed its \r\npower in several applications, but has not been mature enough to deal with \r\nlarge-scale physical processes. This proposal suggests the development of \r\nseveral new tools in order to make dynamical systems theory applicable to \r\nhighly important problems of laser optics, oceanography and atmospheric \r\nscience. For example, one of the suggested directions of research is aimed \r\nat the analysis and prediction of the motion of large eddies in the ocean. \r\nAnother aspect of the proposed work will provide scientifically solid \r\nestimates for the rate of ozone depletion near the Antarctic polar vortex.\r\n",
