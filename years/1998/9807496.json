 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   program supports research on hydrocarbon oxidation by organometallic   compounds by Dr. John E. Bercaw of the Chemistry Department, California   Institute of Technology.  Aqueous platinum halides, originally reported   by Shilov, will be studied.  The specific goals of the work are to   explore the mechanism of the C-H bond activation step in the Shilov   mechanism, prepare more active and robust compounds related to model   complexes that have been shown to effect C-H bond activation, prepare   some derivatives containing redox active groups, examine the reactions of   dioxygen with related Pt(II) compounds and seek ways to couple these   dioxygen reactions to the Shilov mechanism.  Understanding the   mechanistic steps resulting in hydroxylation of simple hydrocarbons will   help define the limitations of the Shilov system as well as provide   insight into how to achieve catalytic hydroxylation of hydrocarbons using   dioxygen as the oxidant.  Transition metal compounds are used extensively as catalysts in the   chemical industry.  This project focuses on the development of catalysts   for rapid and selective reaction of C-H bonds to form primary alcohols or   other partially oxidized products.   Such reactions could facilitate   using alkane feedstocks directly in subsequent chemical production.",
