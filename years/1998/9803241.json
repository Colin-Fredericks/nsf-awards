The first deals\r\nwith imbedding invariants based on integrals on configuration spaces\r\nof points which were introduced by Witten, Axelrod-Singer and\r\nKontsevich.  A particular aim is to understand the Casson invariant as\r\na configuration space integral, and to understand how these integrals\r\nbehave under surgery.  The second topic aims to extend the\r\nDuistermaat-Heckmann theorem to variationally complete orbits of\r\nsymmetric pairs.  Professor Mazur's research centers on four projects.\r\nThe first studies the p-adic interpolation of modular eigenforms and\r\ntheir L-functions.  The second studies the question of the\r\nrepresentability of elements in the Shararevich-Tate group of elliptic\r\ncurves.  The third studies the Euler systems of Kolyvagin in a general\r\nmotivic context.  The fourth project will study certain \"circle\r\nmethod-type questions\" related to the ABC conjecture. Professor Taubes\r\nwork centers on two topics.  The first deals with the theory of\r\npseudo-holomorphic curves for the singular symplectic forms on\r\n4-manifolds which arise as self-dual harmonic 2-forms.  The regularity\r\nof these curves will be analyzed, their use in defining obstructions\r\nto symplectic form existence will be considered.  The second project\r\nstudies the compactness question for various generalizations of the\r\nSeiberg-Witten equations.  The goal here is to determine whether these\r\ngeneralizations can be used to obtain manifold invariants.\r\n\r\nMore colloquially, Professor Bott will study, first, a series of new\r\ninvariants which deal with the different ways in which a loop or\r\nsurface can be fitted into a higher dimensional space.  These sorts of\r\nquestions have arisen recently from physics in some novel quantum\r\nfield theories.  The second part of Professor Bott's project studies\r\nthe ways in which the symmetries of a space constrain its global\r\nstructure.  Professor Mazur will be studying, first, the ABC\r\nconjecture.  This is a finiteness assertion that may govern the number\r\nof solutions to a broad collection of equations.  (For example, the\r\nequations which occur in Fermat's last theorem.)  Second, Professor\r\nMazur plans to study the Fourier coefficients of modular forms.  This\r\nis an area with results of use to quite a number of other branches of\r\nmathematics (group theory, complex function theory, and, surprisingly,\r\ntheoretical physics.)  Professor Taubes plans to study the behavior of\r\nfour dimensional spaces and to develop techniques to distinguish such\r\nspaces from each other.  For example, with time included, our universe\r\nis 4-dimensional and its large scale topological structure is not\r\nknown.  In this context, Professor Taubes' research concerns the\r\nclassification of those structures which are possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
