Five of the students are from other than the home institution and significant effort is directed at recruiting women and minority students.  Areas of research in which the students will be involved include parallel algorithms, system development environments, human-machine interfaces, algorithm animation, and programming languages.  The student will perform independent research, give oral presentations on their work, prepare scientific papers, and present their work at seminars at their home institutions and national and regional meetings.",
