 "awd_abstract_narration": "NISHIKAWA  9809942        As functional morphologists and neurobiologists, the PIs wish to  predict how patterns of muscle activation should change, not only when an  individual performs different tasks but also during its lifetime as it  grows, and as body proportions change during evolution. These tasks are  currently beyond the PIs reach because patterns of muscle activation are  affected by a large number of factors, including the contractile properties  of the muscles, their mechanical advantage, the masses and lengths of the  segments, and the force, velocity and duration of movement. Unraveling the  complexity of muscle activation is an important basic problem of organismal  biology. The goal of the proposed research is to develop prey capture in  frogs as a model system for investigating this problem. In this proposal,  the PIs seek funds to develop biornechanical models that will predict how  body size and morphological evolution affect patterns of muscle activation;  and for empirical studies that will be used to modify the models and test  their predictions. These studies will contribute significantly to the  development of a theoretical framework in which the effects of body size  and morphological evolution on patterns of muscle activation can be  predicted and ultimately tested.",
