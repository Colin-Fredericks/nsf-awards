 "awd_abstract_narration": "Variational problems arise as a natural consequence of modeling  the physical world.  Stretching an elastic membrane or bending a  piece of metal can be mathematically described as a minimization  problem.  Perhaps the simplest example of this idea is the  \"spline.\"  Originally, a spline was a drafting tool consisting of  a long, thin piece of wood that could be clamped to drafting  table at certain fixed points.  Since the deformed wood naturally  assumed a minimum energy state, tracing its length produced a  smooth curve.    In the 1950's, mathematicians redefined a spline as the  mathematical solution to the following problem: Find a smooth  function F(t) such that the \"bending energy\" of F(t) is minimized  subject to the constraint that F(t) interpolates user-specified  values at the integers (the spline's knots).   The space of  functions that minimizes this problem is the natural cubic  splines.    In the 1970's, Lane and Riesenfeld discovered that cubic splines  can also be expressed as the limit of a sequence of functions,  each related by a simple averaging rule. This averaging process,  known as subdivision, is an increasingly popular modeling  technique in geometric design.  In recent work, the PI has shown  that the solution process to a wide range of variational problems  can be expressed concisely as a subdivision scheme.  This project  investigates application of this approach to three important  topics:    - Subdivision rules for thin-plate splines  - Fast numerical solution of variational problems  - Creation of splines with local knot insertion rules",
