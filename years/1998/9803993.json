 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software for safety-critical control systems must be highly  reliable since failures can have catastrophic consequences.  A  novel approach is proposed for assuring ultrahigh reliability  requirements for these systems using multiple program versions  that satisfy different functionalities. One version implements  the safety-critical functions of the system while other versions  provide more optimal and refined control.  Each program is a  general relation that computes all possible outputs for an input.  The system output is obtained from the intersection of all the  output sets with a guarantee that the safety-critical version  will never be violated. This approach allows the  reliability of the system to be assessed cost-effectively.  It  also facilitates the use of advanced adaptive and learning  control algorithms for the non-safety-critical versions.  The project includes analysis of the properties of the  architecture, syntax and semantics of relational programs,  efficient relational composition methods, cost-effective  reliability assessment methods, supporting tools for writing,  executing, and dynamically composing relational programs, and  evaluation of the diverse-capability architecture using several  problems.  The successful completion of this research will result  in a scientifically rigorous and practical approach for achieving  certifiable high assurance for safety-critical  systems.",
