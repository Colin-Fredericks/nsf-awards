 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance work on ethical issues raised by technological distortions in political television ads. This project is important to the understanding of how video and computer technology raise ethical concerns in our political system.  Audiovisual manipulations are powerful social phenomena that influence perceptions and information.  This research provides data that can help to understand the implications of accelerating developments in communication technology that can affect political life.  The underpinnings of democracy may be threatened, if information provided by the most pervasive electoral communication format is distorted and misleading. Earlier phases of the research have documented, through content analysis, that a substantial and growing percentage of ads, particularly negative ads, contain distortions created by video and computer technology. These may include editing, computer and digital alterations, special effects, sound effects, dramatizations, and other visual manipulations. Such distortions can mislead voters and interfere with the rational decision making process in the selection of candidates. Preliminary research, under the previous NSF support, has provided evidence that these distortions may affect voters' responses to candidates and their opponents.  This project will extend the testing of spot distortions with the following objectives: (1) to test experimentally the effects of technological distortions in political spots on voters; (2) to determine in the experimental testing if any identified effects are dependent upon the valence of the spots (positive, negative); and (3) to determine in the experimental testing what receiver/voter characteristics (such as gender and visual literacy level) may be related to the effects of technological distortions in political spots. The project will employ experimental testing of distorted versus non-distorted spots.  In addition to traditional measurement techniques, the study will use computer automated dials to assess viewer responses. To enhance dissemination of information about ethical concerns in technological distortion in political spots, the investigator will produce and distribute project results to academic, public and media audiences.",
