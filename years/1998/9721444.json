A fundamental digital electronic device involves two  states of the system.  In a quantum system there is also the  additional information of the phase difference of the wave  functions for the two states.  This additional quantum property  is called the coherence.  The importance of a coherent quantum  device lies not just in the addition of one more piece of  information, but in the propagation of the properties in a chain  of such devices.  For example, if each unit device is a logic  gate, then the chain forms a quantum computer.  Coherence  dynamics is much studied in quantum optics.  A logic gate using a  trapped ion or an atom passing through an optical cavity has been  demonstrated to work, but a long chain of such devices is  impractical.    A semiconductor heterostructure seems to be a more practical  medium for a coherent quantum device.  A theory of the physical  processes which occur in the operation of a coherent  semiconductor device constitutes the first research area.  The  issues germane to a quantum device are (1) addressing, (2)  interaction, and (3) the various times in the process: onset,  recovery, decoherence.  The problem with applying the optically  excited coherence to semiconductors is that the coherence lasts  no more than a few picoseconds, and only at low temperatures.  Neither condition enhances the prospects for a device.  Ways of  transferring the coherence to spin states with much longer  decoherence time will be studied.  Kikkawa et al. have found that  doping of a quantum well and strong optical excitation make the  optically excited spin memory several nanoseconds long, which  persists even at room temperature.  One possible explanation to  be investigated is the polarization of the electron sea (from  doping) by the optically excited electrons with a common spin  direction.  The Coulomb interaction effect create s a collective  spin which is then not easy to perturb.  The next step is to  explore what interaction mechanism can be utilized for quantum  coherence control.    An electron optically excited leaves behind a hole.  It has been  suggested that such electron-hole coherence may exist in nature  without laser excitation and that the collective action of many  pairs may form a strongly correlated semiconductor.  The second  research area is to explore properties of such semiconductors and  to look for likely materials.  Of various classes of such  correlated semiconductors, the most interesting possibility is  electronic ferroelectrics.  Large dielectric constants in a few  samarium compunds are an encouaging sign.  The electronic  ferroelectrics would be more versatile than the conventional  ferroelectrics for device purposes and the understanding of their  strong electron correlation would be a piece of important basic  physics.  The third topic, related to the first one, is the  theory of electrons carrying spins from a ferromagnet to a  semiconductor.  This is of relevance to the development of spin-  dependent electronic devices, which would integrate magnetic  devices with electronics.  %%%  This is a broad theoretical project to study the properties of  semiconductor devices as components of quantum computers and  other quantum devices.  The properties necessary for new and  novel states in matter will be explored and relevant materials  identified.  In particular, novel semiconductors will be  investigated.  ***",
