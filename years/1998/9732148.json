In addition,  it will attract large numbers of highly qualified graduate  students to the University of Kentucky.  The program will  provide an interactive environment for faculty and graduate  students to expose undergraduate students to the many facets  of a graduate career.  It will inform undergraduate students  about career opportunities available in the field of  neuroscience over the wide spectrum of industry, academia,  medicine, and public service.  Students will be given an  intensive short course on neuroscience, covering basic  anatomical, physiological, developmental, and behavioral  aspects.  Later in the summer, a mini-symposium on a  selected research area will bring leading national  researchers to UK for seminars and informal discussions with  students.  Students will be immersed in a research project  of their own choosing, working in the lab of a faculty  member who acts as mentor. The goal is production of  publishable data, and to this end all students will present  the results of their research in a setting resembling a  regional or national professional meeting.  This program  should give students an appreciation for the nature of  biomedical research and the various opportunities for  careers in this field.",
