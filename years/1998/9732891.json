 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT ABSTRACT DMS-9732891, PI: Helton    This is a proposal to continue support for several projects in the parts of   operator theory and functional analysis related to engineering system   theory. Linear operator theory has had a strong interplay  with analytic function theory and engineering for many decades.  Indeed most commercial software (at least in the control engineering community)   for solving analytic function problems is based on this type of interplay between functions and matrices. One branch of analysis closely related to applications is classical Nevanlinna-Pick-Nehari theory,or equivalently  commutant lifting theory, a part of the area called operator model theory.  The early development of this  was done for the purest of mathematical reasons,   but in the mid 1970's  and early 1980's this was shown by this investigator and others to be critical to the design of engineering systems where   stability of the system is the key constraint. This motivated much  more mathematical development and now it is one of the areas   of functional analysis most closely associated with control   engineering. For many years (since Norbert Wiener) design tools   optimized mean square performance. The theory above ultimately lead to   (commercially commonplace) tools for optimizing worst case   frequency domain performance. The aim of this proposal is to extend this core theory in radically new directions: 1.Highly nonlinear generalizations.   The goal is to find canonical ''nonlinear generalizations\" of   analytic function theory and the related parts of operator theory.   Many systems which people wish to control are nonlinear (e.g., jet engines),   so there is a big demand for an effective nonlinear theory. 2.Linear Operators} Intersections of matrix intervals, and Hereditary operators and polynomials   are the subject of work with Jim Agler. 3. Optimization over spaces of analytic functions} (with Orlando Merino and others). Qualitative theory, computer  algorithms based on this theory, a nalysis of such algorithms. Connections of this work with other branches of mathematics. These are the key optimization problems which arise in designs of linear engineering systems where there are competing constraints, or uncertainty in the math model of the physical system one is trying to control. 4. Computer operator algebra.Linear engineering systems theory and operator theory are rife with calculations in a noncommuting algebra. For example, if the classical core above is set in engineering   `statespace coordinates', the main theorems can be derived mostly by matrix algebra. Helton's group are the main providers   of software (called NCAlgebra) for performing general noncommuting calculations in Mathematica. The work has gone thru several phases and in current research the investigators now have extensive software implementing noncommutative Groebner basis algorithms due to Mora in C++ and linked Mathematica software   for sorting and ''shrinking\" the output in various ways. It is used in the  highly ambitious pursuit of trying to find computer methods for helping a researcher ''discover\" (rather than just verify) theorems in branches of operator theory and engineering systems.",
