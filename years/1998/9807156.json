The focus is on the physics of soft biomaterials.  The systems studied will include lipid bilayer membranes,  DNA, and complexes of DNA with other materials.  The work is  basic research aimed at characterizing these key  achitectural and functional elements of living cells and  understanding the mechanisms governing their behavior.  The  interest of the work is not only to understand their  operation in vivo, but also to illuminate principles which  could help in the design of simple artifiical analogs,  ultimately for medical and even industrial applications.    This project will use the methods of theoretical physics to  study the interplay between membrane conformation, entropic  effects, adhesion of particles to membranes, and structures  of cytosol; the dynamics of stiff biopolymers such as DNA  and actin, the role of torsional stiffness in their  dynamics, and in particular the transport of torsional  stress down DNA in response to transcription; the  interactions of highly-charged polymers (polyelectrolytes),  such as DNA; and, the sharp switching between positionally  ordered and disordered tracts of chromatin fiber, and its  hypothesized role in gene regulation.    Particular emphasis will be placed on distinguishing the  effects of thermal fluctuations (entropy) from those of  frozen disorder (e.g. sequence information) in soft  biomaterials.  Sometimes these effects are similar, for  example in equilibrium DNA stretching, while in other cases  they can be wildly different.    Much of this research will continue ongoing direct  collaborations with experimentalists.  Many different  techniques will be needed, from standard continuum mechanics  methods (elasticity theory, fluid mechanics) to modern  statistical physics.  Numerical modeling will be called upon  as needed, with primary emphsis given to simple analytical  results.  %%%  This i s a theoretical grant funded jointly by the Divisions  of Materials Research, Physics and Molecular and Cellular  Biology.
