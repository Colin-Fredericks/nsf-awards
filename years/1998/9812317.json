This course opens a new avenue through which  neuroscience investigators and teachers can learn to make  productive use of this essential new technology. NEURON is a  widely-accepted simulation tool designed specifically for  biologically realistic neural models.  Since it runs on all  leading computational platforms (UNIX/Linux, MSWindows 3.1, 95,  98, and NT, and MacOS), virtually every laptop and desktop  microcomputer sold in the country is capable of performing  research-quality simulations. The 5-day \"hands-on\" summer short-  course will be offered on an annual basis for three years.  It  will be announced through electronic email lists and through web  pages at: www.neuron.yale.edu and www.npaci.edu.    The potential importance of NEURON to the neuroscience community  derives from the fact that the nervous systems of all animals,  including human beings, perform tasks such as perception,  learning, and adaptive control, through computations that involve  the complex interactions of electrical and chemical signals that  are distributed in space and time. Engineers and computer  scientists have long found simulation to be indispensable for  understanding the operation of nonbiological computers. However  the tools used for simulating computer hardware are poorly suited  to studying biological computers (brains), because the machinery  of manmade systems is fundamentally different in construction and  operation from the \"wetware\" of the nervous systems found in even  the simplest animals. To achieve useful levels of convenience and  efficiency, neural simulators must be designed to take the special  features of biological systems into account.  The NEURON course  will teach the use of such tools.",
