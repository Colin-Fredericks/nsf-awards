 "awd_abstract_narration": "9732579  Kastner    The   research  suggested  in  this  proposal  concerns  the  properties  of quantum dots and single electron transistors.  The  properties  of these quantum dots (\"artificial  atoms\")  are  sufficiently different from ordinary electronic devices  to  require fundamental studies  with the long range goal of  translating  these  novel  structures  into  technologically  mature systems.  This requires determining the energy levels  and  transition  probabilities for  these  artificial  atoms  whose  diameters  are  typically  1000  times  the  size  of  ordinary  atoms.   Transistors based on the artificial  atom  principle, the \"single electron transistors\" (SET), are  the  goal  of  the next generation of electronic devices.     The  research proposed here focuses on two topics, namely 1)  how  do  electrons in an artificial atom interact with  those  in  nearby metallic leads and 2) what is the nature of the phase  transitions  of  the  electron  droplets  in  high  magnetic  fields.   The coupling of topic 1) is believed  to  be  give  rise to behaviors closely related to the Kondo effect, which  results  from  the  coupling of  localized  electrons  on  a  magnetic  impurity to the Fermi liquid in a host metal.  The  second  topic  relates to the magnetic field  induced  phase  transition  from a singlet state to the ferromagnetic  state  in  droplets with many electrons.  The Kondo problem will be  investigated for SETs carrying various numbers of electrons.  The  phase  transitions will be studied   by  measuring  the  magnetic  susceptibilties for magnetic fields  greater  than  the critical field of ca. 1.7 tesla.  %%%  Research  suggested in this proposal deals with  fundamental  problems  of  the  behavior  of quantum  dots,  also  called  artificial  atoms.   Such systems have  great  potential  to  become  nano-scale electronic components, including  \"single  electron transistors\" (SETs), which will become the heart of  the  next  generation of practical electronic  devices.   The  properties  of quantum dots are so different from  those  of  ordinary atoms that the fundamental physics governing  their  behavior  is  not yet fully understood.  Such  understanding  will  facilitate a more efficient and controlled manufacture  of   SETs and their incorporation in practical technological  devices.    Two  problems  are  attacked  in  the   research  described in this proposal. Both of them deal with  electric  current flow into and out of the SETs via the leads made  of  ordinary metal.  ***",
