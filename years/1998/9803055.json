 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9803055  Pai    Stability of large scale systems with model reduction is going to be important in the emerging new structure of power systems.  Faster and reliable tools for computing dynamic available transfer capabilities (DATC) will be needed.  This proposal addresses three aspects which will impact this area.    Firstly, trajectory sensitivities which have yielded reliable results for dynamic security assessment (DSA) based on post-fault systems only, will now be extended to cover both faulted and post-fault dynamics.  This will imply formulating dynamic sensitivity functions for systems of differential algebraic equations with discontinuities in the algebraic portion.  This will enable the direct computation of sensitivities to critical clearing time as well to changes in load, tap settings, etc.    A second objective is to find better and robust preconditioners for solving large sparse systems of the type Ax = b by iterative methods.  This will then be used as part of the fast dynamic simulation algorithm using the simultaneous implicit method.    Finally two new approaches to model reduction will be taken.  First, we will use trajectory sensitivities of the nonlinear dynamic response to identify coherent generators.  To date only linearized models around an operating point have been used for coherency grouping or some other heuristic criteria.  Secondly, we will use the Krylov projector technique to develop reduced order dynamic models.  This is a recently developed tool in numerical linear algebra for DAE systems.",
