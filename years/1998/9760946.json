 "awd_abstract_narration": "***   9760946  Roychoudhry    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project is aimed at developing a low temperature methane catalytic combustor for applications in power generation, air purification and emissions control.  In Phase I of this Project, PCI will develop an adherent high specific surface area coating for the, short channel length, high cell density (SCL-HCD) metal monolith elements, incorporate the catalytically active phase (of palladium) on the resulting high specific area substrate, and test the viability and efficiency of these catalyst systems for low temperature catalytic oxidation of methane.    This technology has potentially important applications for ultra-low NOx power generation.  Because of the economic penalties associated with NOx production, catalytic combustion is being increasingly recognized as a clean and efficient alternative to exhaust after treatment.  Based on previous PCI work in catalytic combustion applications, an SCL-HCD metal monolith based catalytic combustor could be appropriate for power generation across the full size, range, from very small mobile source applications (30 kW range) up through machines generating two hundred MW of power.  ***",
