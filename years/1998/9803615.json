The primary focus is on the bundle theory and classifying spaces\r\nwithin each model.  In both of these models, a bundle-theoretic perspective\r\nleads to deep and unexpected new relations between topology and combinatorics:\r\nthe primary objective of this research is to expand on these relations.  The\r\nproject's goals include both combinatorial applications in topology (for\r\ninstance, combinatorial formulas for topological invariants) and topological\r\nresults in combinatorics (particularly on the topology of posets of oriented\r\nmatroids and polytopes).  The classifying spaces for Gelfand and MacPherson's\r\ntheory derive from certain partially ordered sets of oriented matroids, and\r\nhave close ties to the real Grassmannian.  Among the objectives of this\r\nresearch are a closer knowledge of the topology of the combinatorial\r\nGrassmannian and applications of this knowledge both to real vector bundles \r\nand to various combinatorial problems.  Mnev and Mani's theory also appears\r\nto give rise to a classifying space of interest in both topology and\r\ncombinatorics, relating PL manifolds and convex polytopes.  The author will\r\nalso study a new type of ``non-Euclidean'' pathology in oriented matroids and\r\nits implications for combinatorial differential manifolds.\r\n     Much of the power of these combinatorial models for topology derives\r\nfrom the elegance with which topological concepts translate into combinatorial \r\nanalogs.  One can, for instance, derive combinatorial formulas for topological\r\ninvariants by simply translating each element of a topological formula into\r\nits combinatorial equivalent. The translation from combinatorics to topology\r\nhas proven equally useful: these models have provided a new framework in which\r\nto view various combinatorial topics.  Both models have revealed a\r\nvector-bundle perspective on various combinatorial problems that originally\r\nappeared to have no connection to real vector bundles, leading to unexpected \r\ntopological proofs.  This project will build on recent results in this area\r\nwhose depth lies in uniting the combinatorial side of mathematics, rooted in\r\ncounting things, to the topological side, rooted in plasticity and spatial\r\ncontinuity.\r\n***\r\n",
