 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to improve science education at SUNY Potsdam by engaging students in hands-on field and community service projects utilizing seismic reflection equipment.  Since the seismic reflection method is the oldest and most effective method used by oil, environmental companies and geological surveys, we feel it is the best equipment suited for our growing needs. Reflection equipment will enable us to: 1) continue and enhance our current geological investigations, 2) expand the nature of our field and community service projects (as detailed in the Development Plan) and 3) better prepare our students for future employment in the environmental industry.    The geological problems facing our local communities can best be studied with reflection equipment and have the potential to serve as meaningful educational experiences for our students. Students will be exposed to real problems and at the same time will be learning the mathematical, physics and computer skills necessary to solve these problems. Students will conduct seismic reflection surreys, perform depth to bedrock measurements to install sewer lines, water lines and sewage systems, and depth to groundwater to locate water wells.    The impact of this project on science and non-science students will be immense. The equipment requested will also be shared with Clarkson University, St. Lawrence University and Canton Technical College.    Plans for evaluation include student and faculty comments and engineer and village evaluations of reports submitted by students. Dissemination of the results will include presentations at professional meetings and publications in professional journals.",
