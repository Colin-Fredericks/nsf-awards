The purpose of the meeting to exchange information about research results, and explore possible new questions and priorities in the areas of data communication.  The meeting, to be held in Washington, DC in late fall of 1998, will bring together about 125 PI's on research grants supported by the Advanced Networking Research and Special Projects Programs of the Advanced Networking Infrastructure and Research Division (ANIR).  The principal purpose of the meeting will be to improve communication among the networking research PI's, and much of the discussion will be sharing information about work in process.  A report on the meeting will be published, and CRA will establish a meeting web page to provide participants convenient access to slides and presentation notes.",
