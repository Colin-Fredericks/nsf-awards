 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jones  9734429  This is an award to support a project proposed in accord with the  Guidelines for Submission of Proposals to the Faculty Early  Career Development (CAREER) Program, NSF 97-87.  The Principal  Investigator's research objective is to conduct work that will  investigate innovative procedures to make membranes as components  of processes for treatment of water and wastewater that are not  subject to fouling.  She plans on using an ion implanting  technique to impart a permanent charge to membrane surfaces.  The  electrostatic barrier produced by this technique may provide a  barrier that decreases the accumulation of solutes on the  membrane surface.  This is expected to assist in preventing  fouling of the membranes.    In accord with NSF 97-87, the Principal Investigator plans on  using the results of her research as a platform for teaching both  technical and nontechnical problem-solving skills to  undergraduate and secondary school students.  She expects to do  this by incorporating innovative teaching techniques into  classroom lectures, development of a web-based course in  environmental engineering and development of an effective  outreach program targeted to attract and retain minority students  in educational programs that lead to competence in environmental  engineering practice.  ***",
