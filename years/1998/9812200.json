 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tall Timbers Research Station (TTRS) was chartered in  1958 to conduct original research on the role of fire in  the ecology of forest environments in the Southeastern  Coastal Plain.  This project will enable TTRS to renovate  the 29-year old Stoddard Research Laboratory and expand  the existing 9,416 square foot facility with an  additional 8,103 square feet of floor space.    Tall Timbers Research Station consists of 1,800 ha in  northern Leon County Florida.  The station is located in  the midst of more than 150,000 ha of private hunting  plantations, most of which are available to station  scientists for research.  Additionally, Tall Timbers  holds a conservation and research easement on one of the  last remaining examples of late successional longleaf  pine (Pinus palustris) forest where the ground cover  vegetation has not been disturbed by agriculture.  While  the land resources available for research at TTRS are  outstanding, the Stoddard Research Laboratory, the main  research facility at TTRS, is outdated, overcrowded, and  no longer capable of supporting the research mission of  the institution.    A major objective of the Stoddard Lab renovation and  expansion project is to provide office and laboratory  space for visiting scientists.  Presently, no office or  laboratory space is allocated for visiting scientists at  Tall Timbers.  After this project is completed 1,397  square feet of office and laboratory space will be  available for exclusive use by visiting scientists and  students.  An additional 5,694 square feet of shared  space will also be available to visiting researchers.  The renovation and expansion will result in a net  gain of 4,841 square feet of office, laboratory and  storage space for visiting scientists who want to work  at Tall Timbers.  The renovation and expansion will also  provide needed space for a significant and expanding  research station library collection that serves not only  station and visiting scientists, but also provides a  computerized fire ecolo gy information service to fire  ecology researchers throughout the world.",
