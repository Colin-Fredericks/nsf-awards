 "awd_abstract_narration": "9730775  Moore    The   research   program  investigates   functionally-graded  coating  systems  that  incorporate an  amorphous  diffusion  barrier  layer.   Past research identified  a  functionally-  graded  molybdenum-silicon based coating system (MoSi2-SiC),  deposited  on the refractory metal substrate using  physical  vapor  deposition  as  a  promising  processing  route.    A  sufficiently thick, outer layer of MoSi2 can be subsequently  applied  to  the  functionally-graded  layer  using   plasma  spraying.    The   earlier  research  also  identified   the  potential  of  utilizing  MoSi2-SiC  composite  targets   as  compared  with  elemental targets  (e.g.  Mo,  Si,  and  C).  However,  a  suitable diffusion barrier  layer  between  the  MoSi2-SiC  functionally-graded coating  and  the  refractory  metal  substrate  must be identified in  order  to  minimize  diffusion of silicon and carbon into the refractory  (Mo  or  W)  substrate.   If this barrier is not used,  sub-silicides  and  carbides of the refractory metals are produced  at  the  coating-substrate interface, resulting in  deterioration  of  oxidation  resistance  and  mechanical  properties  of   the  coating system, as well as a reduction in the coating  life.  A  Mo-Si-N-C diffusion barrier has recently been  identified  that remains amorphous up to 1260C.  Thermal cycling of  the  MoSi2-SiC  functionally-graded coating  system  between  the  service   temperature  and  room  temperature  can   produce  stresses  in the coating system.  Therefore, finite  element  modeling will be used to predict the optimized compositional  gradient,  and  coating architecture, i.e. substrate-barrier  layer-functionally-graded layer-outer thick  kinetic  layer,  consistent  with  minimizing  the  stresses  generated,  and  maintaining oxidation resistance for prolonged times  up  to  1600C  in  air. ?  Industrial advisors are Mel  Jackson  (GE  Corp.  Research and Development) and William Allen  (UTRC  -  East  Hartford).   These  co mpanies have  interest  in  high  temperature  materials and coatings for  materials  used  in  turbine  engines.   Students spend time  in  the  industrial  laboratory  research facilities and present  their  research  activities  at  CSM  Center meetings.  It  is  an  excellent  opportunity  for  the  students  to  participate  in  superb  industrial materials laboratories in the United States.  The  MPS OMA Office is co-supporting this GOALI activity.  %%%  The  main  objective of this GOALI research  program  is  to  explore  oxidation-resistant coating systems for  refractory  metals   for  application  in  high  temperature,  oxidizing  environments.   The  coatings  are  designed  using   finite  element  modeling and deposited by physical vapor deposition  using novel MoSi2-SiC or MoSi2-Si3N4 composite targets.  The  research  program  is managed in the Advanced  Coatings  and  Surface   Engineering  Laboratory  (ACSEL),   an   industry-  university consortium, at Colorado School of Mines.  ***",
