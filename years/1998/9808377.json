Byers        Many studies conducted in the past decade have confirmed the  once-controversial prediction that female animals in nature  should choose their  mates carefully.  That females in many  animal species actively choose mates is now established  fact.  The larger questions that remain concern how and why  females choose.  \"How\" questions involve study of the  behavioral strategies and sensory systems that females use  in mate choice.  \"Why\" questions concern the value to  females in exercising choice. The goal of this one-year  project is to develop a genetic paternity analysis for  pronghorn, a large mammal native to the North American  plains and deserts.  This species is particularly useful in  the study of these \"how\" and \"why\" questions in female  choice behavior.  At the National Bison Range in  northwestern Montana, small tissue samples will be obtained  by hand capture of young animals or by remote biopsy darts  from adults.  These samples will be used to develop the  methodology for using DNA microsatellites as genetic markers  for this population.  The paternity analysis developed by  this work will allow study of these questions in future  years, and in particular study of whether females are able  to choose genetically superior mates.      This research addresses central issues relevant to choice  behavior in nature that is widely applicable to many  species.  In addition, this basic knowledge on the  reproductive biology of a large ungulate has conservation  applications.",
