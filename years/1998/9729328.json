 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729328  Sconiers    The Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications (COMAP) is establishing  four implementation centers - one National Center and three Curriculum Centers - to provide resources for implementing the elementary school instructional materials in mathematics developed with support from NSF (Everyday Mathematics, Investigations in Number, Data, and Space, and Math Trailblazers).  The four centers  will combine the experience of the developers of these instructional materials and focus their efforts on the issues that schools and teachers confront as they adopt and implement reform mathematics curricula.  The National Center will be housed at COMAP and will cooperate with  similar centers for secondary and middle school implementation at Ithaca College and the University of Missouri, respectively, with the center for K-12 implementation at the Education Development Center, and with the Curriculum Centers to assist schools and districts with issues related to the successful adoption and implementation of the three curricula.  Each of the three Curriculum Centers is associated with one of the instructional materials development projects at the elementary school level and will work with schools and districts on issues specific to the instructional materials associated with that Center.",
