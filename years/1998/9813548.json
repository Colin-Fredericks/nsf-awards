 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, in the SGER mode, funds an initial exploration and prototyping of personal devices, controlled by physiological signals, for the purpose of augmenting human function.  The objective is to provide children who have severe motor disabilities, a device that can navigate and manipulate the external environment under their control.  The impact of such a device will be to provide an exploratory agent that would allow the child to tele-interact, thereby unlocking his/her cognitive abilities, promoting curiosity and a sense of entitlement to explore, and allowing personal development to continue.  Three primary hypotheses will be addressed: (1) a remote \"personal robotic device\" under the control of a child with a severe disability can promote cognitive and motor development; (2) the interface can be optimized by using subtle physiological signals to control the device and multisensory feedback; and (3) the actions of the device, which is intimately connected to the user, can be used as a new technique to evaluate children whose capabilities have not yet been elucidated.",
