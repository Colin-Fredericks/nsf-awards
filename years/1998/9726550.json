The researchers  will undertake a high-resolution angle-resolved  photoemission study of high Tc superconductors.  They will  research an area of high temperature superconductivity as  well as fundamental questions related to dimensionality in  certain superconducting ladder compounds.  The main  objective of the research is to extend their current  experiments with new materials being developed in Japan, and  currently not available in the U.S.  The Japanese have state-  of-the-art equipment that will allow for investigation of  problems of current interest in condensed matter physics,  such as the connection between dimensionality and non-Fermi  liquid behavior, and the connection between spin gap  behavior and the presence of a pseudogap.  Detailed momentum  dependence and photon energy dependence of the photoemission  features will be investigated in the U.S. and extreme energy  resolution experiments will be carried out in Japan.     This project brings together the efforts of two  laboratories that have complementary expertise, research  capabilities and equipment.  The U. S. researchers have  ultra-high resolution capabilities but no frequency tuning,  while the Japanese have the highest resolution spectrometer  available, coupled with the highest intensity source  available. Young investigators, from both countries, will be  significantly involved in the research.  Through the  exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden  our base of basic knowledge and promote international  understanding and cooperation.  ***",
