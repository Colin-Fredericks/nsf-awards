Svetlana Pacheva and Emil Nissimov of the Institute of Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.  The researchers propose to focus on four main topics: 1) the relation of reduced KP integrable systems and the theory of affine Kac-Moody symmetry; 2) discrete-difference analogues of the classical integrable systems; 3) the relations of continuum and discrete integrable systems and quantum integrable models; and 4) some interesting physical application of their results.  The research topics are some of the most central in mathematical physics in the past twenty years and are still actively developing.  The work is significant for new instights into physically relevant field-theoretic models ranging from completely integrable systems in nonlinear soliton physics and planar statistical mechanics to string and membrane theories.  It will represent an advance in the development of consistent systematic methods for understanding links between continuous and discrete integrable models.     This project in physics research fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Bulgaria to combine complementary efforts and capabilties in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
