IFAC is comprised of various national member organizations around the world.  The American Automatic Control Council (AACC) is the U.S. representative to IFAC and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers is one of seven societies who are members of AACC.  DYCOPS-5 is organized by the Technical Chamber of Greece, Athens.    The theme of DYCOPS-5 is \"Technology Push vs. Technology Pull in the 21st Century\".  DYCOPS-5 aims to bring together researchers and developers of new methodologies (Technology Push side) with the users of these techniques (Technology Pull side).  This sort of interplay is important in the environment of global industrial competition.    DYCOPS-5 will focus on the examination of new methodologies and challenging applications in the following areas:   o Reacting process systems   o Separation process systems   o Batch process systems   o Complex and industrial systems   o Interaction of design and control",
