Human and animal  research suggests that during lactation, responses to stress are  diminished. Specifically, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical and  sympathetic-adrenal medullary responses to stressors are blunted under  lactation. Human work from our laboratory indicate that lactational  status affects sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) nervous system  measures during rest and in response to stress. Lactators showed a  relatively high baseline SNS activity compared with Non-Lactators;  however Non-Lactators showed more SNS responsivity to stressors. Weaning  may alter ANS function as well. Lactators had a high coactivation of the  SNS and PNS systems, with the latter predominating, while Weaning-  Lactators showed coinhibition of the SNS and PNS systems. In addition,  Weaning-Lactators showed relatively greater SNS responses to laboratory  stressors.       An investigation of these alterations in neuroendocrine regulation  during lactation require procedures that are not possible in human  mothers; therefore, it is necessary to develop an animal model to  investigate the effects of lactation and weaning on cardiac autonomic  function during baseline and in response to stressors. The hypotheses are  that compared with lactating animals, weaning animals will have greater  baseline heart rates and lower baseline heart period variability and will  react to stressors with greater heart rate increases and greater  decrements in heart rate variability.       First and foremost, the proposed experiments will determine whether  rats show ANS alterations as they do HPA changes in lactation and  weaning. Secondly, the experiments will determine whether rats show ANS  alterations similar to those found in human mothers, and therefore,  whether rats are a suitab le model for normal function in health humans.  Furthermore, procedural parameters must be investigated, e.g., at what  day postpartum and postweaning are there maximal lactational effects on  ANS. The proposed studies address these questions about feasibility and  inform subsequent, more comprehensive studies of mechanisms underlying  lactational effects on ANS function. If this rat model is suitable,  future experiments proposals to NSF will address the underlying  physiology of these effects using pharmacological blockade and surgical  techniques to determine SNS and PNS contributions, hormonal assay and  administration of agonists and antagonists to determine the role of  oxytocin and prolactin in mediating the ANS effects of lactation, and  bioenergetic issues.",
