Each conference is held the day before the Department of Education's 1998 Regional Conference on Improving America's Schools (IAS), but has a distinct agenda and program leader.  The conferences support the Action Strategy developed by the\r\nU.S.  Department of Education and the National Science Foundation as part of the President's initiative on improving mathematics education at the middle school level.\r\n",
