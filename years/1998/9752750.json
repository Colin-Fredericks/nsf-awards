 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement project brings 32 faculty members from other schools to Mount Holyoke College for a one week workshop and to a two-day follow-up meeting preceding the joint mathematics meetings 18 months later. The project is disseminating materials and methods from the courses Laboratory in Mathematical Experimentation, Algebra, Geometry and Number Theory, which were developed at Mount Holyoke with NSF support. Exploration of the course materials is introducing participants to the interactive, conversational mode of mathematics teaching that the courses require. Participants also explore the opportunities the courses afford for broadening the mathematics curriculum and attracting new students to majors and minors in mathematics through employing interdisciplinary courses as feeders, creating entry-level courses that go somewhere and adding a course following the introductory courses which points to additional mathematics courses.    The June workshop has five elements. First, participants model the learning experience of students in courses by actually carrying out computer experimentation. Second, by looking at student papers participants address issues of teaching and evaluating writing and also have a means of examining some of the ways students' thinking develops. Third, participants have an opportunity to talk with students who have taken these courses. Fourth, participants discuss their observations and experiences and compare them among themselves. Finally, the workshop ends with a presentation of participants' implementation plans at their home institutions.",
