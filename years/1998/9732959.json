 "awd_abstract_narration": "Error control coding has become an integral part of almost every  digital communication system . The objective of this proposal is  to investigate several important problems in coding and to  establish teaching plans to develop competent engineers and  scientists for the fast changing area of digital communications.    The proposed research includes three inter-related areas: (1)  soft-decision decoding of linear codes; (2) turbo decoding; and  (3) coded modulation for unequal error protection (UEP)  applications. The first research area is composed of two parts.  In the first part, a new unified analytical approach which lets  us tightly bound the error performance of many reliability-based  algorithms at practical SNR is to be investigated. Although  numerous such algorithms have been proposed for more than 30  years, no such bound exists yet. In the second part of (1),it is  proposed to devise efficient soft decision decoding schemes for  long powerful block codes with reduced decoding complexity. No  existing algorithm can decode such codes without a tremendous  computational effort. In area (2), it is proposed to reduce the  delay associated with turbo decoding. This long decoding delay  prevents the use of turbo-codes in real time communication  systems despite their astonishing error performance at very low  SNR values. Finally, it is proposed to devise coded modulation  schemes with UEP applications based on conventional signal  constellations. Very few such schemes have been proposed despite  the increasing demand of coding schemes able to adapt to  different channel conditions, such as satellite broadcasting for  HDTV.    The second part of this proposal concerns the teaching plans of  the PI.  Based on the principle that students are the primary  reason most electrical engineering programs exist in  universities, the PI's teaching main goal is to develop students  into engineers and scientists who will be able to make  significant contributions to the development of data  communicatio n systems. Also, the particular geographical and  cultural situations of the University of Hawaii with respect to  other US-mainland universities are considered.",
