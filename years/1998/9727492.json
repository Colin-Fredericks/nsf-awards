 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Bart Kahr, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of   Washington, is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry   Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the   Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate through a Grant   Opportunities for Academic Liaisons with Industry (GOALI) award for his   studies of the stabilization of biopharmaceuticals in single crystal   hosts.  Through exploration of the host/guest chemistry of single   crystals of known biopharmaceuticals and excipients and the single   crystal matrix isolation of biopolymers in hydrogen-bonded molecular   crystals, Professor Kahr and co-Principal Investigators Jean Chmielewski,   of Purdue University, and Jerry Lewis, of Eli Lilly, are developing   methods for the stabilization toward light, heat, and moisture of various   peptidic pharmaceuticals, including glucagon and human growth hormone.    The stability of the mixed crystals and the activity of the   biopharmaceuticals upon release from their crystal hosts will be explored   through a variety of physical and biological assays.  In part due to the emergence of recombinant DNA technologies, a number of   biopharmaceutical agents are appearing.  These drugs, often comprised of   polypeptides (proteins), generally display poorer stability toward   ambient conditions of light, temperature, and humidity than do typical   small-molecule drugs, and development of methods for their stabilization   beyond storage at low temperature, which is not always practically   feasible, are required.  Through a Grant Opportunities for Academic   Liaisons with Industry (GOALI) award, the Organic and Macromolecular   Chemistry Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the   Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate support Professor Bart   Kahr, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington, for   his studies of the inclusion of biopharmaceutical agents within single   crystal `hosts.`  Professor Kahr's studies are focused on the ability of   biopolymers, including human growth hormone, to crystallize within the   crystal lattice of various pharmaceutical `excipients` and on the effects   of this incorporation on the thermal, light, and moisture stability of   these biopolymers.",
