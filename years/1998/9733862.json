The project will study high  temperature  superconducting  materials such as yttrium  barium  copper  oxide  (YBCO),  and  its praseodymium- and terbium-doped  variants.  The  critical  temperature and ground state resistivity  of  YBCO  are  altered   significantly   by  exposure   to   optical   radiation  (photodoping), by application external of pressure, by changes in  the  oxygen  content  and  by  the  replacement  of  yttrium   by  praseodymium  or terbium. However, the relation of these  changes  in  electron  transport  to local local atomic  order  is  poorly  understood.  The  project  addresses this  issue  by  correlating  transport  properties  with changes in  the  local  structure  of  oriented  bulk materials, oriented films and single  crystals  as  determined by x-ray absorption spectroscopy. This should  provide  fundamental information about the superconducting state in  these  multinary  oxide  materials. The project will integrate  work  at  NJIT  laboratories with off-site research at national synchrotron  light  laboratories.  Graduate, undergraduate,  and  high  school  students will conduct the research. The educational component  of  the  project will expose undergraduates, high school students and  teachers  to  modern research techniques. The PI is developing  a  research and teaching program targeted at Newark area high school  students  and  NJIT undergraduates. It involves an  undergraduate  laboratory  with  advanced experimental methods  and  techniques,  which  link  basic science training with research  on  transition  metal oxides.  %%%  This  is  a CAREER award to an African-American scientist  at  an  urban  university  with  a  large  enrollment  of  students  from  underrepresented groups. The research will investigate the atomic  structure  in several high-temperature supercon ductor  materials.  Among other applications, these materials show promise to lead to  low-loss  power  transmission lines at  temperatures  approaching  room  temperature. The mechanism for superconductivity  in  these  materials is still not understood. To shed light on this problem,  the   project  attempts  to  determine  what  atomic   structural  characteristics  are  correlated with the  superconductivity  and  other  transport  properties  in these  materials.  The  research  program  integrates  work  at  NJIT  with  off-site  reserach  at  national   research  laboratories,  such  as  synchrotron   light  sources.
