 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the Hirsch Conjecture which claims  that the edge-diameter of a (d,n)-polytope -- a d-polytope with n  facets -- is at most n-d.  The edge-diameter of the polyhedral  feasible region of a Linear Program is of interest since it  provides a lower bound on the worst-case behavior of any edge-  following Linear Programming algorithm.  Considerable research  effort has been expended in the past on the Hirsch Conjecture and  its relatives due to their crucial role in the quest to  understand and improve the worst case behavior of the Simplex  method.  Despite four decades of research however, even a polynomial upper  bound on the edge-diameter of a (d,n)-polytope has remained  elusive, and the Hirsch Conjecture and its relatives remain among  the most important unresolved problems in  the theory of Linear Programming.  In contrast to earlier attacks on the conjecture, which analyze  the combinatorial structure of polytopes, this research attempts  to determine whether or not the space of all Hirsch polytopes  (polytopes for which Hirsch Conjecture is true) is a proper  subspace of the space of all polytopes.  The research will study  the geometric properties of the space of Hirsch polytopes in an  attempt to determine if the complementary subspace of  counterexamples is empty.",
