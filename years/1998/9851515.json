 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is integrating Materials Science into market-driven curriculum that is introductory in nature for undergraduate Manufacturing Technology and Electromechanical students, pre-service Technology Education teachers, and in-service Technology Education teachers in the State of Iowa.  The specific objectives of the project are to: 1. Upgrade the existing materials testing laboratory to reflect the current state of materials science in industry. 2. Integrate the fundamentals of Materials Science in lower-level courses for Technology Education (pre-service teachers), General Industry & Technology, Electromechanical Systems and Manufacturing Technology program majors. 3. Provide activity-based learning experiences in quantitative microstructural evaluation utilizing Image Analysis methodology, mass spectrometer and microhardness readings for chemical composition and mechanical properties testing of industrial materials in mid-level undergraduate courses. 4. Facilitate upper-level student research activities in materials testing and development. These objectives are being accomplished through the purchase of an Image Analysis System, a table-top optical emission spectrometer, retrofitting an existing universal testing machine, and purchasing a new microhardness tester.  As a result of this project, the faculty will be able to introduce Materials Science concepts earlier in the curriculum, offer improved laboratory experiences for pre-service technology teachers, develop industry-appropriate student research projects, and open new avenues for independent study projects requiring utilization of contemporary research techniques for mechanical and microstructural testing of industrial materials.",
