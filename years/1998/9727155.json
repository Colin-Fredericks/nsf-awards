 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this award is to support further development  the Antarctic Geologic Database (AGD), an on-line database  for geologic specimens collected in Antarctica by members of  the U.S. geologic community, and to provide for the rescue  of Antarctic geologic collections that are at risk of being  lost. This award, from the Office of Polar Programs of the  National Science Foundation, provides funds for a computer  system to act as the server for the database, for personnel  costs associated with improving, updating, and running the  database, and for rescue of at-risk collections.    A prototype of the AGD was designed as part of a Small Grant  for Exploratory Research. This initial version is now on-  line and available for use (http://polestar.mps.ohio  state.edu/AGDcgibin/Search_agd1.pm). It was tested by 15  geologists with varying specialties, and comments from the  Antarctic geologic community have now been solicited.  Continuing interaction with the community will ensure  development of a useful database.    The database allows a user to search for rock samples by  geographic area, geologic age, rock type, formation or unit,  fossil or mineral content, collection purpose, and by whom  and when the collection was made. It informs the user what  analyses have been carried out, where those results are  published, and also any possible unpublished results and  their location and availability. It can provide a great  variety of descriptive information, including anecdotal  field observations. Most importantly, the Database records  where the rocks are currently stored, and the name and  address of the collector or contact person.",
