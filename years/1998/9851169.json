 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of this project is to provide students at Cottey College, a two-year college for women, access to the type of research experience typically available to students at four-year institutions. Second-semester organic chemistry laboratory will focus on a research project, with the entire class acting as the research group, and the laboratory instructor acting as the research director. Students will be asked to contribute to the overall direction of a group project. It is intended that during the course of the semester, students will develop a greater understanding of the mechanism of research in the natural sciences, and that each student will come to a greater realization of her own level of interest in scientific research.  The laboratory program that will be implemented is designed to benefit chemistry students at Cottey College, as well as students at other junior colleges and small women's colleges. It is believed that this program could benefit any department that offers organic chemistry to a small (10 to 15) number of students, or a large department offering an independent section of organic chemistry laboratory for its chemistry majors. This program is not designed to address the needs of large, multi-section organic chemistry laboratories.",
