The device uses a different approach to the standard forward biased p-n junction light emission recombination processes, and this proposal seeks to explore the development of the device and in the process of this development, understand better the mechanisms of light emission.\r\n\r\nFor the development of this technology, planar p-n junction diodes and micron and submicron IC MOSFET arrays will be fabricated, and shallow implantations will be performed to define the optically active areas.  Electrical and optical evaluation will be performed to examine the resultant properties of the device and develop an understanding of the parameters critical to the light emission processes.  Auger and SIMS analysis will be employed to define the implant profiles and correlate with observed properties.\r\n\r\nImplantations will be performed by a standard broad area implanter and by a focused ion beam implanter (FIBI) at the University of Maryland Focused Ion Beam facility.  Processing of micron MOSFET devices, electrical (parameters, DLTS) and optical (luminescence spectroscopy and wafer imaging) evaluation will also be done at the University of Maryland.  Sumbicron processing, and Auger/SIMS analysis, will be done at the Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD, through the ongoing collaborative program, at no cost to this proposal.\r\n\r\nThe development of such light emitting device, will have a significant impact in developing viable fully CMOS compatible Si OEIC technology, with optical interconnects for on-chip guided and freespace optical processing and transmission.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
