 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is an initial exploration of developmental learning by machines. This is motivated by human cognitive development from infancy to adulthood.  It requires a fundamentally different way of addressing the issue of machine intelligence.  The basic goal of the proposed developmental learning algorithm is to enable a machine to develop its cognitive capability, after its \"birth,\" through direct interactions with its environment.  The developmental learning concept does not mean just from small to big and from simple to complex.  It requires the system to learn new tasks and, as a special case, new aspects of a complex task without a need for reprogramming.  The basic nature of developmental learning plays a central role in enabling a human being to incrementally scale up his or her level of intelligence from ground up.  In the proposed exploratory study, the major basic concepts for developmental learning will be crystallized and some preliminary experimental results will be produced for the focused task category of recognition through interactive training.",
