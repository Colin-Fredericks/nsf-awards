 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program, focuses on the study of fundamentals of reactive  collisions and soft-landing of polyatomic ions at surfaces.   Professor Cooks and his students at Purdue University will contrast  soft-landed ions at self-assembled monolayers with landing into  vacuum-compatible liquid films.  The functional groups available  for reaction with impinging polyatomic ions at both of these  surfaces will be varied to control the properties of the reaction  products produced by these collisions.  New multi-quadrupole  instrumentation will be built and used in conjunction with existing  multi-sector mass spectrometry instrumentation in pursuing this  work.  This project will provide a strong educational experience  for students in the areas of mass spectrometry and surface science.  The nature of chemical reactions that occur at surfaces involving  projected polyatomic ion reactants remains poorly understood.   Professor Cooks and his students at Purdue University will study  the chemical reactions occurring between these polyatomic ions and  a range of surfaces that exhibit diverse chemical properties.  The  long-term objective of this work is to develop new methods for the  characterization of chemical reactions that occur at surfaces and  to produce surfaces that have desired chemical features.  The  results of this work will have technological value in applications  that depend on having surfaces with controlled chemical and  physical properties.",
