 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731209  Fabien  This award supports ten US participants in the US-South Africa Workshop on Mechanical Engineering Design Education, which will be held in Johannesburg, South Africa, in July 1998.  The co-organizers are Professor Brian Fabien, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Washington, and Professor Andrew Dickson, Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.  The purpose of the workshop is to establish a long-term, mutually beneficial collaboration between university-level design engineering educators in both countries.  Participants will be drawn from academia and industry and will include senior educators as well as postdoctoral and/or junior investigators and graduate students.  Through a series of presentations and interactive sessions, the participants will discuss current practices in graduate level teaching of engineering design and state of the art use of multimedia in engineering education, including distance learning and real-time computer usage in the classroom.  This latter topic is especially important for South Africa, where distance learning forms a large part of higher education.  Special emphasis will be placed on undergraduate teaching methodologies and effectiveness measures, with the aim of presenting a variety of innovative current approaches to design education.  Site visits to academic institutions and local industry will take place during the workshop, and industry representatives will give their perspectives on hiring requirements for design engineering graduates.  The workshop is being supported jointly by the Division of Design, Manufacture, and Industrial Innovation (DMII), the Design of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC), and the Division of International Programs (INT).  ***",
