 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mock witness Paradigm asks mock witnesses - `witnesses` who have been given a verbal description of an offender but who have never seen him - to view a lineup or photospread and try to choose the suspect.  If the suspect is chosen more often than expected by chance, the lineup or photospread is said to be biased towards the suspect, and thus unfair.  Since 1973 the Mock Witness Paradigm has been used in various forms for two important purposes:  as the basis for evaluation of the difficulty of the fairness of lineups and photospreads in studies of eyewitness identification, and as the basis for post hoc assessments of fairness by the defense in a variety of legal cases.  The basic validity of the mock witness paradigm has been widely assumed but never specifically evaluated or demonstrated.  Studies in the laboratory demonstrate that when applied to sequential presentations, the outcomes of mock witness evaluation do not follow the pattern expected of eyewitnesses under similar conditions.  These results raise a series of questions including the following:  What are the important differences between mock witness and eyewitness identification decision making contexts and processes?  Do these differences lead the psychological processes in the two types of witnesses to diverge from each other - a failure of process parallelism?  Do differences in social contexts and judgment processes lead to contrasts in the rates and accuracy of choosing the offender?  And do they result in contrasting judgments of the fairness of lineups or photospreads?  These seem to be important questions.  To the extent processes and outcomes differ and lead to different outcomes the mock witness paradigm is called into question.  If it is invalidated we would be left with only very cumbersome ways to evaluate lineup/photospread fairness in research and in the legal process.  The methodology employed in this study is based on videotaped crime scenes, varying in the quality of the viewing conditions for the observer, and providing for the use of multiple `offenders`.  Pilot studies calibrate the quality of the viewing conditions in the videotaped crime and calibrate varying levels of photospread bias.  Photographs of the `offenders` and those to be used as foils come from the procedures and files of the El Paso Police Department.  Historically, data from eyewitnesses has focused on choosing, accuracy and other classifications of the witness's  lineup/photospread choice, while data taken from mock witnesses has been used in the aggregate to estimate the bias toward the defendant and the appropriateness of the foils employed in the lineup/photospread.  This investigation is in a position to examine both sets of dependent variables for eyewitnesses and mock witnesses, providing a common basis for examining outcome parallelism.  Witnesses who have viewed the videotaped crime provide a verbal description of the offender.  A mock witness will be yoked with each eyewitness and will be given the eyewitness's verbal description, thereby preserving the range of variation in both sets of witnesses and providing a stronger basis for comparison of outcomes.  This research will clarify the conditions which are appropriate for mock witness evaluation and thus combine solid basic research with high potential for application.",
