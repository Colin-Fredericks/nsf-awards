 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733956  Kruger    This is a CAREER Award project involving high pressure techniques  in two separate areas of research. An objective of the work is to  synthesize and study, novel and potentially technologically  relevant materials. The research employs pressure-induced  amorphization, the pressure-induced destruction of long range  crystalline order to produce an amorphous materials. X-ray  diffraction study of pressure-amorphized samples will yield the  pair correlation function, G(r). The pressure variation of this  function will be correlate structures of the pressure-amorphized  glasses with the starting crystals, as well as with  conventionally synthesized, melt  quenched glasses. Raman scattering will be used to study the  boson peak of these glasses which will result in a deeper  understanding of the glasses as well as the boson peak itself.  Numerous theoretical studies have predicted the stability of  various phases of carbon nitride, some theoretical studies  indicating that certain phases should have bulk moduli rivaling  that of diamond. There is significant interest, both theoretical,  and practical, in realizing such materials. The PI will apply  high pressures and high temperatures to carbon-nitrogen mixtures  in order to synthesize some of the theoretically predicted  superhard phases of carbon nitride. Study of the equation of  state of the materials will help determine which phases are most  likely to be superhard, and hence should be made in larger  quantities for more detailed study. The education component of  this project involves extensive undergraduate research activity,  lectures at local high-schools, and mentoring activity associated  with the local student Chapter of the American Physical Society.  %%%  This is a CAREER Award project involves high pressure (up to 100  million atmospheres) techniques to synthesize and study, novel  and potentially  technologically relevant materials. One  relatively recently observed technique employs compression alone  to turn a cry stal into a glass. In this way a variety of glasses  will be prepared. X-ray and optical scattering techniques will be  used to characterize the structural transition from the  crystalline to the glassy state. Relationships are sought between  the new glasses, the starting crystals, and traditional model  glasses. A second project involves the use of high pressures to  try to synthesis new, superhard materials. By analogy with the  graphite to diamond conversion, high pressures and temperatures  will be applied to graphite-nitrogen mixtures in an attempt to  synthesize some of the theoretically predicted superhard phases  of carbon nitride. The education component of this project  involves extensive undergraduate research activity, lectures at  local high-schools, and mentoring activity associated with the  local student Chapter of the American Physical Society.  ***",
