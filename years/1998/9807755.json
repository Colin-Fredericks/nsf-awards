 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pacala\r\n9807755\r\n     The primary goal of this project is to interpret\r\nanalytically the effects of spatial environmental heterogeneity\r\non the community dynamics and biodiversity of ecological systems.\r\nSimulation models and experimental studies have convincingly\r\ndemonstrated the importance of endogenous and exogenous spatial\r\nheterogeneity, such as variation in resource supply rate or\r\ntopography, to the coexistence and the maintenance of diversity\r\nin ecological communities.  However, both mathematicians and\r\necologists still lack analytic understanding of the mechanisms\r\noperating, particularly in fully spatial, stochastic\r\nenvironments.  The investigators extend existing analyses of the\r\neffects of heterogeneity by using a wide range of models (from\r\nmetapopulation models to interacting particle systems and point\r\nprocesses); they develop moment approximations, which express\r\nspatial population dynamics in terms of mean densities and\r\ncovariances, to simplify the analysis while preserving both\r\nexogenous and endogenous heterogeneity.  The study uses moment\r\napproximations, and more standard techniques, to analyze the\r\neffects of environmental heterogeneity, endogenous heterogeneity,\r\nand their interaction on population dynamics and competitive\r\noutcomes in ecological models of plant and marine intertidal\r\ncommunities.\r\n     Field ecologists have long known that small-scale\r\nvariability in environmental factors such as soils or temperature\r\ncan affect the structure and diversity of ecological communities\r\n--- which and how many species can live together in a region.\r\nEcological modellers, however, have often found simple\r\nexplanations for small-scale spatial patterns of biodiversity,\r\ncaused by interactions between plants or animals (such as\r\ncompetition or predation), that ignore environmental variability.\r\nComputer simulation models have recently gone a long way toward\r\nreconciling these two camps, but (1) simulations show that\r\npatterns occur, but do not always explain why; and (2) even\r\npowerful computers have limits (it could be foolhardy, for\r\nexample, to attempt to simulate every tree on a continent in\r\norder to predict the effects of global climate change).  This\r\nstudy develops simple mathematical models that combine spatial\r\nvariability caused by interactions between organisms with spatial\r\nvariability caused by the environment to explore how these two\r\nkinds of variability affect the structure and diversity of\r\ncommunities.  The results from these simple models will eventually\r\nshow how to build more complex and realistic models that can\r\npredict patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem productivity, and\r\nwill provide a much more general understanding of how variability\r\nin the environment leads to diversity in ecological communities.\r\n\r\n",
