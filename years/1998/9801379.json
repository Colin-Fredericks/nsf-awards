The goals of the SSWG are to ensure that the highest quality scientific research is carried out from SCICEX platforms, that these platforms are optimally utilized, and that both research planning and synthesis of results are coordinated with the national and international Arctic Ocean science community.  To attain these goals, the SSWG is organized to 1) provide a forum for discussion of research that can utilize SCICEX platforms, 2) represent and coordinate SCICEX-based research from other programs, 3) help develop appropriate technologies, databases and sampling procedures, 4) provide guidance for development and integration of both cruise-specific and overall science plans, 5) ensure that SCICEX programs are operationally and logistically integrated, and 6) provide guidance toward data integrity, archiving, and exchange.",
