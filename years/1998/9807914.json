Activation  of  these neurons in the central nervous  system,  in  turn,  results in a sequence of behaviors in the same individual, including egg  laying, mating as a female during egg laying, and mating as a male after  egg  laying. This process in which a sign stimulus (possibly a  chemical  stimulus in the egg mass) leads to a sequence of behaviors has parallels  to   genetically   determined,  instinctive  behavior  associated   with  reproduction  in  other animals. This preparation  is  advantageous  for  detailed investigation since activity of the peptidergic neurons can  be  monitored in both reduced experimental preparations and intact  animals,  and  their  effects on neuronal circuits and relationships to behavioral  control  can  be  investigated at the cellular and molecular  levels  in  considerable   detail.   One  goal  is  to  describe   in   detail   how  neurotransmitters released from the peptidergic neurons affect  neuronal  circuits controlling locomotion and feeding during the behaviors. As  in  other  animals,  there appears to be an internal drive for  reproductive  behavior,  in  which the threshold for induction of egg  laying  by  the  releasing stimulus in the egg mass changes according to the reproductive  cycle.  An  idea  we  wish  to test further is  that  the  physiological  properties  of  the  peptidergic neurons  and  cells  that  excite  them  constitute  the  neural mechanism for the internal drive.  The  research  should  result  in  a  clearer understanding  of  the  contributions  of  peptidergic  neural systems to neural regulation of complex, genetically  determined behaviors. The principles of organization and control by this  neural  system  may  be useful for understanding fundamental   mechanisms  that underlie complex behavior in higher forms.",
