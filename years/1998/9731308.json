 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of voters and elections has shed considerable light on people's vote choices and election outcomes.  Scholars have learned a lot about the distribution of preferences at particular points in time.  They also can often account for one election outcome being different from another.  Yet, little is known about the evolution of electoral sentiment over times, about how individuals' vote choices and election outcomes come into focus.  The current study is addressed at redressing this imbalance, focusing on a set of empirical questions:  at what point during the electoral cycle do voter choices harden, so that we can forecast from polls what the next election will bring?  Also, at what point can one read the election outcome from `fundamental` information?  What role does the election campaign actually play?  The researchers undertake a range of analyses, focusing on four different sets of data:  1) time series of presidential trial heats;  2) time series of generic congressional poll answers;  3)  state polls for presidential, gubernatorial, and U.S. Senatorial elections; and, 4) survey data.    The data set to be constructed will be of value to other scholars interested in the topic, and, this project promises to enhance our understanding of the question.",
