One objective of this project is to determine the structures and forces that govern the association of proteins to charged membrane interfaces.  Protein domains known as PH and C2 domains are frequently found in molecules involved in cell-signaling and are believed to facilitate the attachment of these proteins to the membrane-solution interface.  Although high-resolution solution and crystal structures for these domains are known, information on how these domains are positioned on the membrane and interact with the interface has not been obtained.  The goal of this research is to determine the orientation and position of PH domains and C2 domains on the membrane interface by the use of site-directed spin-labeling and EPR spectroscopy.  This methodology will also be used to investigate forces controlling the membrane association of simpler structures that include the charged domain of MARCKS (the myristoylated alanine rich C kinase substrate).  Finally, proteins such as MARCKS and other highly charged peptides induce the lateral phase separation of negatively charged lipids including the phospholipase C substrate PIP2 in fluid phase membranes.  This process controls the timing of second messenger production in cells and is believed to provide a positive feedback mechanism for some signaling systems.  A final objective of the work will be to investigate the forces and protein structural requirements necessary for the formation of these domains, which appear to be driven by electrostatic forces.  These measurements will make use of wide line 2H NMR spectroscopy.    Many proteins that function to control the metabolism and growth of cells are inactive in the cytoplasm of the cell, but become active when they are attached to the internal surface of the cell membrane.  These proteins often become attached to membr anes as a result of electrostatic interactions between positively charged regions of proteins and negatively charged membranes.  In some cases, the membrane association of these proteins, and hence their activity, is regulated by the enzymatic phosphorylation of sites within these positive domains.  Biological systems utilize this electrostatic \"switch\" to control the membrane attachment of these proteins and to regulate cell growth and metabolism.  The objective of this project is to investigate the forces and molecular interactions that attach these proteins to membrane interfaces.  Although the membrane attachment of basic protein domains is a general phenomenon, there is relatively little information on the structures of the protein domains and the magnitudes of the electrostatic forces that control membrane attachment.  ***",
