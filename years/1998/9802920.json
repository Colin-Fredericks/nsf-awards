 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the study of nonlinear waves and their \r\napplications in nonlinear optical systems.  Using a combination \r\nof modern perturbation methods, rigorous analysis, and scientific \r\ncomputation, a wide variety of optical models will be explored \r\nand developed.  In conjunction with significant modeling \r\nefforts, the mathematical objectives will be to further develop and \r\nextend the methods utilized for quantifying and understanding the wave \r\ndynamics of nonlinear, dispersive partial differential equations\r\nwhich arise in the study of optical soliton transmission, modelocked \r\nfiber lasers, and optical fiber network devices and applications.  \r\nIn particular, a variety of analytic methods will be pursued with the goal\r\nof reducing the governing equations in Hamiltonian and integrable systems \r\nto more readily handled systems of partial differential equation that still \r\nretain the fundamental characteristics of the full governing equations.  \r\nThe resulting dynamics will be completely classified with particular attention \r\ngiven to parameter regimes for which periodic or chaotic dynamics may \r\narise in the system.  Comparison between the reduced models, numerical \r\nsimulations of the governing equations, and experiments will be performed \r\nwhenever possible.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to identify, classify, and model physical systems \r\nof current interest in the optics community.  Particular interest will be given \r\nto applications of greatest interest to industrial partners at Bell \r\nLaboratories (Lucent Technologies), Tyco Submarine Systems International, \r\nthe 3M corporation, Hughes Research Labs, and Honeywell Inc.  With the \r\nincreased importance of optical fiber technology, fiber optic \r\napplications have broadened from mere high data-rate communications \r\n(soliton transmission) to inexpensive optical fiber laser sources, \r\nlocal area network design and applications, and all-optical network \r\ndevices and components.  The proposal covers all areas of current research \r\nefforts in these areas.  In particular, the close working relations \r\nwith industrial partners ensures timely research in the most important \r\nareas of application.  And with the readily available experimental \r\nstudies provided by these industrial partners, accurate mathematical models \r\ncan be constructed and developed to capture the fundamental aspects\r\nof each optical system:  thus providing the potential for the mathematical \r\nmodels to have a significant impact on design and implementation of \r\nrealistic and physically realizable systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
