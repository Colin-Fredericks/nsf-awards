 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports T. Darrah Thomas of   Oregon State University in his continuing studies on inner-shell   photoelectron spectroscopy of small molecules.  He will focus on   high-resolution spectroscopy of carbon 1s electrons, using the   high-resolution electron spectrometer at the Advanced Light Source (ALS)   at Lawrence Berkeley Lab.  The ultimate goals are to develop a better   understanding of the relationship between ionization energies and   reactivity and other chemical properties, to develop procedures for   assigning group electronegativities, to better understand the factors   that contribute to electronegativity and to test current theories for   predicting and understanding ionization energies.   These topics are at the forefront of current research in electron   spectroscopy and have recently become extremely topical because of the   availability of third-generation synchrotron radiation sources.  While   there have been many molecular systems studied at high-brightness   synchrotrons, almost all of the previously published studies of other   investigators have been demonstration studies.  These studies go far   beyond that.  The beauty of x-ray spectroscopy is that it can be   atom-specific, even in the `chemical site` sense of the term.  For   chemically important compounds, this requires the extremely high   resolution available in the synchrotron sources that will be exploited in   these studies.  Photoelectron spectroscopy and Auger spectroscopy are by   far the most important and widely used techniques for surface analysis in   industry and fundamental research in these areas remains vitally   important.",
