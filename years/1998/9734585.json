 "awd_abstract_narration": "New Traffic Models for Internet Connections  and VBR Video Traffic      This project examines new models for application and connec-          tion  level  traffic  on  the  Internet. The objective is to               better understand the impact  of  this  traffic  on  network               congestion.   Features  of Internet traffic such as its non-  Poisson statistics and long range dependence are a point  of               departure from typical traffic on circuit switched networks.               As packet traffic progresses from the  user  application  to               its  destination across a network, it undergoes a variety of               transformations.  These linear and/or nonlinear  transforma-               tions  give rise to structural features in an otherwise ran-               dom traffic stream. The result is high  variability  in  the               network traffic mix.  Identifying and controlling the source               of these traffic features is important in real-time resource               allocation and network traffic engineering. The work in this               project uses measured network data to identify  the  feature               space  required  to model Internet usage. Traffic generation               from end users, network protocols and video-coders are  con-               sidered.   Non-linear  time-series  models  will  be used to               characterize connection and application level traffic. These               models  have  the  flexibility to address a range of traffic               types from short-range  dependent  stochastic  processes  to               those  with  self-similar and deterministic features. At the               application level, particular attention is paid to the  gen-               eration  of layered variable bit rate video and into the in-               fluence of encoding parameters on  traffic  characteristics,               model  parameters  and performance. The time-series modeling               framework will be used to  design optimal rate control  algo-               rithms  with perceptual and network driven cost constraints.        The traffic models obtained will allow one to assess  and   control  end  systems  and provide network level control for               problematic traffic sources. The results will  also  provide               quantitative  evaluation of what types of traffic can be su-               perposed to yield suitable statistical  multiplexing  gains.               In  conjunction with the research effort, a graduate and un-               dergraduate curriculum in the network performance area                 will be  developed. The  courses  and  projects will support the               development of end-to-end problem solving skills. The aim               is to integrate  research and interdisciplinary ideas from               engineering and  physical  sciences  into  the  solution  of               telecommunications related problems.
