 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding will support planning and initial implementation for Barnard's proposed Science Education for Tomorrow (SET) Program. The SET Program will develop or revise curricula at three levels: 1) introductory, discipline-connected courses; 2) mid-level interdisciplinary electives for both majors and non-majors; and 3) advanced, interdisciplinary, off-campus research projects for majors. New pedagogical materials and methods from the SET project will be disseminated on the Web through the College's existing Barnard Electronic Archive for Teaching and Learning and through professional meetings.\r\n\r\nIntroductory science and statistics courses will be modified by incorporating of \"real world\" data available through the Internet; expanding multimedia technology as a teaching tool; and providing peer mentors for entry-level students. Mid-level curricular modules will be developed on issues at the intersection of science and public policy. These modules will make use of role-playing as a learning technique; they will be prepared by interdisciplinary teams of faculty. Junior and Senior majors will be urged to explore the professional world of science through interdisciplinary, off-campus research opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis combination of reforms will build upon a strong commitment to educate women for the sciences and an ongoing review and adaptation of the College's science curriculum and pedagogy to maintain and strengthen Barnard's record of successful science education. The SET Program will expand and reinforce the College's efforts to create a new generation of scientists and scientifically literate citizens who will understand more completely the implications of science for society and the significance of public policy for science.\r\n\r\n",
