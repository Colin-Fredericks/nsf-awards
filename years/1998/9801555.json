 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal DMS-9801555  Abstract of the Research Project of Francois Treves    F. Treves plans to carry out his research in the coming years, in the   following three distinct areas: 1. Global parametrices for the time-dependent   Schroedinger equation on Euclidean space equipped with a non-Euclidean   Riemannian metric. This is joint work with S. Chanillo (Rutgers Univ.). The   first step is to construct a parametrix when there is no potential. The next   step is to do the same with a potential, whose derivatives are decaying at   infinity at a suitable rate (with similar contions on the metric). They   propose to use the parametrix to describe the critical set and the propagation   of singularities (in Lbesgue and Sobolev spaces), with special attention to   the presence of trapped geodesics. 2. Boundary values of Dolbeault cohomology   classes. Treves is completing a research program begun with P. D. Cordaro   (Univ. of Sao Paulo, Brazil) and S. Gindikin (Rutgers Univ.). The objectives   are several: to obtain integral formulas for the solutions of second-order   hyperbolic and ultra-hyperbolic partial differential equations; to define   spaces of generalized functions (actually hyperfunctions) well suited for the   representations of the classical groups which preserve those equations; to lay   the ground for the study of ``analytic extension\" to domains more complicated   than wedges. 3. Analyticity of the solutions of second-order linear partial   differential equations of the form ``sums of squares of (analytic, real)   vector fields\". Recently Treves has formulated a necessary and sufficient   condition for such a property to be valid; he plans to use microlocal analysis   to initiate a proof of the conjecture.    The solutions of the Schroedinger equation are the fundamental elements in the   ``wave description\" of the states of particles in Quantum Physics. The   construction attempted by Chanillo and Treves is aimed at providing explicit   formulas for solving the Schroedinger equation  - formulas that make it possible   to describe very precisely the behaviour of the particles in the large (so as   to take into account distant ``radiation\") and in ``curved\" space (so as to   take into account special constraints on the trajectories of the particles).   The work of Treves on boundary values aims at forging new mathematicatools, and   again explicit formulas, that could be used in the theory of the Radon and   X-ray transforms (which lie at the theoretical foundations of tomography).   Finally, the differential equations of the kind ``sums of squares of vector   fields\" describe, through their solutions, various kinds  of Brownian motion and of random processes (they have been extensively studied   by probability theorists). The analyticity of their solutions is a precise   mathematical  formulation of their great smoothness, as well as indicating the possibility   of computing some of their properties in finitely many steps.",
