 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714334  Gordaninejad    Innovative energy-absorbing protective systems are needed to  enhance the safety of structures in the event of  earthquakes, severe storms, and other natural man-made  hazards.  This project aims at the developing and  implementing magneto-rheological fluid (MRF) dampers for  protect of structures.  The focus of the research will be on  the proof-of-concept utilization of a novel MRF damper for  seismic protection of buildings.    MFR dampers are semi-active decides that contain magneto-  rhelogical fluids.  Initiation of the damper's built-in  magnetic field causes a fast and dramatic change in the  viscosity of MRF dampers contained in the damper.  The  fouled changes state from liquid to semi-solid in  milliseconds.  The result is an infinitely variable,  controllable damper capable of very large damping forces.  MRF dampers offer an attractive solution to seismic energy  absorption in structures because they require minimal power  for operation this can be battery operated.  They are  inexpensive devices to manufacture, utilize, and maintain  which require no mechanical, valving and have large  temperature tolerance and long operational life.    The focus of this project is to develop controllable MRF  dampers that can demonstrate the capabilities needed for  protecting buildings under strong motions.  The research  tasks included:  (1) Comprehensive theoretical and  experimental studies for basic understanding of the behavior  and identification of the proposed MRF dampers, (2) Design  and development of MRF dampers for building applications.  Issues of robustness, maintenance, aging, and heat transfer  will be investigated, and (3) Proof-of-concept laboratory  tests on several scaled building systems.    To maintain and improve the present performance of  structures under severe seismic excitations and/or storms,  new or improved technology is a clear solution.  The  proposed MRF damper system will take advantage of the state-  of-the-art in advancement of materia l s to produce a  practical, efficient, and inexpensive protective system for  seismic structures.  Successful completion of the research  will contribute to the understanding, development and  utilization of innovative protective systems in the design  of new and/or retrofit of aging structures.",
