Garland Jr.  Responses to artificial selection for voluntary activity in  house mice    Non-Technical Summary      During the course of evolution, changes in behavior,  morphology, and physiology occur in some correlated fashion.  Natural selection that leads to changes in one trait also  produces changes in other traits.  Artificial selection,  where individuals possessing extreme values for some trait  are mated with one another over many generations, has been  used to establish lines of house mice that have a 120%  greater level of voluntary activity.  Using four such lines,  along with control lines that were not subjected to  selection, this research will explore the morphological and  physiological changes that are correlated with this change  in behavior.  It will explore traits such as oxygen  consumption, heart mass and blood hemoglobin levels to  determine differences in locomotor performance capabilities.  In addition, function of the endocrine system, limb bone  proportions, muscle fiber types and the activities of key  enzymes in both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism will be  examined.  This research will bring to bear a wide array of  sophisticated, modern methodology from the fields of  functional morphology, respiratory physiology, endocrinology  and genetics to these truly integrative studies of the  evolution of behavior.      The selected lines produced by this research will be made  available to  other researchers and will provide an important model system  for studying effects of voluntary activity in behavior on  physical fitness, health, lifespan and other aspects of life  history in mammals.  This project constitutes a pioneering  study upon which this potential for future research rests.",
