Given current priorities for literacy instruction, it is important that members of the science education community learn more about the ways in which the practices inherent in the systemic reform of science education at the elementary school level can improve students' reading, writing, and speaking abilities.  The grant will identify studies and reports of practice that will be useful in shaping an argument to the literacy and policy community in favor of hands-on, inquiry-based science instruction.  Once these studies are identified, a plan for dissemination through conferences and written material will be developed.\r\n\r\n",
