This  fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain  additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue innovative and imaginative research into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular, cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled Allometry as a  fundamental mechanism linking evolutionary and ecological  pattern in vascular plants.  Traditionally, the role of  plant size has not been as important to the study of botany  as it has been in animal research. In animal studies,  organism size (or allometry) has been shown to influence  nearly all aspects of organismal biology and diversity.  Interestingly, allometric relationships have been shown to  be described by a simple mathematical relationship described  by an exponent that is a quarter-power. The fact that these  quarter-power allometries describe nearly all aspects of  biology (anatomy, physiology, ecology of populations, life-  histories) strongly suggests that one or a few critical  mechanisms might link biological organization and process.  Recently, I have proposed a general model for the origin of  biological allometries. The model is based on the  transportation of resources through vascular networks.  Perhaps its biggest insight is that although plant and  animals differ, allometrically they share numerous  relationships. The underlying assumption of this work is  that allometry offers a window by which one can critically  investigate fundamental mechanisms influencing pla nt (and  animal) structure, function, and evolution. This proposal  will explore the specific predictions of the model in  vascular plants by using various empirical measurements of  vascular anatomy and physiology, tied with computer  simulation and mathematical modeling. Specifically this work  will test the role of vascular systems in dictating plant  architecture, evolution, and constraining ecological  patterns in local ecological communities.",
