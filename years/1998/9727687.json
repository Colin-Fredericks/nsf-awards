 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a continuation of behavioral and demographic monitoring of golden lion tamarin monkeys in Poco das Antas Reserve, Brazil. The study population, now continuously monitored for 13 years, consists of about one third of the approximately 346 tamarins in the reserve.  Date and circumstances are recorded for every migration event in the population.  Maternity is recorded for each infant born into the study population and probable paternity determined using behavioral and molecular-genetic techniques.  Demographic data are entered into SPARKS, software designed to track genealogies and perform demographic analyses for captive populations.  One major objective of this research is to test hypotheses concerning the social and ecological circumstances that influence timing of natal dispersal in this cooperative breeding primate. Demographic analyses will also permit calculation of effective population size, an important measure for setting conservation goals for this endangered species.  In addition, we will apply newly available fecal endocrine assays to address questions concerning physiological suppression of fertility in subordinate females, endocrine correlates of forced and voluntary dispersal of individual tamarins, and of social dominance.  Finally, this research site, the study population, and the supporting databases will continue to serve as a center for Neotropical research.",
