 "awd_abstract_narration": "9713566  Bank  This project will study the energy-absorption capacity of  composite material tubes when loaded in bending.  The  ability to absorb energy in flexural deformation is required  in framed structural systems.  This flexural energy  absorption capacity is a central tenant of the design  philosophy of steel and reinforced concrete structures,  since it allows these structures to develop \"plastic-hinge\"  mechanisms prior to failure. Such \"hinges\" provide reserve  capacity, overall ductility, and an all-important safeguard  against catastrophic failure.  It is the objective of  this  project to demonstrate that pseudo-plastic hinges can  develop in composite material tubular beams,  thus,  imparting to composite structural frames an energy-  absorption capacity analogous to that found in conventional  steel or reinforced concrete frames.  The mechanism by which  a composite material tubular beam develops \"stable\" energy  absorption is, however, very different from that of a steel  or reinforced concrete beam.  In these conventional beams,  the energy absorption is obtained due to irreversible  plastic strain in the elasto-plastic materials.  It is the  purpose of this study to show that in a composite material  tubular beam, energy is absorbed in a stable manner by  progressive \"tearing failure\" at the tube corners, and that  this provides the beam with a behavior analogous to that of  an elasto-plastic beam.  Such a phenomenon has recently been  reported but an in-depth study has not been conducted.  This  research will investigate the phenomenon in-depth, by use of  experimentation and numerical modeling, and provide  recommendations for design.  ***",
