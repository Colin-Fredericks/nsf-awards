 "awd_abstract_narration": "9812526  Goldstein    This award supports research on nonlinear dynamics and  pattern formation in physical and biological systems.  Theoretical research well connected with experiment will  focus on the areas of cell growth and motion, and on an  alternative explanation of the Rayleigh instability in fluid  mechanics.  Work in the first area focuses on understanding  the physical mechanisms of cell growth in the bacterium B.  subtilis and on the mechanism of directed swimming in  peritrichously flagellated bacterial cells.  The proposed  work would elucidate the physical processes that lead to the  formation of the supercoiled  structure of B. subtilis that  results when cell separation fails to occur after cell  division, and related physical biology associated with  moving filamentary structures. Work in the second area seeks  to elucidate the mechanism for directed swimming that  results when co-rotating helical flagella bundle together.  Inquiry will focus on the hydrodynamic interactions that  occur when this happens and on collective behavior recently  observed in suspensions of swimming microorganisms.  The PI  seeks a description that melds the areas of elasticity and  hydrodynamics at low Reynolds number to elucidate the  physical mechanisms by which microorganisms swim. Recent  experiments on shape instabilities of membrane vesicles  induced by optical traps that have shown that front  propagation may occur in such tension driven instabilities.  Motivated by these experiments, the PI will study the  circumstances under which an analogous `propagating  topological transition' might occur in viscous two-phase  flow.  Of particular interest are convective instabilities  of jets and plumes, buckling phenomena in jets, and the role  of viscoelasticity and shear.  %%%  This talented PI will carry out theoretical research in  areas at the interface between physics and biology.  The  physical mechanisms by which microorganisms swim and a  better understanding of kinds of fluid flow peculiar t o  biological systems are a major focus of the research.  ***",
