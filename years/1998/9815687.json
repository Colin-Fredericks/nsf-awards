The NSF I/UCRC at the University of Michigan has focused on the development of real time error compensation methodologies.  In general, these methods use information measured by temperature sensors mounted on the machine tool structure, and mathematical models of machine thermal errors, to predict the cutter location errors caused by various sources; the methods them compensate for the errors in real time.  In this study, the NSF I/UCRC at the University of Michigan will initiate a collaborative R&D project with Saginaw Machine Systems, Inc. to perform the following research:\r\n\r\n1. Develop a scientific methodology to determine a set of optimal sensor locations quickly before mounting the sensors on the machine.  A software simulation method will be developed to determine the optimal thermal sensor locations when the machine structure and working conditions are known.\r\n2. Develop an innovative concept of thermal error mode analysis.  The thermal error mode analysis will reveal each machine's thermal error features for optimizing the sensor locations.\r\n3. Validate the above methodologies and techniques experimentally on a CNC turning center.  The number of sensors required is expected to be reduced significantly.  At the same time, the calibration time for thermal errors is expected to decrease dramatically.  Furthermore, year-round machining accuracy can be achieved.\r\n\r\nThe success of this study will shed light on future research and applications of machine tool error compensation methods in industry.  The success would not only make a significant contribution of the science base of this important technical field, but would also make a great impact on the widespread industrial applications of error compensation research.  Thus, it will help U.S. machine tool industry, and further generate positive impacts on any manufacturing industry that uses machine tools, to compete \r\n",
