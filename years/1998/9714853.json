The structural  uses of intermetallic alloys suffer a major drawback: most  are brittle at ambient temperatures.  This poor ductility  and toughness restricts the use of intermetallics as  critical components in industrial systems.  For the past 10  years, substantial efforts have been devoted to this class  of structural materials, and, as a result, significant  progress has been made in improving the tensile ductility  and fracture resistance of nickel, iron, and titanium  aluminides.  The objective of this workshop is a provide a  forum for experts from various countries to discuss (1)  fundamental variables controlling deformation and fracture  of ordered intermetallics at ambient and elevated  temperatures; (2) the design of ductile intermetallic alloys  for structural uses; (3) further improvements in low-  temperature toughness and high-temperature strength by a  composite approach; and (4) the processing of intermetallic  alloys and composites by both conventional and innovative  methods.  This international workshop is co-organized by  Prof. Dongliang Lin (host) from Shanghai Jiao Tong  University, Dr. C. T. Liu from Oak Ridge National  Laboratory, and Prof. Stephen L. Sass from Cornell  University.  It is held in Hangzhou, China, from April 5-10,  1998.  Participation in this workshop is by invitation only.  The proceedings of this workshop is tentatively planned to  be published in the Journal of Materials Science and  Technology.  It is expected to have 25-30 scientists from  outside China and 25-30 scientists from China.  %%%  Ordered intermetallics based on aluminides and silicides  possess many attractive properties for high-temperature  structural use.  In general, these intermetallic s show  excellent strength at elevated temperatures. Many  intermetallic alloys exhibit an increase in strength with  temperature rather than a decrease as in conventional  materials.  Aluminides and silicides are extremely resistant  to oxidation and corrosion at elevated temperatures in  hostile environments.  In addition, these intermetallic  alloys have a density lower than that of steels and  superalloys by as much as 40%, thus making the  intermetallics ideal for fabricating moving parts in  advanced heat engines, gas turbines and other energy  conversion systems.  ***",
