 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the nation's highway bridges are aging and are showing signs of deterioration due to environmental effects.  Innovative and durable materials are needed for future bridge construction and major bridge rehabilitation.  Fiber-reinforced plastics are known to have high resistance against environmental effects.  An interdisciplinary approach is needed to investigate the potential application of FRP's in bridge engineering.  This study addresses the basic behavior of innovative beams made with graphite/epoxy (G/E) composites used in combination with high-strength reinforced concrete slabs.  The study will integrate two disciplines, bridge engineering and composite materials, to establish the feasibility of using CG/E (concrete and G/E) sections in bridge construction.  The new shapes are aimed at developing a reliable connection at the interface of the concrete slab and the G/E sections.  One aspect of the research will determine if adhesives can be eliminated altogether at the concrete G/E interface.  Another aspect of the study will examine the fatigue response of the proposed sections to assess their suitability for application in bridges.",
