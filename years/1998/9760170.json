 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9760170  Lockert    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will develop a mechanically reinforced Commingled Recycled Plastic Lumber (CRPL) with an efficient cross-sectional geometry.  Reinforcements include chopped natural fibers and continuous synthetic fibers oriented both isotropicly and anistropicly.  Efficient cross-sections are used to maximize geometric stiffness while minimizing material requirements.  CRPL's inherent long life expectancy augmented by significant increases in mechanical properties would allow this innovative product to cost effectively replace wood in civil infrastructure projects.  The research has strongly interactive process development, experimental, and computational (finite element) components.  The latter provides a \"mechanics of reinforced plastics approach\" in specifying reinforcements and optimal profiles.  Process flexibility allows the hybrid profile to be designed for the application as opposed to finding an application meeting the product's capabilities.    CRPL's superior bio-degradation resistance provides a wide range of potential commercial applications including where pressure-treated wood is currently used.  Applications include residential and commercial construction, e.g., building framing, fence and sign posts, guard rail posts, retaining walls, bulkheads, pilings, pallets, railroad ties, concrete forms, etc.  If the research is successful, the potential for intelligent use of reinforcement and optimal structural profiles should result in mechanical performance and service life of CRPL far superior to wood in many civil infrastructure projects.",
