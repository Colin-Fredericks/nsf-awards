 "awd_abstract_narration": "9814972  FRITSEN  Three to twenty meter thick permanent ice covers on lakes in  the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctic contain viable microbial  cells in association wit sediment aggregates.  These  aggregates are now recognized as sites where physical,  chemical and biological interactions promote microbial  growth under extreme conditions inherent to the ice  environment.  This interdisciplinary research program will  define specific processes which allow (1) the creation of  liquid water (the essential element for life) in the  permanent ice, (2) the survival and structuring of microbial  populations subjected to freezing and thawing, (3) the  production of substances which alter the physical attributes  of the ice crystal habitat and (4) nutrient supply to the  microbial populations which is essential for not only  survival, but net microbial growth and biomass accumulation.  The work will be on ice aggregates embedded within the  permanent ice covers on the lakes in the Taylor Valley,  which have been tentatively characterized in previous  studies.  Research on microbes in permanent ice provides  information on the ecology of microbes in ice ecosystems and  promises to have biotechnological implications.  Furthermore, these studies will provide insights into the  conditions, which support or have supported life beyond our  own planet in association with water ice which is currently  present within and beyond our own solar system.",
