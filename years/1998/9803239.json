 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803239\r\nHoudre\r\n\r\nProfessor Houdre is investigating various topics in probability and statistics.  His theoretical work includes isoperimetric problems for product probability measures, graphs and Markov chains, jackknife based deviation inequalities and new directions in the study of random Fourier series.  His applied projects include studying the probability of error in biostatistical modeling as well as the application of deviation inequalities in aerospace engineering.\r\n\r\nProfessor Houdre's work in bioinformatics addresses questions of error inherent in popular genome sequencing algorithms which were used in the mapping of E. Coli and more recently, H. Pylori.  His work in aerospace engineering involves the application of stochastic algorithms to the design of high speed civil transportation aircraft.  The theoretical underpinnings of these applied activities will also be advanced since isoperimetric methods often provide good estimates of probability distributions which have a tremendous number of applications.  In particular, Professor Houdre will continue to bridge modern statistical resampling methods and distribution estimates for general classes of statistics. Finally his work on random Fourier series will provide tools and methods for the analysis of fractal-like physical phenomena.\r\n",
