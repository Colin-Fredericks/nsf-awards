 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. David A. Atwood, Department of Chemistry, North Dakota State   University, Fargo, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division and by the Experimental   Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) for studies of the   chemistry of Group 13 complexes.  The fundamental chemistry of cationic,   anionic, and neutral complexes will be investigated, which could lead to   the development of applications in Lewis acid and Ziegler-Naata catalysis   and in nanoparticulate oxide synthesis.  The education component of this   project integrates teaching with research, and fundamental with applied   chemistry through the formation of courses which emphasize synthesis,   catalysis and solid-state materials in ways that relate the chemistry to   applications and uses in daily life.  This project addressses the synthesis of new compounds with Group 13   metal ions such as aluminum and gallium.  Synthetic strategies will be   developed, and a wide range of molecular and solid-state characterization   techniques will be used to study the fundamental chemistry of these   systems.  Fundamental developments in the chemistry of these systems   could lead to applications in catalysis and solid-state materials.",
