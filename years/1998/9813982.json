Plans involve holding the initial workshop in Budapest, Hungary, during July 1999 and a second in Auburn, Alabama, during March 2000.  The intent is to strengthen research ties between the two communities that will build upon Hungarian strengths in mathematical theory and U.S. strengths in operation research and computer science.   Results are expected to foster new U.S.-Hungarian research teams and subsequent publications in subjects featuring: packing density, Helly and Radon type results, problems related to motion planning and graphs, and new methods in convexity theory.\r\n\r\nThese mathematical workshops in geometric analysis fulfill the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.\r\n",
