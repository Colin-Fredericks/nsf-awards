 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870659  Tabor       This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training  (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a broadly-  based graduate training program at the interface of the  biological, mathematical and physical sciences.  The program,  a joint effort of 21 faculty drawn from 9 departments and 2  national laboratories, will emphasize collaborative research  on problems where the joining of mathematical and physical  modeling with hands-on laboratory experimentation holds great  promise.  Particular areas of interest include arthropod  evolution and population biology, cardiovascular physiology,  image analysis, bacterial motion, physics of cell structures,  and olfaction.  Students enrolled in any of seven existing  Ph.D. programs, will participate in a combination of existing  and new courses, including a new three semester biomathematics  seminar that will combine literature research, faculty-student  group discussions and seminars by outside experts to explore  topical problems.  A new, biological physics laboratory course  covering Brownian motion, membranes, biopolymers, chemotaxis  and fluid dynamics will be required of all students.  Students  will be recruited through existing departmentally-based  strategies, as well as special efforts sponsored directly by  the graduate college.       IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program whose goal is to sponsor  the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate  programs that will train a diverse group of new scientists and  engineers to be well-prepared for varied careers in the  private and public sectors.  IGERT provides an opportunity for  the development of new, well-focused multidisciplinary  programs that bridge traditional organizational barriers,  uniting faculty from several departments or institutions to  establish a highly-interactive collaborative environment for  both training and research.  In its first year, the program  will provide support to 17 institutions for new or nascent  programs that collectively s pan all areas of science,  engineering and mathematics eligible for support by the NSF.",
