 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cubic nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS) equation is a partial differential \r\nequation that describes pulse train generation in solid state\r\nor fiber lasers, or pulse propagation in long distance communication \r\nsystems under ideal conditions.  In order to describe the situation under \r\nmore realistic physical scenarios, i.e., with losses, spectral filtering, \r\netc., one must consider extended model equations which are perturbations \r\nof the NLS and which depend on the physical situation that is being modelled.  \r\nExamples include models for phase-matched third-harmonic generation, \r\nmaterials with higher-order nonlinearities, and passively mode-locked fiber \r\nlasers.  Numerous recent research efforts have indicated that these extended \r\nmodels are very robust.  The central mathematical question of the planned \r\nresearch is the stability of propagating pulses, incorporating for example \r\neffects of small gains and losses in the optical fiber, and the correct \r\nbalance of these effects which will guarantee stable pulses.  A mathematically \r\nrigorous analytical study of the existence and stability of solitons for the \r\ngoverning equations has been lacking and will be developed.  The work  \r\nwill exploit a recently discovered mathematical structure for the extended \r\nmodel equations.  It makes use of the fact that these equations are very close\r\nto integrable equations that have been studied extensively.\r\n\r\nFiberoptic cables are of growing importance in long distance communications.\r\nThe pulses which carry information in such cables can be described by\r\nmathematical equations that depend on the medium, among other things.  The exact\r\nform of the equations is usually not known.  In order for information to arrive \r\nundistorted at its destination, it is essential that these pulses remain stable \r\nas they travel along the fiber.  In this work, rigorous mathematical methods to \r\nstudy this stability will be developed.  The methods will also be robust under\r\nchanges of the medium and will therefore have wide potential.\r\n   \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
