 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid proliferation of new instruction set architectures that  support instruction-level parallel processing has created great  compiler and microarchitecture research opportunities.  The IMPACT  compiler, with its advanced features such as predicated  compilation, instruction level parallelism optimizations, compiler  engineered speculation, profile-based optimizations, advanced  machine description facilities, scheduling frameworks for resource  sensitive code optimizations, and pointer-based dependence  analysis and tracking facility, has become a premier compiler  technology base for major U.S. companies as well as academic  researchers.  This software capitalization project enables the use  of IMPACT's state-of-the-art compiler framework by a large number  of researchers.  This will be accomplished by enhancing existing  documentation and developing new documentation and tutorials,  further strengthening the software interfaces, building and  maintaining a web-based support infrastructure, and making the  software as stable as possible through the aggressive use of a  regression-test environment and timely response to users' bug  reports.  This project's software and documentation will be  released in several phases over two years and the end product will  be a high-quality and readily-available compiler environment that  supports a wide variety of advanced instruction-level  parallel processing research.",
