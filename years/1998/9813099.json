 "awd_abstract_narration": "9813099  Wen  This research project deals with the development of path  planning methods using a feedback controller for a variety  of fully and under-actuated mechanical systems, including  robots and spacecrafts.  The proposed scheme can guarantee  the closed-loop asymptotic stability when information is  imperfect. Furthermore, by using interior penalty functions,  inequality constraints can also be handled by the algorithm.  This type of feedback control law can be considered as a  special class of model predictive control (MPC), since the  control action at each time instance is determined based on  the future trajectory.  However, in contrast with the  standard MPC schemes where an optimization problem needs to  be solved at each control time interval, only one Newton  step needs to be computed involving a fixed amount of  computation.  The efficacy of this algorithm has been  demonstrated on a number of difficult examples, including  the kinematic control of wheeled vehicles, stabilization of  underactuated 6-DOF satellites, and stabilization of  underactuated manipulators. The key research thrusts in the  proposed research include: i)develop parameter selection  rule in the algorithm that will grarantee closed loop  stability; ii) quantify the stability robustness margin when  the vector field is perturbed due to model imperfection and  external disturbances; iii)enhance robustness through  parameter adaptation; iv)utilize null space in the gradient  operator for singularity avoidance and constraint handling;  v)develop stategies for choosing the approximation basis in  control computation and analyze the effect of approximation  on convergences, and vi) apply to a number of experiments  involving nonlinear mechanical systems.    ***",
