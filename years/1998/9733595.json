 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award supports research leading to the development of a new methodology and modeling techniques for performing geotechnical and geo-environmental site characterizations.  The Principal Investigator will build on the previously developed Vision Cone Penetrometer (VisCPT) system capable of capturing and recording continuous video images of the subsurface materials in real time.  This research will develop a suite of image processing and analysis programs for both qualitative visualization (including virtual specimens shown at low and high magnification) and quantitative characterization (including development of a Soil Image Classification system that can identify subsurface stratigraphic units difficult to detect using existing methods).  Sophisticated image processing and analysis algorithms, such as texture classification and segmentation using wavelets, co-occurrence approaches, etc., will be applied for soil characterization.  A three-dimensional `Geoscience Modeling Environment` will be created for visualizing site data obtained from various measurements.  The educational objective for this project is to develop a curriculum that emphasizes the importance of site investigation and characterization for engineering problems.  A new, flexible course module, including integrated computer methods, on site characterization will be developed that can be adapted for training students at various educational levels.  Development of novel, stimulating, educational experiences, which are targeted to students at different stages of intellectual development, is essential to attracting underrepresented groups into science and engineering.  The theory and application of the computer programs will be examined through analysis of several real or simulated case histories.  The impact of uncertainty on design and analysis will be stressed.",
