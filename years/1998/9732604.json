 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arun Yethirraj is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research on static and   dynamic properties of polyelectrolyte solutions.  A combination of liquid   state theory and computer simulations will be used to investigate the   conformational properties, static structure, self diffusion, and   viscosity of polyelectrolyte solutions.  Monte Carlo simulations will be   used to investigate the effect of solvent, chain branching, and charge   sequence distribution on the polymer properties and to analyze neutron   scattering data on DNA and sodium polystyrene sulphonate.  Brownian   dynamics will be used to study the kinetics of the collapse transition in   polyelectrolyte chains, and to test various models for the dynamic form   factors used in the analysis of experimental neutron diffraction data.    Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations will also be used to   investigate the anomalous behavior of intrinsic viscosity.  Polyelectrolytes have a wide range of technological uses: as processing   aids such as flocculants, dewatering agents, demulsifiers, and drag   reduction agents; as additives in detergents and cosmetics; and in the   manufacture of membranes, ion-exchange resins, gels, and modified   plastics.  The study of polyelectrolytes therefore spans diverse areas   such as biomedicine, wastewater treatment, separations, colloid science,   and petroleum recovery.  The behavior of polyelectrolytes, however, is   far from well understood, and Yethiraj's research will help in obtaining   a molecular level understanding of these systems.                                                   \u2593@\u00a5 \u2500}  \u00cc\u00a8\u2560f(DT '\u00b5 \u00a6M\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0131\u256ci .|7(\u2534 \u2550\u00e1Z5\u00af\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0P9 \u00da\u00a59\u00b5\u00b8\u00cdG\u2550G49fX\u2566u\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0192% P  C [G*X\u00cb  \u00da4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0^VC\u2591  #\u256c0  \u2518T\u00b3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
