 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental research on social influence processes has recently revealed lower levels of social influence compared to prior research.  This project focuses on systematically investigating three sources of this variation: (1) changes in cultural attitudes regarding social characteristics that affect influence processes, (2) differences in the medium through which experiments studying social influence are conducted (i.e., video-mediated vs. computer-mediated experiments), and (3) differences in the procedures that experimenters have followed.  In this experiment, subjects complete a decisionmaking task, ostensibly by working with a partner.  In reality, the partner is emulated via computer software or videotape.  The partner's behavior is manipulated, introducing disagreements regarding the task solution into the interaction.  Influence is assessed by determining how often the subject refuses to comply with the position of the partner following the disagreements.  To test gender and media effects, a 2 (subject gender: male vs. female) x 2 (partner's gender: male vs. female) x 2 (medium: computer vs. video) factorial design is used.   This project rests on arguments from Status Characteristics Theory, which describes how social attributes (like age, race, and sex) that differentiate people correspond to differences in competency expectations that people hold for one another and influence behavior.  Competency expectations arise from cultural beliefs regarding social characteristics.  Thus, shifts in such beliefs may lead to changes in influence processes, accounting for the lower influence levels found in recent tests of the theory.  Also, recent experiments were conducted in a computerized context, while earlier studies were conducted in a video context.  As such, media effects represent an alternative explanation for reduced influence levels.  Examination of previous and recent experiments on social influence also reveal differences in the protocols that were used.  Consequently, it is unclear whether lower influence rates in recent research arise from (1) changes in cultural attitidues, (2) media effects, and/or (3) variations in the procedures followed in administering the experiments.  This project will lead to enhanced understanding of the effect of cultural attitudes on interpersonal interaction, as well as the effects of communication media on social interaction.  Valuable information on computer-mediated experimentation will also be gained.  The investigator has been engaged in the development of computer software through which Status Characteristics Theory experiments can be conducted.  The articulation of media and procedural effects is critical to this work. The effects of media must be disentangled from the effects of cultural understandings of social attributes before theoretical and empirical advances can be made.  Consequently, this exploratory research is critical to the development of the investigator's research agenda and scholarly career.",
