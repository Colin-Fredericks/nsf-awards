The goal of the program is to enhance and broaden the chemistry Ph.D. experience by offering broader coursework, industrial internships and teaching experiences in a multidisciplinary setting.  The so-called LANTERN (learn and intern) program includes: (a) an industrial internship program with the regional semiconductor industry, (b) associated graduate coursework on the chemistry and physics of semiconductor materials and devices, and (c) short courses on semiconductors and their devices, partially taught by the graduate students, for undergraduates and for non-technical staff employed by the industrial affiliates.\r\n\r\nThis effort seeks to broaden the traditional chemistry Ph.D. curriculum by incorporating lecture and laboratory courses in semiconductor materials and devices, a topical area typically under the purview of physicists and engineers.  The LANTERN program in chemistry is implemented in conjunction with an applied physics masters program; students in both programs will share courses and will co-participate in industrial internships, which will assist in nurturing a common language between both groups.\r\n%%%\r\n***\r\n",
