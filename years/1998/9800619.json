The goal is to encourage these students to pursue careers in the geosciences and to help them succeed by providing research experiences, credentials for future opportunities, and a support network.  The program allows students of color to participate in collaborative student-faculty research projects at two stages in their academic careers: a five-week summer program after the sophomore year and a year-long experience beginning the summer after the junior year.  Ten sophomore students each year will join two research groups each involving ten students and three faculty members.  Students from two to three member teams that design and implement a research project addressing an aspect of the group's research interest.  Three junior students each year will participate in any of five research groups each involving nine more advanced students and three faculty.  These students design and implement an individual research project that contributes to the group's research goals.  Research begins during a four-week summer project and continues through the academic year.  Four faculty from underrepresented groups are recruited each year to help lead the research projects.  These faculties enrich the scientific expertise on the projects, expand the career counseling available to students, and provide a wide variety of role models for students.  Students are guided in research during the academic year by an on-campus sponsor who may visit the summer research project.  Research groups stay in contact during the academic year using e-mail.  All students present their results at the annual Keck Research Symposium in Geology in either an oral or poster presentation and publish a short paper in the symposium proceedings.  In addition to providing closure to the research experience, the research symposium allows students to network with over 100 student and faculty participants in the Keck Geology Consortium Student-Faculty Research Program.\r\n",
