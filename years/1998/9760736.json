 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Physical Optics Corporation (POC) will develop a compact full color head mounted display (HMD).  The proposed display will be low in weight and cost, easy to manufacture, and comfortable to use.  The firm proposes to develop a compact full-color HMD with high resolution and a high refresh rate based on the following innovations: (a) A liquid crystalline, electro-optic, tunable micro-scanner based on POC's recently demonstrated microrefraction optic technology; (b) multiplexed (RGB) holographic reflective optics based on POC's established volume holographic technology; and (c) a modular architecture for improved manufacturability.  POC will investigate the feasibility of the proposed concept through analysis and experimentation, leading to a proof of concept at the end of Phase I).  A novel head mounted information display technology will be extremely useful in a wide range of scientific and other applications.  Potential commercial applications of the proposed HMD include virtual reality, telepresence in robotics, medicine, avionics, education, and CAD applications in the private sector.  Video conferencing, movies, and video games offer huge potential mass markets for compact, high resolution, low cost HMDS.",
