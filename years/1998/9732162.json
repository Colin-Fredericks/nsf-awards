This  meeting will bring together experts in the field of structure  determination by diffraction and related techniques to inform a  broad range of inorganic, solid state and materials chemists  about the latest advances in these fields.  %%%  New materials classes of high technological importance are  emerging at a rapid rate due in large part to the development of  new solid state synthetic strategies. These include synthesis at  low temperatures, \"chemie douce\" or soft chemistry,  supramolecular assembly, crystal engineering, and new routes to  hybrid inorganic-organic materials. These approaches have  recently been used by industrial firms searching for new  catalysts, semiconductors and superconductors. Complementary to  these synthetic efforts, and an integral part of solid state  chemistry is the development of powerful structure determining  tools for the characterization of these new classes of  materials.  ***",
