 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation project focuses on an understanding of the historical development of the infrastructure of modern aviation through detailed investigation into one component of the infrastructure: blind landing systems.  In particular this project will analyze the process of negotiation that took place between representatives of labor unions, Federal agencies, the International  Civil Aviation Organization, airlines, and radio and electronic companies which resulted in the construction of a standardized system.  This involved the rejection of some possible systems, and hence this project will investigate both successful and failed technologies.  Because modern aviation is a highly complex system that has evolved both in terms of its technologies and the organizations that use and mange them, understanding its development as an historical process will help scholars better understand the development of large-scale, public-sector technologies.  The finished project will take the form of an historical narrative, based upon extensive examination of published primary documents, and through the examination of unpublished material contained  in the archives of government agencies, relevant labor unions, and commercial organizations, and the International Civil Aviation Organization.",
