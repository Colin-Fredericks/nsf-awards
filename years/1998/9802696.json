Dr. Dadarlat's student, Mr.  Nathaniel P. Brown, will work with Dr. Yasuyuki Kawahigashi,  Professor in the Department of Mathematics, on a research  project entitled, \"Noncummutative  Dynamical Systems.\"    A dynamical system is a mathematical model through which one  attempts to understand the behavior of physical phenomena.  The study of classical, or commutative, dynamical systems is  closely related to many aspects of modern physics including  both chaos and quantum theories.  The proposed research will  attempt to apply classical dynamical systems theory to the  noncommutative setting and will investigate a series of  geometric and algebraic questions concerning crossed product  C*-algebras.  The first component of the research will  examine when certain classes of crossed product C*-algebras  are embedded into AF algebras, allowing deduction concerning  the specific geometric and algebraic properties of the  crossed product C*-algebra.  The second component of the  research will build on some of the known classification  results for crossed product C*-algebras; specifically, it  will attempt to determine when certain crossed products are  essentially the same.  Finally, the research will attempt to  develop an innovative notion of topological entropy for  these noncommutative systems.  Entropy has played an  important role in the study of commutative systems, but  entropy in the noncommutative setting is relatively new and  not yet well understood.  The research is designed to study  this facet of mathematics with the goal of achieving  concrete calculations for future examination.  ***",
