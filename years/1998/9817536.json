 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) Programs and the Commission on Professionals in Science and Technology (CPST) propose to conduct a three-year research study to identify and disseminate findings on the successful strategies that lead to increased minority representation in science, mathematics, and engineering (SME) doctoral programs and SME-related careers, in particular, professorial positions.  Our study will determine the factors-the college and university policies, practices, and support services-that lead to the successful transition of minority SME undergraduates into and through graduate school to career entry. By identifying and disseminating these findings, our aim is to stimulate the creation of a structural approach to support minority graduate education.\r\n\r\nBuilding upon the ongoing research studies of AAAS and CPST, through a series of planning studies, surveys and case studies with colleges and universities and key federal and private staff, and surveys of SME minority faculty, we will identify indicators related to institutional infrastructure, professional socialization, and beliefs and attitudes.  Additionally, we will conduct special analyses of employment data on recent SME doctorates.\r\n\r\nAs data are being gathered and analyzed, we will facilitate a national dialogue, engaging college and university Presidents/Chancellors, deans and provosts, SME department chairs, federal and private funders, and leaders in professional SME associations to move minority graduate education forward.  Dissemination efforts will include efforts such as regional hearings/meetings; annual meeting and planning sessions with thirteen professional societies; and continuous reporting of minority graduate education issues, programs, and meetings via Internet and resource press packets.\r\n\r\nThe study will draw from its expert research consulting team for ongoing advice on the project, as well as from its dissemination team for assistance in distributing the findings across a wide spectrum of groups and organizations in a variety of media.\r\n",
