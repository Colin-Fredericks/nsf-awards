 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727890  Kilpatrick    The University of Georgia has a one-year award to publish a monograph that formulates a concise and explicit statement of the research and theoretical bases for the standards in the three National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) standards documents.  This project is opportunely timed to coincide with the forthcoming revision of the curriculum, teaching, and assessment standards-a project termed Standards 2000.  Underlying assumptions that relate to student learning, instructional practice, assessment practice, teacher development, system change, and the nature of mathematics will be made explicit in the monograph.  Moreover, this publication will not only document claims made in Standards 2000 but offer contrasting views.    With a group of mathematics educators, mathematicians, teachers, educational theorists and researchers, and the Standards 2000 working-group leaders, the principal investigator will convene a three-day conference to structure a publication that will be accessible to classroom teachers. It will allow the writers of Standards 2000 to link their work to a complementary document containing a detailed discussion of relevant research and citations of the literature.    While intended primarily for mathematics teachers, the monograph is designed to reach a much wider audience that includes policy makers, administrators, supervisors, mathematicians, and teacher educators.  A formal review process is in place to ensure that these diverse voices are heard.  Plans will be developed for utilizing the World Wide Web to get feedback from an even wider audience before a final draft is offered for publication and subsequent distribution.    The project will provide a much-needed, succinct, and clearly formulated statement of theory and research relevant to Standards 2000.",
