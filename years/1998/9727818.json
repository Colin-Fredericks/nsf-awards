 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sloboda  9727818    The goal of this project is to understand the role of a protein termed p62 in two key processes of cell division, mitosis and cytokinesis.  Cell division is an essential feature of life: it is the process whereby all organisms reproduce themselves and whereby multicellular organisms develop from a single-celled zygote.  Cytokinesis is the process in which the cell cleaves itself into two separate cells.  Mitosis is the complex process immediately preceding cytokinesis, in which the chromosomes of the dividing cell are separated and equally apportioned into the regions destined to become the daughter cells.  A cytoskeletal framework is erected by the cell in order to accomplish these tasks.  For mitosis, the framework is called the mitotic spindle because of its appearance under the microscope, and it consists primarily of microtubules.  For cytokinesis, in animal cells the framework consists of highly organized actin microfilaments directly under the plasma membrane in the cortex of the cell.  Prior work from Dr. Sloboda's laboratory has implicated the p62 protein in both cytokinesis and in the anaphase A stage of mitosis (the stage in which the separated chromosomes move away from the middle of the dividing cells, toward the poles, or pointed ends, of the mitotic spindle apparatus).  The protein is physically closely associated with the spindle, and mitosis can be inhibited at the start of anaphase by microinjection of antibodies specific for p62.  An essential feature of anaphase A is the disassembly of microtubules, and a drug known to prevent microtubule disassembly, taxol, affects mitosis in a manner analogous to the anti-p62 antibodies. Thus, p62 appears to play some role in allowing or mediating the mitotically-regulated disassembly of microtubules.  The protein is also concentrated in the cortex of dividing cells, and has been shown to undergo phosphorylation when the cortex is induced to contract.  The cDNA for p62 from sea urchin eggs has been cloned and sequenced,  and the protein has been expressed in bacteria.      For the purposes of this project, additional reagents (purified p62 and additional antibodies) will be developed.  Purified p62 will be used for in vitro studies of its effect on microtubule stability, binding to the mitotic apparatus, and cortical contraction.  The information obtained from these studies will be combined with information from experiments in intact cells, using antibodies to localize and to inhibit the functions of p62.  Site directed mutagenesis will be used to alter the phosphorylation sites in p62 to determine the role(s) of these sites in these processes.  Also, p62 homologues will be sought in other systems that offer the opportunity of genetic manipulation.      The general hypothesis underlying this project is that p62 plays a pivotal role in mitosis, particularly during anaphase A, not only by allowing microtubule disassembly to occur but also by inducing the activity of the cleavage furrow.  Understanding the characteristics of p62 and the functional interactions of p62 with other components of the machinery of mitosis and cytokinesis will lead to a greater understanding of these critically important cellular processes.",
