 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Kononenko    The main emphasis in our a program of  research is on  the   singular geometry and its applications to billiards systems.   The research focuses on geometric methods that allow one to   restate various problems in the theory of semi-dispersing  billiards in terms of geodesics in some Alexandrov spaces   (typically of non-positive curvature).  The problems that   can be attacked with our methods have to do with counting the  number of collisions in billiards,  counting the number of   periodic orbits, calculating entropy and other invariants of  billiards systems. The most important open problems that we  plan to work on are the construction of  universal model   spaces for billiards in non-positive curvature, and proving   the finiteness of the topological entropy for the first-return   map for billiards in non-positive curvature.  In addition, hope to   construct examples of billiards with areas of positive curvature,   which have infinite entropy.  We also plan to continue our  work in the areas of  differentiable and  cohomological rigidity   of lattice actions, and partially hyperbolic dynamical systems.    The theory of semi-dispersing billiards lies at the  heart of the  foundations of the statistical physics. Much of our proposed   research focuses on new geometric methods in the theory of   semi-dispersing billiards that we have  recently developed. Our   new methods have already allowed us to solve  several old problems  that had been open for at least 15 years.  In particular we have  established the finiteness of entropy (measure of chaos in the  system) for broad classes of billiards. Among other things we plan  to use our approach to study various other statistical properties  of hard-ball systems (the main model of statistical physics).  In addition to our research on billiards we plan to work in the  areas of rigidity and hyperbolic dynamics. In particular, we are  interested in various questions related to the notion of stable  ergodicity (a property of a s ystem to remain chaotic even after  arbitrary, but \"small\" perturbations).",
