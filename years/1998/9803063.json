The proposed research is to identify forest species by means of  (1) hyperspectral data measured directly from above forest canopies in the field, and (2) hyperspectral data from airborne instruments based on the understanding from part (1).  This research is motivated by the belief that the rich amount of spectral information contained in hyperspectral data should improve the level of discrimination of forest species and by the desire for a relatively simple method that can handle the large number of spectral bands in hyperspectral data while tolerant of spectral noise.  Data reduction will be carried out via nonparametric techniques such as spline fitting and penalized discriminant analysis (PDA) for interpretation and classification purposes. Model selection criteria derived from the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle will be investigated as both general model selection tools and criteria for spline knots selection and band selection for data reduction based on curve data.  Spatial PDA will be developed to classify hyperspectral images from airborne spectrometers to take into account the spatial dependence of pixels in the image.\r\n \r\nCorrect recognition of forest species is important in natural resource management, environmental protection, biodiversity and wildlife studies.  Conventionally reliable methods for tree species recognition depend mainly on inventory in the field or on interpretation of large-scale aerial photographs.  The use of these methods is frequently limited by cost and time and not applicable to large areas.  Digital remote sensing has been used to identify forest species of large areas, but two problems are encountered: different tree species often have similar spectral characteristics partly due to the lack of high spectral resolution and lack of large number of spectral bands; and the same tree species may have distinct spectral properties due to illumination conditions on which optical remote sensing is based.\r\n",
