 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds amounting to $80,000 are requested from the NSF ILI-LLD program in support of a 2-year project to incorporate rugged, field portable, pen-based computers in the sequence of field geology courses in order to modernize undergraduate instruction. The new pen-based mapping stations are about the size of a typical map board. But instead of using colored pencils to map, a stylus is used to select from a legend showing lithology, structural symbols, and faults. Global positioning systems (GPS) provide location data when necessary. A digital map is made directly in the field in real time eliminating the need for later scanning and editing using geographic information systems (GIS). At both UC Berkeley which is the lead institution and OSU at Corvallis which is the test site where Professor John Dilles is a Collaborating P.l., we have demonstrated long-term expertise in instruction of geologic mapping. We believe we can develop a new instructional program which can serve as a national model for mapping from basic field methods through advanced summer camp. Advanced electives (ore deposits, geomorphology and structural geology) will also benefit. Towards this end, we will develop a program which is transportable, adaptable, and adaptable at other institutions. By the end of the 2-year program, we will evaluate the program for ease of use, equipment maintenance, reliability, data management and completion of professional maps. An Advisory Panel will assist us to broaden the realm of users. National degree trends which indicate dramatic acceleration of students in bachelor's programs and increased enrollments in field classes coupled with the recent availability of integrated GPS-GIS systems with pen computer based software indicate that this is a timely endeavor. Therefore, adoption of this approach can serve national educational needs to more effectively integrate direct observations of geospatial phenomena with modern computing tools at the bachelors level. We also wish to develop effective demonst rations for the Middle School level. Towards this end we have designed a technology acquisition and training sequence which begins with purchasing and instructor testing of 2 alternative computer platforms, GPS and mapping software packages during the first year at UCB and OSU. After testing is complete, we will purchase the integrated system which proves to be most cost effective and implement it in teaching using about 18 pen-based field portable computers each with GPS units. We will develop, implement and refine full direct digital mapping capabilities. Pedagogically, instruction will begin with traditional mapping of geologic features using pencil and a paper copy of a topographic map. The students will then move to computer-based mapping also using a topographic base illustrated on the computer screen. With this revolutionary technology, which initial testing suggests that students can learn quickly for real-time mapping to solve diverse geologic field problems, the conversion from classical mapping to full on-site real time digital mapping is natural. It requires exactly the same analog eye-hand coordination skills we presently use in training students. Our plan of direct digital mapping in the field is an exciting advance over the past methods of map making which has involved taking paper maps back to the laboratory and spending weeks digitizing them to produce a digital map. Exploration and environmental industries are already using this type of GPS-GIS mapping technology and we must prepare students for these rapidly-developing career opportunities.",
