 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the use of physically secure coprocessors  and cryptographic techniques to solve the remote execution  problem.  This is exemplified by issues arising from mobile code,  e.g., active network capsules and mobile software agents that  autonomously move among servers.  The primary focus of this  project is on mobile agent systems.  Remote execution exemplifies  mutual distrust: not only must the servers be protected from  potentially malicious agents, but agents must also be protected  from potentially malicious servers.  This latter agent security  problem is much harder, since without a trusted computing base at  the serve (1) the agents have no guarantee that they will actually  run at all once they arrive there, and (2) agents cannot keep any  secrets (e.g., cryptographic keys) from the server.  The objective  of this work is to resolve the agent security problem and explore  the security engineering issues involved in building a mobile  agent system.  To achieve protection from hostile servers, this  project will explore using secure coprocessors to provide a secure  execution environment, a \"sanctuary\", within the server.  Additionally, cryptographic techniques such as Perfect Forward  Integrity and other new schemes will be developed to enhance the  security of agents when no sanctuary servers are available.",
