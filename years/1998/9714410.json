Under this Program, the National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Office of Naval Research are jointly evaluating and supporting research of high priority to the USWRP.  One of the primary goals of the USWRP is to perform the research necessary to improve track and intensity forecasts of hurricanes.\r\n\tIt has been known for some time that sensible and latent heat fluxes from the sea surface are the energy source for hurricanes.  Due to the difficulty, however, of obtaining data in the atmospheric boundary layer of a hurricane, data is scarce and the processes by which heat and moment fluxes occur are not well-known.  Under this award and in cooperation with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Principal Investigator will conduct field experiments designed to collect data in the boundary layer of hurricanes.  The experiments will concentrate on the inflow to the hurricane eyewall utilizing new high resolution dropwindsondes and sensors on a NOAA research aircraft that measure turbulent-scale fluxes.  The experiments will provide an estimate of the depth and the energy content of the inflow that fuels the eyewall which is one factor that affects the intensity of the hurricane; they will also provide estimates of the sensible and latent heat fluxes in the inflow layer.  Inflows with differing histories will be examined to determine how the inflow responds to passage over land, or warmer or cooler seas.  Real time information can also be transmitted to the National Hurricane Forecast Center appraising them of the likelihood of a change in the intensity of hurricane prior to landfall.  \r\n\tSuccessful completion of this research could lead to improved methods for predicting the intensity of hurricanes.\r\n***\r\n",
