Phenomena specific to nano-structural  materials that will be investigated include the quantum  confinement induced semimetal-to-semiconductor transition in  quantum wires, and phenomena associated with the one-dimensional  electronic density of states of carbon nanotubes. Special  nanostructural properties of specific materials, such as bismuth,  carbon nanotubes, MoS2, and unique forms of carbon, will be  investigated. A systematic study will be made of the electronic  structure of bismuth nanowires as a function of wire diameter,  crystalline orientation, temperature and magnetic field, with  particular attention to the semimetal-to-semiconductor transition  in small diameter (less than 100 nm) bismuth wires. A variety of  nano-transport and optical techniques will be used to measure the  properties of bismuth nanowires prepared by filling the pores of  anodic alumina under pressure, and structurally characterizing  the nano-wires by x-ray diffraction, TEM, and SEM techniques.  Optical studies will also be undertaken to study the electronic  structure of this 1-D system. A systematic study of the first and  second-order resonant Raman spectra of carbon nanotubes will be  carried out in an effort to gain more quantitative information of  the 1-D electronic structure of carbon nanotubes, and their  phonon dispersion relations. Experimental and theoretical studies  of the relation between microstructure/nanostructure and the  properties of novel carbon materials obtained by the heat  treatment of poly-para-phenylene (PPP) will be carried out to  explain why this system has such a high affinity for lithium,  with particular reference to the application of this material for  use in lithium ion batt eries.  %%%  This research will contribute basic materials science knowledge  at a fundamental level to important aspects of nanostructured  materials. The basic knowledge and understanding gained from the  research is expected to contribute to improving the performance  and stability of advanced materials by providing a fundamental  understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved  materials, and materials combinations from nanostructure building  blocks.  An important feature of the program is the integration  of research and education through the training of students in  fundamental materials science and related technological areas.  ***",
