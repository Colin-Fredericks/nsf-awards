 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 97-34350  MEL       Neurons, the computing cells of the brain, typically possess  extensive, highly branched tree-like structures called dendrites  onto which tens of thousands of input connections from other  neurons are formed.  In contrast to the classical conception that  the brain's computation power lies primarily in the \"neural  network\", i.e. in the richly interconnected network of nerve  cells, evolving understanding over the last 40 years and including  modeling work in Dr. Mel's laboratory, among several others, has  established that computations carried out within the dendritic  trees of individual neurons can contribute in significant ways to  the computing functions of neural tissue.  One of the important  principles to emerge from this modeling work is that different  computations may be carried out simultaneously in different  \"subunits\" of  the dendritic tree, which could dramatically  increase the computational capacities of individual nerve cells.  A second principle is that the learning and memory may involve  changes not only in the absolute potency of cell-to-cell  connectivity but in the spatial arrangements of input connections  onto the dendrites of individual neurons as well.    Whether parallel subunit computations actually occur within the  dendrites of real neurons remains to be determined.  However, the  design of experiments to answer these questions is complicated by  the fact that the measured physiological responses of neurons can  be due to either to internal operations of individual cells or the  combined effects of networks of cells.  In this work, Dr. Mel and  his colleagues will model the roles and interaction of single-  neuron computations and those carried out by the embedded network  of interconnected neurons, in order to guide experimental  approaches relating to critical questions of neural processing.",
