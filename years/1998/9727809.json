 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9727809  Moon  The goal of this project is to develop a low dimensional mathematical model based on experimental observation and to use chaos control techniques to quench the subcritical nature of the chatter. The research will use experimental and mathematical methods to obtain nonlinear models for tool vibration, including the effects of tool motion, velocity and thermal effects.  The unique feature of this research project is the use of concepts of chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics in developing new tool chatter diagnostics as well as chaos control techniques to quench chatter behavior in cutting dynamics. Further evidence will be gathered for a theory in an earlier research which indicates that chaotic dynamics is present in normal or non-chatter cutting of metals. As part of the nonlinear modeling, methods will be developed to predict and avoid subcritical chatter behavior. Basic mechanics of thermoplasticity and fracture mechanics will be incorporated in the model development. Partnership with both machine tool users and manufacturers will be sought.  The research will develop a new understanding about nonlinear cutting dynamics, which will likely result in new tool design methods for industry. It may result in mathematical tools which help manufacturers predict, avoid or control tool vibrations in cutting of metals and nonmetals to improve surface quality.",
