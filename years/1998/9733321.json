 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Seth N. Brown, Department of Chemistry, University of Notre Dame, is   supported by a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award from the   Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program.    Trimetallic complexes with coordinatively unsaturated titanium centers,   each capable of acing as a one-electron reductant, will be synthesized   using a variety of targeted ligands, possessing amine or hydroxyl   moieties, as templates.  The ability of tri-titanium clusters to abstract   atoms from small molecules, forming capped-clusters, via reductive   cleavage will be examined.  Additionally, an undergraduate experimental   laboratory course will be designed and introduced into the curriculum as   a vehicle to teach students about model-building.  The goal of the course   is to develop good experimental design skills in undergraduates.  The reduction of oxygen or nitrogen is a key step in the use of these   titanium-containing molecules by biological systems or in industrial   processes.   The proposed studies will provide additional insight into   topics ranging from the biological production of ammonia to surface   catalyzed reactions.  The education component of this project will   examine new approaches in undergraduate chemistry education.",
