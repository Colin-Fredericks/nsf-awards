 "awd_abstract_narration": "9873589 Theis The objective of this research is to develop a thermodynamic basis for life-cycle-analysis (LCA) that overcomes several of the obstacles that currently limit its applicability to problems of industrial ecology and to provide a theoretical framework for quantifying the potential environmental impact of industrial systems.  This research will utilize the concept of exergy, which combines the first and second laws of thermodynamics, to track material and energy resource demands, to identify the potential for reuse and reclamation of waste products, and to estimate the environmental burden of a specific real-world semiconductor manufacturing process. Finely, a computer model of the manufacturing process will be constructed to create a 'virtual laboratory' wherein various alternatives or scenarios can be tested systematically.  It is anticipated that this research will realize the seminal vision of industrial ecology wherein industrial systems can be optimized for material and energy demands and while being designed for minimal environmental impact.  It will develop a new analytical tool with a sound scientific basis that can be applied to an industrial ecosystem, a single facility or a single process.  It will test the efficacy of this approach on a real semiconductor manufacturing process and generate recommendations for improvement within the context of industrial ecology.  This grant is made pursuant to the joint NSF/Lucent Technologies Industrial Ecology Research Fellowships Program 1998.\r\n***\r\n",
