 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733207  Kang  Protein C (PC) is an important blood plasma protein which  prevents unwanted clots and also dissolves formed clots in  the human body.  With PC deficiency, either by hereditary or  acquired, the human body can encounter serious medical  complications due to blood  coagulation that can lead to embolisms that injure lung,  heart, and brain tissue, and can cause death.  A practical,  clinical PC biosensor for the diagnosis of PC deficiency  should have the attributes of high sensitivity, high  specificity, and real-time measurement.  The proposed  mechanism depends on a highly specific antigen-antibody  reaction.  It involves binding antibodies at the surface of  an optical fiber, injection of the sample into a micro  chamber (300 micro liter) encasing the fiber, reacting light  emitting secondary antibodies with the absorbed PC molecules  on the fiber, and quantifying the PC concentration by the  emitted light intensity.  It is proposed to apply total  quality management (TQM) concepts in both graduate and  undergraduate bioengineering education and research.  This  project emphasizes the structured team approach to bring  together basic scientists, bioengineers (biomedical and  bioprocess engineers), clinicians, business, and legal  professionals to address optimum process development for the  production of the best bioproduct at minimum cost.  ***",
