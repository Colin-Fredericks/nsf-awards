 "awd_abstract_narration": "McHale is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program for   studies to elucidate solvent dynamical influences on the optical spectra   of solvatochromic molecules.  The program includes (1) measuring   absorption, emission, and resonance Raman spectra in low-temperature   glass, in order to isolate the intramolecular contribution to the   linewidth, (2) employing solvent isotopomers to isolate solvent dynamical   effects on absorption, emission, and resonance Raman spectra in room   temperature solvents, and (3) determining fluorescence yields and   lifetimes as a function of solvent isotopic substitution in order to   obtain radiative and nonradiative decay rates in glass and liquid phase   solutions.  These strategies will enable the extraction of the   solvent-induced dephasing function, and hence the solvent spectral   density.  Issues to be addressed include the sensitivity of radiative and   nonradiative relaxation rates to solvent isotopomer, the validity of   treating solvent response as independent of the solute electronic state,   the possible dependence of solvent-induced electronic dephasing on   vibrational mode, and the role of solvent intramolecular modes in   electronic dephasing.   Molecules dissolved in liquid solvents exhibit behaviors that are much   affected by the solvent molecules in the surrounding environment.  These   interactions are complex and still not understood well at this time.    Results from this project will help to bridge the gap  between   theoretical predictions and real systems in understanding solution   dynamics.  Fundamental insights from this work could improve both the   description of electron transfer processes relevant to biochemistry and   the molecular models for nonlinear optical properties relevant to   materials science.",
