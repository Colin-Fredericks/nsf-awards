 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Proposal DMS-9803493  Principal Investigators: Leon Simon and Brian White    Leon Simon proposes to pursue various questions related to the  structure of the singular sets of minimal submanifolds and energy  minimizing maps, including the extension of his recent work on  smoothness of the singular set of area minimizing submanifolds to  higher dimensions and to other classes of submanifolds.  Specifically,  he is proposing to consider the question of whether the  top-dimensional part of the singular set locally lies in a finite  union of smooth submanifolds, which he has recently established for 3  and 4 dimensional mod-2 minimizing submanifolds in codimension 2.  Simon also proposes to continue his efforts to develop methods for  generating examples of singular sets, and to pursue several questions  related to asymptotics on approach to singularities.  In addition he  proposes to study questions related to the structure of the branching  set of energy minimizing maps.  Brian White plans to study how  regularity properties and singular structure for minimizing chains  with coefficients in a metric group depend on the group and its  metric.  This includes study of immiscible fluid interfaces as a  special case.  He also plans to investigate singularities in the  mean-curvature flow and in a related hyperbolic flow that should more  accurately model the dynamics of real soap films.  He will also  continue his investigations of branch points in 2 dimensional minimal  surfaces.    An understanding of singularities, and how singularities are formed,  is a fundamental element in the overall understanding of many physical  and geometric phenomena.  For example, in cosmology singularities of  space-time (e.g.  \"black holes\") play a fundamental role.  Likewise in  the study of the \"canonical\" objects which arise naturally in topology  and geometry, the understanding of singularities is absolutely  fundamental.  As with most non-linear phenomena, there is no single  well ordered theory which a pplies in a wide range of different  contexts.  Rather, each different context has its own collection of  effective techniques, and it is the development and application of  such techniques in the context of the geometric calculus of variations  which is the focus of the present research proposal.  Specifically,  Simon and White propose to continue their efforts toward a complete  understanding of singularities, and how they are formed, in the  context of area minimizing submanifolds and energy minimizing maps.  Such techniques are likely to be applicable to the study of other  objects of geometric and physical significance---for example to the  study of immiscible fluid interfaces, soap-films, and the equilibrium  free surfaces of fluids.",
