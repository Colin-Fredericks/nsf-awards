 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal: DMS-9801091  Principal Investigator: Mei-Chi Shaw    Abstract: Shaw plans to continue her investigation of partial differential equations that arise in the theory of functions of several complex variables. In particular, the regularity of the Cauchy-Riemann equations on Lipschitz domains and function theory on such domains will be studied. This work represents a natural extension of recent progress on the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems on Lipschitz domains to boundary value problems that are not coercive. Harmonic analysis and a priori estimates will be used in order to obtain the optimal regularity property of the solution. Related problems on the boundary behaviour of holomorphic functions on Lipschitz domains, zeros of holomorphic functions, and Bergman projection on non-smooth domains will also be studied. In addition, Shaw intends to continue her research on the tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations, including such topics as the regularity of the solutions and embedding problems for abstract CR structures. Boundary regularity problems for sum- of-squares operators and other subelliptic operators constitute a third focal point of the project.     Motivated by such fundamental physical problems as the conduction of heat through a solid medium, the classical Dirichlet and Neumann problems have for almost two centuries been central to the study of analysis. Through the use of technical tools like potential theory, Schauder estimates, and singular integral theory, these problems have now become quite well understood in the case of a domain with smooth boundary. The extension of this understanding to the setting where the boundary is not necessarily smooth, a situation encountered more and more frequently in applications of several complex variables to problems in physics and engineering, has been an active area of recent research. In fact, novel approaches employing geometric measure theory, Schauder estimates with non-smooth coefficients, and harmonic measure have been em ployed to tackle these problems, a process that has led to the development of many new fields and methods. Within the last thirty years very precise results have been obtained concerning elliptic boundary value problems for domains that are not smooth, but have so-called \"Lipschitz boundaries.\" The Neumann problem for the Cauchy-Riemann complex presents the next great challenge in this area. Not only will it be interesting from the point of view of partial differential equations, but it will also have many applications in the function theory of several complex variables - and beyond. The problem will be solved, however, only with the injection of significant new ideas.",
