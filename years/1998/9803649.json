Its   applications  include biochemistry, computational biology, computer  science, engineering, finance,  physics, seismology, traditional   statistics, etc.  The primary objective of this research, as motivated  by various applications encountered by the PI, is on designing  and  analyzing new Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The  research  plan includes three related  projects, all concentrating on the MCMC   methodology. The first project proposes two new hybrid Monte Carlo   methods. These methods  combine a gradient-type move, or a conjugate   direction-type move, with Metropolis algorithm. The new methods aim at   alleviating slow-mixing behavior (or ``stickiness'') observed in   discretized Langevin diffusion and molecular dynamics, and  can be  applied to simulating  images, predicting protein structures, neural  network training and other continuous-optimization problems. The  second project focuses on generalizing the multigrid Monte Carlo  (MGMC) method used by physicists in computations of lattice field  theories. Our preliminary work reveals a close connection between the  MGMC and the reparameterization method in statistics literature. The  generalized  MGMC proposed in this project unifies these seemingly  different methods and provide a generic approach to the search of  more efficient MCMC schemes. Its use in random effects model and  probit model is currently under investigation and  its applications  in  Bayesian image analysis, such as pattern synthesis and  image  smoothing, will be explored. The third part of the proposal is  concerned with theoretical  analyses of the dynamic weighting method  recently proposed by Wong and Liang (1997). As shown by the authors,  the method has tremendous potential in various  optimization  problems, such as the traveling salesman problem, circuit  partitioning problem, neural network training, and Bayesian model  selection.  A few variations of the dynamic weighting are suggested  and a functional analysis method is outlined for studying   convergence  properties and weight behavior of the DW.    It has long been recognized that many complicated systems, such as   reactions in atomic bombs, fluid dynamics, molecular movements,  etc., can be studied via computer simulation.  One of the most  popular approach of this sort, the Monte Carlo technique,  simulates a complex system described by probability distributions.  The technique was named after the famed gambling resort  because  its procedures incorporate the element of chance. In the recent two  decades, people come to realize that Monte Carlo techniques is also  applicable to a much wider class of problems including global  optimizations, statistical inferences, signal processing, target   tracking, artificial intelligence, financial modeling,  computational biology, data mining, and many others. The PI has  successfully applied Monte Carlo techniques, together with  suitable statistical models, to the understanding of  relationship  between remotely related DNA or protein sequences; to dynamic  system updating (such as target tracking); to neural network  training; and to Bayesian statistical inference.  This project   targets at developing more efficient Monte Carlo methods for  dealing with challenging computational problems, such as  prediction of the 3-D structure of a protein molecule from its  primary sequence. A common feature of all Monte Carlo methods  for simulating complex systems is that they rely on cumulative  evolutions of small, albeit random, local changes.  This often  leads to a very slow-converging algorithm. For example, because   of s uch local moves, with currently available methods one needs  years of super-computer time in order to simulate one tenth of a  second of movement of a protein molecule. The PI outlines a  general method to conduct global moves in Monte Carlo methods;  proposes to incorporate ideas in optimization literature (i.e.,  gradient and conjugate direction methods) to speed up Monte Carlo  simulations; and suggests avenues for the theoretical   understanding of several new and promising Monte Carlo methods.  Success of this  research will benefit scientists and engineers  in coping with their computational challenges.",
