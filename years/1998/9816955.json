 "awd_abstract_narration": "It funds a Grantees' Workshop for the Computation and Social Systems (CSS) program, which supports research on computing and communications in groups, organizations, social communities, markets and society.  The program's grantees have focused on two streams of research.  One is on the integration, sustainable use, and impacts of information technology; the other is on theories and technologies for reasoning, decisionmaking, integration, communication and collaboration. The workshop examines problems, issues and opportunities related to the evolution of CSS research community and the CSS Program's place in NSF and in the larger research world.  It convenes active researchers from CSS-related disciplines to focus on significant issues facing the CSS community, help institutionalize CSS research by building on previous CSS and related workshops, and communicate the research goals, results and key activities of the CSS community.  The workshop uses small groups to develop specific objectives, and plenary sessions for delivering group reports and reaching consensus on issues dealt with by the small groups. The planning committee and selected participants prepare individual chapters of the final report to be circulated electronically for review, and then published for distribution along with an executive summary and executive presentation slides.   http://www.ics.uci.edu/~king/css.html",
