The\r\n     collaborative is centered at Florida A&M University and includes over twenty\r\n     institutions representing many of the state's research universities, four-year\r\n     colleges, and community colleges.\r\n\r\n     These institutions include Florida State University, the University of\r\n     Florida, University of South Florida, University of North Florida. the\r\n     University of West Florida, the University of Central Florida, Florida\r\n     International University, Bethune-Cookman College, Tallahassee Community\r\n     College, Miami-Dade Community College, and Florida Community College at\r\n     Jacksonville.  In addition, area school districts and educational organizations\r\n     which support the preparation of mathematics and science teachers support\r\n     the major components of this project.\r\n\r\n     This inititative focuses on aggessive recruitment of students to teaching\r\n     careers, and improvements in pre-service and in-service education.  Program\r\n     goals are:\r\n\r\n     o increase significantly the number of high-achieving high school graduates who\r\n     enroll in and receive baccalaureate degrees from science, or mathematics\r\n     teacher education program;\r\n\r\n     o establish an effective community of SMET faculty from participating\r\n     institutions, and work towards increasing the frequency and effectiveness of\r\n     communication among these faculty and participating teachers and students;\r\n\r\n     o implement of develop a core of mathematics and science courses for\r\n     pre-service teachers that are inquiry-based and taught in cooperative learning\r\n     environments; and\r\n\r\n     o create a model of teacher training that also incorporates summer mentoring of\r\n     FCETP students and early sustained classroom experiences.\r\n\r\n     The FCETP Project is being evaluated by an external evaluator with assistance from FCETP staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
