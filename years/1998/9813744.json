 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to explore the  applicability of advanced signal processing techniques to  certain problems arising in natural language text  processing. Specifically, we seek to evaluate the  effectiveness of using multiple hypothesis tracking  concepts, originally developed for radar target tracking  applications, to the problem of correlating text-based  messages over time.  A key concept in this project involves  treating a natural language message or statement as a sensor  report. Such a text message, M, is regarded as a random  variable that is related to the underlying truth of a  system's state, S, through joint and conditional  probabilities, p(M|S), p(S|M), and p(S, M). For example,  p(S|M) is the probability that the true system state is S  given that an observation, M in text form, has been  reported. The tracking problem is to estimate the most  likely sequence of states Stl, St2, ..., Stk given a  sequence of text-based observations, Mtl, Mt2,..., Mtk, of  those unknown states. Formulated as a maximum likelihood  estimation problem, this can be solved using standard  recursive estimation methods including Viterbi's algorithm.",
