 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal, we address a need for modern, major instrumentation by seeking a used research grade scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis system and related sample preparation equipment. The SEM will be used to significantly improve laboratory instruction in the Earth Science and Biology programs, and to expand opportunities for student research. Another common goal in Earth Science and Biology is to expose introductory students to a sophisticated technique that will allow them to investigate geological and biological materials at a scale not commonly available in introductory courses. This is expected to capture their interest, and help excite them about the sciences. The high magnification, excellent resolution, and EDX capabilities of the SEM will allow us to incorporate research-based investigations into a wide range of upper-level courses. In Earth Science, students will be able to deal with the mineralogy and textures of fine-grained geological samples (mineralogy, petrology, sedimentation-stratigraphy, and soils), and characterize the morphology and surfaces of microfossils and grains (paleontology and geochemistry). The EDX system will allow in-situ chemical analysis of minerals (mineralogy and petrology). With the ability to study these small-scale features, students will better understand textural and compositional characteristics of geological materials, and improve their problem solving skills as they interpret important geologic processes. In Biology, students will be able to study plant tissue morphology at the cellular level in plant anatomy and physiology courses, which will have important applications as part of studies at both the organismal and sub-cellular levels. This provides an important bridge between two rather different levels of biological work. In Earth Science and Biology, use of the SEM will improve students' understanding of important concepts by allowing them to investigate them first-hand. Of equal importance, stud ents will be more excited about (and better prepared for) becoming involved in significant independent research.",
