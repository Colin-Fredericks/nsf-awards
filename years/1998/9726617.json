 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726617  Minear    This award supports a three year collaborative research  project between Professor Roger Minear of the University of  Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and Professor Saburo Matsui of  Kyoto University in Japan.  The researchers will undertake a  study of novel characterization of humic substances and  their role in the behavior of environmental toxic  substances.  The underlying hypothesis of the overall  research effort is that natural organic matter, and humic  substances as a subset, affect the environmental toxicology  of anthropogenic compounds through complex interactions that  can affect membrane transport and mechanisms of  toxicological reactions.  Following separation by membrane  fractionation and employing size exclusion columns and other  partitioning principles, samples will be analyzed using high  performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) interfaced with  tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). This work should advance  knowledge about humic substances and their combination with  selected environmental contaminants.    It is anticipated that characterization of molecular weight  and fragmentation patterns will be obtained at a level  leading to information regarding actual molecular weights  not previously available.  The goal is to develop new  processes to enhance the identification of the specific  molecular structure of humic materials.  This project brings  together the efforts of two laboratories that have  complementary expertise, research capabilities and  equipment.   The University of Illinois brings expertise in  the isolation and concentration of natural organic matter  and humic substances plus new approaches to the cooperative  research endeavor.  The Japanese researchers have an ongoing  research effort on the study of micropollutant effects in  Lake Biwa, the largest fresh water body in Japan that isof  great economic importance to several major cities including  Osaka and Kyoto.  Recent acquisition of major equipment,  along with the state-of the-art analytic al capabilities of  researchers at Kyoto University, will offer opportunities  for advanced studies of drinking water research and advanced  toxicological techniques.   Through the exchange of ideas  and technology, this project will broaden our base of  basic  knowledge and promote international understanding and  cooperation.  ***",
