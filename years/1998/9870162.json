 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    NSF Proposal: DMS 9870162  Principal Investigator: Leslie D. Saper    This project deals with the cohomology of noncompact locally symmetric  spaces.  In previous work, the investigator developed a micro-local  analogue of purity on compactifications of locally symmetric spaces  and used this to prove Rapoport's conjecture.  In the current project,  the investigator will apply this purity theory to study the relation  between the cohomology of a locally symmetric space and the cohomology  of its boundary strata.  One tool will be a weight spectral sequence  developed by the investigator which is based on the Langlands's  partition.  The objective is to understand from a more geometric  viewpoint the construction of cohomology using Eisenstein series and  the relation with L-functions.    Locally symmetric spaces occur naturally in many areas of mathematics  and theoretical physics, in particular, geometry and number theory.  In their most basic forms, geometry and number theory are considered  in high school:  the study of plane figures and the study of the whole  numbers.  These are two of the oldest fields in mathematics.  In the  modern perspective, geometry and number theory become intertwined as  part of the Langlands's program, the scene of some of the most  exciting current research of the past quarter-century.  Applications  of geometry and number theory abound, in particular in coding theory,  computing, and the study of symmetry of crystals, materials, and  biological structures.",
