 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry and the Atomic, Molecular and Optical  Physics Programs support William C. Stwalley of the Physics Department at  the University of Connecticut in his continuing spectroscopic studies of  diatomic molecules at long range.  In this effort, Prof. Stwalley will  collaborate with Prof. Phillip L. Gould, an expert in collisions of  ultracold atoms.  They will investigate the high-resolution  photoassociative spectroscopy of ultracold alkali atoms using all optical  multiple resonance spectroscopies.  Emphasis will be on highly excited  states of alkali metal diatomics (e.g., potassium or cesium dimers), but  Stwalley and Gould will also attempt to observe photoassociation of  atom-molecules such as Cs-H2.   Molecules at long range are molecules in which the atoms are separated by   very large distances, yet attractive forces are still strong enough to  maintain a `molecular` nature.  Such molecules are of great current   interest,  partly because new effects show up which will extend our   knowledge of molecular potential curves, partly because of their   relevance to the work in laser cooling and trapping and Bose-Einstein   condensation.  The studies that will be carried out in this new   collaborative effort will greatly increase our understanding of chemical   bonding by revealing the subtle forces that act to attract and `congeal`   atoms separated by large internuclear distances.  Successful completion   of these studies will furnish highly detailed information on interatomic   forces which, in turn, are of fundamental importance to our understanding   of atomic collisions and the assembly of atoms into higher states of   aggregation ranging from molecules, to clusters, and on to condensed   phases.",
