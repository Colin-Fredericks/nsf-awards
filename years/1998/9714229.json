 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the preparation of fluorine containing   molecules from monofluoro subunits.  The subunits under investigation are   fluorobutenolides, fluorodienes and fluorovinyl sulfoxides.  The   fluorobutenolide research probes the potential of the subunits for the   synthesis of fluoronucleosides and 2-fluor- and 3-fluor-butenolides.  The   fluorodiene study stresses Diels-Alder methodology and polymerization   reactions and the fluorovinyl sulfoxides provide entry into a variety of   fluorovinyl systems.  It is anticipated that a total of twenty five   undergraduate and masters level students will take part in the research.   With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic   and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr.   Timothy B. Patrick in the Department of Chemistry of Southern Illinois   University at Edwardsville.  With the help of undergraduate and masters   students,  professor Patrick will focus his work on designing and   developing new general synthetic methodology for the preparation of   complex carbon-fluorine molecules.  Molecules of this type have   interesting and useful biological properties.",
