 "awd_abstract_narration": "Menopause is universal, experienced by all women who live beyond middle age.  However, most research on menopause has been carried out in developed countries, e.g., the U.S. (Minnesota and Massachusetts), Canada, Western Europe (particularly the Netherlands), and Japan.  This research will examine variation in age and symptom experience at menopause in an urban population in Mexico.  Three very different neighborhoods in the city of Puebla will be randomly sampled to compare the experience of three groups of women, 200 participants each.  Variation in age at menopause will be examined in relation to a number of variables, such as smoking habits, recalled childhood nutrition, body size, and reproductive history.  Symptom experience at menopause will be examined in relation to such factors as breastfeeding practices, current diet, amount of leisure time, and access to health care.  Hot flash frequency will also be physiologically measured in a subset of women in a clinic setting to determine whether or not there are cross- cultural differences in sensitivity to hot flashes.  By examining menopause in an urban setting in Mexico, this study will provide important information to contrast with recent North American, European, and East Asian research on age and experience at menopause.  It is important to have comparative data from different countries and cultures on age and symptoms at menopause since we do not yet understand what aspects of menopause are universal (i.e., biological) and what aspects are influenced by culture.",
