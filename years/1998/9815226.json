 "awd_abstract_narration": "9815226  Howard   The work under this grant comprises two areas of investigation in the general   category of probability theory.  The first concerns rates of convergence (to an associated   asymptotic shape) and related properties of infinite geodesics in the context of certain   Euclidean first-passage percolation models (Euclidean FPP). Rigorous unconditional   results about infinite geodesics (time-minimizing paths) in the context of standard FPP are   quite sparse, largely due to technical difficulties associated with lattice effects.  Models of   Euclidean FPP take place on graphs constructed from a homogeneous Poisson process   and their statistical properties enjoy complete invariance under all rigid motions.  In this   sense, Euclidean models are a natural setting in which to study FPP geodesics.  The   second area concerns a host of problems arising from random walks on the integers where   some fixed but possibly random coloring, or \"scenery\", is assigned to the integers.  In this   context, a random walk on the integers produces a record of scenery \"observed\" along the   walk.  The issues under investigation concern, loosely speaking, what can be inferred   about the scenery by observing one such scenery record.  The difficulty stems from the   fact that one does not know the steps taken by the walk, only the scenery observed along   the walk.   Both areas of investigation involve stochastic processes associated with some type   of spatial structure.  While the focus of this research is the mathematical aspects of these   models, models of this general sort arise quite naturally in connection with a number of   interesting physical phenomena.  For example, the standard FPP model was first   introduced as a representation of fluid flow through a random porous medium such as an   aquifer or, on a smaller physical scale, a membrane.  There are also connections to other   aspects of materials science, including the formation and propagation of cracks.",
