Three  areas  are  represented.  First  is  the  role  of  fluctuations  in slow granular flows. Experiments will provide  precise  local  and  global measures of fluctuations in forces and in  kinematic  properties  of  static  and  slowly  sheared  ensembles  of  particles,  including both two- and three-dimensional configurations. The  goal  is  to  provide  a quantitative measure of the length and time  scales  for  these fluctuations, and to guide the development of models that include  the effects of fluctuations. Second is the characterization of granular  flows  in  the  inertial  regime characterized  by  binary  collisions.  Experiments  will  characterize the collective  dynamics  of  colliding  particles,  and  the  thermal-like  properties  of  ensembles  with   a  continuous  input of energy. Finally, experimental configurations  will  probe   gas   flow  in  fine  granular  materials,  with  an   eye   to  quantitatively  understanding  heaping  effects  for  shaken   granular  materials.   Granular   flows  of  all  types  are   highly   important  commercially, and this project is should contribute knowledge  that  is  technically  relevant, as provide excellent training for  students  and  post-docs in both fundamental and applied areas.  %%%  This   condensed   matter  physics  project  is   focused   on   better  understanding  the  flow  of  granular materials.  Such  materials  are  ubiquitous and include food grains, ore, coal, and pharmaceuticals,  to  name  only  a few. The processing of these materials is vital  to  many  industries, yet, there is not a solid scientific understanding  of  how  to  describe  these  materials. As a consequence,  processes  involving  granular processing typically operate at 2/3 of design efficiency,  and  catastrophic failures are frequent. This proje ct identifies three areas  of  study  that will provide deeper scientific understanding  with  the  potential for applications to commercial processes. For slowly  flowing  systems,  we  will characterize the nature of fluctuations,  which  are  known  to  be  large,  and therefore potentially destructive,  but  are  poorly  characterized. For rapidly stirred/shaken systems,  experiments  will  test  models based on the similarity of these systems to  a  gas.  Finally,  for  grains  that are small enough,  such  as  typical  sand,  cracking   catalyst,  or  powder,  ambient  air  flow   is   important.  Experiments   will  characterize  the  interplay  between   grain   and  surrounding  gas.  This  project  will also  provide  technical  career  training for one to two graduate students as well as training for post-  doctoral researchers and undergraduates.  ***",
