Life cycles may be simple, like those exhibited by most conspicuous animals; birds and mammals that at hatching or birth, resemble their parents in most regards save for size and proportion. However, most animals (insects and other invertebrates) have complex life cycles, where there are at least two radically different phases of life (for example, moths and butterflies that begin life as wingless, soft-bodied caterpillars). The overwhelming majority of organisms have a single life cycle, be it simple or complex. The mole salamander (Ambystoma talpoideum) is an exception to this general rule. Many individuals exhibit complex life cycles, which is common among amphibians. They begin life as aquatic larvae then undergo a  transformation (metamorphosis) to become terrestrial adults. Some individuals, however, are able to skip the transition from the aquatic larval stage to the terrestrial adult stage and instead become aquatic adults. Although it is known that the propensity for an individual to adopt one or the other of these life history pathways is determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, the relative contribution of these is not well understood. The proposed research investigates the underlying causes of this life cycle polymorphism using experimental techniques. The results will be interpreted in light of both the short-term  (individual) and long-term (population) effects of alternative life history pathways.\r\n",
