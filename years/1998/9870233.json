 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870233  Rosenberg    The terrestrial mollusk and millipede faunas of Jamaica will be intensively  sampled, along with other soil and leaf litter invertebrates. About 550  described species of snails and slugs are recorded from Jamaica, of which  505 (92%) are endemic, occurring nowhere else in the world. About 52  described species of millipedes are recorded, of which 48 (92%) are endemic.  The mollusk fauna of Jamaica is as diverse as any in the world, and it is  largely extant, unlike the mostly extinct terrestrial mollusk faunas of  oceanic islands in the Pacific. Although less than 20% of the original  forest cover of Jamaica remains, and deforestation continues, patches of  forest survive in many areas too rugged for agriculture, and secondary  forest has also grown in many abandoned plantations. Even among Jamaican  birds and reptiles, only a few species have gone extinct, so it may still be  possible to sample a large portion of the island's original invertebrate  fauna; however, the window of opportunity is rapidly disappearing.   Collections resulting from this research should at least double the  millipede fauna and increase the mollusk fauna by around 25%. Other  invertebrates will be made available to specialists who have agreed to study  Coleoptera (beetles), Orthoptera (crickets, cockroaches), Hymenoptera  (ants), Arachnida (spiders, scorpions, pseudoscorpions) and Onychophora  (peripatus). Residues from sorting will be preserved for further processing  for Acari (mites), Collembola (springtails), etc. The proposed research will  be the most extensive sampling of invertebrates ever performed in Jamaica,  with 180 field days over three years. Sampling methods will include hand  picking, leaf litter and soil sampling, and pitfall trapping. An estimated  1,000,000 specimens will be collected, including 14,000 lots of mollusks  (sorted to species) and 14,000 lots of arthropods (sorted more or less to  ordinal level). Hundreds of new species are likely to be discovered.   Knowledge of  species-level biodiversity and site-specific ecological data  will provide a baseline for future researchers studying systematics and  evolution, faunal distribution patterns, factors influencing diversity, and  conservation and restoration biology. Collection data for all material will  be published on WWW, as will distribution maps and identification guides for  all known species of Jamaican terrestrial mollusks, and lists of other  Jamaican terrestrial invertebrates.",
