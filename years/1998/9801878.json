 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9801878  Gould  Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are important in  many areas of science and engineering.  These subjects have  evolved especially rapidly during the recent past and should  be central to the undergraduate physics curriculum.  This  activity will define a core set of concepts and skills for  thermal physics and develop new curricular materials to  update and strengthen undergraduate instruction in this  area.  These materials will encourage more active student  involvement than do traditional textbooks and lectures, and  will include hypertext linked to tables of experimental and  simulation data, computer tools for the analysis of data,  templates for the writing of short computer programs to  enable students to go beyond idealized algebraic  calculations, and self-contained modules on contemporary  applications.  The proposed contributions include a reinvigoration of  classical thermodynamics, an increased emphasis on the  conceptual understanding of probability, entropy, maximum  work, and free energy, and the application of basic ideas in  thermodynamics and statistical mechanics to contemporary  problems.  These materials will be disseminated to the  physics community via a World Wide Web site, which will also  serve as a platform for the co-principal investigators to  help the physics community to continually improve their  thermal and statistical physics courses and to encourage  students to use the self-contained application modules.  They will also edit a special issue of the American Journal  of Physics devoted to thermal physics, give an AAPT  workshop, and organize a symposium on teaching thermal  physics.  ***",
