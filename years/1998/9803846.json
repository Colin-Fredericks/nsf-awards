 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to examine how different environmental conditions and the presence or absence of closely related species (sympatric congeners) affect the diet, activity, and ranging patterns of a small-bodied, leaf-eating (folivorous) primate, the gentle gray bamboo lemur  (Hapalemur griseus).  This will be accomplished by studying H. griseus at two research sites within Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar, which are five kilometers apart.  These two sites differ in altitude, degree of habitat degradation, forest composition, and the presence or absence of the two other species of bamboo lemur, the greater bamboo lemur (H. simus) and the golden bamboo lemur (H. aureus).  These factors may influence the diet, activity, and ranging patterns of H. griseus because the two sites differ in a) the amount and type of available resources and b) competition imposed by the larger, closely related species.  In addition, the length of this study  (15 months) will allow for the analysis of the seasonal changes in these behaviors.  Finally, chemical analyses of the plant parts ingested by H. griseus compared to those available at the two sites may provide clues as to whether environment or competition impose greater constraints on the ecology of this species.",
