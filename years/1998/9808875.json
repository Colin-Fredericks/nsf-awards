 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT              The ichthyological research collection of the Institute of Marine  Sciences/Gulf Coast Research Laboratory/University of Southern  Mississippi (IMS/GCRL/USM) will be improved through the processing of  its large backlog. The material to be incorporated includes important  baseline collections, samples drawn from major collections of  ichthyoplankton taken as part of long-term fishcries research and  conservatively estimated at over 2,100,000 specimens, as well as  collections obtained from a variety of previously funded ecological  surveys. Historically, the GCRL larval collection was maintained  separately to meet State mandates concerning ~sheries management.  However, with current expansion and reorganization of IMS programs  across campuses, incorporation of carefully selected larval materials  into the main collection is seen as an important objective. By  strengthening existing collections, IMS will be better positioned to  serve research and educational needs of coastal states of the northern  Gulf of Mexico and the south-central US and to facet new and  increasingly serious resource management challenges.         The project will take 3 years to complete and will provide  training for two graduate students and summer research opportunities  for undergraduate students. Training within IMS programs provides  exposure to interdisciplinary research, as well as the activities that  integrate academic research and resource management activity involving  multiple local, state, regional, and federal organizations. This work  will greatly enhance the collection for use by both professionals and  students. This activity will contribute to stemming the decline of  taxonomic expertise, and to enhancing the teaching of Systematic  Biology among 57 affiliate institutions, who regularly use GCRL Museum  facilities. It will also better position the GCRL Museum to work more  closely with state, regional, and federal management agencies, thereby  living  up to its mandate from the State of Mississippi to study and  disseminate specimens from the Guff of Mexico. Likewise, it will  increase the value of the USM collection, which is the premier  collection of Mississippi freshwater fishes in the state, to the  University's academic programs, to regulatory and management agencies,  and to scientists worldwide.              Additional shelving, cabinets, and equipment will facilitate use  of the  collections as part of USM's Marine and Biological Sciences  Biodiversity Program, thereby completing  remaining objectives of the second phase of a three-phase plan. When  fully cataloged, the combined ~  collection will rank among the 15 most important ichthyological  collections in the United States and  Canada.",
