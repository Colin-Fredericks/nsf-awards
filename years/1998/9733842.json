 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks to provide a new framework to support  distributed programs that access large amounts of data  stored across millions of servers.  The framework consists  of two parts: a set of extensible modules to provide basic  system services plus higher-level policies built on top of  these modules to coordinate distributed data access.  This  research leverages this framework in the context of four key  subsystems: (1) dynamic data replication to improve  performance, improve reliability, and reduce the need for  human management of storage, (2) extensible and scalable  data consistency to coordinate data access across multiple  nodes, (3) scalable location services for mobile objects to  track where objects are stored in the dynamic replication  framework, and (4) market-based distributed resource  management to balance large numbers of applications  competing for limited system resources.  The impact of this  research will be a better understanding of the fundamental  mechanisms required by large-scale data systems and a set of  techniques that will support new classes of data-intensive  applications in this challenging environment.  This project  also places a heavy emphasis on modernizing the teaching of  operating systems and distributed systems to give students  the skills and experience they need to understand and build  large-scale distributed systems.",
