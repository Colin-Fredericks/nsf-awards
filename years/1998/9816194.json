 "awd_abstract_narration": "The successful institutionalization of teacher preparation reform requires more than isolated course and curriculum reform. It is a systemic standards-based approach to the preparation of teachers that includes overarching state policies, campus support at all administrative levels, and a continuing evolving cross-disciplinary culture of reform. LaCEPT will promote activities, and campus support at two levels to cultivate these prerequisites for successful at institutionalization. The first is for university personnel to learn from exemplary sites; the second, to engage in presentations and other activities designed to engender the understanding and support of key campus administrators.    Louisiana's strengthened commitment to the reform of teacher preparation and undergraduate education is underscored by recent actions of the Legislature: creation and funding of TOPS and the BoR Center for Innovative Teaching and Learning (CITAL).    CITAL, which aims to promote reform in teacher education programs throughout the state,will function in several capacities: (1) as a clearinghouse to promote and disseminate the latest in education research, materials, and data about Louisiana teacher education; (2) as an agency to provide funds for targeted teacher preparation reforms; and (3) as an evaluator of existing teacher preparation programs. Four areas of concentration in teacher preparation were emphasized during 1997-98: (1) K-3 Reading and Mathematics; (2) Middle Grades; (3)Classroom Technology; and (4) Leadership Development.  Building on the TOPS program (II.B) and several pilot mentoring programs initiated under the CRPs, LaCEPT will cultivate further systemic support for preservice students and novice teachers. The continuing commitment of the Board of Regents, the Governor, and the Legislature provide the supportive context within which reform efforts on campuses will continue to expand and grow in vigor. With additional legislative funds expected the impact of CITAL will elevate visibility of th e reform effort at the campus level and among the public at large. Supplemental support from NSF, for both symbolic and material reasons, will help make certain that these developments occur.",
