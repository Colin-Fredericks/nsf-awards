 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803656  Spiel    The objective of this project is to further the understanding of the basic mechanisms by which aerosols are generated at the surface of the sea.  Earlier work in this area identified bursting bubbles as significant contributors to the aerosol flux from a disturbed sea surface. \"Film\" drops are produced when the bubble's cap breaks, rolls up into a rapidly advancing toroidal ring, and spews off bits of water via centrifugal forces. Jet drops are formed at a later stage, after the cap is gone, due to an upward thrust from the bottom of the now unstable cavity.   Recent results indicate the existence of an entirely new mechanism of sea surface aerosol generation. The drops that have been regarded as \"film\" drops, do not all originate directly from the film, but rather most come from splashes created by the impact of the film drops on the water's surface near the bubble's edge. These splash-induced droplets have been termed \"secondary\" film droplets, and are the subject of this investigation.    In a laboratory experiment, the spectrum of secondary film droplets will be measured as a function of bubble size. This requires the separation of the primary and secondary droplets. Secondary droplets are expected to be much smaller and have initial trajectories which should spatially separate the two groups. In a second series of experiments, devices will be designed to generate single droplets of a given size with any desired speed. Thus, the number of size of secondary droplets can be determined as a function of relevant parameters.",
