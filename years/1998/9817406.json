Since the early 1990s, NEEDS  the National Engineering Education Delivery System  has provided these services for the engineering education community.  Building on this base, this project will.  Develop a test-bed digital library for science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education (SMETE).  The library will provide courseware, cataloging, indexing, searching, and downloading to the science and mathematics communities. Initiate the development of a SMETE digital library community. Evaluate the test-bed library. Develop recommendations for the continued development of a SMETE digital library based on a needs assessment and test-bed evaluation.\r\n",
