The basis of the project will be to use the University of Washington's Physic by Inquiry approach supplemented by Real-time Physics and the CPU (Constructing Physics Understanding) program. Each summer 36 teachers will be enrolled in a three-week program. During the academic year project staff will aid in the implementation of the program by electronic communication and by biweekly seminars. Specially selected, experienced master teachers will mentor the participants and aid in the delivery of the program. In addition pre-service teachers will be selected to help with the project so that they will enter the teaching profession with background in teaching using the inquiry approach. A full evaluation program will assess teacher knowledge, the change in how the teacher teaches physics and student achievement.",
