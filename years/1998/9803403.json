More specifically, the project will address  index theory in presence of singularities (boundary, corners), in the  equivariant setting, ``secondary'' (as in secondary characteristic  classes) phenomena, calculation of the asymptotic density of  Bohr--Sommerfeld orbits, symplectic reduction of quantized Hamiltonian  actions and other applications of deformation quantization to  microlocal analysis and symplectic geometry.    Many important quantities which arise in mathematics and physics can  be naturally interpreted as numbers of (independent) solutions of  systems of partial differential equations.  The object of the project  is to find new formulas for such quantities as well as investigate  various relationships among them.  Differential equations are  mathematical models of physical phenomena which is why it is important  to be able to ``count'' their solutions.",
