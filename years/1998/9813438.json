Transcriptional regulation underlies critical aspects of cell behavior including proliferation, response to environmental signals, differentiation, and the development of multicellular organisms. This award provides partial funding for a summer FASEB conference entitled \"Transcriptional Regulation During Cell Growth and Development.\" The intent of this conference is to bring together researchers engaged in studying a broad range of transcriptional processes using different methodologies and biological systems. The goal is to provide an in-depth view of this rapidly expanding field so that experimental and conceptual advances in specific areas can be rapidly disseminated and applied to new problems. Each session of the conference groups together talks that focus on different approaches to key areas of research of gene regulation. The sessions are designed to provide an overview of recent advances in knowledge of fundamental mechanisms of transcriptional activation and repression, chromatin structure, long-range and epigenetic effects on gene expression, and their relationship to the biology of response to environmental signals, development, and cell-cycle control. The conference will underscore the important role that transcriptional regulation plays in normal differentiation and development. Transcriptional and biological regulatory mechanisms across a wide range of species (yeast, worms, flies, mammals) will be discussed so that the similarities and differences can be appreciated.  The conference will be held at Snowmass, Colorado, from July 25 through July 30, 1998. The meeting will include formal talks, informal poster sessions, discussion periods, and ample opportunity for interaction among the attending scientists. Attendees will include principal investigators, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students. The conference will provide an up-to-date and cost-effective overview o f one of the most fundamental and rapidly moving fields in biology and is expected to generate strategies for further research.",
