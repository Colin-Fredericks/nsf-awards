 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803374  Davis       About 50 years ago, Aleksandrov, Busemann and Wald introduced the  idea of defining upper and lower bounds for the ``curvature'' of more  general metric spaces than Riemannian manifolds.  Aleksandrov was  interested primarily in the case of nonnegative curvature and its  applications to convex polyhedral surfaces in Euclidean 3-space.  Interest  in this subject was renewed about ten years ago when Gromov pointed out  that for topological and group theoretic reasons the nonpositively curved  case was much more interesting than the positively curved case, the main  reason being that the universal cover of a nonpositively curved space is  contractible.  Gromov also pointed out that there were many polyhedral  examples of such spaces.  In particular, Tits buildings are such examples.  For the past several years, Professors Charney and Davis have collaborated  in investigating nonpositively curved polyhedra and applications to group  theory.  The groups in which they are primarily interested are Coxeter  groups and Artin groups.  Both types of groups are associated to groups  generated by reflections.  Both Charney and Davis have also accomplished  separate research in these areas.  They  will continue their research on  these areas as well as on closely related topics such as the properties  of Tits buildings and their automorphism groups.       Groups generated by reflections occur in many places in mathematics  and in nature (for example, in crystallogrophy).  The symmetry groups of  regular tilings of the Euclidean plane are such groups.  Escher's drawings  show examples of regular tilings in non-Euclidean plane geometry.  These  are also associated with reflection groups.  Professors Charney and Davis  are interested in such examples in a more abstract setting.  It turns out  that abstract reflection groups (Coxeter groups) can always be realized as  the symmetry groups of a space that is nonpositively curved, much as in the  case of the Euclidean and non-Euclidean planes.   ***",
