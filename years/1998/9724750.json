There he will work with Dr. Gerhard Woeginger in  the area of online algorithms.  Dr. Woeginger is well  respected as an expert in this area.  The proposed work will  find new solutions to several problems in online algorithms,  in particular, the problem of managing two-level memory for  paging, scheduling of machines, vector cover, and vector  packaging.  In addition to advancing the state of knowledge  in the field, the student's research in Austria will expose  him to new ways of attacking these problems, and allow him  to establish international collaborative partners.  It is  expected that the contacts made by the student will continue  to grow throughout the rest of his career.  ***",
