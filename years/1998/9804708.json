The rare \r\nbeta decay of the pi-meson (pion), occurring once in about 100 million \r\nordinary pion decays, provides a theoretically clean window to certain \r\nallowed extensions of the SM.  The PIBETA experiment, mounted at the Paul \r\nScherrer Institute, Switzerland, by an international collaboration of seven \r\ninstitutions led by the UVa group, aims to improve the present 4% accuracy \r\nof the pion beta decay rate by better than a factor of ten in a staged \r\napproach, in order to match the theoretical uncertainty and provide new \r\nconstraints on physics beyond the SM.  Measurements will begin in the summer \r\nof 1998 and will continue for several years.  PIBETA is the main effort of \r\nthe present research proposal.  Additional commitments of effort include \r\nwork on studies of nucleon and meson structure at Stanford (SLAC experiment \r\nE155) and Jefferson Lab (CLAS and RADPHI collaborations).  Lastly, this \r\ngroup's work on chiral symmetry breaking in the pion-pion and pion-nucleon \r\nsystems is being completed and published. (Chiral symmetry is the organizing \r\nprinciple in low-energy strong interactions.)  During the past four years \r\nthis program has resulted in two doctoral and one master's degree at UVa.  \r\nTwo more UVa Ph.D. degrees are expected in the next three years, plus three \r\nmore at collaborating universities stemming from the PIBETA project alone.  \r\nEach year typically one to two undergraduate students are engaged in \r\nresearch on this project, thus gaining practical laboratory experience.\r\n***\r\n",
