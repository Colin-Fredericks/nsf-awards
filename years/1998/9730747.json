 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses laboratory experimental methods to understand other-regarding behavior.  Much of contemporary theoretical modeling of social processes assumes that individuals are narrowly self-interested.  While this approach has generated interesting results in many areas, it tends to fail in social situations in which other-regarding behavior becomes important.  One environment, relying on `dictator experiments,` is exceptionally fruitful for analyzing the degree to which other-regarding interests matter.  Simply put, in a dictator experiment one subject is given the power to divide a pot of money -- taking some and giving some to a partner.  Under one set of experimental conditions, the `dictator` engages in an equal division of the money.  In another experimental condition the dictator takes everything and leaves nothing for the partner.  This project systematically manipulates the decision environment to introduce others into the decision process.  This research explores the extent to which the concern for others creeps into an individual's decision calculus.  This research touches on fundamental issues of fairness and equity.",
