 "awd_abstract_narration": "9730471  Dickey    Renewed support is provided for the Bermuda Testbed Mooring   (BTM) project.  The BTM project deploys and maintains for   community use, a deep-sea mooring which is available for   long-term testing of oceanographic sensors and systems. The   project is has three major complementary facets: 1)   technology development, 2) facilitation of the BTM for other   groups developing and testing new technologies, and 3)   scientific studies. The premise is that newly developed   technology and instrumentation should be synergistic with   scientific applications. Interdisciplinary time-series data   collected from the mooring may be compared, calibrated, and   interpreted using comprehensive shipboard data sets   routinely collected near the site. Many of the sensors and   systems developed and tested on the BTM will be suitable for   deployment on other platforms such as drifters, autonomous   underwater vehicles, and offshore structures. BTM is   deployed near the Bermuda Time Series (BATS) station, a site   that has been sampled continuously for over 15 years and   provides a rich historic data base at the location. The   mooring was first deployed in June, 1994 and has been used   by a variety of scientists since its first deployment, as   evidenced by numerous letters of support.    In addition to maintaining the mooring as a testbed   facility, two new instrument systems, SAFIRE and HiROS will   be tested. SAFIRE measures spectral fluorescence and   absorption and will be useful for optically characterizing   and discriminating particulate components and dissolved   organic constituents. The HiROS system will allow high   resolution characterization and quantification of inherent   optical properties. A new real-time data telemetry system   under development will be tested as well. The PIs will   continue to solicit new BTM users, to facilitate the usage   of the BTM for all investigators, and to provide baseline   interdisciplinary measurements.",
