 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vleck  9801503        Maternal effects describe the non-genetic component of the interaction  between mother and offspring characteristics. Eggs are an ideal system in  which to study maternal effects because investments made prior to hatching  can be measured directly and correlated with subsequent offspring  performance. In a population of wild birds studied in 1997, the egg size  from which an individual hatched explained a significant amount of the  variation in mortality among genetically related individuals during the  first two weeks after hatch. The amount of yolk remaining at hatch and yolk  testosterone are two maternal effects which may provide a mechanistic  understanding of the differences in survival between large and small  offspring. In project one the investigator will manipulate the amount of  yolk remaining at hatch and explore the effects of these yolk reserves on  hatchling growth, development and survival. In project two the investigator  will characterize yolk testosterone in eggs and correlate this with chick  performance after hatch using a fostering protocol. This fostering design  allows for the distinction between pre-hatching and post-hatching maternal  effects. Both projects provides for a powerful analysis of variation in  maternal effects and the subsequent consequences to offspring performance.",
