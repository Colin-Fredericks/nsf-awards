This study will examine the nature of statistics reform and the extent of its implementation, both within Mathematics and Statistics Departments as well as other Department that offer statistics courses.  All Mathematics and Statistics Departments and a sample of other Physical and Social Science will be surveyed to determine whether they have implemented statistics reform, and the types of reform included.  Based on these findings, a set of case studies will be carried out in Departments that have made a strong commitment to statistics reform to analyze the impact that the reform is having.",
