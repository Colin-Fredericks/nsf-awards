 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this a research is to investigate the impact of education policy in a federal system. It utilizes an already developed and successful theoretical model of state and local public finance to derive a computable model that is calibrated to data and extended to apply particularly to education. This model has the advantage that it allows for imperfect stratification of incomes across school districts, the use of various types of tax instruments, and the incorporation of many different kinds of fiscal between state and local governments. Thus, it can be calibrated to the kind of data commonly observed in the US. The model is then modified to make it particularly applicable to public education. Rather than focusing on any one input in the education production process, the model seeks to trace the impact of individual behavior by parents and school officials resulting from changes in incentives brought about by changes in state policies toward public education. In particular, the research focuses on the impact of state policies on school quality, and it defines school quality as an outcome of a process in which, in addition to per pupil spending, such factors as peer quality, parental characteristics, effort by teachers and parents and effective utilization of local information play a significant role. Given the link between a family's residence and its public school, the potential of state policies to impact migration choices by parents is particularly highlighted. This, combined with parental voting choices and the consideration of private school alternatives generates powerful general equilibrium forces that shape public schools but that are often ignored in policy analysis. Furthermore, informational asymmetries give rise to tensions between state and local control and allow for the introduction of competitive effects of increasing the choice set parents face.",
