The work is based on the recent finding that  such  an  array  behaves  as  a Josephson weak link. A  main  part  of  the  project  will investigate the physics associated with the various  Josephson effects in such arrays. The experiments will:  (1)  Map  out  the current-phase relation as a function of temperature  and  ambient  pressure,  (2)  Determine the  stability  of  metastable  states  of  non-zero quantum phase difference, (3) Determine  the  stability   of   metastable  state  of  non-zero  quantum   phase  difference,  (4) Look for phase mixing effects analogous  to  the  superconducting  Shapiro  effect, (5) Determine  the  dissipative  mechanism which exist a non-zero pressure head, and (6) Determine  the  effect  of flux trapping and textural structures within  and  near  the  aperture array. The second part of  the  project  will  focus  on detecting acoustic radiation associated with the  phase  slippage  when  He-4  passes through a submicron  size  aperture.  Techniques  to  detect the acoustic radiation will be  developed.  Subsequently,  the  acoustic spectrum will be  studied  to  learn  about  vortex  nucleation mechanisms and the Josephson  frequency  relation.  The project provides excellent training  for  graduate  students in both fundamental and experimental physics.  %%%  This  is  a  low  temperature physics  project  that  focuses  on  understanding  the  dynamic behavior  of  superfluids  that  pass  through very small apertures. In the case of superfluid He-3,  an  aperture  smaller  than  1/10,000,000  meter  forms  a  so-called  quantum weak link. When the superfluid is forced through  such  a  small  aperture,  instead of flowing in  one  direction  like  an  ordinary  liquid, the fluid surges back and forth at a  frequency  proportional  to  the  force   on  the  liquid.  These   Josephson  oscillations  indicate a sine-like relation  ship  between  fluid  current  and  quantum  mechanical phase difference.  The  planned  research  will  expand our understanding of the  consequences  of  this  relation.  In the case of superfluid He-4, theory  suggests  that   pressure  driven  flow  through  an  aperture  should   be  accompanied  by  a  sound  signal  at  the  so-called   Josephson  frequency. The sound spectrum will reflect the detail  of  vortex  nucleation  within the aperture. The relation between  the  sound  spectrum  and  the applied pressure head may lead  to  a  quantum  mechanical  pressure  standard. The  project  provides  excellent  training   for   graduate  students  in  both   fundamental   and  experimental physics.  ***",
