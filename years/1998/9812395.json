 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract             Ecologists at Colorado State University have been    studying  the shortgrass steppe ecosystem of eastern Colorado    intensively for many years. The current strong focus on the    shortgrass steppe represents the continuing development of a    research tradition that began in the late 1930's.   The major    goal for the broad scientific community studying the    shortgrass steppe ecosystems of northeastern Colorado is to    understand the processes that account for the origin,    maintenance and sustainability of shortgrass steppe    ecosystems.  Much of this research is centered around the    Colorado State University (CSU) field station located on the    CPER. in northeastern Colorado.                  The current CSU field station consists of the    headquarters area, a residence for the site manager and a    corral and pasture area of 53 ha. Three buildings are located    in the headquarters area: a dormitory, a storage/workshed    building, and an office/laboratory building. Essentially no    renovations or improvements have been made at the site since    it was built in the late 1960.                  The CSU field station is heavily utilized for research,    education, and public outreach. Eighteen research projects are    currently studying the shortgrass steppe and using the CSU    facilities at the CPER. Visiting scientists from 36    institutions nationally and internationally have conducted    research at this site in the last five years.  Each year ten    to fifteen classes in use the site several times each year for    instruction.  In addition, classes from the University of    Wyoming utilize the field station for research.                The  product  of  the  planning  process  will  be  a    comprehensive  master site plan. This plan will consist  of  an    extensive  long-term  research  and  education  plan  for   the    facility, a governance structure for the facility., a  detailed    description    of    the    physical     structures,    detailed    institutional/interagency     relationships,     roles      and    responsibilities,  a  long  term  maintenance  plan   for   the    facility, and detailed architectural and engineering plans  for    the facility.",
