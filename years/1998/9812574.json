On the  U.S. side, this investigation will focus on the development of an  active sensing diagnostic technique for identifying anomalies in  critical areas of structures.  On the Japanese side, a passive  sensing technique with distributed sensors for monitoring the  global response of the structures and for locating the critical  areas where anomalies might be present.    This research will involve the development of both the hardware  and software for the system.  The hardware development includes  the design and fabrication of the smart rebar for steel-  reinforced concrete structures.  The smart rebar will be made of  composite materials with a built-in network of sensors and  actuators.  Piezoelectric materials will be selected as both  sensors and actuators.  A built-in actuator would generate  desired diagnostic signals which are sensitive to a particular  type of anomaly or damage, and the neighboring sensors would  record the transmission and reflection of the signals.  The  difference in sensor measurements taken before and after the  introduction of an anomaly in the region will then be processed  to identify the presence of the anomaly.    The software will be developed to interpret the sensor  measurements.  The major focus of the development of the software  will concentrate on diagnostic signal generation by built-in  transducers, signal processing, and signal interpretation, thus  serving as the brain of the diagnostic technique.    Upon completion of the study, a prototype of a built-in active  sensing system will be developed.  Appropriate experiments will  be conducted for verifying the proposed techniques.  ***",
