With today's image processing computer workstations and PCs  equipped with high end graphics programs, virtual reality  technologies are capable of producing diagnostic quality  images of internal organs such as the colon, and provide a  sufficiently accurate depiction of the anatomy of the hip  for the surgeon to use in planning a patient-specific total  hip replacement procedure.    The  two examples noted above indicate the important  potential for the use of virtual reality technologies in  medicine, but additional engineering and computer science  research is needed to generate the knowledge required to  emulate human anatomical features in high resolution and  rapid 3D image reconstruction, full color, user-friendly,  and cost-effective systems.  These areas of research were  examined in the Virtual Reality in Medicine Workshop held as  a part of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics  Engineers (IEEE) Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society  conference October 30-November 2, 1997.  World class  investigators served as faculty for the workshop, presenting  state-of-the-art information about the important  technologies involved in virtual reality and indicating  areas where research is likely to lead to new performance  capabilities. Importantly, 13 engineering students  participated in the workshop and received at first hand  information that could influence them to enter this area of  engineering endeavor.    This award provides support for partial reimbursement of  travel expenses for the faculty.  ***",
