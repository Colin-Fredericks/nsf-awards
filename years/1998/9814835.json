 "awd_abstract_narration": "9814835  Sala  Since the early 1900's, fire exclusion and livestock grazing in the interior northwest have resulted in a successional replacement of open ponderosa pine and western larch stands with dense stands of interior Douglas-fir. Fire exclusion may seriously compromise our ability to preserve old-growth forests in the northern Rocky Mountains. The ecological implications of successional forest replacement include competitive stress on the older trees in old-growth remnant stands, poor regeneration of species other than Douglas-fir, and alteration of water, carbon and nitrogen cycles. Management consequences include increased fire hazard, increased susceptibility to pathogens and decreased forest health. The Intermountain Fire Sciences Laboratory of the US Forest Service is planning a project to restore old-growth fire-dependent ponderosa pine and larch. Several treatments will be applied to an old-growth remnant stand (ca 450 years) which has not burned in about 100 years: 1) control; 2) understory burn; 3) understory removal but no burn; 4) thinning of overstory and understory burn; and 5) thinning of overstory and understory removal. These treatments provide an extraordinary opportunity to experimentally assess changes in ecosystem properties due to fire suppression. The investigators will measure stand-level water use, wood production, foliage production, foliage nitrogen context, water use efficiency, and soil water availability in the five treatments before and after treatment application. Results will determine whether increases in stand density and canopy cover associated with fire suppression has resulted in an increased whole stand-level water use, but has decreased water used by old ponderosa pines and larches.",
