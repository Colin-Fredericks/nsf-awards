 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9710670  Kubacki     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project continues development of a multi-component deposition process, with focus on materials screening and development of organic donors to achieve required sensitivity and selectivity using safe materials which will integrate easily into semiconductor production facilities.  Multiple component cocktails will be investigated to optimize film properties and increase process latitude.  Phase I demonstrated a new class of highly photosensitive, sub 0.5 micron plasma deposited organosilicon resists.  These resists may be photo-oxidatively patterned and processed without removal from a vacuum processing environment, thereby reducing environmental exposure, using less material, using safer material, and creating less waste.  Image development may be delayed with no degradation and is accomplished by chlorine based reactive ion sketch (RIE) leaving a   robust, negative tone silicon dioxide (SiO2)-like etch mask that allows pattern transfer into underlying materials in a single RIE sequence   Relationships developed in Phase I will be strengthened and new alliances sought as will resources to market the equipment and process.  A demonstration vehicle will be selected and arrangements made  with device manufacturers to make one or more functional devices using the all dry processing.  This process has technical and economic benefits for integrated circuits (IC's), micro-machines, displays, modules, photo masks.  ***",
