 "awd_abstract_narration": "Silicon Valley is Santa Clara Valley, California, a site of many advances and accomplishments in the new industry of computer science and information technology.  This project studies how cultural models of work are applied to a variety of other domains, particularly home life, by examining the actions and values embedded in work processes, rationales, relationships and stories.  These `schemata` are placed into novel contexts such as home, education, commerce as well as transferred between diverse work organizations.  The researchers will study how this process occurs among people positioned differently throughout the Silicon Valley region.  The differences stem from a variety of factors such as ethnicity, class, work or profession, gender and age.  The study will investigate how technologies and economic structures and social organizations interact in peoples' daily lives.  Through the analysis of a set of 450 interviews with 150 informants, the researchers will advance our understanding of how involvement with the new information technology industry is affecting the non-work lives of workers, and vice versa.  This new knowledge will help planners as well as society at large understand the ongoing impact of computers in society.",
