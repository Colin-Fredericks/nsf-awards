 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Molecular Genetics of Bacteria and Phages Conference, traditionally held at Cold Spring Harbor and now being held alternate years at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, is a central forum for the presentation of new results in prokaryotic molecular genetics.  On the order of 200-400 participants attend, representing laboratories throughout the world, and most present either short talks or posters.  Its breadth makes it an important focus for the exchange of information in this era of scientific specialization.  Topics covered include fundamental work on bacterial replication, recombination repair, transposition, transcription, control of gene expression, translation, signaling, heat shock, protein folding and secretion, cell development and division, and pathogenesis.\r\nFor many graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, this is the first large meeting at which they have an opportunity to speak.  Due to its highly interactive nature, the meeting provides an important opportunity for these young scientists to meet and talk to the senior scientists they know from the literature.  Support is provided to allow the attendance of graduate students who might otherwise not be able to afford the costs of the conference.\r\n",
