 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tackling the Engineering Resources Shortage:  Creating New  Paradigms for Developing and Retaining Women Engineers is a  conference that brings together practicing engineers, managers,  policy makers, and educators to look at the retention of women in  engineering as an educational-to-career spanning continuum.  The  conference, July 14-18, 1998, at Club Tremblant near Montreal, aims  to achieve long-range retention, development, and success at the  professional level.  The objectives are:  to present and compare  best practices and research findings related to retention at all  levels; to identify institutional and cultural barriers to the  better retention of women engineers; to identify common interests  and areas for active collaboration and institutional change; to  identify and develop model programs for dissemination; to create  and promote new strategies and collaborations for participating  institutions, and to set a research agenda.         The conference makes a significant contribution to the  advancement of knowledge by bringing together engineering  professionals in industry and education who are in the position to  influence or implement effective strategies and policies affecting  long-term retention, but who are not necessarily familiar with the  existing research, literature, and practice outside of their  company or institutions.  Planning and the conference itself are  designed as iterative, collaborative processes to insure that  academic and industry voices and institutional requirements for  change and deliberation are addressed.  A professional evaluation  of the conference and conference outcomes will be undertaken.       Conferees will be in a unique position to actively disseminate  conference results as well as act on them.  Participants will  commit to return to their respective organizations with action  plans for internal change as well as for partnerships across  organizations.  Conference proceedings will be published and widely  disseminated to industry and  universities.",
