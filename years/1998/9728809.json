 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Prof. Jaan Laane of   Texas A&M University in his continuing studies of molecules with   large-amplitude vibrations.  He will use fluorescence excitation   spectroscopy, sensitized phosphorescence excitation spectroscopy and   two-photon spectroscopy with photon or ionization detection to map the   energy levels of the excited states.  He will focus on cyclic and   multicyclic carbonyl compounds and aromatic molecules, especially those   molecules with two chromophores and closely lying electronic states or   those molecules exhibiting interesting structural changes such as   photoracemization or photoisomerization.  Laane will also use dispersed   fluorescence and far-IR and Raman spectroscopies to obtain complementary   information on the ground state surfaces, and molecular mechanics (MM3)   and ab initio calculations to predict potential energy surfaces and   structures.    An improved understanding of electronic excited states is important for   providing a better perspective of photochemical and other important   chemical processes as well as on chemical bonding and structure in   general.  Determination of the potential energy surfaces for the excited   states will provide detailed insight into the energetics and interactions   associated with these states.  The experimental work to be carried out   here will provide the data necessary for calculating the potential energy   surfaces and will also further help improve our experimental procedures   for collecting this type of spectroscopic information.  Results on   molecules in triplet states or on molecules that undergo interesting   structural changes upon absorption should provide fundamental information   that has not been readily attained in the past.",
