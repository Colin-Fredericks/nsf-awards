This proposal seeks funds to support a  unique collaboration with Australian marine scientists to  investigate biogeochemical cycling in this oceanic region.  The prinicipal investigator, Professor Giacomo Di Tullio, of  the Department of Geology, University of Charleston, and his  counterpart, Dr. Peter N. Sedwick, of the Cooperative  Research Center for the Antarctic and Southern Ocean  Environment, University of Tasmania, will conduct and  interdisciplinary study of the physiological status and  response of the whole microbial community to growth  limitation by iron and major nutrients. Experiments will  examine the possibility that iron may control Si:N  utilization ratios by the biotas (including implications for  species dominance), heterotrophic/autotrophic competition  for iron, and iron and major nutrient effects on production  of the radiatively important gas dimethylsulfide (DMS) and  its precursor DMSP. The field program and research cruise on  the Australian vessel RSV Aurora Australis will involve  Australian, New Zealand, and French researchers as well as  the American researchers supported under this project.  Results will contribute to our understanding of factors  affecting global carbon cycling, and will further the  exchange of ideas and encourage cooperation between the  marine science communities of the United States, New  Zealand, France, and Australia.",
