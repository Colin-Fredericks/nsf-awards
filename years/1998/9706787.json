 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thieme  9706787       The investigator studies the interplay of population  structures and population development via mathematical models  consisting of partial differential equations, large systems of  ordinary differential equations, and of Volterra integral  equations.  The structures of interest are induced by internal  characteristics like (chronological or class) age, size, location  or/and by spatial or temporal heterogeneity.  For infectious  diseases that lead to permanent immunity, a model is developed  that allows arbitrary distributions for the lengths of the  various disease stages.  A time scale method is presented that  makes it possible to express the stability of the endemic  equilibrium in terms of the first three cumulants of the  durations of the disease stages.  Further, effects are  investigated that temporarily varying vaccination strategies  (including vaccines with only transient effects) have on seasonal  diseases (influenza).  Optimal treatment strategies are studied  for diseases with resistant strains in populations with core  groups (AIDS, tuberculosis).  As an important tool the  investigator extends the persistence theory for non-autonomous  dynamical systems.  In population ecology, strategies are  considered by which populations cope with spatial or temporal  heterogeneities of their habitats.  In particular, migration  strategies in structured metapopulations and adaptive strategies  like metamorphosis and cannibalism for populations in ephemeral  habitats are investigated that maximize the reproductive ratio.       In order to interpret, forecast, manage and control the  dynamics of microbial, plant, animal and human populations it is  necessary to understand the interaction between population  development and population and habitat structure (as given by age  or body size or by spatial and temporal heterogeneity).  The  investigator develops mathematical concepts and tools to  formulate and analyze appropriate models for this  interdependence.  Particular poi nts of interest are how population  and habitat structure affect stability, resilience, persistence  and extinction of populations.  In the area of infectious  diseases, mathematical models provide a suitable arena to study  various mechanisms that cause seasonal outbreaks (measles,  influenza) and to determine adaptive vaccination strategies that  deal with them in an effective way.  Further, in face of evasive  or resistant microbial strains (AIDS, tuberculosis), it is  possible to compare different disease treatment schedules for  populations with core groups.  As an important issue in  conservation biology, habitat fragmentation leads to the  formation of a patchy environment where local populations often  go extinct and are recolonized by individuals immigrating from  other local populations.  Structured metapopulation models  present a framework to identify the circumstances under which  gradual habitat deterioration leads to a sudden collapse of the  total population and, in turn, to determine critical thresholds  that must be met in order to successfully reintroduce populations  that have become extinct.",
