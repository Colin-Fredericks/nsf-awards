 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop novel interprocedural techniques for compiling scientific and engineering applications on distributed address space parallel machines.  With recent advances in parallel and supercomputing architectures, the application programmers have unprecedented computational power available. However, it has also become increasingly difficult to harness this power.  The parallelizing and  optimizing compilers usually turn out to be inadequate, since they restrict the analysis to a single procedure level. However, by developing a set of novel effective and efficient interprocedural techniques, the efficacy of the parallel compilers can be enhanced significantly, without significallty slowing the compilation process.  In message passing machines and distributed shares memory machines, the compilation process involves several complex tasks, including data distribution, locality management, placement of communication and/or synchronization, and aggregating remote memory accesses.  This project will develop new interprocedural techniques for performing these phases of analysis interprocedurally.",
