Kelberg of the \"Stolbi\" National Nature Reserve in Krasnoyarsk, Russia.  The PI and his graduate student plan to investigate the structure and dynamics of species limits in a purported Phylloscopus ring species.  They will test whether the species complex is truly a ring species by collecting blood samples at various locations throughout the complex to study patterns of genetic variation.  They will also investigate reproductive isolation by using playback experiments and analyzing song structures.   The project has general implications for the role of gene flow, local adaptation, and species interactions in species formation.  More specifically, it will evaluate the role of geographical variation in song and song recognition during the initial stages of speciation.      This project in population biology research fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Russia to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
