A pilot program of ONSET will introduce teachers to the ocean sciences through a series of workshops, coastal and sea-going field excursions, and school site visits.  Teachers will be assisted in developing innovative curricula that combine the best attributes of technology-enhanced and field-based instructional methods.  World Wide Web (WWW) technology will be used to develop a cummunity of teachers to share classroom resources that incorporate inquiry-based methods in student learning.  Six days of teacher workshops, divided evenly between electronic and field-based concentrations, will be held in 1999, culminating in the fall 1999 ONSET conference at the Bay Conference Center of the Romberg-Tiburon Center where marine research scientists will discuss educational outreach projects and current research issues with local educators, including potential future participants in the ONSET program.",
