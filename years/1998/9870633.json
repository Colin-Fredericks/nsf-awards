 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870633  Ebner       This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training  (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a broadly-  based graduate training program that will equip students to  use relevant the technologies and insights of computational  and physical science in investigation of fundamental problems  in neuroscience.  The project will be a joint effort of 24  faculty from 8 departments, with collaborative research  interests ranging from use of numerical methods in modeling of  limb motor control to modeling of synaptic communication in  the retina and to 3-dimensional representation of  neurophysiological data such as those derived from functional  magnetic resonance imaging. NSF support will provide stipends  for 13 graduate students each year who will enroll in either  the neuroscience or scientific computation Ph.D. programs.  Educational opportunities include required six-week summer  course in cell and molecular neurobiology, a new year-long  course in scientific computation, and a new seminar series in  computational neuroscience that will bring 12 speakers from  academia and industry to the campus each year.  After  completing short projects in the research groups of three  participating faculty (lab rotations), students will choose  two mentors for their thesis research, one from the 12  participating neuroscience faculty, the other from among the  12 computational science faculty.  In addition to use of  existing and separate recruitment efforts of the two Ph.D.  programs, the IGERT-sponsored program will benefit from joint  efforts of participating faculty and an ongoing collaborative  effort with the Florida A&M University.       IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program whose goal is to sponsor  the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate  programs that will train a diverse group of new scientists and  engineers to be well-prepared for varied careers in the  private and public sectors.  IGERT provides an opportunity for  the development of new, well-focuse d multidisciplinary  programs that bridge traditional organizational barriers,  uniting faculty from several departments or institutions to  establish a highly-interactive collaborative environment for  both training and research.  In its first year, the program  will provide support to 17 institutions for new or nascent  programs that collectively span all areas of science,  engineering and mathematics eligible for support by the NSF.",
