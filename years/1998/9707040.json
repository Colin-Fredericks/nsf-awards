 "awd_abstract_narration": "Douglas  9707040       The investigator begins a study of multigrid methods for  computers whose performance is highly dependent on the cache  utilization.  The project includes both algorithm development and  realizations in code.  For structured problems in two dimensions,  effective new algorithms can be devised.  For general,  unstructured problems in either two or three dimensions, this is  much harder and requires a completely different approach.  Two  approaches are planned.  One is based on localizing graph  connections of a sparse matrix associated with the grid based  problem.  A second is based on a software tool that re-orders the  computation at run time to use the cache efficiently.  In  addition, the investigator develops new nonlinear multigrid  algorithms that can robustly solve real applications.  A new  methodology is developed to coarsen adaptively refined grids for  problems in which current algorithms fail to converge.       Real world simulations of complex science and engineering  problems like climate, ocean, petroleum reservoir, and pollutant  tracking modeling require enormous amounts of computer time.  Computers today have separate memory modules that run at vastly  different speeds.  Normally, programs run at the speed of the  slowest memory in a computer.  The investigator examines how to  use the faster memory modules instead of the slowest memory for  the solvers needed to run complex problems much faster.",
