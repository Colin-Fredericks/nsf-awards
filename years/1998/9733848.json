The research will explore the  static  and  dynamic  properties of magnetic and superconducting  systems  which  exhibit quantum effects and disorder. One system  consists  of  random  ferromagnetic or antiferromagnet quantum spin  chains  which  can  be  described by a one-dimensional, S=1/2  Heisenberg  Hamiltonian with quenched disorder. The second system consists of  ordered  and  disordered two-dimensional Ising  antiferromagnets,  with  both  short  range  and long range interactions.  The  two-  dimensional  Ising system in a transverse field is  the  simplest  system  which is expected to exhibit a quantum phase  transition.  The  third  magnetic system is consists of magnetic  vortices  in  thin  superconducting  films containing  ordered  and  disordered  arrays  of holes. The disordered system can be described  by  the  random site, random field Ising model (RS/RFIM) in which particle  interaction  strength  is  controlled  by  simply   changing  the  applied  magnetic  field. The critical  properties  of  the  spin  systems  will  be  probed  via measurements  of  low  temperature  susceptibilities as a function of temperature and magnetic field.  The   local  static  configurations  of  the  vortices   in   the  superconductors  will be examined using Bitter decoration,  while  the  local  dynamic motion of the vortices will be measured  with  Hall probe arrays. The educational component of this CAREER award  will  support  development of an undergraduate  research  course,  entitled  \"From  the  Minute  to  the  Macroscopic:  Probing  the  Properties  of  Atoms, Molecules, and Solids\".  The  course  will  focus  on experimental techniques in atomic and condensed  matter  physics,  emphasizing  the continuum in  electronic  and  thermal  properties  from  atoms to solids, and drawing  on  the  research  experience of the physics faculty at Wesleyan.  %%%  This  is  a  CAREER award to a female scientist at a predominantly  undergraduate  institution. Physicists have  been  successful  in  developing  a  detailed understanding of electronic and  magnetic  properties  in  a  wide  range  of  materials.  However,  certain  materials have not yielded to such an understanding owing to  the  presence of disorder and strong electronic interactions. A deeper  understanding of such materials should aid in the development  of  advanced  technological  applications of  these  materials.  This  project  will  focus  on the role of disorder  and  interparticle  interactions in three magnetic systems. Two of these involve  the  magnetism produced by spins of electrons. The third is  a  system  of   magnetic   flux   tubes,  called  vortices,   occurring   in  superconducting thin films with intentionally fabricated defects.  The  grant  will also support the development of an undergraduate  research  course,  entitled \"From the Minute to the  Macroscopic:  Probing  the  Properties of Atoms, Molecules,  and  Solids\".  The  course  will  focus  on  experimental techniques  in  atomic  and  condensed  matter physics. It will emphasize the common  physical  concepts  that  are applicable from relatively  simple  atoms  to  complex  solids. The course will draw on the research  experience  of  the  physics  faculty at Wesleyan. The course  will  also  be  offered  to  high school teachers enrolled as summer students  in  the  Graduate  Liberal Studies Program at Wesleyan.  This  course  will prepare both undergraduates and high school teachers to work  in  the  research labs either during the school year or during  a  subsequent summer.  ***",
