The research will combine the technologies of topology optimization with emerging hp-adaptive meshless and finite element methods of structural analysis.  For a given package space and boundary conditions, this method will compute structures which are optimum in terms of topology as well as size and shape.  Error prediction features of the hp-adaptive method will hold the modeling errors within user prescribed bounds, thus significantly reducing design iterations, the most costly and time consuming portions of the design process.  Phase II will develop a three-dimensional (3D) prototype software package.  Phase I findings will be extended to 3D linear elasticity with error estimation to control solution quality.  The research will also explore improved convergence, stability, manufacturability, and overall performance of the computational algorithms.  This technology has a potential for dramatically reducing the iterative design process by concurrent running of design, analysis, and size/shape optimization algorithms in a single CAE step.  The anticipated ease of use will enable non-expert designers, as well as CAE experts, in applying this technology.  Particular use is expected in the automotive and aerospace industries, where one-half of all mechanical software applications are found and significant pressures to reduce product cycle times are experienced.  ***",
