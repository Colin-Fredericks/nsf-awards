They want visitors to learn about the science, history, and aesthetics of early American hand tools and technology by experiencing various hands-on activities.  The planning activities will include meetings of the planning committees, front-end evaluation, and the testing of some prototype activities.  At the end of the twelve month planing period they will have 1) a better understanding of their audience and their knowledge of the science and technology to be presented in the exhibit, 2) a schematic design for the activities to be included in the park, 3) plans for complementary educational activities, and 4) results of prototype testing of selected activities",
