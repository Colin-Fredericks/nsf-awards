 "awd_abstract_narration": "As multi-media traffic begins to dominate broadband networks,  accurate modeling of video and data traffic becomes crucial to many important  network applications. Video and data traffic has recently been found to  possess complicated self-similarity that invalidates previously developed traffic   models. One of the most important problem is how to develop computationally  efficient and yet accurate models which could capture the complicated  statistical properties of video and data traffic for network design/control.    Our objective of this research is to develop a unified model which is  (1) able to model heterogeneous multi-media traffic including VBR video and  data, (2) computationally efficient, and (3) feasible for analysis.    To accomplish our goal, we propose to use wavelets. We will show that  although heterogeneous multi-media traffic has the complicated short- and long-range  temporal dependence, the corresponding wavelet coefficients are no-longer  long-range dependent. Therefore, simple methods can be used to model   network traffic in the wavelet domain. In particular, independent wavelet   models have shown to be sufficiently accurate, parsimonious, and   have the lowest computational complexity attainable.    We will focus our efforts on investigating how to use independent   wavelet models for analysis including anto-correlation, and buffer loss  rate. We will also investigate how to apply wavelet models to network  control such as admission control.",
