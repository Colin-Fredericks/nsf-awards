As the technology for 100 Gbps local/metropolitan area Time Division Multiplexing optical networks is evolving, transfer of very large files become a reality.  Security for many of these data transfers is of utmost importance. Current prototype high speed encryption systems only operate with throughputs on the order of 2.5Gbps.  Nonlinear optics can enable ultrafast generations with data rates much faster than electronic speed. However, due to the fact that ultrafast optical technology can only support circuits with a small gate count, the classical design of an electronic sequence generator cannot be directly translated to the optical domain. This work presents a new design, reconfigurable Feedback Shift Register, for an ultrafast sequence generator based on both optical, as well as electronic technologies. The design makes use of an electronic sequence generator to control the choice of feedback functions to be configured at the optical shift register at a slower electronic speed, leveraging the speed of the optical generator while exploiting the complexity of the electronic controller.    This project supports the research activities of the PI as a Visiting Researcher at the Laboratory of Information and Decision Systems at MIT during her sabbatical leave in 1997-1998.  The PI, in collaboration with both theorists and system designers at MIT and MIT Lincoln Laboratory, will consider Reconfigurable Feedback Shift Registers as the design of an ultrafast sequence generator. This design makes use of an electronic sequence generator to control the choice of feedback functions to be configured at the optical seedback shift register at a slower electronic speed.  The design leverages the speed of the optical Generator, whil e the latter exploits the complexity of the electronic controller.    Research will be conducted in studying and analyzing in detail the pseudorandom properties of these sequences and their resilience to the known cryptanalytic attacks. Proven good design can be implemented later on in the laboratory.  The realization of such an ultrafast sequence generator not only can serve as an encryption scheme to ensure data security and integrity, but also has other applications in coding. Moreover, these design principles can be readily applied to a hybrid of complex yet slower and simple but faster electronic sequence generators.",
