 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731885    This program will offer summer research experiences in the  field of Psychobiology at the University of Florida (UF).  Applicants will be solicited by mailings to schools in the  Southeast United States, with special emphasis on smaller  and/or minority institutions at which students do not  otherwise have an opportunity for significant research.  Ten  participants will be selected and will spend 12 weeks at UF  (mid-May through early August).  To facilitate group  cohesiveness and interaction, they will be housed in an  apartment residence on campus.  Over the 12 weeks,  each  participant will complete a research project under the  direct supervision of a faculty mentor.  The primary faculty  will give their time to this program; each has an active  research program in psychobiology, with the range of  emphasis spanning molecular and animal studies through  cognitive neuroscience.  In addition to the primary faculty,  affiliated faculty, staff, and graduate students will be  available to help the participants.  Students also will  attend a small-group tutorial to cover the essentials of  biological psychology, as well as a periodic lecture for the  group on topics including ethics, experimental design, and  career development.  They will learn communicative skills by  preparing and presenting oral and written reports.",
