The  Laboratory is being developed jointly at Clemson University and the  Medical University of South Carolina under the auspices of the  Bioengineering Alliance of South Carolina. It will study polymeric  wear observed in conventional and orthopedic bearings. Within the  24-month award period a more fundamental understanding of the  mechanical, chemical and biological physical processes, which  control the performance of polymeric bearing surfaces, will be  developed through team work between the investigators of the  Laboratory under the guidance of an advisory board. This  significant R&D problem will be addressed at the microscopic and  macroscopic scales for both for computational modeling and  experiments. By maintaining a close collaboration and communication  with the members of an industrial advisory board, the models and  experimental analysis and testing methodology developed will be  marketed to the industrial sector. Project results will be applied  to analysis of polymeric wear and to the prediction of its clinical  occurrence with existing artificial joints, as well as with  alternative bearing materials. The analysis and experimental  capabilities developed in this Laboratory will also be extended to  the study of other polymeric bearing applications and materials  such as those commonly utilized in the automotive and textile  industries, each of which represent significant segments of the  economy in the State of South Carolina. The long term goal of this  unique Laboratory is to provide advanced investigational tools  necessary to predict the clinical occurrence of polymeric wear.",
