The first goal is the  construction of an equivariant version of Seiberg-Witten Floer  homology, which is an invariant of the differentiable structure of the  underlying three-manifold and avoids the problem of metric dependence  that arises in the non-equivariant theory.  The second part of the  project consists of deriving the exact triangles formulae that detect  how the Seiberg-Witten Floer homology changes when the three-manifold  is modified by surgery and a suitable cutting and pasting technique  that relates the Seiberg-Witten invariants of four-manifolds and  three-manifolds. The remaining part of the project is dedicated to the  investigation of the relation between the Seiberg-Witten Floer  homology and the instanton Floer homology associated to Donaldson  theory.    The discovery of the Seiberg-Witten invariants, as an outcome of  recent developments in string theory, has had a tremendous impact in  the field of low dimensional topology. The rich interplay of geometry  and theoretical physics has allowed a deeper understanding of the  geometric structure of three and four-dimensional manifolds.  The  topology and geometry of three and four-dimensional manifolds is known  to be especially rich of interesting phenomena and open problems: the  failure of the classification methods used in higher dimensions makes  it particularly important to construct computable invariants, hence  the need to investigate the properties of the Seiberg-Witten  invariants and their relation to the previously known  Yang-Mills-Donaldson theory.",
