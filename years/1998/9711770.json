 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  goals  of  the  research are to develop new  robot  learning  algorithms  for qualitatively more complex robots and tasks  than  have been attempted so far, and to greatly increase the level  of  automation  of  implementing robot learning.  The  research  will  focus  on:  1: tasks and robots with many degrees of freedom,  2:  having  one robot learn to perform multiple tasks, and generalize  appropriately between tasks, 3: learning over a long  time  span,  in  which the robot, the task, and the environment change, and 4:  combining  multiple approaches to robot learning.   The  research  will  contribute to a more automatic process for  selecting  task  structure,   representations,  and  adjustable   parameters   and  functions.   Two  types of learning will be emphasized:  learning  from  demonstration, where the robot learns from a  demonstration  of  how to perform a task, and reinforcement learning, where  the  robot  learns by optimizing a reward function.  Flexible  methods  to  represent  knowledge  will be emphasized,  including  locally  weighted  learning  and other nonparametric learning  techniques.  The   techniques   developed   in  implementing   learning   from  demonstration will form the basis of the approach to more general  learning problems, such as reinforcement learning.  This research  will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Mitsuo Kawato at  the  Advanced Telecommunications Research Human Information Processing  Laboratory in Japan.  The expected significance of this  research  is  that  it  will make it easier and less expensive  to  program  robots  and machine-based systems in general. From an engineering  point  of  view  the  goal is to reduce the amount  of  expensive  expert  human input into robot programming.  From a psychological  point  of  view the goal is to understand how people  learn,  and  this  kind of work leads to models of how learning behavior might  be accomplished.",
