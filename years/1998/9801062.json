 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9801062  Martin    This Small Business Innovation Research(SBIR) Phase II project will develop an innovative type of energy recovery system. If successful, it will significantly enlarge the opportunities for energy recovery in residential, commercial, and industrial ventilation applications. The proposed system will be used to recover otherwise wasted energy by transferring both heat and moisture between the fresh ventilation air stream entering a building and the outgoing exhaust ventilation air. While performing this function, it will suppress the transfer of pollutants which would otherwise accompany the transferred moisture and thereby undermine the quality of the ventilation air.  Present heat and moisture exchangers permit transfer of pollutants between the air streams, and are, therefore, unsuitable for air-quality-sensitive applications. The objective of the Phase II project is to design, fabricate, and operate a commercially-viable air-to-air heat-and-moisture exchanger with walls formed from the selective, low-cost membrane material developed in Phase I. The exchanger will transfer water vapor at a high rate while limiting the transfer of airborne gaseous pollutants.    This research will extend the use of energy recovery to settings where both pollutant control and energy conservation are priorities. The potential of this technology for the ventilation energy recovery market is estimated at $45 million in the U.S.  ***",
