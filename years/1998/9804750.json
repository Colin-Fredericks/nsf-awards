 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804750  Carriquiry      This Americas Program award will fund a Latin American  workshop  on \"Probability and Mathematical Statistics\", to  be held in Cordoba,Argentina,  September 21-25, 1998,  in  conjunction with the Iberoamerican Congress of Statistics.  Organizers are Drs. Alicia Carriquiry, Iowa State  University, and Philip Protter, Purdue University, in  collaboration with Dr. Victor Yohai,  Universidad de Buenos  Aires. The  workshop will focus on the importance of  statistical science and probability as fundamental  components of scientific and social inquiry.    The main objectives will be to discuss new developments and  identify common research areas for international and Latin  American researchers  In order to achieve these objectives  participants will address  topics in statistics and  probability with wide application in other areas of  research.    Coinciding with the improvement of economic conditions in  Latin America during the past ten or fifteen years,  the  basic sciences have experienced a markedly improvement in  quantity and quality in the region.  Probability and  Mathematical  Statistics  are at the forefront of this forward movement,  mostly due to the regional and international collaborations  resulting from challenging problems in areas such as  environmental statistics, econometrics and social  statistics.  While not disregarding the more theoretical  aspects of probability and statistics, the emphasis of this  activity is on the application of the  mathematical sciences  to other areas of scientific and social inquiry,  highlighting methodology and interdisciplinary  collaboration.  ***",
