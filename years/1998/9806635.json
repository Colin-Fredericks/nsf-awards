 "awd_abstract_narration": "9806635    Briggs      Theoretical studies have predicted that limited dispersal abilities of individuals of the component species can stabilize consumer-resource interactions and promote coexistence in competitive interactions. However, there has been little empirical evidence to back up these theoretical predictions, in part because of the difficulties encountered when attempting to apply existing general models to particular systems. The investigators will examine these potential effects of dispersal in a natural host-multiparasitoid system involving the gall-forming midge, Rhopalomyia californica, and its community of parasitoid species.  The following questions will be addressed: (a) Do limited dispersal abilities of the host and parasitoids in the system enhance the stability of the host-multiparasitoid interaction?  (b) Do differences in dispersal ability and competitive ability between the different parasitoid species promote coexistence of multiple parasitoid species on the one host species?  (c) At what spatial scale does (a) and/or (b) occur?  The study will involve the development and parameterization of a spatially explicit model tailored to the system.  The predictions of the model will be used to analyze the patterns of midge abundance and parasitoid diversity observed in natural populations, and will be tested explicitly in a field experiment in which dispersal will be manipulated at different spatial scales.  The results of this project will make a substantial contribution towards bridging the gap between theory and experiments in understanding the roles of dispersal in population regulation and multispecies coexistence.  This research will have direct implications for the biological control of insect pests, and for the conservation of endangered species.",
