 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802182\r\nHirsch\r\n\r\nThis project will study dynamical systems enjoying a strong comparison \r\nprinciple, and their applications to evolutionary stochastic approximation \r\nprocesses. The structure of invariant subsets will be investigated, \r\nespecially attractors and attractor-free sets.  New means of ascertaining the \r\nexistence, stability and periods of periodic and subharmonic trajectories of \r\nmonotone systems of ordinary and partial differential equations will be \r\nobtained.  These results will be applied to stochastic processes in which \r\nlong-term behavior of sample paths is closely related to asymptotic \r\nbehavior of an associated deterministic vector field that points in the \r\ndirection of expected changes in state vectors.  In some cases the \r\ndynamics of the vector field is simple enough that one can derived precise \r\ninformation on clustering of sample paths as certain parameters (e.g., \r\npopulation, in epidemic models) becomes large.  Specific applications \r\ninclude models of spread of infection disease, price adjustment, and \r\nrepeated adaptive games.\r\n\r\nFor many real world phenomena it is useful to have precise mathematical \r\nmodels capturing a few important features.  In order to manage the spread \r\nof an infectious disease, for example, it is important to know whether it is \r\nbetter to budget for increasing cure rates, reducing contact rates, or \r\nisolating the most infected subgroups.  Mathematical models are used to \r\ngive precise theoretical answers to such questions; if the model has been \r\nvalidated by observation or experiment, specific practical steps can be \r\ntaken. This project will investigate, on a theoretical level, mathematical\r\nsystems of this type.  The technical results apply  also  to other situations.  \r\nOne of these is price adjustment and stability of markets; it will be shown \r\nthat prices can be expected to stabilize when goods are similar, price \r\nchanges are small and sellers have good estimates of the intrinsic marginal \r\ndemand for their own products. Another is to repeated games where \r\ninformation is uncertain; such systems are often used to model bargaining between individuals, corporations or governments.  The project will show that certain types of long-term strategies lead to convergence of behavior.\r\n",
