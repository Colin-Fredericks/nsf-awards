The  partnership will address one of the most pressing problems facing  telecommunications today - the low transmission data rates of  present, long-haul, fiber optics links. The Arkansas-Lucent team,  working side-by- side, will focus on developing key optical  elements, such as light sources, fast optical switches,  multiplexer/demultiplexer, filters, and add/drop loops, for  wavelength division multiplexing. Six faculty members at the  University of Arkansas will spend blocks of time at Lucent  Technologies on research during summers and semester breaks and  shorter visits throughout the year as needed. Likewise, four  scientists at Lucent will spend blocks of time at the University of  Arkansas on research efforts and in contributing to the formal  education of students as adjunct professors, via classroom lectures  and seminars. Post-doctoral appointees and graduate students will  spend approximately half their time at each laboratory working on  only one project but taking advantage of the different skills,  point-of-view, and facilities available at each laboratory. The  Arkansas-Lucent partnership will provide faculty and students with  the opportunity to:  (1) work on significant industrial R&D  problems; (2) develop new technical skills important to  telecommunications, many of which are unique at Lucent; and (3)  participate in a new paradigm in graduate training leading to  broader career opportunities.",
