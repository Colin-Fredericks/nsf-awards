This is a collaborative research project between   investigators from twelve academic and government research   institutions.  The  research is being conducted under the   auspices of the NSF Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP) program   and the NOAA Coastal Ocean Program.        This collaborative, research program focuses on the   importance of episodic  events on nearshore-offshore   transport and subsequent ecological consequences. The study   seeks to 1) determine what processes control the cross-  margin (inshore to offshore) transport of biological,   chemical, and geological materials in the coastal margins of   the Great Lakes, and to 2) develop and test scientific   strategies for assessing, quantifying, and predicting the   impacts of multiple stresses both natural and anthropogenic,   in the Great   Lakes or selected coastal sub-regions. A   tight coupling between contaminated sediments and overlying   water exists in lakes and coastal ecosystems through the   process of sediment resuspension. Satellite observations in     Lake Michigan illustrate an annually recurrent episode of   nearshore-offshore transport, a 10-km wide plume of   resuspended material extending over 200 km along the   southern shores of the lake. Preliminary evidence indicates   that this episodic event may be the major mechanism for   cross-margin sediment transport in Lake Michigan.  This type   of event impacts recycling of biogeochemically important   materials (BIMS), ecosystem responses, cross-isobath   transport in the Great Lakes. The program results will be   applicable to similar events in many coastal areas. This   comprehensive, interdisciplinary study will implement an   integrated observational program and numerical modeling   effort to identify, quantify, and develop prediction tools     for the winter-spring resuspension event and to assess the    impact of this event on the  transport and transformation of   BIMS and on lake ecology.        This component of the study focuses on structure and   abundance of microbial food web organisms before, during,   and after plume formation; measure Nitrogen cycling rates in     relation to community and species-specific grazing rates of   microzooplankton within, at the edge, and outside of the   plume. Observations, experiments, and results will be     coordinated with those from primary production and   zooplankton grazing experiments and other studies of   nutrient and physical processes to complete a conceptual   model and   provide data for the proposed coupled   biological/physical model.",
