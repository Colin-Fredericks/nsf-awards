 "awd_abstract_narration": "DNA and RNA are virtually unique among polymers in organic chemistry to  display role-base self-assembly over a broad range of molecular structure.  This self-assembly is the basis of biotechnology and genetics, and is the  focus of this proposal.        Work in the Benner laboratories has shown that the Watson-Crick base  pair can support 12 nucleobases joined in six distinct base pairs, each  joined by different patterns of hydrogen bonding, to give An Expanded  Genetic Information System (AEGIS) following an expanded set of Watson-  Crick pairing rules. AEGIS can be copied via template-directed  polymerization catalyzed by DNA and RNA polymerases.        Work in the Tan laboratories has developed and exploited near-field  scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) tools to image single molecules with 10-  20 nm resolution on two-dimensional surfaces, in particular, nanostructure  functional probes having the dimensions of single molecules. Using these  technologies, Tan has imaged a variety of molecules and nanostructures  (buckminsterfulleranes, DNA chains, and cell membranes),  photonanofabricated a variety of biochemically functionalized  nanostructures, analyzed the kinetics of single enzyme molecules, and  probed the release of metabolites inside single cells.        The two research groups, housed in adjacent buildings, therefore have  technologies ideally matched to undertake a collaborative project focusing  on the practical aspects of synthesis/fabrication through bio-self  assembly of nanostructures.  Procedures for synthesizing the components of  the nanostructures using biocatalysts (in particular, thermostable DNA  polymerases) will be explored, with an eye towards in situ generation of  the components of nanostructures. The cells of the largest nano-nets will  be loaded with photoreactive groups that can be written/read by NSOM. We  hope that this will create a small readable/writable memory element with  obvious relevance to practical applications.",
