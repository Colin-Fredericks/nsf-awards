It  has  been    known  for  a  number  of years that sensory signals  from  peripheral    receptors are segregated, and travel in parallel pathways through  the    relay  nuclei  of  the dorsal thalamus, to primary  sensory  areas  of    cortex.   The   study   of  parallel  pathways  in   sensory   system,    particularly   in   the  visual  system,  has  provided   a   key   to    understanding  how  the  brain  codes the  wide  variety  of  incoming    information. The realization that features such as color,  motion,  or    contrast  are coded by separate subcortical cell types has provided  a    valuable  conceptual framework for studies of how visual  signals  are    perceived  by  the  brain.  This proposal tests  the  hypothesis  that    similar  parallel  pathways  exist  in  areas  of  the  thalamus  that    associate information from a variety of cortical areas. In this  case,    the  proposed  parallel  pathways  originate  in  cortex,  and  remain    segregated  in  the  thalamus through synaptic  contacts  on  distinct    classes   of  thalamocortical  neurons,  which  project  to  different    cortical  laminae.  This  idea will be  tested  in  the  pulvinar  and    lateral posterior nuclei, which receive input from two types of  layer    V  cortical  cells, and contain at least two morphologically  distinct    types  of thalamocortical cells. It is proposed that separate cortical    axons  contact separate classes of thalamocortical cells that  project    to  different  cortical  lamina. The proposed anatomical  experiments,    which   involve   the   injection  of  neuroanatomical   tracers   and    irnmunocytochemistry,  wi ll test the concept  that  parallel  pathways    are  utilized  in the processing of internal cortical signals.  It  is    anticipated  that, similar to the study of parallel sensory  pathways,    this   information  will  provide  a  fruitful  starting   point   for    deciphering  the  function  of  the  pulvinar  and  lateral  posterior    nuclei.",
