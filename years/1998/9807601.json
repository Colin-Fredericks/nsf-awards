 "awd_abstract_narration": "9807601  Olvera    This grant supports theoretical research on phase  segregation in multicomponent polymer mixtures.  Polymer  blends are highly immiscible viscous fluids.  Complex  microstructures are observed during the decomposition into  multiple phases.  The patterns of the decomposing fluids are  expected to be affected by flow.  Here a systematic study  will be conducted of hydrodynamic effects on the  decomposition process as a function of the concentrations  and degrees of polymerization of the blend components, as  well as of their net repulsive interactions.  Blends  decomposing into two and three phases will be analyzed.  Level set theory will be used to analyze interface behavior.  The time-dependent microstructures under externally applied  flow will also be studied.  Preliminary results suggest that  the break-up of the interconnected patterns found in ternary  blends is strongly nonlinear.  That is, the third phase rich  in the minority component growing at the interfaces of the  majority symmetric phases forms connecting fluid filaments  that break up into mother drops with satellite droplets.  This mechnaism greatly affects the growth rate of the  minority phase.  %%%  This grant supports theoretical research on phase  segregation in multicomponent polymer mixtures.  Polymer  blends are highly immiscible viscous fluids.  Most  commercially available polymers for applications are  actually blends.  Complex microstructures are observed  during the decomposition into multiple phases.  These  microstructures affect the properties of the blends.
