 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728041  Heckathorn  Heat stress decreases crop productivity and limits plant survival and distribution, in large part by reducing photosynthesis.  We have recently shown that the chloroplast small heat-shock protein (HSP) protects photosynthesis during heat stress and is important in acclimation of photosynthesis to heat.  In the present research, we will investigate how the chloroplast small HSP protects photosynthesis by addressing the following three objectives: (1) determine which photosynthetic protein interacts with the chloroplast HSP, (2) determine which region of functional domain of the chloroplast HSP is needed for protective function, and (3) examine the functional efficiency of the chloroplast small HSP is species that differ in the heat tolerance of photosynthesis.  These studies will increase our understanding of the effects of heat stress on photosynthesis and the role that HSPs play in protecting photosynthesis at high temperatures.  Such information will add to our knowledge of how plants survive and adapt to heat stress and warm habitats and will help in the bioengineering and breeding of crop plants for improved thermotolerance.",
