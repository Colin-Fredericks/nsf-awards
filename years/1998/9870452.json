 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to assess triadic accuracy in interpersonal perception and, more specifically, in social compatibility judgments.  First, the investigator will assess triadic accuracy - an individual's ability to predict how much two unacquainted persons will like or dislike each other.  Second, the investigator will identify personality and situational factors which enhance a person's triadic accuracy.  In achieving these goals, statistical techniques required to adequately analyze triadic perceptions will be further developed.  Our impressions of others are fundamental to our daily life.  The accuracy of these impressions enables us to understand and predict our social world, thereby enhancing the quality of our social interactions.  Given this central importance of interpersonal perception accuracy, it is not surprising that this topic has long been a central issue in the field of social psychology.  The majority of the work has examined our ability to accurately perceive one other person or another person's view of ourselves.  Despite the apparent importance of triadic accuracy to social functioning, almost no research has examined these perceptual judgments.  Thus, the results of this project will enhance understanding of interpersonal perception as well as expand the field in an important new direction.  This POWRE award will facilitate the consolidation of the investigator's long-term research area.  She has had two non-tenure-track Assistant Professor positions in colleges with very high teaching loads.  This pursuit of a unique approach within the field of interpersonal perception and the further development of sophisticated statistical techniques should aid the investigator in securing a tenure-track position.",
