 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will lead to production of materials for use as synthetic tendons and ligaments.  The materials are spider silk proteins which exhibit strengths of the order of Kevlar or steel yet have the elasticity of nylon.  Use of synthetic fibers will be advantageous because: a) spider silk is nonimmunogenic so implants will not need to be taken from other tissues of the same patient, b) the fibers are stronger than natural tissues but still elastic, and c) the fibers are not degradable by biological systems and will not erode in the patient.  WyoBiGen will produce significant quantities of spider dragline silk proteins from genetically engineered genes.  The first protein produced will be major ampullate spider silk 2 protein.  WyoBiGen will construct and express a second synthetic gene, major ampullate spider silk 1.  Development of a new strategy for synthetic gene construction allows blending of various properties, such as strength, elasticity, and toughness, by joining structural domains of the native silk genes.  Objectives will be pursued simultaneously and generation of fibers from these materials will be pursued in our laboratories, as well as those of companies who have requested these materials from WyoBiGen.  The first applications will be artificial ligaments and tendons due to the unique blend of strength, elasticity, nonimmunogenic nature, and toughness of the spider silk proteins.  Light porous films for tissue reinforcement or drug delivery are also possible.  Other applications of this unique material are airbags, seatbelts, climbing gear, composite material reinforcements, and textiles.  A list of eighteen major companies who have already requested these proteins or the fibers to develop their own applications is included.  This award is supported by the Small Business Innovation Research Program and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).",
