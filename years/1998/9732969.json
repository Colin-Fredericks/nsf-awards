As such, it has  both a research and educational component.  The investigator's  research objectives are to conduct work that characterizes non-  covalent reactions of dissolved organic carbon with water  pollutants that affects their bioavailability, transferability in  aquifers and other factors that can be applied to engineering  design of systems to reduce the pollutional impact of leachate  from landfills.  The dissolved organic compounds he plans on  using have been isolated from the Norman Landfill leachate and  include humic acid, fulvic acid and hydrophilic organic matter.  The investigator plans on using deuterium-labeled aromatic  compounds such as toluene, ethylbenzene, nitrobenzene, phenol,  aniline, benzoic acid and methoxybenzene derivatives in addition  to pyridine and quinoline in the characterization of their  reactions with natural organic carbonaceous substances.    The Principal Investigator's educational component has an  outreach component aspect for involving secondary school  teachers, their students and undergraduates in environmental  research focussed on an actual problem such as those associated  with management of the leachate from a local landfill.  This  problem addresses environmental issues that are expected to  motivate students because of their immediate importance,  scientific and technological complexity.  The investigator plans  on inaugurating a summer program for high school students who  will assist in designing a research project to be conducted by  them during the succeeding academic year.  The investigator also  plans on implementation of the use of advanced analytical  instrumentation in undergraduate classes and integrating the  results of his research in the engineering design and  implementation of systems for solving hazardous waste management  problem s.  ***",
