 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this project is to create a specialized computer laboratory that will achieve an integrated approach to teach the modern techniques and content of geography.  An integrated approach will be used that emphasizes project-oriented teaching and learning.  GIS, remote sensing and the Web will be used by students as effective tools in geography education.     The goal of this project is to provide students with a unique computing environment where they can better grasp the coherent links between content-based courses and technique-oriented courses and solve real-world problems from a broad geographic perspective, and to promote students' participation in the National Conference of Undergraduate Research.  A balanced content-based education combined with hands-on training in modern techniques is crucial to delivering excellent undergraduate education. Typically, the design of an institution's geography curriculum stresses lectures for content-based courses, and lecture-then-lab approaches for technique courses. There have been no real links between these two groups of courses.     With the proposed Geography Computing Laboratory Project, however, the courses will be taught in an integrated, project-oriented fashion. In content-based courses, teaching emphasizes fundamental geography principles and concepts, yet requires students to solve real-world problems using geographic computing techniques. In technique courses teaching coupled with training is project-oriented and application-driven, instead of pure training on hardware and software mechanics. This integrated approach will promote a problem-solving learning environment so that students will understand the holistic aspects of geographic issues and problems. In this learning process, students would be able to obtain not only broad content-based education, but also technical skills in geographic spatial data analysis. They will become highly competitive and productive in the modern workforce.     In this two-year project, se veral publications will result from class projects and students' independent research studies.",
