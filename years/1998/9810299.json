The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. John R. Swallow of Davidson College to work  with Dr. Jack Sonn at Technion-Israel Institute of  Technology in Haifa, Israel on the descent of quaternion  algebras and applications to Galois Theory.  They will  develop new, primarily constructive techniques for 1) the  realization of groups as Galois groups and 2) the  determination of the equivalence of quadratic forms over  number fields, using a theory of descent connecting  quadratic form theory with obstructions to central Galois  embedding problems.  One of the likely outcomes of this work  will be the realization of certain 2-groups that are not  known to occur.  This will provide connections between the  Inverse Galois Problem and the theory of quaternionic  algebras and quadratic forms.    Dr. Sonn is the leading expert in the theory of central  embedding problems.  ***",
