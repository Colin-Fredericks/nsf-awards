 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This award is for support of a cooperative project by Dr. Mary M. Mikhail, Senior Investigator, Enteric Microbiology, at the Naval Medical Research Unit -3 (NAMRU3) in Cairo, Egypt, and  Alaa Eldin Shehata Aly, Senior Chemist, Biomedical Research Center, Egyptian Organization for Biological Products and Vaccines (VACSERA), in Cairo, Egypt.  The two collaborators plan to synthesize a new vaccine for the protection of infants against Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) diseases.  The polysaccharide of Hib will be prepared and purified then depolymerized and uniterminally coupled to a carrier protein (150KD fraction of tetanus toxoid).  This will improve its immunogenecity specially in infants and lead to a better protection and longer duration of immune response with T-cell dependent characters.  The conjugate produced will be of high hapten load so will be more active in priming infants, and more active in adults.  The improvement of the immune response of the conjugate will be tested in laboratory animals.   Scope:  This project will involve two laboratories with complementary capabilities to conduct research in an important industrial and health research field.  Part of the research work will be conducted at VACSERA, including the purification of Hib CPS and the preparation of the conjugate.  The steps of TT fractionation, Hib CPS depolymerization, periodate oxidation and chemical coupling will be jointly reviewed by VACSERA and the NAMRU3 teams.  The chemical testing of the conjugate also will be carried out jointly.  The animal immunization will be done at NAMRU3.  Dr. Mikhail is an expert in biological chemistry and animal clinical testing.  The Egyptian researcher is an expert in the field of polysaccharide protein conjugated vaccine preparation, and has experience in purification and testing of bacterial capsular polysaccharides.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting US-foreign collaboration in areas of mutual benefit.  The project was generated as a result of a workshop on biotechnology organized by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Egyptian Government.  NIH was involved in the evaluation of the project and in recommending its support.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, administered by the US Department of State, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out cooperative activities.",
