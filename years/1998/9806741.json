Park, Kihong  Purdue University    ESS: ISAC: Integrated System Support for Adaptive Communication and  Computation Control in Clustered Environments    This project aims to build an integrated software system (ISAC) for   application development in cluster-computing environments. ISAC addresses   issues of communication control and load balancing to facilitate an   effective parallel platform. In contrast to traditional approaches, ISAC   views communication and computation control in an integrated system. It   dynamically schedules computation and communication making use of their   repetitive nature to achieve optimal performance. End-to-end congestion   control is augmented by a group communication mechanism that conjointly   schedules communication and computation. Scheduling is carried out assuming   a best-effort network environment in which resources are shared among a   pool of applications. Communication control is adaptive, and scheduling is   performed dynamically as a function of network state. Assuming that routers   implement a form of weighted fair queuing wherein resource reservations can   be affected, ISAC implements guaranteed-bandwidth channels either   per-connection or per-multicast group using a form of admission control. In   conjunction with process scheduling support at host stations, this allows   critical applications to achieve guaranteed progress impervious to network   and processor loads. It also allows applications to deal with heterogeneity   among hosts and networking environments transparently. ISAC will   significantly enhance the programmability and performance of   cluster-computing applications ranging from scientific computing to   distributed web and database servers.",
