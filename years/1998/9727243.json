 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program provides continued support for research on carboxylate-bridged   metal dimers by Dr. Stephen J. Lippard, Chemistry Department,   Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Metalloproteins containing such   units are responsible for many biological functions, including oxygen   transport, methane hydroxylation, and hydrolysis of phosphate esters.  In   this study, three lines of investigation will be pursued:  oxidation   chemistry of diiron complexes as models for the active site of the   hydroxylase component of methane monooxygenase; metallohydrolase   chemistry that mimics urease and metalophosphatase; and sugar   isomerization reactions to model D-xylose isomerase.  Emphasis will be   placed on designing dinucleating ligands that have sufficient internal   preorganization so that they fold into shapes that create the appropriate   cavities for metal binding.  One class of ligands is dicarboxylates in   which two Kemp's triacid anhydride-chloride moities are linked by a   bridging 1,3-diaminoxylene, 1,4-diaminophthalazine, or   bis(aminomethylphenyl)porphyrin group.  Symmetric and unsymmetrically   substituted amidinate ligands, that are isoelectronic with carboxylate,   will also be investigated.  Attempts will also be made to functionalize   mono-carboxylate bridged systems using a multicomponent ligand with two   terminal bidentate units joined by one bridging carboxylate spacer.  The   compounds synthesized will be tested to see the extent to which they   mimic the structures, physical properties, and reactivities of the   biological prototypes, including intermediates in catalytic cycles.    Many biologically-important hydroxylases, hydrolases, and isomerases   function because of a reaction center that contains two linked metal   atoms and a surrounding carboxylate group.  In order to understand the   details of how these enzymes work, model compounds will be designed,   synthesized, and tested for catalytic activity.",
