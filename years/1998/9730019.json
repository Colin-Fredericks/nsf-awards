 "awd_abstract_narration": "9730019  Risbud  The goal of this project is to develop new synthesis science for  III-V nitride nanoclusters applicable to quantum dot structures.  The approach is to combine inspirations from the synthetic  chemistry of block copolymers and precursors to nitride compounds  to process nanocrystals of III-V nitride materials sequestered in  polymeric matrices. Parallel investigations of the microscopic,  optical and electronic properties of nitride quantum dots will be  pursued. Transmission electron microscopy and electron  diffraction will be employed to study the structure, size  distribution, and defects of the quantum dots. Optical  spectroscopies will be used to characterize the band gap of the  quantum dots, quantum confinement, and- emission processes  (photoluminescence and time resolved spectroscopy). The effects  of synthesis parameters, defects, surface passivation, and  impurities on the behavior of the III-V nitride quantum dots will  be studied using these primary measurement and characterization  methods.  %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  materials science having high technological relevance. The  research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a  fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic  devices. The basic knowledge and understanding gained from the  research is expected to contribute to improving the performance  and stability of advanced devices by providing a fundamental  understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved  materials, and materials combinations.  An important feature of  the program is the integration of research and education through  the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically  significant area.",
