Stephen Wilson, Department of Mathematics,  Johns Hopkins University, for collaboration with Professor  Goro Nishida, Division of Mathematics, Graduate School of  Science, Kyoto University, Japan.  The collaborators will  attempt to prove a conjecture on the unstable Brown-Peterson  homology of spaces.  This conjecture was first made nearly  20 years ago in the USA by American and Japanese  mathematicians.  In recent collaboration between U.S. and  Japanese mathematicians, significant progress has been made  on the problem, and the PI and his collaborators have  sketched an approach which is expected to resolve the  question.    The conjecture states that n-dimensional elements in the  Brown-Peterson homology of a space are an n-th type of  torsion free.  The collaborators will translate the problem  into classifying spaces for a cohomology version and then  prove various homotopy decomposition theorems  Solution of  the problem will be of mutual benefit to U.S. and Japanese  mathematicians.  This project is supported under the Science  Fellowship Program between the National Science Foundation  and the Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership.  ***",
