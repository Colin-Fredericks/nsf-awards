The research plan focuses on computational and experimental studies of the dissolutional growth of fissures in soluble rock and the impact of precipitation/dissolution reactions on permeability of porous and fractured media.  The educational plan involves the development of observational components relevant to education in fluid mechanics and hydrology, and curriculum development relevant to the graduate program in hydrologic sciences.  Feedback coupling between fluid flow and chemical reactions is important in the context of several geological processes such as conduit and cave formation in karst, and engineering applications such as \"acidization\" to increase permeability for oil recovery.  Although reaction-flow coupling has been examined previously, a systematic study of the influence of geologic heterogeneity on the nonlinearly coupled dynamics is only beginning.  A preliminary study carried out by the P.I. and a graduate student indicated that random variations in the fissure aperture accelerate conduit growth in calcite by up to an order of magnitude.  The objective of the proposed research is to quantify the influence of heterogeneity on the dynamics of flow-reaction coupling in porous and fractured media, based on controlled experiments and computational studies.  Experiments will be carried out in fractures cast with plaster-of-paris.  Surfaces with measured roughness will be used to assemble the fractures.  High-resolution aperture measurements (through collaboration with Dr. Robert J. Glass, Sandia National Laboratories) will accompany dissolution experiments.  Computational studies will focus on topical systems such as karst evolution, dissolution of gypsum and anhydrite, deposition of quartz veins in fractures and the growth of carbonate concretions.  The studies on carbonate concretions will support the work of Drs. Matt  Davis (EAR-9725194) and Peter Mozley (EAR-9726416).  The data on concretion growth history and orientation  obtained from their work will be employed to evaluate different hypotheses on concretion growth.  Continuing educational activities include development of an interactive undergraduate fluid mechanics course and a bench-top watershed module to be used for qualitative and quantitative visualization.  Proposed module development activities focus on simple experiments to illustrate the impact of heterogeneity on flow and transport processes in porous and fractured media.  Curriculum development involve a new integrative course on reactive transport modeling, to serve as a core course for the graduate program in hydrologic sciences.  The course will provide an integrated perspective on reaction-transport interactions in atmospheric, oceanic, surface and groundwater systems, emphasizing the unifying aspects across different media.  The relationship between spatial/temporal scales of interest and the types of models used will also be a theme.  The course will include a field component on experimental modification of water quality in small streams (through collaboration with Dr. Diane McKnight) and experimental studies.",
