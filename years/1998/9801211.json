 "awd_abstract_narration": "Niziol  9801211      This project will explore a conceptually very simple K-theoretical approach to the  theory of p-adic periods. For a scheme  over a local field of mixed characteristic  the theory of p-adic periods attempts to relate the p-adic   geometric etale cohomology with the de Rham cohomology. This relation is supposed to be attained by so called period morphisms and the key theorems in the field (comparison theorems) deal with constructing this morphisms and showing that they are isomorphisms. This project proposes to use K-theory to construct the p-adic period maps. This should give new proofs of the known comparison theorems as well as show that they are true in some cases which were not known before.       This project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.",
