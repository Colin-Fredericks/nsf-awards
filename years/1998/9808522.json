 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is  believed that there are two major  challenges in the  overall success of multi-threaded architectures: (1) Building  multi-threaded systems with off-the-shelf components and, (2)  Providing effective programming language and compiler support for  common  imperative languages (like C and Fortran). At the  University of Delaware Gao's research group has successfully built  a multi-threaded machine from  off-the-shelf components. The  remaining challenge is to demonstrate successful use of imperative  languages for  such architectures. This project proposes to  investigate whether aggressive interprocedural analysis and  transformations, combined with accurate alias analysis, can be  applied to irregular applications coded in imperative languages  for compilation and efficient execution on multi-threaded systems.  Novel analysis, transformation and code generation techniques are  being developed to examine the strengths (and weaknesses) of  using imperative languages for multi-threaded systems. The major  challenge in generating code is partitioning the sequential code  into strands, such that the code for each strand can be executed  without requiring any remote memory references. Before strand  partitioning, interprocedural code motion and loop transformations  will be used to reduce the frequency of off-processor references  and enable better strand partitioning. Developing new analyses for  these transformations, which take into account the possibility of  aliasing and the cost functions for multi-threaded architectures  is one of the main focus of this project. Also, since registers  are not reallocated during a context switch in these systems, new  inter-strand register allocation techniques are also being  developed.",
