The instruments to be acquired by the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) were developed by a private company, Refraction Technologies (RefTek),  in collaboration with personnel from UTEP, Rice University and the University of  Texas at Dallas.  The result has been the RefTek-125, a 2-3 lb. Instrument that operates on 2 D-cell batteries for up to two days with on board memory capable of 12 hours of continuous recording at 2 ms intervals or 48 hours at 8 ms.  They are single channel instruments which are primarily suited for \r\nhigh frequency active source seismic experiments.  The lightweight of the RefTek-125 significantly reduces shipping costs, allowing field deployment of greater numbers of instruments and to more remote locations than have been economically or logistically feasible with the older IRIS-Program for Array Seismic Studies of the Continental Lithosphere (PASSCAL) pool of community accessible instruments.  For high-resolution shallow subsurface imaging, these instruments will also allow very dense (ca. 1-10 m separations) array deployments for 3-D investigations that can feasibly be carried out with only a single field vehicle and for relatively low cost.  In return for future operational and management support from IRIS, the RefTek-125 pool of instruments will ultimately be available to the broader seismological community through the IRIS-PASSCAL program.\r\n***\r\n",
