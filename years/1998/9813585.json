This NSF travel support will augment similar travel support funding in the amount of $15,000 from Defense Advance Research Project Agency (DARPA).  In addition, the Workshop's sponsoring organization, Transducers Research Foundation (TRF), will contribute similar travel support.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the graduate students who conduct much of the academic research in the field is of immense importance to their educational experience and the quality of the Workshop.  For many of these graduate students, attendance at the professional conferences constitutes a major part of their education.\r\n\r\nAn announcement in response to the Workshop paper submission acceptances and registration applications has been made to notify US participants of the availability of the travel support.  A member serving on the program committee will select the candidates for travel and subsistence assistance awards.  In order to stretch the available funds, consideration of partial travel grants will be made.  The requested support will only be available to those graduate students from US academic institutions.\r\n***\r\n",
