 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804100  The research addresses the verification of properties of  infinite-state reactive systems, which have an ongoing  interaction with their environment.  Reactive systems include  hardware, software, and real-time and hybrid systems.  Their  computations can be modeled as infinite sequences of states, and  their properties conveniently expressed using temporal logic.  Except for untimed hardware, where a state depends on a fixed  number of bits, these systems are infinite-state: not only is a  computation an infinite sequence of states, but the set of  possible system states is infinite as well. Abstraction underlies  virtually all deductive and algorithmic verification techniques  for infinite-state systems.The algorithmic methods explore finite  quotients of the state-space, which are often incrementally  refined. Deductive verification rules can also be understood as  using an appropriate abstraction, expressed using intermediate  assertions. When applied to software systems, the main challenge  in both cases is to find the right abstraction that will allow  the verification of the properties of interest.  Compositional verification reduces the validity of a property  over a complex system to that of related properties over smaller  components. Compositionality is often used together with  abstraction to verify systems larger than would otherwise be  possible.  The research investigates new forms of abstraction and  compositional reasoning, combining algorithmic and deductive  methods.  They will facilitate the verification of temporal  properties of software components, automating the process  whenever possible.***",
