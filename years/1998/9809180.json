 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research examines the consequences of democratization.  The central hypothesis is that democratizing systems are characterized by increased electoral competition and that that this generates more inclusive and participatory patterns of recruitment.  The implication is that policymaking will be designed to appeal to the mass electorate. The research focuses on comparisons across all of the states of Mexico and makes use of multiple methods, including interviews with legislators and community leaders, analysis of formal/legal instruments, measures of institutional performance and analysis of public opinion data.  The primary focus is with patterns of political recruitment, legislative behavior and public policy outcomes.  The study provides insight into transitional governments by observing what happens at the sub-national level.",
