 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study submitted through the Research in Undergraduate Institutions program. The project will add samples of Hmong and Cambodian refugees from different urban areas to an existing data base on minority identity among Southeast Asian refugees. The quantitative data base is a survey of 50 Hmong in a small, nearly all-white city and 50 Cambodians in a large, multicultural city. Even with control variables, the Hmong consistently have a stronger minority identity as measured by social distance, expectations of discrimination, and the belief that their group is disliked by native whites. The project seeks to determine if this difference is due to ethnicity or urban location. Qualitative data from follow-up interviews suggests that ethnicity is a cause of the variation. Cambodian ethnicity has fluid ethnic boundaries which leads to a weak sense of in- and out-group opposition. Hmong ethnicity has rigid ethnic boundaries which leads to a strong opposition between in- and out-groups. Fluid or rigid ethnic boundaries are due to (1) being a majority or minority group in the homeland, (2) one's view of the U.S. state in the Vietnam War, and (3) the role of ancestry in creating kinship groups. Obtaining samples of Hmong from a large, multicultural city and Cambodians from a small, nearly all-white city will provide the needed data to establish that homeland ethnicity can minimize or magnify the formation of a minority identity in the United States.",
