 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs of the  National Science Foundation, supports a project to study  features of the landscape and soils of the Dry Valley region  of Antarctica toward a fuller understanding of past climatic  and environmental conditions.  The dynamic nature of climate  has received growing public attention because of the  occurrence of seemingly extreme weather events recently, and  growing concerns about warming. El Nino and global  greenhouse warming have become familiar topics in the news.  In this context, it is increasingly important to understand  the inherent variability of Earth's climate and how humans  affect can affect Earth's environment.  One important means  of improving our understanding of the Earth's climate system  is to treat the Earth as a natural laboratory and examine  it's past behavior.  One of the most extreme changes in the  Earth climate system during the last few million years is  the transition from a warm period in the Pliocene to an ice  age world.  In Antarctica, this interval of time is thought  to have seen relatively mild conditions give way rapidly to  intense glacial conditions that catalyzed the growth of the  largest ice sheet on Earth. This inference is based on  geologic indicators of past climate from which some  scientists suggest that East Antarctica was relatively warm  and largely free of glaciers about 3-4 millions years ago  (during parts of the Pliocene). The mild conditions ended  abruptly by rapid ice-sheet growth and development of the  very cold, dry climate that now characterizes this region. A  contrasting view, based on substantial geologic evidence,  suggests that East Antarctica has been cold and the ice  sheet stable for at least 8 million years, and perhaps  considerably longer. These views lead to drastically  different interpretations of the stability of Earth's  climate.  This project will contribute to a resolution of  this important dilemma by introducing independent new  evidence and insights der ived from studies of the stability  of ground ice and land surfaces in the Dry Valleys,  Antarctica.  This project will study modern day processes  that have important implications for understanding the  occurrence of buried ice found recently in Beacon Valley.  This ice may be the oldest ice on Earth and, if so, provides  strong evidence of long-term stability of the East Antarctic  ice sheet and may provide a rare glimpse at atmospheric  conditions millions of years ago. Specific processes to be  investigated include: energy exchange at the ground surface  that affect ground temperature, water vapor transport and  other processes leading to the formation or loss of ice in  the soil, and frost cracking due to contraction during rapid  cooling of the frozen ground in the winter and its resulting  disruptions of the soil.",
