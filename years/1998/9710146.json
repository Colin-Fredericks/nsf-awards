 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710146  Scholz         This program is a core project of IDEAL, the International  Decade for the East African Lakes.  The project will conduct an  intermediate-resolution seismic reflection site survey of Lake  Edward, in the northern part of the western branch of the East  African Rift, in anticipation of subsequent drilling.  The primary  goal of the drilling program is to chronicle a quantitative high-  resolution paleoclimate and paleolimnological history of the basin  and surrounding region at 0o-1o S latitude on the East African  plateau, extending back through at least two glacial-interglacial  cycles.  Ancillary goals include answering fundamental questions in  the ares of extensional tectonics, and evolutionary biology and  macroecology in continental rifts.         The principal objectives of this seismic-reflection pre-  drilling site survey are to 1) develop a robust sequence- and  chron-stratigraphic framework for the upper 1000, of sedimentary  section in this half-graben basin, 2) acquire a grid of high-  quality, intermediate-resolution multichannel and single-channel  seismic reflection data for siting one or more drill holes in the  basin, 3) characterize the deformational fabric of the uppermost  crust, and 4) determine the total sediment thickness and depth to  syn-rift basement in the basin.  Important issues to be considered  through interpretation of the seismic data set include developing  a relative lake level curve for the basin; determining which areas  of the lake are likely to contain continuous stratigraphic records;  and assessing the intrabasinal deformational fabric for helping  determine extension direction in the East African Rift.   Integrating the seismic data with the drill hole data sets will  permit the development of quantitative, high-resolution models of  lacustrine rift basin evolution.         Since the primary drilling objectives are focused toward  paleoclimate studies and limited to 100-500 m, and a vessel must be  transported to the lake for the  survey, an intermediate-resolution  survey will be carried out using a small air gun seismic source and  a short (300-600 m) seismic streamer, to acquire ~ 1500 km of data  and image to a depth of ~ 1000 m.  ***",
