 "awd_abstract_narration": "Edwards  9807916    There is growing concern about predicted global climate change with  parallel rises in carbon dioxide (C02) and temperature over the next 50  years, including questions of how this will impact agriculture and  ecosystems. Plants have different mechanisms of assimilating C02 into  organic matter, which will affect their responses to changes in climatic  conditions. One type of plants, called C4 plants, have an active mechanism  of accumulating C02 (a C02 concentrating mechanism). They make a  substantial contribution to productivity on a global scale, and they also  account for some of the world's worst weeds. There is currently speculation  about how C4 plants would be affected by a global rise in C02 and  temperature, and whether they would benefit, or would be threatened  intrinscially by competition from other species. Fundamental to this  question is a) understanding the mechanism of conversion of solar energy  into adenosine triphosphate in C4 plants to power the C02 concentrating  mechanism, and b) determining the magnitude of the diffusive resistance  which allows the C02 to accumulate and limits its leakage from assimilating  sites within the leaf. Wildtype plants of Amaranthus edulis (a C4 weed),  and mutants which lack the C02 concentrating mechanism due to a defective  C4 cycle, will be used to study these objectives. The other objective is to  determine the response Of C4 plants to growth under current, two and three  times current levels of C02 and to determine the interactive effects of  temperature and light intensity. This will include measurements of  photosynthetic rates, leaf expansion, content and activity of key proteins  which catalyze conversion of carbon dioxide into carbohydrates in two C4  species, Amaranth and maize (corn), and one species, sunflower. A major  question is whether C4 species can acclimate to C02 enrichment and rising  temperatures and, thus, maintain a balance between key processes in carbon  assimilation.",
