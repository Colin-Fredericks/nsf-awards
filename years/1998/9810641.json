 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810641  Hogg    The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will undertake a four-year project that   addresses a critical ocean sciences requirement for enhancing long-term environmental   observations in the deep ocean using moorings.  Recent advances in materials, electronics,   and communications technology suggest that significant improvements can be made over   present capabilities.  The PIs propose a four-year project to develop a replacement for the   subsurface mooring that: (1) is less expensive and requires fewer, skilled people to prepare   and deploy, (2) is sufficiently reliable and power conservative that deployments of five   years or more will be possible, (3) telemeters its data back to the scientist, and, (4) is   mechanically simplified to the point that deployment can be done from a vessel of   opportunity. Ultimately, an expendable mooring may be achievable.    The development effort is based on the premise that measurements of ocean currents and   other variables will continue to be of fundamental importance to advancing our   understanding of the ocean and the development and implementation of models capable of   predicting its future state, as well as understanding its present and past conditions. The   development of an efficient, reliable, and long-lived mooring system will make it possible   to attack many problems that previously it would have been futile to consider, but which   have become increasingly important as the field moves to global, climate change issues.",
