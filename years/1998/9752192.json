 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through its Rio Grande River Project, Laredo Community College is developing a two-course undergraduate interdisciplinary program of studies focusing on the Rio Grande River. The program will integrate biology, algebra, trigonometry and the physical sciences using problem-posing, discovery learning, river monitoring and exploration, teleconferencing, microcomputers, and a student-led mini-science symposium, as the culminating activity. The immediate beneficiaries of the project are 100 freshmen and sophomores who will take the courses in fulfillment of their associate degree math and science requirements. The courses are designed for pre-service teachers, and science and math majors, as well as for students pursuing other majors and careers.   The major objectives of the project are: 1) Train faculty to design interdisciplinary math/science courses; 2) Design a two-course sequence which will provide the required foundations in four areas of college math and science; 3) Maintain high level of academic achievement for participating students; 4) Increase career knowledge in math, science and math/science education, especially for female and Hispanic students; 5) Expedite institutionalization of the courses; 6) Manage the project effectively. The major contribution which the project will make to the field of math/science education is its focus on a major national resource at risk (the Rio Grande River) as a means of integrating the four disciplines and the emphasis on developing approaches which are effective with students, specifically Hispanic students for whom English is a second language.  This interdisciplinary approach will be particularly valuable as a model for those students who will pursue K-12 science teaching as a career.",
