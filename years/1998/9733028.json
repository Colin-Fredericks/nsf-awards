In-depth  systematic experiments are planned to study in the following:  1)  the   effect  of  topological  defects  on  structural  symmetry,  electronic structure and reactivity of nanotubes, 2) the  effects  of defect mobility in nanotubes during high temperature annealing  and  electron irradiation, 3) the effect of substitutional  boron  doping on the structure, topology and properties of nanotubes, 4)  the  effect of structure and topology of nanotubes on wetting and  the formation of interfaces in nanotube-based nanocomposites, and  5)  correlation of the information obtained on the structure  and  topology  of  carbon  nanotubes to transport  measurements.   The  studies    will   be   carried   out   by   spatially    resolved  characterization and measurement techniques on pure  single-shell  nanotubes,  pure  multi-shell  nanotubes,  doped  nanotubes   and  nanotube-oxide  layer composites.  State of the  art  microscopy,  spectroscopy,  and four probe conductivity measurements  will  be  done  on  isolated nanotubes for correlating structure,  topology  and properties.  Some of the measurements will be pursued through  industrial and international collaborations.  The main thrust  of  the  educational  plan is to use innovative teaching  methods  to  prepare  students  for  a  modern  and  technologically  advanced  society. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is at the forefront  of  undergraduate  educational  reform  and  in  its  commitment   to  introduce flexibility and innovation into the curriculum, most of  the  courses  are  being  recast into interactive  formats.   The  proposed  educational activities reflect the synergy between  the  long  term  educational  goals of the PI  and  the  institutional  a pproach  to  improving educational methods.   A  wide  range  of  activities  are planned achieve the educational goals:   some  of  these   include  developing  computer  based  structural  models,  demonstrations, short simulations and effective team problems for  interactive  courses,  use  of  multi-media  facilities  in   the  classroom,  developing  modules  for  the  nanomaterials  course,  involving  undergraduates  in  key research  projects,  arranging  formal  and  informal  seminars to  increase  science  awareness,  encouraging  industrial  stays and  international  exchanges  for  students  and  promoting materials science and engineering  as  a  viable career opportunity among secondary school students in  the  area.  %%%  The    basic    aim    of    this   proposal    is    to    study  structure-topology-property  correlation  in  carbon   nanotubes.  Carbon  nanotubes  represent the most  striking  example  of  how  carbon  structures can be tailored to exhibit a variety of useful  properties by changing local symmetries and topology.   Only  six  years  after their discovery, the new knowledge available in  the  field  indicates  that  nanotubes can  be  used  in  a  range  of  applications, for example as nanoprobes and nanoscale  electronic  devices.  It  is  expected that the comprehensive study  proposed  here  will  lead  to  better utilization of  nanotube  properties  leading  to  the development of unique functional nanostructures.  In  addition,  the  PI  will use innovative teaching  methods  to  prepare  students  for  a  modern  and  technologically  advanced  society.  ***",
