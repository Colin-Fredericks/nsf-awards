 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728490  Hulbert     Rp1 is a complex rust resistance locus of Maize which has been extensively characterized genetically. Recent success in transposon tagging the Rp1-D allele will now allow molecular characterization of the complex and the mechanism(s) which act(s) to generate allelic diversity. It is known that meiotic instability of most Rp1 genes is caused by unequal crossing-over which indicates that the Rp1 genes are carried on duplications which retain synaptic homology and frequently mispair. The unequal recombination events reshuffle the Rp1 genes into new combinations, creating allelic diversity. Experiments will be done to determine the mechanism in which novel alleles are generated by the frequent recombination events which occur in the complex. This will be done by characterizing several unique recombinant alleles and comparing them to the parental alleles. The recombinant alleles that will be examined include three which condition rapid necrotic reactions when challenged with any Puccinia species and also cause lesion mimic phenotypes. A second class of alleles that will be examined are those with non-parental race specificities. This class includes five alleles with novel race specificities from a single cross with Rp1-K.     The proposed research is designed to determine the mechanism in which novel alleles are generated by frequent recombination events which occur in this rust resistant complex of corn. Several unique recombinant alleles will be compared to parental alleles. The mechanism whereby race nonspecific adult plant resistance is generated will also be investigated.",
