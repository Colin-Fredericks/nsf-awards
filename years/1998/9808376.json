 "awd_abstract_narration": "9808376  Duman  Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) have now been identified in a number of poikilothermic (cold blooded) animals and plants.  The most active AFPs are found in certain insects, such as the overwintering larvae of the beetle Dendroides canadensis.  Dr. Duman has purified and characterized several of these proteins, and using recombinant DNA techniques he has cloned 13 similar AFPs from this species.  The studies in this proposal will continue to ascertain the relationship between the structure and antifreeze function of the D. canadensis AFPs.  Also, the possibility that various structural differences in the 13 different beetle AFPs translate into functional variation in abilities of the AFPs to lower the freezing point of the hemolymph, prevent freezing initiated by outside ice across the surface of the insect, and/or promote supercooling will be determined.  Certain aspects of the antifreeze activity of the beetle AFPs can be substantially increased by certain protein and low molecular weight solutes such as succinate.  The mechanism of these enhancers will be investigated to understand how to optimize the activity of the AFPs.  Information provided by these studies will have a direct bearing on the numerous potential applications of these extremely active AFPs, such as expression of the insects AFP genes in plants.",
