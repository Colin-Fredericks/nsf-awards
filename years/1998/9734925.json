 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9734925  Smith  In many manufacturing operations, particularly in the aerospace industry, large amounts of material must be removed from workpieces by milling. Frequently the onset of chatter is a limiting factor in the productivity of such operations. Previous attempts to improve the metal removal rate have assumed that the dynamic characteristics of the tool are fixed, and the cutting parameters are manipulated to account for them. In this project, the spindle performance characteristics are considered as fixed, and the dynamic characteristics of the tool are manipulated so that both the tool and the spindle perform best at a speed. The results of this effort will be a set of cutting tools for machining operations with adjustable dynamic characteristics and a procedure for quickly and easily making the adjustment or selection.  At least four methods for adjusting the dynamic parameters of the tool will be explored: 1) Tool length adjustment, 2) Adjustment of the axial position of an internal mass or external mass, 3) Material removal from the interior of the tool, and 4) Material removal from the exterior of the tool.  Successful completion of this project will lead to a way to produce a set of optimally tuned tools for machines. The ability to tune a set of tools to perform well in a narrow spindle speed range will greatly simplify future high-speed spindle development because the spindle will only need to operate in that narrow speed range.",
