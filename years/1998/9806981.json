 "awd_abstract_narration": "9806981  Goodwillie       This project is mainly concerned with the long-range goal of  investigating those aspects of the topology of manifolds that lie  beyond the reach of algebraic K-theory.  The method is a combination   of several kinds of \"functor calculus.\"  One task is to investigate some          interrelationships between these calculi with an eye to strengthening  the general method.  This is expected to involve some foundational work   on Poincare duality complexes.  Another task for the long haul is to  look at what may be called a second-order analogue of algebraic K-theory;  it arises by a kind of quadratic stabilization of manifold phenomena.  For the short haul there is the job of constructing a kind of  second-order analogue of cyclic homology that should be related to the  above as cyclic homology is related to algebraic K-theory.  There is at  least a slight hope that this would yield topologically defined  invariants for four-manifolds that are akin to the well-known  analytically defined Seiberg-Witten invariants.       The word \"calculus\" is used because of an attractive analogy with  the ordinary calculus of functions.  Sometimes, of course, the way to  settle a numerical question is to see the answer as a value of a  function; by means of the powerful apparatus of calculus, properties of  the function can lead to a computation of the number.  Likewise, a fact  about some geometrically defined object is sometimes best proved by  viewing the object as a particular value of a functor and using the  apparatus of some kind of functor calculus. This analogy may show  something of the flavor of the work; the content is harder to describe  to the non-expert, because most of the \"geometric\" objects in question  are connected to everyday reality by rather long chains of abstract ideas.   ***",
