 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    On today's Internet, packets are delivered in a best-effort manner.  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is standardizing support  for realtime packet delivery on the Internet. The viability of  relaxed, as opposed to hard guarantees, realtime services depends  fundamentally on the ability of its measurement-based admission  control algorithms to determine which connection can be admitted to  the network without violating service specifications.  Previous  research has demonstrated the viability of measurement-based admission  control algorithms and relaxed realtime services.  However, two  important questions remain.  First, independent of any specific  algorithm, what traffic characteristics can serve as primary  indicators to guide the setting of an algorithm's parameters?  Second,  can global inefficiencies resulting from the local nature of  independent admission decisions be minimized?  This research proposes  to use equivalent token-bucket filter of aggregate traffic to guide  the setting of the admission control algorithm's parameters, and to  apply a market-based approach to global resource allocation.  While  there is a sizeable body of literature in the application of  market-based control to the allocation of computing resources, no previous  work on distributed resource allocation that involves multiple  resources and takes into account transaction costs, i.e.~the cost to  negotiate and execute a transaction, has been reported.  Further  information on this project is available from  http://irl.eecs.umich.edu/jamin/research/CAREER.html.",
