 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9800920  Yang   Micro-crystalline ceramics are widely used in electronics and optics.  The nature of these applications requires that the surfaces be very smooth and free of deformation damage.  For the generation of smooth surfaces it is essential that material removal occur by a plastic microcutting process.  The contact between a hard, rigid indenter and a ceramic surface provides a good model system for studying material response and material removal mechanisms of relevance to various machining processes.  In this project, a technique uniquely suited for analyzing microplasticity in ceramics of relevance to material removal processes will be developed for estimating the yield strength and elastic-plastic, stress-strain behavior of ceramics from low-load indentation tests.  It will involve measurement of the onset of plasticity underneath an indentation, determination of the force-penetration curve, and finite element modeling of the indentation process.  The mechanism of material removal will be studied using low-load, scratch experiments with optically transparent ceramics.  This configuration provides a unique setting for directly observing the deformation and fracture phenomena occurring in the contact zone.  Cutting forces, deformation mechanics, and the threshold load for ductile chip formation will be analyzed in these experiments, together with the effect of parameters such as indenter shape and scratch velocity.  A finite element model of the plastic cutting process leading to continuous chip formation in ceramics will be developed by exploiting the analogy between machining and asymmetric, wedge indentation of a solid indenter.   The study is expected to lead to a fundamental understanding of surface generation in machining of ceramics and the controlled generation of ultra-smooth surfaces for electronics and optics.",
