 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733621  Young  The objective of this research is to (i) establish the  mechanisms of desorption resistance for organic chemicals in  soils and sediments, (ii) develop predictive models and  improved experimental techniques for assessing desorption  rate limitations and (iii) quantify the potential risk  variation resulting from desorption resistance by  incorporating these predictive models into contaminant  transport and risk assessment models. The presumptive  mechanism underlying this research is that desorption  resistance arises when organic compounds migrate to remote  locations within rigid, condensed natural organic matter  networks (NOMs) that significantly impede diffusion out of  the matrix. This hypothesis will be tested by examining  organic chemical desorption equilibria, rates, enthalpies  and activation energies from natural materials containing  diverse NOM types and quantities into both aqueous and  supercritical carbon dioxide solvents. Predictive models of  the desorption process will be developed by correlating NOM  structural characteristics with model parameters. Desorption  rate limitations will be incorporated into existing  transport models, forming the basis for revised risk  assessment models that can be used to estimate the impacts  of the phenomenon on soil cleanup standards.    The educational plan seeks to illustrate the importance of  fundamental physical-chemical process models by linking them  with chemical transport and risk assessment models. Chemical  equilibrium and rate models will be linked to transport  models for groundwater and surface water and, subsequently,  to risk assessment models. Training on how policy-makers and  managers analyze engineering design options, using tools  such as risk and cost-benefit analysis, is being integrated  into courses. Case studies will be prepared using the soil  risk assessment model developed in this research.",
