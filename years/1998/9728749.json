 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728749  Silver    This grant provides partial support of the costs of acquiring a  geodetic global positioning satellite (GPS) receiver system and  five mobile computers for use in active tectonic field research.  This proposal is the Instrumentation and Facilities (IF)  counterpart of a companion research proposal submitted to the  Geophysics (PH) program (EAR-9725792) which has recently been  recommended for award.  The research focus is to determine, via  GPS field campaigns, the distribution of strain across the  convergent margin in Papua New Guinea.  The PI, together with  Papua New Guinean collaborators from UNITECH, will establish a  GPS network in Papua New Guinea in June 1998 and again in June  2000 to measure baselines.  This instrumentation proposal will  provide a single GPS receiver system that will be monumented and  left in Papua New Guinea so that scientists from UNITECH can re-  measure baselines between field campaigns conducted by UC-Santa  Cruz scientists.  Thus, this collaboration provides not only  additional valuable baseline data in an area of rapid deformation  and potential earthquake hazards, but also serves as a fruitful  technology transfer to scientists within Papua New Guinea and  their students.  ***",
