 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adeyeye  9727813    The success of arthropods as terrestrial animals is attributable partly to  their cuticle, a versatile structure that acts as a covering and skeleton.  Ticks belonging to the genus Ornithodoros can live for many years even when  starved. Moreover, the relapsing fever tick, Ornithodoros tuncaln, shows  remarkable resistance to desiccation. This project will investigate whether and  how the cuticle of 0. Turicata is biochemically modified in order to cope with  starvation and/or desiccation. Comprehensive biochemical analyses of fed and  starved 0. turicata cuticle will be conducted. In particular, proteins of  interest will be purified and characterized using various techniques.  Also  cuticular lipids of sequentially starved ticks will be analyzed. The cuticular  permeability will be determined and its possible correlation with changes in  cuticular lipids and proteins will be ascertained. Two other ticks that differ  in cuticular permeability and in starvation/desiccation hardiness shall be  studied to permit broader generalization about the role of cuticular proteins  and lipids in the of 0. turicata resisting desiccation. Because so little is  known about the chemistry of the cuticle of soft ticks, the proposed studies  will expand existing knowledge vis-a-vis the structure and functions of tick  cuticle.",
