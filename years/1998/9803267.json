 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803267  Newman   This research is in the general area of Probability Theory with special emphasis on   a number of stochastic models with interesting spatial structure. One specific topic is first-  passage percolation based on d-dimensional Poisson point processes, with particular   emphasis on results related to the existence and nonexistence of semi-infinite and doubly   infinite geodesics. A second major part of the work concerns a class of voter models in   random environments which exhibit  the intriguing phenomenon of \"chaotic time   dependence.\" This is when the model (which is a Markov process in time) has multiple   invariant distributions and the distribution at time t (starting from a randomly selected   initial state) does not converge as t tends to infinity. A smaller, but significant, part of the   research involves continuum scaling limits of minimal spanning trees in the plane.    In the general area of probability theory, an increasingly important role has been   played in recent years by systems in which random effects are observed in the spatial   structure rather than in (or in addition to) the behavior as a function of time (as in models   of equity prices). Some of these models, such as first-passage percolation, have arisen   separately in multiple contexts, such as fluid flow in porous media (which is relevant for   example to modeling of pollutant dispersion in aquifers), polymer structure, and other   parts of materials science. There are also connections to combinatorial optimization (as in   the minimal spanning tree problem, which is a variant of the classical traveling salesman   problem of designing optimal routings) and thus to various parts of theoretical computer   science. The research under this grant concerns the mathematical phenomena that occur in   several representative examples of such stochastic systems with interesting spatial   structure. One particular issue of study is the connection between randomness in the   spatial environment and chaotic depe ndence in time.",
