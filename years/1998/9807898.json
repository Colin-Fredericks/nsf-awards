 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nDBI 9807898; Kimerling, John; Oregon State University\r\n\r\nA prototype database and web access system of turtle biodiversity data will be built and \r\nmade available worldwide to a variety of users in the systematic, museum, conservation, \r\nand land management communities. This prototype will be used to characterize users and \r\ntheir needs and should lead to a second generation system that could be permanently \r\ninstitutionalized. The prototype will be immediately useful to international groups dealing \r\nwith the declining turtles crisis. The data will consist of every known locality of all 263 \r\nfreshwater turtle and tortoise species with appropriate documentation. In addition to \r\nsupporting the usual text queries, the database will have associated tools for visualization \r\nof models of species ranges against environmental data and for analytical queries using a \r\nglobal grid system. We will develop a system that can be tailored for use by anyone from \r\nthe most sophisticated user to the least. The system must be usable by both a well-\r\nendowed museum in a developed country and the least well-equipped park ranger in a \r\ndeveloping country. In contrast to most web development, the system will rely on multiple \r\ndata distribution methods to support heterogeneous users, postal services, more \r\nestablished web protocols, and the newest technologies may all be employed to achieve an \r\nacceptable level of service to users. Data access and visualization tools will be usable on \r\nthe most common computer hardware and operating systems.\r\n\r\nThe three-year design will initially focus on building the prototype up to implementing the \r\nvisualization components. This initial phase includes database design, data migration, \r\nestablishing the development environment, and building the site for user interaction. \r\nSubsequent work will add visualization tools and further refine the overall system design \r\nbased on feedback from users, to include documentation and distribution methods. These \r\ndesign and implementation methods will be valuable to similar conservation efforts across \r\na global user community.\r\n\r\n",
