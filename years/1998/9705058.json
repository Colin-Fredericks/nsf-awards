 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705058  Lukens    Experiments  will  be  undertaken to explore  the  quantum  mechanical  behavior  of a macroscopic variable---in this case, the magnetic flux through  a  ring.  A  particular focus of this work will be to understand the  effect  of  the  environment  (damping and temperature) on the evolution  of  the  flux  from  purely  classical  to  quantum.  The  system  to  be  studied   is   a  superconducting  loop   containing   a  Josephson  junction  (SQUID)  which   undergoes  transitions  between  two  fluxoid states by tunneling through a potential  barrier  between  potential  wells. The system energy is quantized within  each  fluxoid  well as  has  recently been confirmed using macroscopic resonant tunneling.  At  low  temperatures  only  the lowest state in a well is occupied,  giving  a  model  two  state  system. These states differ in magnetic  moment  by  about  10^10  Bohr magnetons---a very macroscopic quantity. The primary goal of this  work  is  to  attempt an observation of macroscopic quantum coherence  (MQC)  between  these two states and to understand the role of the environment in  determining the extent of such coherence.  %%%  Quantum  mechanics predicts many `strange' phenomena  which  are  very  much at  odds with our everyday experience. This was illustrated rather vividly  in  the early years of the field by Schroedinger -- one of the founders of  quantum  mechanics  --  through  a  thought  experiment  in  which  he  postulated  his  cat in a state where it oscillated between being dead and  alive.  We are  usually spared the consequences of these paradoxes since they tend  to  only  arise in atomic scale systems: interactions with the rest of the world  prevent  them  from  occurring in the sort of macroscopic  objects  we  encounter  in our everyday lives. Recent advances in experimental technology are,  however, predicted to make it possible to observe such effects (called  macroscopic quantum coherence (MQC)) in a superconducting system known  as a  SQ UID, which generates a magnetic field (or magnetic moment as  it  is  more  correctly known) about 10 billion times greater than that of an  atom.  In  our experiments, which must be performed a few thousandths of a degree  above absolute zero, we hope to be able to observe this system in a  coherent superposition of states with the magnetic moment pointing  up  and  down.  ***",
