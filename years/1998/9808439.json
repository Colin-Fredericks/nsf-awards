 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program (CRIF)  will assist the Department of Chemistry of SUNY at Stony   Brook in acquiring a preparative ultracentrifuge.  The areas of chemistry   enhanced by the equipment include: (1) the design and characterization of   new magnetic contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging, (2) the   synthesis of coenzyme A and palmitoyl-coenzyme A analogs, (3) the folding  of the ribosomal protein L9 and of the E3/E1P domain, (4) the role of   protein surface loops and hinges in the reactions catalyzed by   triosephosphate isomerase and the interfacial enzyme cholesterol oxidase,   (5) the binding site for fertilin-beta in its receptor, (6) the synthesis   of polyfunctional organosilanes as inhibitors of aspartic and   metalloproteases, (7) the study of the interfacial enzyme phospholipase D   and (8) the spectroscopic analysis of the molecular forces leading to   catalysis in the reactions catalyzed by enoyl-coenzyme A hydratase and   enoyl-acp reductase.  The instrument will also be used in two advanced   undergraduate laboratories.  Ultracentrifugation is a technique used   mainly to aid in the isolation and purification of proteins.  The   capability of chemists to carry out cutting edge research in bioorganic   chemistry  demands access to state-of-the-art preparative   ultracentrifuges.",
