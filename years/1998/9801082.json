The complex interaction between these two energy sources makes stream food webs difficult to study.  This project will use cave streams as surrogates for surface streams to better understand organic matter use in stream food webs.  Because cave streams rely exclusively on terrestrial organic matter for energy (there is no light in caves for green-plant photosynthesis) the roles of various organic matter types can be more easily examined. The PIs will determine the importance of particulate and dissolved organic matter in stream food webs by comparing energy processes in multiple cave streams with and without particulate organic matter input.  Specifically, the investigators will examine the effects of leaf and wood input on particulate and dissolved organic matter availability, transport, transformation, and use in stream food webs.",
