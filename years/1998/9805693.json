Focusing on adaptability in active networks (for flexible control of services), transmission scheme (for reliability), and anomaly management (for bandwidth constraint, etc.); the project will also provide training to a Postdoctoral Associate, while  considering both wide area networks and mobile networks. Two directions constitute the main thrust. The first aims towards extending the infrastructure for experimenting with adaptable communication services. The second conducts a series of experiments that evaluate a variety of adaptability schemes. Two sample experiments explore Feasibility of Active Techniques in Adaptability and Re-transmission Scheme and its Effect on Reliability. Since Raid Laboratory has an infrastructure for experiments in  adaptability, communication, and video conferencing, these experiments are conducted there. The experiments, along with necessary software tools, will be designed by the postdoc; thus significantly increasing both the quality and variety of experiments that are planned and the system support for the Ph.D theses of graduate students. This research can make emerging applications to run at top efficiency and optimize network resources.",
