 "awd_abstract_narration": "The tools used in the field of medical informatics are those of  knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) or alternatively, data  mining. KDD spans a variety of fields: statistics, pattern  recognition, artificial intelligence, and data warehousing.  However, it has become a distinct discipline with its own  objectives. The purpose of data mining is to extract previously  unknown and potentially useful information. KDD differs from the  more traditional statistical tools by focusing on model   identification while minimizing misclassification. Statistical  methods tend to focus on estimation and model identification. The  hypotheses generated by the KDD process must then be validated by  standard statistical techniques.    It has become increasingly clear that more traditional techniques  are not adequate because of the size and complexity of the  databases. One 450-bed hospital maintained a database with six  months of laboratory tests and medications as well as summaries  of patient followup for 15 months. The storage capacity of the  computer had to be increased by 12 gigabytes. The dependence upon  an investigator examining relationships in the data must yield to  an automated process. KDD can generate interesting and unexpected  hypotheses which can be examined by statistical methods. The  automatic hypothesis formation and testing cycle can continue  until important patterns emerge.    This project involves the study and development of data mining  techniques applied to several databases primarily stored in the  Alliant Health System. This includes a database containing a  25-year followup on a cohort of 10,000 women in Kentucky to  examine patterns of health and lifestyle.  In addition, the  techniques will be applied to a database of student  information to examine relationships between student habits,  student success, and student learning. Using the developed  materials and databases, a course will be taught to students in  the Department of Mathematics on applications of data mining.      This GOALI project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
