 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs of the  National Science Foundation, supports an international  collaborative research project involving New Mexico  Institute of Mining and Technology, USA, and the British  Antarctic Survey (BAS).  The objective is to understand the  origin, emplacement, and evolution of Jurassic (180 million  year old) basaltic rocks in Antarctica which formed when the  Gondwana supercontinent started to disintegrate.  The  research team will test a new unified model for this 180  million year magmatic activity in which the magmatism is  caused by a single mantle superplume and is a major factor  in continental rifting.  Within Antarctica, the Jurassic  basaltic rocks are divided into two provinces: Ferrar Large  Igneous Province (FLIP) and the Dronning Maud Igneous  Province (DMIP) (the official US name for Dronning Maud Land  is Queen Maud Land - the foreign term will be used for  purposes here because the project is collaborative with  BAS).  The origin of the FLIP is problematical and a plume  origin has generally been discounted because of its lateral  distribution over 3000 km along the Transantarctic Mountains  and also in southern Australia.  The FLIP is characterized  by unusual geochemical compositions, which has been  attributed to their origin from an enriched mantle source.  In the model being investigated by this research team, the  FLIP magma would have been significantly contaminated in an  upper continental crustal magma chamber (probably the Dufek  Intrusion) whereas the DMIP has distinctly mantle-like  chemical characteristics but still shows some evidence of  modification by crustal material.    In this research, the team will examine and sample the rocks  of the DMIP and rocks of the FLIP in the Theron and  Pensacola Mountains and Dronning Maud Land.  The team will  conduct an integrated study of the age, geochemistry, and  structural relationships of the FLIP and DMIP.  Radiometric  age determinations will examine the age relationship  between  the FLIP and DMIP.  Models for upper crustal contamination  of the FLIP magmas will be tested using isotopic studies and  geochemical modeling.  Other studies, conducted by BAS  collaborators, include a regional aerogeophysical survey to  determine the size and shape of the Dufek Intrusion and a  detailed survey will search for a feeder dike system from  the body.",
