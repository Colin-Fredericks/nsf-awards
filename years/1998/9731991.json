 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731991    The Research Opportunities for Minorities Program is a  highly rigorous but exciting research-training program for  undergraduates and post-baccalaureates who belong to groups  underrepresented in basic-science research.  The program  provides participants up to 2 years of intensive research  training in molecular biology through the Biotechnology (BT)  Programs at Massachusetts Bay Community College (MBCC).  Concomitant or prior admission to the BT program at MBCC is  a prerequisite for entry into the ROMP. The majority of  research training occurs in the BT laboratories at MBCC, the  most advanced undergraduate research facility in the nation.  However, each ROMP student undertakes at least one summer  research externship at one of over 50 eminent research  institutions in the United States and abroad.  Representative of these are the Marine Biological  Laboratory, Woods Hole; the Texas Medical Center, Galveston;  The University of Edinburgh, Scotland, and the Molecular  Biology Institute of the University of Quebec, Canada.  For  every student admitted, the ROMP begins with an intensive 10-  week molecular-biology research project conducted at MBCC in  the summer preceding their Fall entry into the BT program.  The projects are designed to be expandable and extend into  the subsequent academic year.  During the academic year, all  ROMP students are assigned 4 or 5 entering Freshman BT  students who must conduct tangential sub-projects under the  direction of ROMP students.  This mentoring role is designed  to foster leadership skills and research-management skills  in ROMP students.  In the second summer of the ROMP,  participants can undertake a challenging research externship  at one the many foreign and domestic research institutions  that collaborate with the ROMP.  Summer research projects  are then extended into the second and final year of the  Program as described above.  ROMP students are assisted in  advancing to baccalaureate or graduate-degree programs by  MBCC, which h olds numerous transfer and application-  articulation agreements with colleges and universities  throughout the United States and abroad.",
