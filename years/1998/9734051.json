Model  antiferromagnets  will  be used to study  surface  and  interface  magnetic  excitations and surface magnetic ordering phenomena  of  artificial  heterostructures. There is  much  interest  in  these  materials because they have simple structures and therefore  they  can  be understood theoretically and their behavior modeled by  a  computer. The results will significantly contribute to our  basic  understanding of low-dimensional magnetic systems,  and  will  be  used  to  understand  more complex systems  that  have  important  technological    applications.   A   novel    waveguide-thin-film  spectroscopy  will be employed to probe the magnetic excitations.  Additional  information  regarding the antiferromagnetic  surface  long  range order will be obtained from magnetic measurements  of  ferromagnetic  overlayers and neutron reflectivity  measurements.  The  educational objective of this proposal is to develop science  outreach and recruiting programs in the State of West Virginia to  prepare  students for the technology-based economy of the twenty-  first  century. The educational portion of this project  will  be  composed  of  three  parts: 1) integration of  collaborative  and  hands-on  activities into the physics curriculum at West Virginia  University;  2) participation in science outreach and  recruiting  programs  in  the State of West Virginia; and 3)  involvement  of  undergraduate physics students directly in the research program.  %%%  This  is  a  CAREER  Award  to an EPSCOR  grantee.  The  research  objective of this project is to study the magnetic properties  of  interfaces  between  model  magnetic  materials.  There  is  much  interest  in these materials because they have simple  structures  and  therefore  they  can be understood theoretically  and  their  behavior  modeled  by a computer. The results will  significantly  contribute to our basic understanding of very small magnets,   and  will  be  used  to  understand more  complex  systems  that  have  important  applications in magnetic storage and  magnetic  sensor  applications.
