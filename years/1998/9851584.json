 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational chemistry is used extensively in biochemical research in applications ranging from the design of potential new drugs to the structural characterization of macromolecules. Yet, most undergraduate biochemistry curricula do not include this vital discovery tool. Instead, students typically perform wet chemistry laboratories with little consideration for molecular level interactions. This project addresses this deficiency by exposing students to macromolecules and their interactions both experimentally and computationally. We are integrating computational calculations with corroborating experimental investigation, utilizing the new workstations, software and spectrophotometers. Completion of the proposed laboratory exercises enhances students' understanding of how the molecular structure of macromolecules is related to physiological function and observed experimental results. These laboratories should be of interest to educators who are searching for new approaches to teaching important biochemical concepts and relationships. The results of the project are being disseminated though presentation at a national American Chemical Society meeting and through publication both in chemical education journals and in a biochemistry laboratory manual.",
