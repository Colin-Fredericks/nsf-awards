By using this construction, the principal   investigators were able to extend Floer homology from the semi-positive   case to all closed symplectic manifolds and consequently to solve the   non-degenerate Arnold conjecture completely.  By using certain refinements   of this construction, they established a general relationship between   non-vanishing of certain GW-invariants and the existence of closed orbits   of Hamiltonian systems.  As one of the applications of this, they solved a   stabilized version of Weinstein conjecture.  Base on these results, the   principal investigators propose further investigations on the Arnold   conjecture for degenerate case and some other unsettled cases of the   Weinstein conjecture.    Hamiltonian equations arise from classical mechanics, celestial mechanics   and many other physical systems as fundamental equations governing the   motions in such systems.  The dynamics of Hamiltonian systems describes the   evolution of the \"classical\" world.  One of the important steps to   understand the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems is to understand their   simplest dynamic behavior, the periodical orbits.  The basic questions   here, known as the Arnold conjecture and the Weinstein conjecture, are   about the existence and the number of closed orbits of Hamiltonian systems.    Both of these conjectures have been considered as main guiding problems in   the subject of symplectic topology.  The methods developed by the   investigators of this project to solve the non-degenerate Arnold conjecture   and stabilized Weinstein conjecture have opened the door for investigating   the Arnold conjecture for the degenerate case and the Weinstein conjectur e   for general symplectic manifolds.",
