 "awd_abstract_narration": "This summer research program for undergraduates in Cell and Molecular Biology supports undergraduate research in laboratories of leading researchers in the biological sciences at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.  Members of minority groups underrepresented in biological research and students from institutions without broad research facilities are selected for the program based on research interests and potential commitment to a research career.  During a 9-week program, each student works on an independent research project in a faculty mentor's laboratory.  Depending upon the project, participants learn current techniques including DNA cloning, PCR sequencing, in situ hybridization, cell culture and Western blotting.  They also participate in workshops on specific research areas, bioethics, advice from graduate students and preparation for the Graduate Record Examination.  Students write and orally present a research proposal during the beginning of the program, and, at the conclusion, submit a paper summarizing their work.  The paper is presented at a symposium for the participants.",
