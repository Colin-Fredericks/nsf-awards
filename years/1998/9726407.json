A plant is resistant if it experiences little insect damage relative to   other plants in the population.  In contrast, a plant is tolerant if it experiences   damage, but that damage has little effect on plant fitness.  Although most studies of   the evolution of plant response to herbivory have only considered resistance,   a theoretical model suggests that resistance and tolerance do not evolve   independently. This work will test several specific assumptions and   predictions of that model.  These predictions include the cost to plants of   being either resistant to, or tolerant of, damage, the genetic structure of   populations experiencing herbivory, and the type of natural selection imposed   on populations by insect herbivores.  Testing these predictions will involve the use of   quantitative genetic methods to quantify genetic variation for resistance   and tolerance to several common insect herbivores, including the stem and   head-boring lepidopteran, Suleima helianthana, the head-clipping weevil,   Haplorhynchites aeneus, the seed-feeding weevils Smichronyx fulvus and S.   sordidus, and the head-feeding lepidopteran Homeosoma electellum.  These   data will also be used to measure natural selection on resistance and   tolerance, the pattern of correlations between resistances and tolerances   to different herbivores, and the costs of these characters.  In addition,   mechanisms of tolerance will be examined.  Previous work suggests that   tolerance may typically be considerably more costly than resistance.   However, little is known about characters conferring tolerance, and thus,   little is known about why tolerance may be costly.  The hypothesis that variation   in plant life history leads to variation in tolerance will be tested..  Additional   experiments will quantify resource allocatio n patterns and floral phenology,   and will determine if these characters are correlated with the ability of plants   to tolerate insect damage.            Herbivory by insects is generally detrimental to plant fitness.  In   addition, genetic variation for resistance to herbivory is nearly ubiquitous   in natural plant populations.  These data suggest that insects should   frequently impose natural selection on plant resistance, and further, that   such selection should proceed until either plant populations are maximally   resistant or genetic variation is exhausted.  That selection has apparently   not acted in this way has stimulated considerable interest.  One explanation   for this anomalous result is that resistance is costly to plants.  If this   is the case, then resistant plants should have high fitness in the presence   of insects, but low fitness, relative to susceptible plants, in the absence   of herbivores.  This is because when herbivores are absent resistant plants   bear the cost of resistance but receive no benefit.  However, many attempts   to quantify costs of resistance have failed.  This work will determine   whether simultaneously considering resistance and tolerance allows costs of   these characters to be detected, and may provide one explanation for the   abundance of genetic variation for resistance in natural plant populations.",
