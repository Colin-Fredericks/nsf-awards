The most common idea is of a single  reward system; the favorite candidate for such a system is the  mesoaccurnbens dopamine system, originating in the ventral tegmental area  of the midbrain and terminating in the nucleus accumbens of the  forebrain. The experiments in the proposal are designed to test the idea  of two separate reward systems. One centered in the nucleus accumbens,  receives a glutamatergic input from the subiculum and a dopaminergic  input from the ventral tegmental area. It is involved in activating the  motor programs of \"appetitive\" behaviors, such as exploration and  locomotion. The second, centered in the ventrolateral striatum, receives  a glutamatergic input from the sulcal prefrontal cortex and and  dopaminergic input from the substantia nigra. It is involved in  activating the motor programs of \"consummatory\" behaviors, particularly  feeding.       The experiments are largely devoted to behaviorally examining  hypothesized roles of glutamatergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic  neurotransmission at the accumbens and ventrolateral striatal nodes of  these functionally distinct systems. This will be done by intracerebral  microinjections of drugs, which affect specific receptor subtypes of the  glutamatergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic systems. The injections are  proposed to modify responding of rats for electrical self-stimulation of  ventral subiculum or sulcal prefrontal cortex in ways consistent with  known electrophysiological effects of these drugs.       These experiments also emphasize the idea that these \"reward  systems\" are actually \"behavior systems,\" wherein dopamine modulates  activity in hierarchically organized neural systems of cortical origin.  Self-stimulation of subiculum and sulcal prefrontal cortex develops very  slowly; the development seems dependent upon the number of stimulations,  not the number of responses. Thus  it appears more like neural activity-  dependent plasticity than response-dependent learning. To examine this  phenomenon, the investigators will test the idea that the development of  this brain stimulation reward depends on activity at glutamate receptors  of the NMDA subtype.",
