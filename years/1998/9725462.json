 "awd_abstract_narration": "V. Ara Apkarian is suported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to perform semiclassical molecular   dynamics simulations of quantum dynamic effects in extended systems.    This approach has already been developed and employed successfully for   gas-phase spectroscopy. The methodology is now being applied to the   spectroscopy of cryogenic solids, condensed hydrogen, and hydrogen-bonded   networks, as well as room-temperature liquid resonance-Raman and   photon-echo spectroscopies.  Quantum effects are simulated with a `black   box` dependent only on inputted potential energy parameters.  Due to the   many degrees of freedom in these applications, the computations are very   intensive.  This is partially remedied by relying on short-time   propagation with wavefunction reconstruction through repeated Monte Carlo   sampling.   In order to understand quantum dynamics in systems of large   dimensionality, such as liquids and solids, new simulation methods are   needed.  In condensed phase spectroscopy in particular, connecting   observables to the underlying molecular structures and their motions   currently relies on approximate techniques.  Theoretical developments   that aim toward a microscopic understanding of condensed phase spectra   are invaluable tools in the interpretation and design of experiments.",
