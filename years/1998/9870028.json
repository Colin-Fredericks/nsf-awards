 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many engineered devices and biophysical systems become  unstable when subjected to certain changes in their  environments.  Such instabilities can result in a  substantial loss of efficiency, or in catastrophic failure.  These instabilities can sometimes be controlled by feedback  mechanisms that constantly monitor the system's behavior and  compare it to a mathematical model of the desired behavior.       The research proposed here addresses issues that arise  when faithful mathematical models are unavailable or when  some characteristic of the system makes it impossible to  implement more conventional control methods.  The research  will focus on the use of time-delay methods that substitute  the past behavior of the system itself for the computed  ideal reference state.       This research should be viewed as part of a long-term  scientific effort to understand the dynamics and control of  large systems, but short-term results relevant to areas of  current engineering interest are expected as well.  Two  examples of primary interest are semiconductor lasers, which  have instabilities that occur on extremely fast time scales,  and electrical activity in the heart, a complex system for  which sufficiently accurate mathematical modeling is  extremely difficult.",
