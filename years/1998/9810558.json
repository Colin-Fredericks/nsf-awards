The COWS system, which combines molecular recognition synthetic membrane technology and optical guided wave sensor technology, will detect biological pathogens with speed, sensitivity, specificity, and simplicity. The concept of this technology is to mimic cell membranes that selectively and rapidly respond to numerous molecules. Artificial membranes are environmentally very stable and can be designed to undergo distinct chromatic transitions when such molecular recognition events occur at the surface of the membrane. The sensor chemistry will be synthesized on optical waveguides to enhance detection limits and sensitivity for absorption-based measurement. The Phase I work will study the feasibility of combining these two technologies. The farm-to-table food chain provides many opportunities for contamination. Food testing is required at every step in the production process, but a biosensor system that is comprehensive and practical for routine in-situ or in-line inspection is not available. \r\n       The ability to detect reliably and quickly the presence of biological pathogens is an important need in our society. A real-time sensor can be used to rapidly detect disease, in hospitals and in the home. It can also benefit food safety inspections, detection of biological weapons, and environmental monitoring.\r\n",
