 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the study analytical and dynamical aspects   of generalized wave maps and the Yang-Mills equations. From the analytical   standpoint we plan to address fundamental questions such as existence,   uniqueness, and formation of singularities for these models.  Specifically   we will consider wave maps with torsion and will study how the addition of   the torsion tensor affects propagation of regularity and development of   singularities for these equations. From the dynamical standpoint we will   start by considering the integrable versions of wave maps with torsion, as   well as other integrable equations, and will study how homoclinic   solutions behave under perturbation.  Specifically we will study how the   persistence of homoclinic orbits leads to chaotic systems. We will also   attempt to quantify the difference between temporal chaos and spatial   chaos, which is observed numerically in perturbations of the above models.   We will test for spatial chaos by actually computing the probability   distributions at two spatially distinct points and show that the mutual   information function decays to zero at an exponential rate.    Many physical phenomena are described by equations which have a geometric   interpretation.  The best known examples are Maxwell's equations and   Einstein's equations for gravity. These physical models pose challenging   mathematical questions whose answer will add significantly to our   understanding to the nature of things.  For instance, blackholes are   interpreted as a certain type of singularity that occur in the equations   of general relativity.  However in addition to blackholes, these equations   also exhibit another type of singularity called naked singularity, which   are purely mathematical and do not exist in nature.  In this project we   will consider models and study the existence and nature of singularities,   and how the geometry of the problems influence these issues.  This study   will help in the understanding of how , and of what type, singularities may   develop in the given systems.  We will also study the onset of chaos in   deterministic partial differential equations, which can exhibit spatial   chaos as well as temporal chaos.  In such systems the precise physical   information is usually lost and replaced by statistical quantities.  In   addition to this, the equations themselves become less useful and should   be replaced by effective probablistic equations to capture the stochastic   nature of deterministic spatial-temporal chaos.  In this project we will   develop tests for the occurrence of spatial chaos based on mutual   information, which measures the amount of information transmitted   spatially by the equation.  We will also attempt to develop a   mathematically rigorous procedure to derive from the original systems the   relevant effective probabilistic models.",
