 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bdellovibrios are procaryotic predators which prey on susceptible gram negative bacilli basteria. The unique predatory and intraperiplasmic growth phase makes the lifestyle of the bdellovibrios different from that of other bacteria and places these organisms in a distinctive class. Although the bdellovibrios are widely distributed in nature, little is known about the diversity of the organisms in various ecosystems.  Characterization of different isolates of the predatory bacteria has been insufficient to allow for more than a rudimentary classification scheme and taxonomic system. The halophilic group of the bdellovibrios are all placed in one group in the existing system. This situation exists because state of-the art molecular methods used to differentiate among bacterial species and subspecies have not been applied to the study of these organisms.   The aim of this project is to use the available molecular fingerprinting and ribosomal RNA sequencing techniques to differentiate among over 40 isolates of bdellovibrios in Dr. Williams' collection, which is the most extensive one known. Isolates in this collection were obtained from various environmental sources from wide geographical areas of the world including the Chesapeake Bay, coastal waters of St. Johns Island in the Caribbean, Puerto Rico, Bermuda, Hawaii, several isolates from soil, sewage and rivers in Russia and water and soil samples from Nigeria.  Another major aim of this project, which is consistent with those of the Minority Career Advancement Award, is to provide the Principal Investigator with the opportunity to develop expertise in the application of molecular techniques to his area of expertise, the ecology of the bdellovibrios.",
