Specific study areas proposed for this  funding period include:       a) The physics of wind instruments, including a new  application of nonlinear dynamics and the analysis of time  series to an investigation of the degrees of freedom of  reeds, lip reeds, and vocal folds;       b) The \"directional tone color\" of violins, including  design of special \"DTC loudspeakers\" which mimic their  directional characteristics'       c) The physics of \"dissected instruments\" (in which a  computer link is inserted into the fast oscillation loop of  an instrument), including the coupling of a dissected violin  corpus to an actual violin;       d) Research into the directional characteristics of the  reverberation of a room, with particular applications to  architectural acoustics.  As in the past, this work has implications not only for  fundamental physical understanding and for the building of  better musical instruments, but also for other areas of  science such as nonlinear vibration analysis, wave  propagation, and psychoacoustics.  Its special merit in  educating physicists is that it constitutes the type of  research in which even undergraduates can be fruitfully  involved.  ***",
