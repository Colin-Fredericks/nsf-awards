 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708664  Miller         In a series of meetings between 1987 and 1992, a consensus  developed in the academic community that the timing and magnitude  of past eustatic sea level changes and their relationships to  stratigraphic sequences should be determined by drilling borehole  transects on passive margins.  Three crucial time intervals were  identified:  the Oligocene to Recent \"Icehouse World,\" when  glacioeustatic changes were clearly operating;  the Cretaceous  \"Greenhouse World,\" which apparently lacked significant ice sheets:   and the Paleocene-Eocene \"Doubthouse World,\" a time for which  debate continues over the existence of ice sheets.         To address sequences and sea-level changes, the P.I.s designed  the \"New Jersey Sea Level Transect\" as a series of boreholes from  the onshore NJ Coastal Plain across the shelf to the slope and  rise.  The New Jersey Sea Level Transect is the first step in a  global campaign to evaluate relationships between global sea level  and passive continental margin sequences, to determine the timing  and amplitude of sea level variations, and to evaluate mechanisms  of sea level change.  The onshore component, the NJ Coastal Plain  Drilling Project, has completed 4 boreholes at Island Beach,  Atlantic City, Cape May, and Bass River.  This project is for the  completion of the NJ Coastal Plain Drilling Project by drilling a  2000 ft borehole at Corson's Inlet, NJ and a 1200 ft borehole at  Parvin, NJ.  ***",
