 "awd_abstract_narration": "9807470  Shimizu      In nature, macromolecular self-assembly is nearly an ubiquitous  process, yielding complex three- dimensional structures and  architectures. Flexible polypeptides and polysaccharides are  folded and assembled into materials of exemplary mechanical,  recognition, and catalytic properties.  Proposed are three  synthetic polyimides that similarly self-assemble into structures  of precise dimensions and organization.  The resulting, hexagonal  array, interwoven sheets, and conformational switch are unique  due to their nano-scale dimensions, highly organized topologies,  and entirely synthetic composition.  As a consequence, novel  biomimetic and materials properties are anticipated.  Envisioned  are applications as:  (1) models to understand the fundamental  process of biological self-assembly; (2) rationally designed  materials such as organic zeolites and conductors; (3) materials  with biomimetic properties such as replication, specificity, and  templating abilities.  However, the most attractive attribute of  the proposed polymers is ease and low cost with which these self-  organizing materials can be synthesized.  All three polyimides  are fashioned from a similar framework composed of 1, 3-  disubstituted benzenes linked by 1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimides.  These synthetic polymers can be prepared by conventional  polymerization and processing techniques from inexpensive  starting materials.  Complementing this synthetic economy is the  efficiency of the self-assembly process.  Spontaneously, arrays  of intra-and intermolecular contacts are formed with high  fidelity and specificity.  Finally, the synthetic accessibility  of the polyimides and highly coherent structures of their  assemblies enable their rational elaboration into more complex  extended architectures and materials.  %%%  This project should enhance our ability to design novel materials  through self-assembling processes in a direct and benign way  exemplified by nature.  ***",
