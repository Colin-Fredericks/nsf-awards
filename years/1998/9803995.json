Integrating  the concepts and techniques of solid-state chemistry with the  well established and full curriculum of chemistry based upon  molecular concepts will continue to be a goal of the solid-state  chemistry summer program.  Selected students and teachers will be  offered opportunities to interact with internationally known  solid state chemists from various universities and industries  through a program of tutorials, site-visits, and summer research.  They will devote the summer period to tutorials on solid state  chemistry, and research on individual projects will be conducted  by the participants in university and industrial laboratories  across the U.S.  The results of these efforts will be presented  by each participant in a final symposium.  %%%  The scope and importance of solid-state chemistry is increasingly  recognized among students, university faculty and industrial  scientists not only because of the discovery of new classes of  materials of high technological relevance, but also because of a  deeper fundamental understanding of the diverse properties of  solids that is made possible by the availability modern  techniques.  Contributions to solid-state chemistry are now made  by researchers active in multidisciplinary areas of research that  include materials science and engineering, chemistry, chemical  engineering, physics, and mineralogy/geology.  ***",
