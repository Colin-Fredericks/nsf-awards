Headquartered at the University of Tennessee, the Center has several collaborating institutions, including East Carolina University.  \r\n\r\nIn this project, a prototype instrument will be developed and used that integrated self-modeling curve resolution (SMCR) software with fiber-optic UV/visible spectrograph an and  an automated four station mini-reactor/calorimeter into one package.  The prototype instrument for making lab-scale and pilot-scale measurements of synthetic organic reactions.  Commercial transmission and reflectance probes will be used for in-situ measurements.  A small business partner, H&A Scientific, will design and produce the prototype instrument by integrating, OEM components with SMCR software produced with technology transfer support from East Carolina University (ECU).  One of the main goals of this project is to develop a user interface that reduces the complexity of the SMCR problem as perceived by the instrument user.  A small development team at H&A Scientific will undertake this aspect of the project.  A second prototype instrument will be assembled with funds provided by Glaxo Wellcome, Inc (GWI) to H&A Scientific.  The two prototype instruments will serve as test beds for user interface design and ease of use at ECU, and by non-chemometricians and research scientists at GWI.  Both business partners (H&A Scientific and GWI) are expected to make significant contributions in this area.  \r\n",
