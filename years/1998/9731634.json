 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robert Cave of Harvey Mudd College, a RUI institution, is supported by   the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the Division of   Chemistry to investigate electronic coupling elements in electron   transfer reactions.  He will use his own recently published methods to   treat ground and excited state electron transfer reactions in a variety   of systems of experimental interest.  He will address orientation and   distance dependences of electronic coupling with and without solvent,   superexchange processes in hydrogen-bonded transition metal adducts, and   effects of thermal averaging and dielectric continuum electrostatics on   the electronic coupling matrix element.    Electron transfer processes play an important role in a wide variety of   chemical reactions, such as photosynthesis.  The ubiquity and importance   of these reactions in organic and inorganic chemistry has led to   concerted experimental and theoretical research attempting to unravel the   details of this simplest of chemical reactions.  Sophisticated electronic   structure methods in combination with molecular dynamics simulations are   being used in this study to characterize donor-acceptor electron coupling   in electron transfer reactions.",
