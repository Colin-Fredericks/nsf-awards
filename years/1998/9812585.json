 "awd_abstract_narration": "9812585  Feng  The enhanced structural performance of bridge columns retrofitted  by steel or fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite jackets has  been well demonstrated and a large number of highway bridge  columns have indeed been retrofitted with such jackets in the  United States and Japan.  However, seismic damage of the columns  covered by the jackets and thus made invisible can considerably  weaken the columns.  In order to solve this problem.  this  project will develop nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques,  particularly electromagnetic (EM) and ultrasonic imaging  technologies, and experimentally investigate their effectiveness  for assessing post-earthquake damage of reinforced concrete  columns wrapped with steel or FRP jackets.  Under consideration  are damages such as delamination cracks, debonding between  concrete and reinforcing rebars, delamination between concrete  columns and jackets.     The primary tasks of this research include (1) development of  prototype EM and ultrasonic imaging devices, (2) further  development of the image reconstruction algorithms for both EM  and ultrasonic devices, (3) verification of the EM and ultrasonic  imaging technologies by testing the prototypes on steel-and FRP-  jacketed bridge columns damaged to different levels in  laboratory, and (4) verification of the EM and ultrasonic imaging  technologies by field testing on steel- or FRP-jacketed bridge  columns.    The PI is currently directing an experimental testing program  funded by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the  California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), and the  Society for the Advancement of material and Process Engineering  (SAMPE), where twenty-seven half-scale bridge columns wrapped  with different FRP jackets are tested and damaged under cyclic  loads in both single and double bending configurations.  This  program provides and excellent opportunity to verify the  effectiveness of the proposed technologies in detecting damage in  the columns and voi ds in the bonding interfaces, with no cost to  the proposed project for building and damaging these columns.    To facilitate closer collaboration and promote educational  benefit, graduate students will be selected to spend two summers  at PWRI to conduct joint experiments in Japan, while one junior  research engineer from PWRI will spend one summer at UCI to  participate in the field experiment involving Caltrans bridges.   This project will also expose undergraduate students to  interdisciplinary and collaborative research experience.    This is an award under the first round (FY'98) competition of the  CMS-INT initiative NSF 98-36 \"US-Japan Cooperative Research in  Urban Earthquake Disaster Mitigation\".  ***",
