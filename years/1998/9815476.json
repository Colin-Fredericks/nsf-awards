Pui/University of Minnesota\r\n\r\nPartial travel support will be provided for young researchers and academic invited speakers to the ESF (European Science Foundation)/NSF Symposium on \"Aerosols for Nanostructured Materials and Devices\", Edinburgh, Scotland, September 12, 1998.  This symposium is immediately prior to the 5th International Aerosol Conference.  It will present the most recent research results obtained by both parties, evaluate trends and opportunities in the field of synthesis and processing into materials and devices of nanoparticles produced via aerosols.  Areas of relevance will include functional nanostructures in ceramics and electronics, optical and opto-electronic devices.  The meeting will bring together European scientists, particularly from the ESF NANO-network (Vapor-phase Synthesis and Processing of Nanoparticle Materials), and US scientists, particularly those with NSF funded projects.  An emphasis is on connection between aerosol science and material science community in the area of nanotechnology.  Twelve young researchers from US researchers and ten from Europe have been selected for participation and will present papers.  A purpose of the meeting is to facilitate the establishment of long term cooperation among researchers in both regions.\r\n",
