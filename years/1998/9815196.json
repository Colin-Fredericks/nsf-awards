Specifically, the workshop would bring together researchers working in the areas of control theory, signal processing , communications, computer science and operations research, from different institutions such as universities, industry, national laboratories and other government agencies to foster the creation of new research directions in the area of communication networks.  The emphasis of this workshop would be wireless networks, including physical layer phenomena, and congestion control, scheduling and pricing in high-speed networks such as the Internet and ATM networks.  A total of  about 80 people will be invited to the workshop, of which there will be about 15-20 speakers, with enough time for discussions.  The presentations will emphasize on an overview of the research area and open problems, thus promoting the goal of the workshop which is to set new research directions.",
