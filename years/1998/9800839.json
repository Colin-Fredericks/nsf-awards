 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a collective professional response to the NSF supported conference on Earth System Education and the resultant report of recommendations contained in \"Shaping The Future of Undergraduate Earth Science  Education.\"  It provides an operative step by involving a wide spectrum of the geoscience community in the undergraduate earth system curriculum reform effort.  Several dozen individuals, from two year community college institutions, to doctoral research institutions, will participate in a working conference to begin to plan an appropriate and collective geoscience response to a major undergraduate earth system curriculum reform effort.  Workshop participants will develop guidelines for development of content, pedagogical strategies, and instructional material for the new curriculum.  This curriculum reform program parallels earlier calculus and chemistry reform initiatives and is intended to bring a more integrated, earth systems approach, to the introductory geoscience sequence.  The activity is projected to be a multi-year, multi-institutional, effort and is designed to strengthen curriculum for majors and enhance offerings for non-majors.  Specific outcomes from this initiative will be: a content framework for a two-semester introductory, undergraduate, Earth system science curriculum; a curriculum template that will serve as the content framework model; a time table, resource and organizational framework for the comprehensive curriculum reform effort.  A workshop report will be published and sent to Chairpersons of all U.S. undergraduate geoscience departments and geoscience professional organizations.  The report, including personal perspectives, instructor commentary, and links to other Earth system related reform efforts will be available on a project Web site.",
