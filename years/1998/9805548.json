 "awd_abstract_narration": "9805548  Donald, Bruce Randall  Dartmouth College    CISE PostDoc: Microrobotics and MEMS    Combining rapidly evolving technologies -- MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS), distributed robotics, and biotechnological systems -- to create large collections of autonomous, intelligent micro-machines offers new capabilities that can be exploited for a variety of useful purposes.  By merging sensing and actuation with computation and communication, MEMS devices can be distributed throughout the environment, coated on surfaces, or embedded within everyday objects to create distributed systems for sensing, reasoning about, and manipulating events in the physical world on a scale never before possible.    A primary component of this research is the exploration of how to program massively-parallel MEMS microactuator arrays.  Drawing on biological inspiration, arrays of artificial flagella and cilia provide actuation in the form of manipulation or locomotion. Asserting a coordinated effort by the aggregate array requires addressing the parallel actuation of individual robotic agents.    The impact of a postdoctoral candidate includes: (1) new designs and processes for massively-parallel MEMS devices, (2) biologically-inspired systems and devices to implement massively-parallel manipulation and locomotion, and (3) control software and algorithms for arrays of artificial flagella and cilia. Experiments will be performed to validate the theory. This work is interdisciplinary, combining results from computer science, biology, and engineering.",
