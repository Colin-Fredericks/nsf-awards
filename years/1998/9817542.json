We seek NSF funding for four specific activities that will make a\r\n  critical difference in the creation and establishment of new models.  The first two\r\n  are directed to the cultivation stage.  The third is a pilot project for a fellowship\r\n  program that bridges recruiting to graduate mentoring.  Finally, we ask\r\n  assistance in supporting an innovative scheme to provide faculty leadership for\r\n\r\n  The four activities are\r\n\r\n1.\tAn applications-oriented Summer Mathematics Workshop to facilitate\r\n\tinquiry-based learning.\r\n\r\n2.\tExpanded opportunities for students at other universities to have a\r\n            meaningful summer research experience at the University of\r\n            Michigan.\r\n\r\n3. \tA Fellowships to Faculty pilot to encourage individual faculty\r\n            initiative in recruiting minority students.\r\n\r\n4. \tA Faculty Leadership Committee, reporting to the Provost and the\r\n            Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigators, that will review\r\n            activities and progress within SEM departments, approve pilot projects\r\n            for improving recruitment and retention of minority students, and assist\r\n            and advise SEM departments and the Graduate School on the\r\n\r\n",
