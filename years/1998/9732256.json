 "awd_abstract_narration": "9732256    This REU program will provide a rich research experience to  undergraduate students who will be recruited primarily from  small colleges in the midwest and historically black land-  grant universities, where research opportunities for  students are rare. Formal communication and personal  networking will be used to attract students from these  institutions. Iowa State University has an active group of  researchers who perform state-of-the-art research in  molecular biotechnology. For eight weeks during the summer,  they will guide ten students to participate in research  projects involving molecular techniques. Projects will  include generation of recombinant DNA, genome analysis,  overexpression of foreign genes in bacteria and plants,  molecular genetics, and transgenic animals. The students'  experiences will be enriched by several activities outside  the laboratory setting. These structured interactions will  include discussion sessions on bioethics and different  aspects of biotechnology research and careers. The students  will also visit biotechnology facilities on campus and in an  industrial environment. In addition, several social  functions with mentors, graduate students, postdoctoral  associates and other biotechnology researchers will  encourage informal interactions. The impact of summer  research training will be assessed through formal  evaluations immediately after the training. Informal  contacts with the students and their parents will be used to  monitor progress and career decisions of the students. This  program should excite the students about research and foster  interest in research careers.",
