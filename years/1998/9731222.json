 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731222  Liu    The proposed research project represents a joint effort by  U.S. and Chinese researchers to establish the tsunami  modeling and mitigation capablility in China.  A numerical  model developed by the U.S. investigator will be used to  investigate the impact of tele-tsunamis generated in the  Pacific seismic rim on the China coast.  The effects of the  continental shelf and the offshore island chain will be  examined.  By so doing, a database for bathymetry and  topography along the China coast will also be established  and will be available to the international research  community.  The second task of the poposed reseach project  is to study the 1992 Hainan island tsunami.  Since there are  five tidal gage records available for the event, it is an  ideal situation to test the hydrodynamic inverse algorithm  for determining the seismic parameters in the source region.    The P.I. of the proposed research project is Professor  Phillip L.F. Liu, School of Civil and Environmental  Engineering at Cornell University.  A half-time graduate  student will assist on the project.  The Chinese  investigators are Mr. Yu Fujiang and Ms. Ye Lin of the  National Marine Environmental Forecast Center of China.  The  duration of the research is 24 months.",
