 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to provide our students with laboratory experience in modern Fourier transform-based multinuclear 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance applications. The selected instrument uses an existing 1.4 Tesla permanent magnet augmented with FT probes shims and software to permit student operation with minimal training. This will allow students to begin to use the instrumentation early in a sophomore organic laboratory course. Chemistry majors and minors will continue to work with NMR applications in later analytical, physical, and advanced organic courses. They will become familiar not only with routine applications for simple structural identifications, but with advanced applications such as COSY, inversion/recovery measurements of T1, temperature-dependent exchange kinetics, and saturation transfer studies. Since this is not a high-field magnet system, the sensitivity and resolution will not match that of a typical superconducting NMR. In an educational setting, these disadvantages are offset by the fact that the proposed system is relatively easy to Maintain, the purchase and operating costs are much lower, and the versatility of the probe and software will still permit students to set up and run sophisticated range of experiments.",
