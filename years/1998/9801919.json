A primary example of such a system is the quantum  Hall  effect  occurring in a buried two-dimensional electron  gas.  The  SCA   microscope  permits  very  high  resolution,    about   0.1  micrometer,  examination  of  such  systems  which   are   inside  materials. The research topics being pursued include the  quantum  Hall  effect, the 2D metal-insulator transition and  also  single  impurities and electron traps in semiconductors. A key element of  the  ongoing  work  is to determine the correlation  between  the  structures  seen  in SCA images of the quantum  Hall  liquid  and  features in the transport properties of the 2D system. A topic of  interest  also  is the behavior of spin textures  or  \"skyrmions\"  which  exist around the n=1 Hall plateau. Estimates of the  sizes  for  skyrmions and a possible skyrmion crystal place them  easily  within  the  range of SCA measurements. This research program  is  interdisciplinary in nature and involves graduate  students,  who  receive   excellent  training  in  preparation  for  careers   in  industry, government laboratories or academia.  %%%  This  experimental basic research project focuses on  application  of a new imaging method, the Subsurface Charge Accumulation (SCA)  microscope  to  the  new  physics in  low-dimensional  electronic  systems.   The  new microscope allows imaging of electron  charge  distributions on a scale of about 0.1 micrometer. This resolution  does  not  allow  atoms to be seen, but does  allow   imaging  of  broader  distributions  of  buried  charge,  which  is  of  great  importance in many semiconductor situations. A primary example of  such  a  system is the quantum Hall effect occurring in a  buried  two-dimensiona l  electron gas. The SCA  microscope  permits  very  high  spatial  resolution examination of such systems  which  are  inside  materials.
