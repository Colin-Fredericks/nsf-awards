 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project takes place over the next two academic years (Fall 1998 through Spring 2000). Each year a small group of students (20-24) take part in a combined calculus and physics course. In the first year the students are recruited from the physics department and the electrical engineering department.  The project team's initial energies are focused on the development of course materials. Once the materials are in place, the program expands to a include a greater number of students.    The format of the class meetings follow a studio setting. A physics course is currently meeting in a studio setting, and the experience gained during this current semester are used to further develop the course. The activities that take place this summer concentrate on the development of the materials for the calculus thread. This development begins by examining the materials from the current studio physics course, deciding on the order that the calculus materials are introduced in the course, and developing the appropriate course materials.    The second summer is dedicated to updates and revisions after the first pilot course is given. Based on the feedback and evaluation of this first pilot program, changes are made as appropriate. As the materials are revised we also take advantage of this period by organizing and cataloging the materials. The efforts to organize and formalize the materials allow us to offer a workshop during the third summer.    The second pilot program will also consist of a small cohort of students. The experience offers a test case in order to further refine and evaluate the materials assembled. Again, physics students and electrical engineering students are recruited for these sections.    During the third summer (2000), a workshop is offered for faculty with an interest in implementing their own program.  The course materials are assembled and in near final form after the third summer.  The materials are distributed at the workshop. The workshop offers an important method of disseminati on, and it also allows us a chance to test the materials for clarity and usability.",
