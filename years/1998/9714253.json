Under this Program, the National Science  Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Office of Naval Research  are jointly evaluating and supporting research of high priority to the USWRP.                    The intense winds and rainfall! associated with landfalling hurricanes are  organized on smaller scales than those that can be forecast using currently available   analyses and models.  Although much of the damage caused by hurricanes results  from small-scale and rapidly changing features of the core, the physical mechanisms  governing changes in the winds, convection and related phenomena are poorly  understood.  There is, however, growing evidence that the major changes and  asymmetries observed in the cores of hurricanes are strongly modulated by larger-  scale features that can be predicted.  A promising approach to improving forecasts of  the structure and intensity of hurricanes near landfall is to improve our quantitative  understanding of these causal relationships.        This research program will study the mechanisms by which hurricane  structure and intensity vary near and after landfall using a series of numerical  simulations of hurricanes.  A state-of-the-art non-hydrostatic model will be used to  simulate rapid, small-scale variations in the hurricane core as it responds to imposed  variations in wind speed, vertical wind shear, large-scale gradients and anomalies of  potential vorticity, and changes in boundary layer processes.        A primary focus of the study will be on the manner in which the imposed  variations in external circulations and surface properties affect the hurricane's  secondary circulation, and hence modulate the magnitude and distribution of  convection. The re search will also analyze the manner in which asymmetries in the  storm convection, including convection in the spiral rainbands, affect the storm's  intensity and core structure.  The results should provide significantly improved  understanding of the processes governing rapid changes in hurricane structure, and  they should be of immediate use in improving forecasts of the winds, storm surge  and rainfall in hurricanes.  ***",
