Each of the projects will be presented by its Principal Investigator.      Project Showcase will take place at the ASEE Annual Conference in Seattle, Washington in June 1998.  The exhibits will number 20 and will be held for one day, with follow-up \"user groups\" for a select group of PIs.        In addition to the showcase sessions, this effort will support a mini-plenary, \"Crossing the Great Divide.  Can the Engineering Community Truly Collaborate with the Education Community?\"  Participants will lead a discussion concerning efforts to get the engineering education community more actively involved in effective teacher enhancement and teacher preparation projects for K-12 education.",
