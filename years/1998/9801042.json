 "awd_abstract_narration": "9801042  Lee    Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) consist of a strain-tolerant  ceramic layer and a metallic bond coat, which provides  oxidation protection to metal alloys.  The dominant failure  mode observed in these material systems is the progressive  fracture of the interface region between the bond coat  surface and its oxide scale upon exposure to oxidation.  One  potent avenue for improving the scale adhesion at the bond  coat surface is to incorporate one or more reactive  elements, such as Hf or Zr, into a NiAl diffusion coating  formed by aluminizing the surface of a Ni-based superalloy.  This grant results from recent manufacturing advances in  aluminizing by chemical vapor deposition (CVD).  In contrast  to the close-batch pack cementation and gas phase pack  methods traditionally used for aluminizing, the dynamic  nature of the open-flow CVD technique offers the promise of  proactively controlling dopant concentration and  distribution in the coating matrix.  Previous studies with  bulk alloys and intermetallics have shown that, in order for  the beneficial effect to be operative, a reactive element  must be present in a well-controlled level and distribution  in the matrix material.  Stevens Institute of Technology in  collaboration with General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE)  is exploring the synthesis, characterization, and  performance issues associated with the CVD doping concept.  This is accomplished under the NSF-GOALI concept, which is  ideal for long-term exploration by collaborative university-  industry research activities.  This research project  effectively integrates Stevens' strengths in conducting  kinetic experiments, coating characterization, and  mathematical modeling with GEAE's expertise as a leading  aircraft engine manufacturer with unique characterization  and test facilities.  The Division of Materials Research and  the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities jointly fund  this grant.  %%%  Extending the surface functionality of advanced metallic and   ceramic materials has been a vital area of research and  development for high temperature structural applications.  Currently a strong technological need exists to improve the  performance of \"traditional\" structural materials, such as  Ni-based superalloys, via surface coating and modification  approaches.  ***",
