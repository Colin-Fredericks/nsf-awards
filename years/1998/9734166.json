 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of proprietary designs (reusable cores) as part of VLSI systems on a chip  depends on having reliable and efficient techniques for intellectual property  (IP) protection. This research investigates techniques for such protection. It  includes a watermarking (signature hiding) approach for protecting CAD tools,  reusable cores, and embedded software. Also being explored is a fingerprinting  scheme, and a covert channel-based technique for the efficient detection of  misappropriated (stolen) IP. The watermarking approach is the addition of design  and/or timing constraints in the design specification which encode the author's  signature. Fingerprinting techniques are meant to deter people from illegally  distributing IP by enabling the author of the IP to uniquely identify the  original buyer of a resold copy. The concept of covert channels is the basis for  techniques which convey to the author information without alerting an illegal  owner of IP. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques and algorithms will be  demonstrated on industrial strength designs.  The educational plan includes the  development and use of watermarking techniques and video games for teaching IP  protection techniques and other material.",
