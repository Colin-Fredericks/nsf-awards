 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reuhs\r\n     Soybeans account for the majority of cultured legumes and the effective nodulation of these legumes is the subject of considerable research. Wild-type Sinorhizobium fredii USDA257 does not infect the roots of most North American soybean cultivars. However, a mutation in the nolXWBTUV gene region extends the host range of this bacterium and allows it to nodulate many domestic soybean cultivars, including Williams. Interestingly, the infection of Williams soybean by the mutants is blocked if the wild-type strain is present in the inoculum, and preliminary results show that the nol mutations directly affect the expression of bacterial cell surface polysaccharides. The goal of this project, therefore, is to determine the structural changes that are associated with the nol mutations and to identify the factor(s) produced by wild-type cells that limit its host range. In addition, two novel polysaccharides, which are abnormally expressed in the nol mutants and may be bacteroid-specific surface components, will be structurally characterized. Monoclonal antibodies will be raised against these polysaccharides and used to probe for their distribution in bacteroids from many S. fredii host plants. These objectives are part of a broader goal of understanding the role of the bacterial cell surface in the infection and differentiation process, which ultimately lead to bacteroid development and N2 fixation. This project may also provide new insights into the function of the microbial cell surface components in plant-pathogen interactions, as the nol gene region is homologous to the hrp genes of Xanthomonas and Pseudomonas.\r\n     Biological nitrogen fixation in the legume-rhizobia symbiosis is an important part of worldwide agriculture, and the nitrogen-enrichment of cultivated soils by microorganisms that form a symbiotic relationship with legumes (e.g. bean, pea, soybean, and alfalfa) is a renewable source of environmentally safe fertilizer. To exploit and improve this resource and to reduce the requirement for potentially harmful chemical fertilizers, the mechanisms of the infection process that allow the bacteria to form N2-fixing nodules on the plant root must be understood. The molecular basis for infection and nodule development determines, in part, the compatibility of a bacterial cell with a potential host plant and, therefore, the efficiency of nitrogen fixation.\r\n\r\n",
