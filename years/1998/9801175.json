 "awd_abstract_narration": "9801175  Fenner and Wackford    This research focuses on the imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) that has become an invasive pest throughout the southeastern United States. Where it has invaded, the fire ant reduces diversity of other arthropods, and in particular it eliminates most other ant species. While a strong competitor within its native range in Brazil, the fire ant does not achieve the same level of total dominance there and in fact coexists with a diverse community of native ants. This research will examine mechanisms of competition and population regulation within an ant community in the native range of the fire ant, in Brazil.  Three mechanisms that could allow coexistence between the fire ant and other ants will be tested: 1) tradeoffs between dispersal ability and competitive ability, 2) mediation of competitive ability by species-specific parasitoids, and 3) seasonal spatial structure that leads to self-limitation.  This research will be one of the first to study the community interactions of an invasive ant species within its native range. Results of this work will be of immediate practical value in designing biological control programs directed at the fire ant in the southeastern U.S.",
