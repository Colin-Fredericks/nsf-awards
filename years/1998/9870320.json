 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims at developing a unified and integrated theory of implicit (i.e. machine independent) computational complexity, and applying it in programming languages, program design and development, and feasible mathematics.  The project proposes that implicit computational complexity can be rooted in the spectrum of weak set existence (i.e. comprehension ) principles.  By transfer principles, such as proof theoretic conservation, data ramification, Schoenfinkel-Curry-Howard morphisms, and boundedness, one obtains known and new characterizations of major computational complexity classes by methods of proof theory, function algebras, lambda calculi, and finite model theory.     A unified implicit computational complexity theory would enable the development of software environments for program derivation and verification, which will assure that the computer programs produced are not only demonstrably correct, but can also be executed within feasible computation time and memory.  Thus, the proposed work would bring abstract conceptualizations, rooted in philosophy, to bear on concrete applications of immediate technological value.",
