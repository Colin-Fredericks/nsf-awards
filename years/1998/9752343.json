 "awd_abstract_narration": "The studio mode of teaching that has been developed at Rensselaer promotes learning, excites students' interest by involving them directly in knowledge acquisition, fosters development of communication skills, and allows tailoring the educational process to varied needs of a diverse student population. This project in biochemistry is designed to expand and improve computer-based learning modules, and to create an integrated package of instructional materials for teaching biochemistry in a studio format.  These materials will  include: (a) instructions for in-class studio activities, such as problems to be solved, data to be analyzed and graphed via spreadsheets, structural motifs to be examined using molecular modeling software, questions to be researched for in-class discussion; (b) notes and diagrams in a form allowing computer projection as well as viewing on a computer screen, for use in short lectures within the studio context; (c) instructions for accessing and using software; (d) sample test questions; and (e) interactive multimedia tutorials. The tutorials will use a mix of text, graphics, audio, videos and animations to illustrate biochemical principles, facts and mechanisms. The learning modules will be designed for distribution to students via intranets and/or the World Wide Web. They will be used to teach Molecular Biochemistry I and II at Rensselaer to a mix of advanced undergraduate and graduate students. A separate course to be delivered in summers to high school teachers, will use the same materials. Results of quizzes and evaluations to be carried out will guide a continuing process of expansion and improvement of the package of instructional materials.",
