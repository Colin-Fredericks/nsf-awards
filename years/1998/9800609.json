He will also consider the fine structure of the reduction of the Shimura varieties of PEL-type,.  This is a natural extension of his recent results on the density of ordinary Hecke orbits of Shimura varieties of PEL-type.  In a new direction of investigation, Professor Chai will try to apply the technique of l-adic cohomology to particular exponential sums that have arisen in recent work in graph theory.\r\n\r\nThis work in a modern area of Number Theory known as arithmetic algebraic geometry.  Number Theory is the study of the counting numbers, 1, 2, 3, etc. and is the oldest branch of mathematics.  Just as the complicated name suggests, arithmetic algebraic geometry is a synthesis of three different areas of mathematics.  In the last fifty years, mathematicians have found that familiar objects from geometry, like the curves that appear as the graph of a polynomial equation, can be much better understood by viewing them as abstract algebraic constructions.  This powerful idea revolutionized geometry.  In time number theorists realized that many of their most difficult problems could be posed and then solved in terms of these abstract algebraic descriptions of geometric objects.  As often happens in mathematics, this ever increasing level of abstraction has actually produced many very concrete and practical results.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
