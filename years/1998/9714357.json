 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract/Young ATM-9714357    The term  green flash  refers to a class of poorly understood atmospheric refraction   phenomena that have been observed by reliable observers for many years on  occasion when the sun is near the horizon.  It is often described as a brief  flash  of  green light at the upper edge of the setting sun, but the term is misleading, for  several reasons.  First, there are several different observable phenomena that have  been called  green flashes  in the past.  Second, the colors can range from yellow to  violet.  Third, there is no flash literally.  One can speculate that the term  flash  has  been applied because of the brevity, not the intensity, of the phenomenon.    There is a simple, but mostly inadequate, model that attempts to explain the  phenomenon in one of its forms.  There are neither quantitative theories nor  qualitative explanations for any of the other observed forms.      The objectives of this research are 1) to determine how many different atmospheric  refraction phenomena can be grouped under the heading of the phenomena know  popularly as  green flashes ,  2) to assess the relative importance of molecular  absorption as a causative factor, and 3) to develop a model to predict the observed  colors and to compare the predictions with existing observations.  The achievement  of these objectives will not only move the phenomena from the poorly-understoood  category to the at-least-basically-understood category but also but also provide  insights regarding possible techniques that might be developed to determine at least  the algebraic sign of the temperature structure of the boundary layer passively under  certain conditions that might eventually be of practical use.",
