These efforts will feature energy dissipation as a result of magnetization where Bloch walls interact with regions that have different magnetic properties from the matrix.  The researchers intend to emphasize pinning of magnetic domain walls on larger voids, non-magnetic inclusions, and regions of high localized stress.\r\n\r\nThis cooperative work will involve comparing theoretical model calculations with experimental data measured on iron and nickel based alloys.  Results should provide a more complete theoretical framework for the description of magnetic properties of materials, i.e., hysteresis curve modeling, thereby improving our understanding of microstructural effects on magnetic properties.  If successful, findings may be applied in magnetic nondestructive evaluation methods, an area of broad interest in materials research and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis project in theoretical materials research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.\r\n",
