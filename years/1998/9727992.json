 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract  Context Dependence of Learning and Memory Processes    Memory is usually best when the act of remembering takes  place in a presence of the background stimuli ( contextual  stimuli ) that were also present when learning occurred.  However, this is not always true; memory for some types of  material is not very context- dependent.  This project seeks  to understand why some memories are context-dependent and  others are context-independent.  It will study the role of  contextual stimuli in classical conditioning, a fundamental  example of associative learning that is connected with many  aspects of cognition and behavior in animals and humans.  Rats will learn that one stimulus, such as a tone or a light  or a distinctive flavor, signals the occurrence of another  stimulus, such as a food pellet or a mild footshock or  malaise.  The signal comes evoke behaviors that indicate  that learning (and also remembering) have taken place.  The  project will test the effects of changing the context on  various forms of this kind of learning.  Some, but not all,  are context-dependent.  For example, if a signal is  associated with different stimuli (e.g., shock and food) at  different times, the second association, but not the first,  is typically context-dependent.  The project will test  several ideas of why this should be so.  It will also study  several different kinds of cues that can provide a   context.   This research will have major impact on theories  of learning, memory, and acquired motivation.  It will also  be relevant to research on the neurobiology of learning  memory.  And the results may help us design better cognitive-  behavioral therapies of human behavior disorders (e.g., drug  dependence and anxiety), which may be successful or not  depending on whether the learning they involve is context-  independent.",
