 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award to Wayne State University is made under the  high performance connections portion of ANIR's \"Connections to  the Internet\" announcement, NSF 96-64.  Wayne State will connect  its campus-wide ATM backbone network to the National Science  Foundation's very high speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS) by  establishing an OC-3c connection to MichNet, the statewide  computer network operated by Merit Network, Inc.  The connection  at Wayne State University will complement the high performance  connections that Merit is establishing with the help of NSF  (NCR-9616938) at the University of Michigan and Michigan State  University.  Collectively these OC-3c connections will support  special research requirements at Merit, Michigan State  University, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State  University.  This NSF award provides partial support for the  Wayne State component of Merit's OC-3 infrastructure, which is  connected to the vBNS in Chicago.    With this high performance connection, Wayne State will expand  current research and collaboration with both academic  institutions and federal laboratories.  Wayne State's OC-3  connection will support research related to automatic  parallelization environments for distributed high performance  computing, a collaborative digital library, quantum chemical  reaction dynamics, quantum molecular dynamics, and high energy  physics.  Each of these projects will benefit considerably from  the increase in network bandwidth and performance, bringing  substantial advances to research in these fields.  In addition, a  high performance connection at Wayne State will encourage other  faculty to pursue research opportunities that require access to  resources at other vBNS connected sites.",
