 "awd_abstract_narration": "Magdalenian culture marks the apex of the Paleolithic period in European prehistory. Covering the time span from ca. 16,000-11,000 years ago, the conclusion of the last Ice Age, Magdalenian peoples occupied an area which extended from Spain through northern Germany. Famous rock paintings in caves such as Lascaux and Altimera were produced by the Magdalenians and carved bone and ivory figurines constitute some of the earliest known art mobilier in the world. From an anthropological perspective the group is interesting because of the broad range of subsistence adaptations displayed. Through analysis of within-culture variation, it is possible, one hopes, to discern basic organizing principles. The site of Miron is particularly interesting in this context because it is situated near the southern end of Magdalenian distribution and is in a montaine location. With National Science Foundation support Dr. Straus and his collaborators will conduct four seasons of archaeological excavation at the site.       Miron is a huge cave dominating the intermontaine valley of Ason and is surrounded by high Cordilleran crests and summits. Because of it's size, it approximates an open-air site since activities conducted within it would have been relatively unconstrained. Preliminary excavation has revealed stratified Magdalenian deposits rich in lithics as well as faunal remains. Because of its sheltered nature, it provides an ideal locus for the study of long-term environmental change through sedimentology, geomorphology, micromorphology, palynology, paleobotany and paleontology. This range of studies will be conducted by collaborating specialists from the Universidad de Cantabria. The site has yielded rock engravings stratigraphically datable to the Magdalenian and is likely to produce additional artistic remains.        This project is important for several reasons. It will shed new light on prehistoric adaptation at a hunting and gathering level of technology. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists and assist in training a number of both Spanish and American students.",
