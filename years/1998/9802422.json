The 42nd meeting will be held on June 3-7, 1998.  The dates for the other two years will not be determined until 12 months prior to the meetings.  This conference is primarily concerned with the biology of prokaryotes, and is the major annually occurring meeting devoted to this subject area.  One significant feature of thes meetings is their accessibility to graduate students and post-doctoral students, whose travel funds frequently are limited.  Specifically to address this problem, funds are being used to provide travel and support scholarships to facilitate the attendance of graduate students and post-doctoral students working in various areas that comprise prokaryotic biology.",
