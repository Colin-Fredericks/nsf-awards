Gupta and Mary Ellen Bock, Purdue University  Proposal Number: DMS 9801130  Project: Sixth Purdue International Symposium on Statistics    Abstract:     This international symposium will be held from June 17 to 21, 1998,  at Purdue University.  The symposium consists of a workshop June 17-19  on \"Synthesis and Interfaces of Major Statistical Paradigms\" and a   conference June 19-21 on \"Statistical Decision Theory and Related Topics\".  The workshop will focus on the major approaches such as frequentist,   Bayesian, likelihood, and bootstrap paradigms.  The different paradigms  are not simply separate approaches that should be developed individually,   but are instead pieces of the puzzle of statistical inference that must  be fit together.  One of the primary purposes of the conference on decision  theory is to use the unifying nature of decision theory to enhance   cross-fertilization among apparently disparate areas of statistics.  The  conference is a natural adjunct to the workshop.    Statistical decision theory is increasingly used in modeling and analysis  of decision problems in business, economics, medicine, law, reliability  and quality control, risk assessment, and numerous other fields.  It   attempts to provide a formal approach to decision making and statistical   inference by asking that explicit numerical criteria be given and that  the merits of a statisitcal procedure or decision be assessed by these   criteria.  The broad topics for the conference include classical subjects  within or related to statistical inference and decision theory.  The   interface workshop examines areas where the different paradigms used by  statisticians may be unified in methodology.  The focus is on model  selection and testing, confidence sets and prediction intervals,   nonparametrics and statistical computation.    A large portion of the grant will go towards expenses of   graduate students, new researchers, and members of underrepresented  groups.",
