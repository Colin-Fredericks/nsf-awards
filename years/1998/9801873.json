This award is for partial support of an international  conference on the diversity of form and function found among  complex molecules of the membrane of living nerve, muscle  and other cells controlled by the nervous system.  The  functional contacts between nerve cells are called synapses,  and the biochemical compounds that carry signals between the  cells  at the synapse are called neurotransmitters.  The  transmitter  molecules are captured on the surface of the  cell membrane of the  target cell by molecules called  receptors.  Classes of  transmitters, like particular amino  acids, or particular  catecholamine compounds, were known to  have particular receptor  types that triggered particular  responses in the post-synaptic  cell.  More recently,  subtypes of receptor molecules have been  found, often with  different chemical binding affinities, molecular  arrangement, and coupling mechanisms.  This symposium covers  recent  advances at the molecular level in understanding the  subtypes of  the particular receptors called muscarinic  receptors, which  modulate the responses of nerve and muscle  cells to a widespread  neurotransmitter called  acetylcholine. The program will bring together eminent  scholars and junior scientists with interests in these  receptors, to allow them to exchange data and the latest  ideas on these important molecules. Such goals are important  to our progressively better understanding of how the brain  an organism's body.  Support is to help cover  some travel  costs of young investigators in the field to enable them to  attend and deliver their own research results at this  meeting.   This support will have an impact on fostering the  career  development of young neuroscientists, and t he  symposium  presentations will have an impact on muscle and  cardiovascular  research as well as neuroscience.",
