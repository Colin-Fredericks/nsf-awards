 "awd_abstract_narration": "Broadband networks are being designed to transport diverse traffic streams  with various quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Accurate characterization   of these streams is essential to devising efficient resource allocation   strategies that guarantee acceptable QoS without underutilizing network   capacity. This project is focused on characterizing compressed video traffic   and investigating resource allocation schemes for transporting video traffic   over computer networks.  New traffic models for VBR video streams will be   developed under three  strongly related compression algorithms: JPEG, MPEG-1,   and MPEG-2. The modeling methodology will be based on the class of  M/G/infinity  processes, whose versatility will be exploited to capture various forms of   traffic correlations. Video sources (single and aggregated) will be   characterized at both an entry node and after being multiplexed with other   streams (i.e., the departure traffic from a multiplexer).  Models for the   various layers in hierarchically encoded MPEG-2 video will be developed. The   multiplexing performance under video models will be investigated.    Corresponding resource allocation strategies for transporting video traffic   over broadband networks will be developed.  The impact of correlations  persistence on the queueing  performance under video traffic  will be investigated. Several priority scheduling strategies at a multiplexer   that is fed by several MPEG-2 input streams will be studied.    In connection with the proposed research program, several educational  goals will be pursued. New courses on broadband multimedia networks  which integrate in their curricula several aspects of the PI's research   agenda will be developed. The pedagogical approach in these courses will   be a balanced mix of theory and practice and will combine classroom  instruction  with research-oriented semester projects, hence exposing students (graduate   and senior undergraduate) to the intriguing realm of research. Team work will    be strongly encouraged in course projects, as it prepares students to future   work environments in industry.  In an effort to outreach to industry,  networking courses taught by the PI will be broadcast over the VideoCampus   facility to several industrial sites in the area, allowing many interested  engineers and managers to take these courses on their premises. The PI plans   to organize a weekly seminar on various topics in networks research,   which will feature presentations given by students, faculty, and invited   speakers from industry and academia.",
