 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802813  Fendley  Nonperturbative methods are valuable for exploring the large  number of interesting systems with strong coupling in  condensed matter physics.  Experimental advances have  allowed extensive scrutiny of systems like the quantum Hall  effect, quantum impurities and spin chains where these new  techniques are immediately applicable.  Many of these  systems exhibit fully non-Fermi-liquid behavior, meaning  that one usually cannot even formulate a perturbation theory  around free electrons.  This research program will utilize  the Bethe ansatz, conformal field theory, supersymmetry, and  other methods of finding exact solutions in these strongly  interacting systems.    A great deal of progress has been made on developing new  methods for exact computations, and a number of deep results  of mathematical physics have been derived.  More experiments  are being done or planned on the Hall devices, and more  theoretical work needs to be done.  Integrable methods are  quite powerful, but are far from computing everything, even  in those special cases where they are applicable.  There are  still many interesting models of condensed matter physics  where exact methods should be applicable.  This research  will develop new tools in order to treat integrable models  by exact methods.  In addition, the striking progress  particle physicists have made in understanding  supersymmetric field theories has had only limited  application in condensed matter physics.  This issue will  also be pursued.  %%%  This grant will support theoretical research on finding  exact solutions to a variety of systems characterized by  electrons which interact so strongly that conventional  methods fail.  The techniques to be used are ones which are  common throughout theoretical and mathematical physics, but  which, sometimes, have had limited application to problems  in condensed matter physics.  ***",
