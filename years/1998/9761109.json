 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9761109  Young    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed towards the study and evaluation of a new non-explosive rock excavation and concrete demolition method.  The process involves injecting foam at high pressure into pre-drilled holes in the rock or concrete to be broken through a barrel incorporating a new hole bottom sealing method.  The high viscosity of the foam (as compared to a gas) combined with its stored energy characteristics (as compared to a liquid) result in very controlled breakage.  The pressures to break the rock or concrete are significantly less than required in methods based upon the use of small explosive or propellant charges.  Consequently, airblast and flyrock are reduced to very benign levels allowing the method to be applied in a continuous manner and to be used in urban and other sensitive environments.  The incremental breakage of the method combined with the mobility and simplicity of the requisite hardware give the method considerable potential to be highly automated.  The Phase I project will quantify the breakage that might be achieved in rock and concrete, investigate the foam viscosities and pressures required for efficient breakage and identify aspects of the process with a potential for automation.    The controlled foam injection method for rock breakage could be used to develop utility tunnels under existing streets and buildings, to provide access tunnels or shafts to existing subway systems, to modify or enlarge excavation carried out with tunnel boring machines or to excavate or enlarge underground space for buildings.  In the area of concrete breakage and stripping the method would be useful for demolishing concrete structures when explosive methods were precluded or where salvage and recycling of building or structure components was desirable.  ***",
