 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is addressing the need for teachers of K-12 mathematics to make appropriate choices in the use of technology. The typical mathematics course, however, most often solves each problem with a single type of technology, thus depriving pre-service teachers of an opportunity to analyze the pros and cons of different technologies. This is a serious omission, but Kennesaw State is seeking a solution by establishing a Transitions Laboratory -- a classroom where pre-service teachers can make the transitions between different technologies quickly and efficiently  and thus become better prepared to make technological choices later. Prospective teachers in the Transitions Laboratory are using different technologies within the context of the same problem, then comparing and discussing what each technology brings to it. The laboratory is equipped with a wide array of manipulatives, four different types of calculators, laptop computers, and Internet access.  It serves eight mathematics methods and content courses ranging from the early childhood to the secondary mathematics level. A set of five to ten transitions modules are being developed for each of these courses. Focusing on a single concept or problem, each transitions module prompts the students to perform a series of mathematical investigations while using a range of  different technologies. Students write a report comparing and contrasting the advantages and disadvantages of each technology and saying which technology they would choose if they were the teacher. By exposing the prospective teachers to a wide range of technologies and then asking them to critically analyze their experiences, the Transitions Laboratory is producing teachers with the competence and confidence to make appropriate use of technology in mathematics instruction.",
