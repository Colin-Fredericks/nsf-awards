 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9808785  Riedel  Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) is an important hormone that controls cell growth and cell movement.  PDGF acts by binding to and thereby activating a specific cell surface PDGF receptor.  This activated receptor then attracts several intracellular proteins into a signaling complex. Preliminary studies from this laboratory suggest that a recently discovered growth factor receptor binding protein (Grb10) participates in this signaling complex and specifically in the cell growth stimulatory signal initiated by the PDGF receptor activation. The goals of this study are to determine how Grb10 functions in the PDGF receptor signaling complex and how it affects cell growth.  A combination of molecular genetics, biochemistry and cell biology methods will be employed in the  experiments. Initially the site at which Grb10 binds to the PDGF receptor and how the latter is activated will be determined  The interaction of Grb10 with other proteins in  the signaling complex will be established and studies will look at how it affects the function of these proteins.  These studies will elucidate an unexplored mechanism in an important signaling pathway which occurs in many cell types.  These results may also contribute information about other signaling pathways involved in the control of cell growth.  This research is studying a recently discovered protein, growth factor receptor binding protein (Grb10) which is involved in the signaling complex initiated by the activation of the platelet growth factor receptor(PDGF). These studies will examine the mechanism of action of this factor in an important signaling pathway of many cell types, and may provide information about other signaling pathways involved in cell growth.",
