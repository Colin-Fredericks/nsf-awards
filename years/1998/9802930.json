 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802930\r\nShea\r\nThis award provides partial support for the purchase of a matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF-MS).  This instrumentation is essential to many materials  research programs being undertaken on the University of California, Irvine campus which include programs in polymer science, material and synthetic chemistry, protein engineering, and disease research.  No MALDI-TOF-MS is available at UCI.  The chemistry department on this campus has rapidly expanded its faculty generating many more types of sample as well as increasing sample numbers.  The two magnetic sector systems now in the facility are fully committed providing high resolution data for organic synthesis.  The instrument will be used in a multi-user environment.  Projects in which the MALDI-TOF-MS is essential include: polyhomologation to form mixed hydrophilip/hydrophobic polymers and synthesis of organosiliconate monomers; research on incompletely condensed silsesquioxane cages and there use in surface reactivity models, hybrid inorganic/organic polymers and dendrimers; synthesis of photoluminescent and redox-active dendrimers and multimetallic compounds with potential applications in nanoscale photonic and electronic devices; lanthanide chemistry and the formation and understanding of the mechanisms of polymer formation as mediated by lanthanide complexes. Approximately 25 faculty, 140 graduate students, and 50 postdoctorals will have access to this instrument.\r\n%%%\r\n***   \r\n",
