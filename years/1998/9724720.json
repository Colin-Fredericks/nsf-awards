 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724720  TARBOTON      Spatially  distributed  hydrologic  models  are  being  used  increasingly  in environmental management and  design.  They  have  the advantage that they can capture to a large  degree  the spatial variability in hydrologic processes and can give  spatially   distributed   predictions.   However   spatially  distributed models suffer from problems associated with  the  large  number of variables involved. When calibrated against  integrated  quantities, such as basin outflow, they  do  not  generally represent internal processes correctly.  The  work  proposed has the objective to develop and formalize  methods  for  using  spatially distributed data and  spatial  pattern  comparison  in  the  validation  and  testing  of  spatially  distributed  models.  This  work  will  be  a  collaboration  between  David Tarboton at Utah State University and Charles  Pearson  and Ross Woods at NIWA, New Zealand. David Tarboton  has   distributed  hydrologic  modeling  experience  in  the  semi-arid  western  U.S.,  while  Woods  and  Pearson   have  experience  in hydrologic modeling focusing on scale  issues  in  New Zealand and Australia. Data from the Reynolds  Creek  experimental watershed in Idaho, USA as well as  the  Buller  and  Grey Rivers on the South Island of New Zealand will  be  used.  The  research will develop methods that extend  model  calibration  and  validation  from  reliance  on  integrated  measures only to the use of spatially distributed data.  The  benefits  will be greater reliability of model  results  and  forecasts  and better understanding of spatially distributed  hydrological processes due to better representation  of  the  internal watershed dynamics and variability.",
