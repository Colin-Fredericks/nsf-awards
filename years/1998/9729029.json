 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fungi from the Kansas State University (KSU) herbarium  were donated to the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) in  March, 1999.  This herbarium consists of approximately  32,000 specimens of which about half belong to published  and widely distributed, uniform sets of duplicate  specimens.  The remaining approximately 16,000 are unicate  specimens. NYBG will incorporate the unicates into its  fungal herbarium, and to offer the duplicates to other  institutions.    Incorporation of the Kansas State University fungus  herbarium will involve segregation of unicate from  duplicate specimens, repair, databasing, nomenclatural  updating and filing of specimens to be retained. Based on  previous experience, this work will require approximately  3200 person-hours, or two F.T.E. Curatorial Assistants for  one year.    Currently the KSU specimens are stored at NYBG in sealed  shipping boxes, because of a lack of herbarium case space  for unassimilated specimens.  Fungal specimens stored  outside of standard herbarium cases are at risk of damage  from  mold and insect infestation.  Therefore it is  imperative to incorporate the KSU specimens into the NYBG  fungal herbarium cases as soon as possible.  In the fall  of 1997, the NYBG will begin construction of a new Plant  Sciences Building, which will house the entire herbarium  and library, and the collections will be moved to the new  building in 1999.  Planning for the arrangement of the  fungal herbarium in the new building will be greatly  facilitated if the KSU specimens have been incorporated  before the herbarium is moved.",
