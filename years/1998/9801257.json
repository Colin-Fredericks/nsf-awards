 "awd_abstract_narration": "Faber  9801257        The proposal consists of three parts. Part I (to be carried out by the P.I.) focuses on the intersection rings of the moduli spaces of curves, thereby restricting attention to the tautological classes. The central subject is the P.I.'s conjecture describing the tautological ring in the case of smooth curves; the case of stable curves will be studied also. In Part II, the P.I. and post-doc I. Ciocan-Fontanine will try to relate the various approaches available for the calculation of  Gromov-Witten invariants in the case of varieties with torus actions. In Part III, Ciocan-Fontanine will study a recently proposed conjectural  construction of mirrors for complete intersections in partial flag  manifolds. It is based on a surprising heuristic link with mirror symmetry for complete intersections in toric varieties. A proof of a weaker conjecture would lead to the calculation of virtual numbers of rational curves on complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefolds.       This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.",
