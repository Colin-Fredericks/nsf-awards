In recent years, linear H-infinity techniques have been extended to nonlinear system.  The nonlinear H-infinity control problem is solved by two first order nonlinear partial differential equations called Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations.  These equations are extremely difficult to solve except in very special cases and they are difficult to approximate by standard techniques except for low order systems.  The inability to solve these equations has lead to a failure to realize the potential of nonlinear H-infinity control techniques.\r\nThis proposal outlines a plan to investigate innovative and computationally practical techniques for approximating closed-loop nonlinear H-infinity optimal control laws.  The approach is to approximate the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation in a two step procedure.  First, an iteration in policy space is used to reduce the nonlinear partial differential equation to an infinite sequence of linear partial differential equations.  The second step uses the Galerkin spectral method to approximate each linear partial differential equation.  The result of this process is a feedback control law, with a well defined region of attraction, that converges to the nonlinear H-infinity solution as the order of approximation increases.  The two step process outlined above suffers from Bellman's \"curse of dimensionality,\" i.e., the required computations and memory increase exponentially with the order of the system.  This \"curse of dimensionality\" is overcome by exploiting the structure in the problem for a fairly general class of nonlinear systems.\r\nThe proposed research will advance the state of the art by supplying a practical method for approximating nonlinear H-infinity control laws.  This result will be helpful to researchers working in the area, allowing them to test their ideas on real world problems, and to practicing engineers who wish to implement the latest developments in control theory research.  The proposed research also advances the state of knowledge by illustrating how to mitigate the \"curse of dimensionality\" by exploiting the structure of optimal control for a certain class of nonlinear systems.  \r\n***  \r\n",
