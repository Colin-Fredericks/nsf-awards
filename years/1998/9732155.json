 "awd_abstract_narration": "9732155       The Mountain Lake Biological Station (MLBS) was founded  in 1929 as a teaching and research facility of the Biology  Department of the University of Virginia.  It is located on  a mountain top in the Allegheny Mountains of southwestern  Virginia.  For almost twenty years MLBS has been developing  a theme of experimental studies in ecology and evolutionary  biology that has attracted a vigorous group of researchers  from major colleges and universities nationwide.       This REU Site continues a highly successful program  that has provided opportunities for ten students to spend  ten weeks each summer at MLBS conducting their own  independent research projects in the area of population  biology.  Student projects are overseen by field biologists  who return to MLBS year after year because of its biological  diversity and range of research opportunities and resources.  REU participants are selected for their enthusiasm for field  research, scientific sophistication, and interest in  pursuing the sciences of ecology or evolution as a career  path.  Admission is highly competitive; less than 10% of  applicants are accepted. Participants design, execute,  interpret, and present their own studies.  Many projects are  published in peer-reviewed journals.  Not including 1997  participants, 42% of REU students have gone on to pursue  graduate degrees in biology.  Students also have the chance  to interact closely with other undergraduate and graduate  students, postdoctoral and faculty researchers, and teaching  faculty.  REU participants attend weekly seminars on the  conduct of scientific research and life as an academic.  The  meetings allow regular periods for students to share  questions, concerns and discoveries.  Participation in the  program is open to any undergraduate conducting independent  research at MLBS, whether they are supported by the NSF/REU  Site grant or not.  This serves to foster a greater sense of  collaboration and interaction among research groups at the  station.",
