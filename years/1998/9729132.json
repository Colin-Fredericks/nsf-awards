In recent publications several aspects of the BMI pertaining to these problems have been studied. The basic aim of the proposed research is to examine further the theoretical structures of the BMI as well as to develop efficient algorithms for solving it.  The development of efficient algorithms for solving BMI's will constitute a major part of the present effort. The theoretical insights that will also be pursued will be primarily utilized for gaining insights to be used in the development of such algorithms. The method to be employed will rely on the areas of Linear Complementarity, Semidefinite Programming and Parallel Algorithms for nonconvex programming. Several practical applications of Control Theory pertaining to robust control stand to benefit from such a study. Besides robust control, there are also other areas of applications such as signal and image processing, economics, graphs and combinatorial theory, etc., where such study will be of use.  \r\n***  \r\n",
