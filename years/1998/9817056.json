 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nCTS-9817056\r\nGulari, Esin/Wayne State U.\r\n\r\nRecent measurements from our laboratory have shown that dense supercritical or near-critical gases can exhibit solubilities of 5-20 wt% or more (Garg, et al., 1994) in polymer melts at typical processing temperatures, and that the presence of dissolved gas can produce reductions in the viscosity of the melt by as much as two orders of magnitude. Because of these properties, we believe that SCG solvents can be exploited in broad categories of environmentally beneficial polymer processing operations, including recycling of polymers and polymer composites, replacement of ozone-depleting blowing agents in polymer foam processing, and reduction of volatile organics from polymer assisted metal casting operations.  To demonstrate feasibility for these applications according to solubility and viscosity criteria listed in Table I (see text), and to encourage industrial implementations, we propose to perform solubility measurements and rheological measurements on nine polymer-SCG systems listed in Table 2.\r\n\r\nA variable volume, visible PVT cell will be used to measure the solubility of SCG in molten polymer for the nine systems listed in Table 2. Bubble point measurements and spectroscopic measurements will also be performed in the visible cell for mixed-SCG blowing agents, and for blended polymer systems for metal casting.  The PVT measurements will be supplemented by rheological measurements performed in a sealed, high-pressure capillary rheometer.  The solubility and viscosity data will then be used to develop equation of state thermodynamic models and free-volume rheological models for each of the systems tested.\r\n\r\nThe proposed experimental study will produce thermodynamic and rheological data for nine polymer-SCG systems needed to evaluate the feasibility of SCG assisted polymer processing.  Successful systems will lead to replacement of ozone-depleting polymer foaming agents, reductions of VOC in metal casting operations, and improved polymer recycling.  The predictive thermodynamic and rheological models for polymer-SCG systems will be instrumental in the design and engineering of industrial processes based on the systems studied.\r\n***\r\n",
