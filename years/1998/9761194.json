 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9761194  Lesko    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes the development of an automated scanning microscope to permit the commercialization of a promising cytogenetic procedure for prostate cancer analysis.  The procedure is based on the specific fluorescence labeling of rare cells isolated from patients' blood which are then scanned and analyzed for cancer cell characteristics, such as cytokeratin, PSMA and chromosome aneuploidy.  While the sample preparation procedure is now ready for routine use, the current method for scanning the slide for positive cancer cells is far too labor intensive and time consuming to permit the successful commercialization of the test.  Therefore we propose to develop an automated fluorescence microscopy system that will scan the test slides with a speed, accuracy and cost that is compatible with successful commercialization.    The project team at CeIlGene has a proven track record for combining genetic  biotechnology with computer and imaging techniques and has now gained the additional elements necessary to make the transition from research to production and finally commercial deployment.    Although the initial commercialization effort will be directed towards prostate cancer, the proposed automated system will be adaptable to support related cytogenetic procedures that address other important medical problems with similar commercialization potential.  ***",
