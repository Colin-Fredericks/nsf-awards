Siniff                           OPP-9725820                            Abstract    The Weddell seal is found in regions of pack ice or fast ice  close to the Antarctic continent. This species has been the  focus for long-term population studies in McMurdo Sound  since the mid-1960's. This data set, one of the few of its  kind in the world, has provided valuable knowledge towards  an understanding of the survival and reproductive patterns  of a long-lived vertebrate. Within the framework of this  study, an examination of the breeding system and  reproductive fitness will be conducted, using recently  developed techniques in molecular biology. An examination of  the behavioral ecology and mating system through paternity  analysis of breeding males will provide precise estimates of  reproductive success and effective population size in this  aquatic breeding species. A second aspect of the study will  focus on population demographics, which is a continuation of  the annual analyses, parameter estimation and hypothesis  testing associating with the existing 30-year data base. A  new addition to this aspect is a comprehensive analysis of  the population dynamics focusing on the role that  immigration and emigration play in the population dynamics.  As the southern-most breeding mammal in the world, the  Weddell seal exemplifies an extreme in environmental  adaptability. Knowledge of the strategies employed in this  environment will contribute to the basic understanding of  pinniped evolution and population dynamics and competition  in marine mammals.",
