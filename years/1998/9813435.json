This award supports a satellite short-course  presented annually at the Society for Neuroscience meeting.  The  course instructs neuroscience investigators and teachers how to  use a widely-accepted simulation tool designed specifically for  biologically realistic neural models.  Since it runs on all  leading computational platforms (UNIX/Linux, MSWindows 3.1, 95,  98, and NT, and MacOS), virtually every laptop and desktop  microcomputer sold in the country is capable of performing  research-quality simulations.    The potential importance of NEURON to the neuroscience community  derives from the fact that the nervous systems of all animals,  including human beings, perform tasks such as perception,  learning, and adaptive control, through computations that involve  the complex interactions of electrical and chemical signals that  are distributed in space and time. Scientists are increasingly  finding simulation to be an indispensable tool for understanding  the operation of systems with such complex interactions.  The  NEURON course will teach the use of such a tool for applications  in neuroscience.",
