 "awd_abstract_narration": "While spoken language systems are now used for many applications,  language  engineering technology is still not  adequate  for  all  important  tasks. For instance, automatic recognition of  natural  conversational speech results in incorrect transcription of  one-  third  of  the  words spoken.  Parsing sentences  from  newspaper  articles   leads  to  faulty  automatic  analysis  of  half   the  sentences.  The need to make progress in this important  area  is  obvious.  The number of available language engineering  personnel  is  small  and  relatively  few  universities  presently  educate  students  capable of performing the required tasks.   The  Center  for   Language  and  Speech  Processing  at  the  Johns   Hopkins  University  is  organizing  a  six  week  workshop  on   Language  Engineering  from July 13 to August 24, 1998, in which  teams  of  professionals  and  students will work together  to  advance  the  state  of the art.  Three topics will be addressed:  (1)  Dynamic  Segmental  Models  of Speech Coarticulation;   (2)  Rapid  Speech  Recognizer Adaptation to New Speakers;  (3) Core Natural Language  Processing   Technology   Applicable   to   Multiple   Languages.  University   professors,   leading  industrial   and   government  researchers  presently  working in  widely  dispersed  locations,  graduate   students,  and  six  or  more  undergraduate  students  selected  through  a nationwide search will participate  in  this  workshop.   Significant  technological innovations,  training  of  students,  cross-fertilization of ideas from various disciplines,  initiation  of collaborative research, and creation  of  valuable  training  and  test  corpora are expected  to  result  from  this  endeavor.",
