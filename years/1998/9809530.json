 "awd_abstract_narration": "9809530  Mitchell    Many industries have recently experienced a speed-up in the rate of technological innovation. These new technologies often must be adopted in the face of incomplete information about how best to use the new technology. Adoption often involves a tradeoff between discarding an older, better understood technology and taking a chance on learning a newer technology that promises higher returns. A model is developed to capture these trade-offs in an industry equilibrium framework.  It is then shown to be consistent with a variety of industry dynamics data. The goal of the research is to fit the model to a particular industry, and then see what the model predicts following a one time unanticipated increase in the rate of growth in the productivity of new technologies.  The model's predictions about the size distribution of firms and the age/size profile of hazard rates of firms are driven by the learning component. Learning is modeled as a Bayesian problem similar to the myopic, one agent problem studied by Jovanovic and Nyarko (1997). New technologies arise each period. In order to be operated efficiently, technologies require an input which can only be gained by experience. Vintages of technology are connected informationally, in the sense that the relevant parameter is correlated across vintages. This leads to a potential advantage in adopting a new technology for existing firms, which already have some experience on an older vintage. On the other hand, incumbent firms' advantage at producing using the older technology gives them an incentive to stick with the older technology. The updating process is rich and nonlinear, with the potential for a variety of equilibrium outcomes across firms of different degrees of experience.    The model is shown to be consistent both with evidence on the differences between incumbents and entrants in Dunne, et al. (1988) as well as evidence on exit rates and employment growth in Audretsch (1995). The next step is to fit the model to evidence fr om the computer industry (SIC code 357) prior to the rapid increase in computer technologies in the 1970's and 80's. The model will have predictions concerning the resulting size distribution and hazard rates following the increased technological opportunities which can be compared to data. It will provide an important step towards understanding the forces that effect industries when a new generation of products arrive. It can also be potentially helpful in understanding changes in the firm size distribution at more aggregate levels following an increase in technological progress that might be termed a technological revolution. The model's predictions will be compared to the actual experience of the computer industry. The comparison will shed light on the importance of adoption of new technologies in determining the entry, growth, and survival characteristics of firms following a technological speed-up.",
