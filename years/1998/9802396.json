Owing to a large band gap dependence on temperature,  lasers made from IV-VI semiconductors have tuning ranges of  several hundred wavenumbers in the mid-infrared region, 3 microns  to over 20 microns, where most molecules have strong absorption  bands. This tunability, an advantage over mid IR lasers based on  quantum cascade technology, and the expected improvement in cw  operating temperatures using lift-off fabrication methods make  IV-VI semiconductors attractive materials for enhanced mid-IR  laser performance. This research seeks fundamental understanding  of strain relaxation in highly thermal expansion mismatched  epitaxial layers, work that can lead to the integration of  compound semiconductor devices on silicon substrates. It is also  expected to lead to the development of a new materials technology  that can dramatically improve maximum operating temperatures of  mid-IR lasers. The project is co-supported by the DMR Electronic  Materials Program and the EPSCoR program.  %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  materials science having high potential technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at  a fundamental level to new aspects of electronic/photonic  devices. The basic knowledge and understanding gained from the  research is expected to contribute to improving the performance  and stability of advanced devices by providing a fundamental  understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved  materials, and materials combinations. A direct benefit of this  research is that it will enable the development of user friendly  mid-IR laser spectrometers, instruments that can be used in a  variety of applications includ ing air pollution monitoring,  real-time process control, and medical diagnostics. An important  feature of the program is the integration of research and  education through the training of students in a fundamentally and  technologically significant area.  ***",
