 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is growing evidence that passive listening in class or the mere verification of the laws of nature in the laboratory are inefficient ways of learning physics.  This project modifies the freshman laboratory based on the success of a special laboratory initiative, the Clarkson Team Design Program introduced in 1996 by the department.  Currently the program targets only academically strong students (the upper 10% of the class).  Some of the elements of the project being implemented in the traditional laboratory environment are: open-ended problems, project-based learning, flexibility for the students to design their own experiments, team work-based activity.    This project allows the whole freshman class to participate in the positive experience of the Team Design Program. Specifically, students are engaged at an early stage in all aspects of the scientific enterprise through computerizing the major portion of the laboratory experiments. This facilitates students' ability to generate a hypothesis, design experiments, and analyze, interpret, and present data. The lab stations are set up with the intention of challenging the students with real world problems, shifting the emphasis from grades to project success. Such an approach allows students to gain important experience developing theoretical models and experimental procedures with state of the art data acquisition systems, while fostering technical creativity and encouraging students to sharpen their analytical skills.",
