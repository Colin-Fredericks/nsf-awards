 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tRecent field studies show that methyl halides gases (e.g., methyl chloride, methyl bromide and methyl iodide) are released from rice paddies.  Given the worldwide cultivation of rice, this newly identified source is of potential global importance.  However, measurements are sparse.  In addition, atmospheric mixing ratios for the higher molecular weight analogs (chloro- and bromoethanes) are poorly known and there exists little information concerning the emission sources for these compounds.   The potential importance of halomethanes and haloethanes to the global atmosphere is due to their chemical behavior in the atmosphere that is expected to be similar to the well studied and better understood  class of synthetic chlorofluorocarbons.  Thus, methyl and ethyl halide gases also may produce profound effects on the concentrations and distributions of stratospheric ozone.\r\n \r\n\tThis renewal project supports a  series of rice field measurements located in California and Texas.  Flux chambers will be placed over rice plants and samples will be collected into stainless canisters, and analyzed for methyl and ethyl halides by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).  The field experiments will produce quantitative data for updating the current global emission estimates of methyl and ethyl halides.  It is possible these emission data will lead to revised calculations for the lifetime of methyl bromide, thus changing the calculated impact of this gas on stratospheric ozone concentrations and distributions.  Further, the new emissions data should lead to significant improvement in the current understanding of the relative roles of natural and anthropogenic sources of methyl chloride and methyl bromide.   The benefit to atmospheric chemistry is the improved accuracy  of atmospheric models which investigate the global sources and sinks of alkyl halide gases.\r\n",
