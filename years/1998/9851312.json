 "awd_abstract_narration": "A growing body of literature amply documents the low levels of scientific and environmental literacy among the American public. To address this issue we are providing a framework in which all Georgia Southern University (GSU) undergraduates can achieve basic environmental and scientific literacy. We are developing an environmental biology course that will be part of GSU's new core curriculum. All students who wish to obtain a degree from GSU will complete this core curriculum including science majors, non-science majors, and future K-12 teachers. The new Biology course utilizes environmental issues to introduce and discuss relevant scientific concepts and the Biology department expects to have an estimated annual enrollment of 2325 students. The main focus of this proposal is to provide equipment to allow development of innovative hands-on laboratory activities related to local, regional, and global environmental problems. Expected project outcomes include: graduates who are able to engage in environmentally-aware behavior and informed citizenship; improved scientific and environmental knowledge; and appreciation of the connections between science and \"real-world\" problems.  This proposal requests funding for equipment necessary to develop new, unique and  meaningful environmental exercises for a large number of GSU students. The project has produced laboratory exercises that are available for adaptation by other institutions. Dissemination of the work is through presentation at national meetings, faculty development workshops, publication of laboratory materials and professional articles, and a project web site. This model is a unique one that can be easily adapted by other institutions and, therefore has excellent potential outside the university.",
