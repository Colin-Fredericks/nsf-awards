 "awd_abstract_narration": "Random matrix theory has had remarkably wide applicability. \r\nThe spacing distributions arising in random matrix theory have \r\nover the past few years been\r\nshown to have deep applications in number theory; \r\nthere are applications in numerical analysis and computational \r\ncomplexity where condition numbers of random matrices are important; \r\nrandom matrix theory has motivated developments\r\nin the Riemann-Hilbert method which in turn finds applications \r\nto a variety of problems in integrable systems and inverse scattering. \r\nIn physics the applications range from  many-body systems \r\n(both atomic and nuclear), to quantum chaos to quantum transport \r\nin mesoscopic systems.  Four areas for research are\r\nspecified. The first is related to the fact that in certain random \r\nmatrix ensembles the measure describing the eigenvalue distribution \r\nis the Gibbs measure for charges interacting via a potential at inverse \r\ntemperature beta equal to one, two or four (corresponding to orthogonal, \r\nunitary and symplectic ensembles, respectively). The limiting spacing \r\ndistributions for these ensembles are now quite well understood but \r\nthe methods are applicable to these values of beta only. The question \r\nfor general beta, while quite difficult, is mathematically interesting \r\nand quite important in statistical physics. A new approach looks \r\npromising and we intend to pursue it.  The second area of research\r\nis the question of universality of the limiting distribution of the \r\nlargest eigenvalue in matrix ensembles.  This would be analogous to \r\nthe universality of the Gaussian distribution for sums of independent \r\nrandom variables, the famous Central Limit Theorem.  Thirdly, we propose \r\nto study the order statistics of the spacings between eigenvalues (which \r\nis different from the spacing distributions between consecutive \r\neigenvalues mentioned above).  For example, what is the probability\r\ndistribution for the largest or smallest spacing?  There are known \r\nresults for independent random variables but none yet for for random matrices,\r\nwhose eigenvalues are far from independent.  Finally, we expect to complete earlier\r\nwork on the asymptotics of solutions to the periodic Toda equations by \r\ndetermining the asymptotics on the so-called critical curves, where the \r\nasymptotics will take a very different form.  The theory of Wiener-Hopf operators\r\nand operator determinants should play a decisive role in this investigation. \r\nNo doubt the pursuit of these four questions will lead to others.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the 1950s Eugene Wigner, in his now classic study of highly excited \r\nstates of large nuclei of atoms, introduced a mathematical model\r\nto describe the spacing between these states. \r\nThis model goes under the name of random matrix theory.\r\nSince Wigner's work in nuclear physics, it has been shown that the \r\nmathematics of random matrix theory has far-reaching applications to \r\ncondensed matter physics, atomic physics and the new area of quantum chaos. \r\nIn mathematics itself, random matrix theory has begun to appear in such \r\ndiverse areas as number theory, combinatorics and numerical analysis. \r\nIt is natural to ask why there is such wide applicability of random \r\nmatrix theory.  In probability theory the bell-shaped curve is widely \r\napplicable because of a theorem which says roughly that when one \r\nadds quantities which are random and independent,  the sum follows \r\nthe bell shaped curve regardless of the distribution of the random\r\nobjects being added. The distribution functions of random matrix theory \r\nappear to have a similar universality for a class of problems where \r\nthere is a high degree of dependence in the underlying processes. \r\nIn the present project the mathematics of random matrix theory will be \r\nfurther developed with an eye kept on possible applications. \r\nIn earlier work a general mathematical framework was developed that \r\nrelated the distribution functions of random matrix theory with \r\nsolutions to certain equations which are said to be integrable. \r\nThis mathematical theory gives exact formulas for distribution functions \r\nin random matrix theory and provides efficient numerical methods for \r\ntheir computation.  Computing these distribution functions will allow one\r\nto compare them with experimental data.\r\n",
