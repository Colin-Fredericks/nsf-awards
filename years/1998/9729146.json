 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Michael T. Bowers of   the University of California-Santa Barbara in his continuing studies of   sigma bond activation at transition metal centers.  Prof. Bowers will   investigate clustering of second row metals with dihydrogen, reactions of   first and second row metals with methane and other small alkanes, the   role of different ligands in tuning reactivity, and cluster assisted   sigma-bond activation.  In addition, he will focus on a new effort   studying macromolecular systems.  He will exploit gas phase H/D exchange   as a complementary method for conformational analysis of biologically   interesting systems; specifically, he will investigate polymer   conformation, folding dynamics and energetics as a function of repeat   number.  He also plans to study host/guest systems, in particular the   influence of solvation on host selectivity.  To support the biological   studies, Prof. Bowers will construct a bright electrospray based mass   spectrometer.    Gas phase ion chemistry and the related discipline of mass spectrometry   have made huge strides during the past decade, especially in the past   five years.  Much of this progress is due to technological breakthroughs   in detector design, ion sources and the availability of bigger, faster   and especially cheaper computers.  Further development of this powerful   analytical tool as applied to bond activation at metal centers will   improve understanding of the behavior of heterogeneous catalysts, used   extensively in many industrial processes.  Prof. Bower's present effort   focusing on macromolecular systems will provide structural information on   these larger species.",
