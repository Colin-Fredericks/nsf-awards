The  theoretical research is targeted at understanding how the microscopic  nature of fluids and their mixtures is correlated with their  macroscopic behavior.  Systems of interest include both simple and  complex molecules.  In addition, a unique opportunity afforded by this  work is the ability to compare the results for a lattice model with  those for a continuum model using the same theoretical approach.    The behavior of complex fluids has been of high interest in recent  years, and this has been stimulated by the increasingly sophisticated  kinds of measurements becoming accessible.  In addition, the ability  to simulate mixtures of dense fluids has expanded dramatically within  the last decade.  Thus, more data are beginning to appear whcih are  capable of testing statistical mechanical theories, particularly for  complex liquid mixtures.  The research conducted here involves an  integral equation technique known as Born-Green-Yvon  (BGY) theory.  Using the BGY formalism theoretical descriptions of lattice and  continuum systems have been derived, and comparisons between the  results using the two have been initiated.  The lattice theory has  resulted in simple closed-form expressions for thermodynamic  quantities of interest.  The advantages of lattice theory include its  accessibility to non-theorists, and the ability to test it using  lattice simulation results on relatively complex fluids and mixtures,  which are more plentiful than continuum simulation data.  The  continuum theory is capable of tackling more subtle issues involving  the interplay between local structure and bulk properties.  However,  continuum solutions involve numerical methods and simulation data on  mixtures are not yet plentiful.  The development of analogous lattice  and continuum theories yields the p ossibility of determining what  kinds of equilibrium properties are expected to be sensitive to the  imposition of a lattice constraint.    This research will focus on developing an understanding of polymer  solutions and blends, building on the demonstrated ability of the  lattice BGY theory to describe pure fluids, simple alkane mixtures and  polyethylene solutions.  This work will involve analysis of data,  including equation of state information and (new to these efforts)  small angle neutron scattering results, in order to obtain the  characteristic microscopic parameters.  Having determined what minimum  data set is required to characterize a system, the goal is then to  predict less accessible properties, such as the pressure dependence of  the coexistence curve.  Such information is important in deciding on  processing conditions, for example.  The BGY theory is also capable of  probing the effects of structural differences (for example polyolefin  blends) and energetic differences (such as ocur in strongly  interaacting mixtures) on miscibility in an effort to understand at a  more sophisticated level the balance between these two.  %%%  This is a renewal grant funded jointly by the Materials Theory Program  in the Division of Materials Research and the Theoretical and  Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division.
