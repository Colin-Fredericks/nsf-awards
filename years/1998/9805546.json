 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9805546  Xu-Dong Liu    This project is concerned with several new numerical methods for  solving multidimensional systems of conservation laws, including a new  fully conservative scheme for multi-phase fluid calculations. The first  contribution of this project is the extension of Friedrich's positivity  principle from multi-dimensional symmetric linear systems to systems of  conservation laws, which has become one of the guidelines for designing  numerical methods. A family of positive schemes is constructed.  Positive schemes are very robust, simple and of low cost. Many  numerical experiments have shown that positive schemes are among the  best 2nd order accurate high resolution methods. This is also the first  work of this type which contains theoretical results for scheme design  in multi-dimensional hyperbolic systems. The second contribution of  this project is the new Convex Essential-Non-Oscillatory (CENO) schemes  for multi-dimensional hyperbolic systems. The scheme can be implemented  in component-wise fashion. Therefore its apparent advantages are: (1)  No complete set of eigenvectors is needed and hence weakly hyperbolic  systems can be solved. (2) Component-wise limiting is twice as fast as  field-by-field limiting in each space dimension, which makes Convex ENO  one of the fastest existing schemes. (3) The component-wise version of  the scheme is simple to program. In addition, (4) the Convex ENO scheme  is very robust.  The third contribution of this project is the  introduction of a fully conservative method for multi-phase flow  problems. This new idea enables us to avoid the spurious oscillations  near material interfaces common to all other conservative schemes. This  is done through the addition of a general equation of state.  The new  scheme works essentially for mixture of any fluids such as gamma-law  gas, water and JWL (explosive material). The new idea works in any  space dimension and is scheme-independent, which means it should apply  to a typical users' existi ng code.  Preliminary numerical experiments  show that this scheme is very promising.    This project is aimed at solving real world problems and is intended to  have a significant impact on semiconductor device modeling, underwater  and solid explosives modeling, computational fluid dynamics,  magneto-hydrodynamics, and many other applications, which are all a  part of high-performance computing. The principal goals are: (1) to  design and improve numerical methods for more efficiency, simplicity,  and robustness; (2) to improve computer simulation of multi-phase  fluids. The methods reported in this project are a step towards this  goal.",
