 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under certain circumstances such as in mobile communication, one  needs to transmit compressed data through a very noisy channel.  Unless a very powerful error control coding technique is used,  the misdecoding error probability for a very noisy channel is  usually high. Since the use of very powerful error control coding  technique will offset a large part of the gain obtained in data  compression, this is not what we are willing to do.  On the other hand, most of the efficient data compression  algorithms are very sensitive to channel errors. The  contradiction between high decoding error probability and  catastrophic behavior of compression algorithms is the main  problem we need to resolve in the study of transmission of  compressed data through very noisy channels.    In this project, we are examining an alternative approach to this  problem.   Instead of using source codes of small block length,  or powerful error control coding techniques, we are developing  robust data compression algorithms - algorithms which are  insensitive to channel errors. We give two definitions of  robustness of lossless data compression - the asymptotical mean  robustness and the asymptotical mean semi-robustness - defined  with respect to certain distortion measures. The most important  distortion measures we use are Hamming distance and the so-called  insertion-deletion distance. In this project, we propose    1) to study the existence of asymptotical mean robust lossless  data compression algorithm that is also asymptotically optimal;  2) to develop practical asymptotically mean robust (semi-robust)  lossless data compression algorithms;  3) to study various important properties of asymptotically mean  robust (semi-robust) lossless data compression algorithms.",
