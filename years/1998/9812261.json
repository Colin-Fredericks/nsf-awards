 "awd_abstract_narration": "9812261  Harrison    The proposed research in this SGER Award represents a new  approach to speeding up crystallization-dissolution processes in  copolymers.  Speed is necessary to increase the rate at which  similar-composition materials can be separated.  Temperature-  Rising Elution Fractionation (TREF) is currently used to separate  crystallizable copolymers based on relative crystallizabilities,  and to obtain a distribution of compositions within the  copolymer.  Results from TREF were key in developing the latest  class of polyolefins using so called `single-site catalysts'.  However, like other composition separation techniques, TREF is  slow.  The proposed research uses TREF as a starting point to  identify those fundamental parameters that control separation in  such systems.  An outcome of the proposed study would be to  reduce TREF analysis times in crystallizable copolymers from  days, to an hour.  One approach to increasing separation speed is  to turn TREF into a true      chromatographic technique where  separation between components increases as material moves along a  column.  This undertaking has never before been attempted and  represents a dramatic departure from the norm.  A zone refining  type modification of TREF will be used to introduce  chromatographic character into the separation process.  The final  form, as described in the proposal, is neither zone refining nor  TREF but could potentially reduce analysis time by a factor of  50.  Supplementary methods may aid in separation and other routes  to the chromatographic approach also exist.  These will be  evaluated as required.  %%%  If successful, composition distribution in crystallizable  polymers by `zone TREF' can become as standard as molecular  weight distribution by GPC, or melting-crystallinity evaluation  by DSC.  Given the potential impact which rapid composition  analysis could have on the plastics industry in general, and the  polyolefin segment in particular, early evaluation of this  proposed methodology  through a SGER grant is desirable.  ***",
