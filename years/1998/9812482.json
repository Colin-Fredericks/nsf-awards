In order to guide the study, a steering group of senior executives from industry and academic experts has been established.\r\n\r\nThe study will be comprised of a series of events of varying size and scope (e.g., symposia, workshops, and conferences), as determined by the PI and steering group.  A variety of pertinent issues will be addressed, including the underlying rationale for industry-university-government cooperation, best practices for implementing partnerships, means of evaluation, and experiences with international partnerships.\r\n\r\nDissemination of findings and conclusions is a high priority and will be pursued through various mechanisms.  \r\n",
