This proposed major research instrumentation will enable experimental studies essential to three ongoing research projects: aggressive distributed shared memory (DSM) implementation; effective synchronization mechanism, and recoverable DSM.  It includes desktop PCs, an ALR Revolution Server, SUN workstations and a SUN Enterprise server, which are interconnected by a Myrinet LAN switch and a fast Ethernet switch from 3Com.  The instrumentation will also allow students in computer architecture and distributed processing courses to gain hands-on experience, stimulating students' interest in computer system research.  Entry-level graduate research assistants involved in the on-going research projects will be encouraged to take advantage of this instrumentation for realizing aggressive research agenda.",
