 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Maria Masucci will conduct two seasons or archaeological fieldwork in the Chanduy, El Azucar and Rio Grande valleys of Ecuador. These extend inland from the Pacific coast towards the Andes and thus cover a range of environmental zones. While the prehistory of this region of Ecuador is poorly known, prior work indicates that the final periods of prehispanic occupation may be divided into two periods: a Guangala Phase from ca. 200 BC to 800 AD and a following Integration phase which extends from ca. 800 to 1530. One model for the organization of the latter period has proposed a centralized state level of organization with a complex system of agricultural production through water management and storage facilities. Evidence for the earlier Phase suggests a more independent production system with resources shared across environmental zones within a developing hierarchical system or chiefdom. Dr. Masucci wishes to determine whether these models are correct and if so discover the factors which are responsible for the shift from one to the other. Relatively little excavation has been conducted in this region and in this first phase of a longer term project Dr. Masucci will establish a basic chronological and ceramic sequence. She will map and conduct small scale excavation at a number of sites to collect in situ material. Ceramics serve as time sensitive indicators since styles change over time and ceramic characterization and seriation will provide an important dating tool. Radiocarbon dates will anchor the sequence in absolute time. Collection and analysis of fauna as well as macrobotanical and pollen will permit  environmental reconstruction and the eventual interpretation of change in this larger context.  Archaeologists have worked in the Peruvian coastal zone for many years and within this highly arid environment reconstructed a trajectory of cultural change. In many ways this is similar to the preliminary sequence from Ecuador. While the Peruvian sequence is well established, debate rages about what underlying factors are responsible for the observed changes. Some archaeologists rely heavily on climatic factors and believe that El Nino events precipitated major social re-organizations while others argue that social rather than natural factors played a more important role. Ecuador can provide information potentially relevant to this issue. Dr. Masucci wishes to compare the Ecuadorian sequence to its Peruvian counterpart; she will compare the degree of similarity and the times a which change occurred. Since the two are relatively independent, if cultural changes occurred at essentially the same time that would provide strong evidence for a climatic cause.  This research is important for several reasons. It will increase knowledge of an important and understudied archaeological region. The data will be of interest to many researchers. It will also shed new light on the effect of events such as El Nino on hierarchical societies which existed at a simple level of technology.",
