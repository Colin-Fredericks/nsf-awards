 "awd_abstract_narration": "9806418  Faust    In addition to the control of molecular weights and their  distributions, the ultimate goal of macromolecular engineering is  to obtain a high degree of control over compositional as well as  structural variables which affect the physical properties of  macromolecules.  Among these activities there has been growing  interest on the design and construction of linear and non-linear  block architectures, such as graft, comb, ring, star, or H-shaped  polymers, that self-assemble into ordered nano-structures.  Recent advances in living cationic polymerization coupled with  methodologies developed using non-(homo)polymerizable monomers  offer an unprecedented level of control over the molecular  architecture of these materials.  This project continues research  funded by NSF DMR on the synthesis, characterization and physical  properties of novel linear and non-linear block architectures  using non-(homo)polymerizable monomers in living cationic  polymerization.  These activities will be augmented with  continued kinetic and mechanistic studies with special emphasis  on addressing the use of low molecular weight model systems in  comparison to high molecular weight analogs.  %%%  The above novel materials will serve as model polymers to advance  fundamental understanding in structure/property relationship of  macromolecules through interdisciplinary research activities, to  enable the development of materials with superior properties.  ***",
