 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract    Measuring Emotion in Chimpanzees Using Cognitive Tasks      This project aims to establish a new, pioneering direction  of research to measure the subjective experience of emotion  in chimpanzees, the closest living relative of humans.  The  technique combines experimental    and physiological techniques to provide an objective measure  of emotional responses in a nonverbal animal.  Changes in  psychophysiological responses, such as changes in electronic  conduction of facial muscles and skin will be measured when  subjects view emotion-eliciting videos, and when required to  categorize these videos according to their emotional  valence.  Categorization involves matching positive,  negative and neutral facial expressions with videos of  social scenes presented on a computer monitor by contacting  them with a joystick-controlled cursor.      Traditionally, students of nonhuman primates have  investigated social behavior and social cognition while  ignoring the emotional aspects. Emotion is considered  inaccessible in a nonverbal species. Psychophysiological  responses, such as those noted above,  have an inherent  correlation with autonomic nervous system functions that  have been  associated with the experience of emotion in humans.  Measuring psychophysiological parameters in nonverbal  organisms will provide an objective measure of what are  often covert, unconscious responses. Applying an objective,  empirical measure of emotion to chimpanzees will broaden an  understanding of the evolution of emotional responses and  empathy in humans.",
