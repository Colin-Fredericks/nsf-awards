 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703736    The objectives of this research program are to develop new  instrumentation, test methodology, data acquisition, and field  procedures  for the direct in-situ and site-specific assessment of soil  liquefaction  potential by cone penetration testing.  The program consists of a collaborative group effort between  Georgia Tech  and Virginia Tech, and is being co-funded with the United States  Geological  Survey. It includes the assembly of a vertically-vibrating  piezocone  penetrometer (piezovibrocone), laboratory calibration chamber  testing, a  companion series of laboratory cyclic triaxial and simple shear  testing,  and field trials at geotechnical experimentation sites.  Current methods of assessing the liquefaction susceptibility of  loose  sands and silts during earthquake shaking rely strongly on  empirical  correlations and methodologies. Present state-of-practice  procedures for  liquefaction evaluation include both in-situ and laboratory test  methods  that require correction factors which are not fully understood,  nor well  defined.  The vibrocone consists of a cone penetrometer coupled with a  vibrating  shaker mechanism that induces liquefaction of the soil in the  vicinity of  the probe during penetration into the ground. Vertical penetration  tests  are conducted under both static and dynamic excitation in paired  side-by-side soundings. Comparisons of cone tip resistance values,  sleeve  friction values, and penetration pore water pressures from  adjacent  soundings are made to ascertain the liquefaction potential and  other  properties of the subsoils. The penetration test is designed to  allow a  rational interpretation by analytical theories which incorporate  important  soil behavioral aspects such as dynamic loading, cyclic pore  pressure  generation, initial stress state, and residual undrained steady-  state  strength. As envisioned, the piezovibrocone will thus offer an  improved and  systematic framework for evaluating the liquefaction  susceptibility of  loos e ground in seismically-active regions. Additionally, it  should have  value for assessing the applicability and effectiveness of ground  modification techniques such as vibroflotation, vibro-replacement,  and  densification by blasting.",
