 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mobile robots play a central role in the research and educational  goals of this project.  Research activities focus on the  locomotion of walking, running, and swimming machines.  A design  approach is advocated in which desired dynamic behaviors are  built into a robot, through such means as spring-mass and  pendulum components.  Control will be accomplished by coupling  actuators to nonlinear oscillators, in a manner analogous to  pattern generators in animals. Locomotion in unstructured  environments will also be considered, and robots will be  fabricated to test theoretical predictions.  Bright high school  students will be recruited for educational and research  activities. A mechatronics course will be developed, which will  feature a competition among student-constructed mobile robots and  a focus on industry approaches to problem solving. Undergraduate  students will be sought for participation in a national mobile  robot competition. Use of the Internet for educational purposes  will be explored in the development of hyperlearning modules for  courses the PI teaches and in the use of videoconferencing  technology to broadcast lectures. Graduate students interested in  careers in academia will be encouraged to teach, write proposals,  and supervise the research of undergraduates and high school  students.",
