The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and  experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-four-month postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Lynne P. Yenush to work with Dr. Ramon  Serrano at the Universidad Politecnica de Valencia in Spain  on the study of yeast as a model system for understanding  high salt tolerance in higher plants.    The salination of irrigated land is a problem for the future  of agriculture.  Because arid land has low levels of  precipitation and must rely on irrigation, the water  evaporates and leaves a high concentration of salt in the  soil.  This increased salinity causes the soil to  deteriorate, making it incompatible with plant growth.  This  research project will help understand the mechanism of salt  toxicity and defense responses of crop plants, so genetic  engineering strategies can be developed to improve crop  growth in arid regions.    Dr. Seranno has developed a model system for understanding  the genetic basis of the evolution of this high salt  tolerance in agriculturally important higher plants.  ***",
