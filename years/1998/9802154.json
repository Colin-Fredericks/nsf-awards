 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Proposal:  DMS-9802154  Principal Investigator:  Helmut Hofer    In this project Hofer studies the dynamics of Reeb vector fields.  The   main tool is a particularly adapted theory of holomorphic curves,   which has been developed by the principal investigator and his   co-workers in recent years.  The fact, that there is a such a close,   but completely unexpected, relationship between some important class   of dynamical systems and a suitable theory of holomorphic curves has   deep implications.  Immediately it makes it, in principle, feasible to   relate questions about an important class of dynamical systems to   recent mathematical theories like quantum cohomology, Gromov-Witten   invariants, and in low dimensions even to Seiberg-Witten invariants.    The fact, that two intersecting holomorphic curves in a   four-dimensional space have always a positive intersection number   implies that these new methods are most powerful for Reeb vector   fields on a three-dimensional space.  The main goal of this project   will be the development of a mathematical machinery for constructing   global surfaces of section for three-dimensional Reeb flows and   generalisations thereof.  In practice this means that the study of   certain three-dimensional dynamical systems can effectively be reduced   to two dimensions.    The importance and scope of Reeb dynamics is illustrated by the   following examples.  The motion of a satellite in the presence of the   gravitational forces of the sun, the planets and the moon is described   mathematically as the dynamics of a Reeb vector field.  A charged   particle moving in an electrical and a magnetic field is described by   a Reeb vector field if the magnetic field is not too large or the   kinetic energy of the particle is sufficiently large.  The motion of   the particles of an ideal incompressible fluid in some system of pipes   is, if the motion is in an equilibrium (steady) state, described by a   Reeb vector field if the pressure is not too far f rom being constant.    Also many evolution equations of mathematical physics, which describe   systems, in which energy is preserved, can sometimes be approximated   by finite-dimensional dynamical systems, which are described by a Reeb   vector field.  Such approximations are of course necessary if one   tries to find solutions for such equations by using a computer.",
