 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmental analyses have become increasingly important at Roanoke College, due both to the introduction of an Environmental Science program and to extensive use of multi-week applications based projects throughout the curriculum. This new emphasis has created a need for trace analysis of metals, which will be met using a combination flame/furnace atomic absorption spectrometer. The new instrumental features include the improved detection limits of the furnace method, background correction capabilities, and a higher temperature burner for flame analyses.  New experiments and research projects will be developed in the context of a comprehensive four year instrumentation training curriculum. A multi-level sequence of instrument experiences will be used to educate students on basic operations, advanced techniques, and fundamental principles. Interesting experiments will include air, water, and soil analyses, forensic investigations, and a statistically designed optimization. The new Environmental Science program is also creating a variety of undergraduate student research opportunities for which the availability of trace metal analysis is critical.  Outreach activities will be an integral part of this project. A multi-year series of instrumentation workshops will introduce advanced modern instrumentation to a large group of secondary level teachers and students. Workshops will emphasize basic principles, in-depth hands-on instrument experience, and real life applications. Additionally, the new spectrometer will be extensively used for high school student research.",
