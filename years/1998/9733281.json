Such monolayers have traditionally been used to study the phase behavior of liquid-crystalline materials.  This project aims to extend the usefulness of these systems to the area of rheology.  Recent work has demonstrated that monolayers of particles can also be formed.  The rheology of surfactant and colloidal monolayers will be studied using a combination of specialized optical microscopy techniques (Brewster angle and fluorescence microscopy) and interfacial rheometric measurements.  These experiments will lead to a better understanding of processes where monolayer flow is important, such as foam coarsening and emulsion coalescence.  They will also serve as valuable tests for theories describing the behavior of colloidal suspensions under shear.    Performing flow experiments in 2D has several unique advantages:  the theoretical description of the flow is simplified, the entire flow field is directly observable, and the thermodynamic variables can be varied to control the orientation and conformation of the surfactant molecules to a greater degree than is possible in 3D fluid phases.  This project will utilize these advantages to study several important issues in the rheology of complex fluids for the first time.  The experiments will include both rod-shaped and disk-shaped surfactant molecules and will encompass a variety of liquid-crystalline phases, including nematic (and polar nematic), discotic, and hexatic.  The recent discovery of the first 2D small molecule nematic phase (by this research group) will make these experiments possible.  Also, since hexatic phases are peculiar to quasi-2D systems, the rheology of such phases are not understood.  Studies of rod-shaped particles under shear will lead to a  particle-level understanding of the effect of interpartic le interactions and proximity to a wall. Monolayers of spherical particles will be examined as a model system with which to study intriguing behavior in colloidal suspensions including shear thickening/thinning and the connection to shear induced melting and re-entrant solidification.    The simplifications afforded by 2D studies will permit detailed comparisons between the experiments and relevant theories, such as Leslie-Ericksen theory for nematic flow, and allow the development of new theory for hexatic phase hydrodynamics.  Since liquid-crystalline behavior is ubiquitous in 2D systems like monolayers, fundamental understanding of the rheology of 2D liquid crystalline phases will be directly relevant to processes involving surfactant monolayer flow.  For example, the coalescence of oil droplets in emulsions is the basic process regulating emulsion stability and is partly controlled by rheological properties of the surfactant monolayer.  Stability may be desirable, as in paint and coating technologies, or undesirable, as in some surfactant-based oil recovery schemes.  A basic understanding of surfactant monolayer rheology will permit the design of appropriate surfactants for these applications. Similar issues are involved in the stability and collapse of foams.  The rheology of colloidal suspensions is not only scientifically interesting but directly relevant to materials processing in a vast array of industries.  The studies are aimed at making the connection between particle-level structures and processes and macroscopic flow behavior. The simplification of 2D and the ability to observe individual particles over the entire flow field will allow such connections to be made.",
