 "awd_abstract_narration": "9812573  Poland  In the current race to develop Performance-Based Engineering  (PBE) standards and procedures, one of the fundamental needs is  new and significantly improved analysis techniques that have been  tailored to use in design offices.  To be effective, they must by  analytically sound, scientifically defensible, and adaptable to  the intricacies of building design.  Some of the recent research  efforts were made to develop such techniques.  Unfortunately,  they have never found their way into common structural  engineering practices.  This project, a collaboration of  Degenkolb Engineers and the University of California-Berkeley,  intends to develop four new analysis techniques that meet the  needs of performance-based engineering as described in the  conceptual framework of Vision 2000, and in the process, adapt  sound research to structural engineering practice.    This project will complete the following tasks as their  contribution to the collaborated effort: Advise on the  development of the research plan, Compile a database of  buildings, Develop and maintain an analysis utilization matrix,  and Conduct calibration tests.    This project is a 3-year effort.  The first year will focus on  Tasks 1 and 2, while some work will be started on Tasks 3 and 4.   Years 2 and 3 will be focused almost entirely on tasks 3 and 4.    This is an award under the first round (FY'98) competition of the  joint CMS-INT initiative NSF 98-36 \"US-Japan Cooperative Research  in Urban Earthquake Disaster Mitigation\".  ***",
