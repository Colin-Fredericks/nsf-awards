 "awd_abstract_narration": "9809826  According to a 1996 NRC report, fewer than 25% of teachers in grades 5-8 majored in science, and less than 45% completed more than 10 credit hours of college science.  The goal of this proposal is to improve the quality of science teaching in grades 6-12.  Improving science teaching requires a complete overhaul of the traditional science-teaching models, however in-service teachers have few opportunities to see alternate techniques modeled.  The PI proposes to develop a pilot short course that will help in-service science teachers incorporate inquiry-based and research-based education into their teaching techniques.  During this short course, the teachers will do their own geoscience research on a local watershed and develop instructional plans to take their research activities into their classroom.  The course is based on a similar course that was developed for instruction of undergraduates and graduate students.  Although this course will be based on the local watershed, the result will be a model workshop that could be adapted for any location.",
