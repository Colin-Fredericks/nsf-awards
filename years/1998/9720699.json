 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a research proposal with an educational emphasis under  the Interdisciplinary Grants in the Mathematical Sciences  program. The principle investigator will spend the 1998-99  academic year (and summer, 1998) in the Electrical Engineering  department at Virginia Tech University learning the fundamentals  of communications network theory and building a research program  in nonlinear fiber optics for communications.    The PI plans specifically to study spectral approaches to the  nonlinear Schrodinger equation, which models pulse propagation in  communications fibers. He proposes consideration of the equation  both numerically and through extended multiple scales methods,  both of which are in the spectral domain rather than the time  domain. The resulting asymptotic analysis, with accompanying  numerical component, would be extremely valuable to  communications engineers in their efforts to simulate pulse  transmission in fibers where nonlinear effects are significant.  The resulting analysis would also be of keen interest to  researchers and teachers of mathematics.  The PI therefore  expects to be involved in the creation of new mathematical ideas  to meet the needs of emerging technology.    The investigator plans to share his findings with his  mathematical colleagues through seminars, colloquia, conferences  and publications.  He proposes to involve students in his  findings through masters thesis level work and through  undergraduate research projects.    In addition to faculty colleagues and graduate students, the PI  also plans  to make the mathematical aspects of fiber  communications more accessible to undergraduate mathematics major  through his department's Undergraduate Research Program.  This is  an active program in undergraduate research in mathematics which  has been in existence since the spring semester of 1995.  (see  the web site at   http://www.math.vt.edu/UR_brochure/URbrochure.html)    This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary A ctivities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
