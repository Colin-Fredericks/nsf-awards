 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award support preliminary research into price formation and patterns of trading in decentralized markets where agents have asymmetric information.  In markets with many agents and negligible transaction costs economists tend to ignore the institutional framework governing traders interactions, and instead apply the notion of Walrasian (competitive) equilibrium to generate predictions of transaction prices, trades, and final allocations. This approach has proved to be useful in application, and yields accurate predictions in laboratory experiments for centralized markets. Nonetheless, while there are many markets where trade is centralized (e.g., stock and commodities markets), many other important markets (e.g., housing and labor markets) are characterized by decentralized trade.   In this project we introduce a model which is a stylized representation of naturally-occurring decentralized markets. The defining features of our model, and of such markets, are that (i) finding a partner with whom to trade is time consuming and therefore costly, (ii) prices are determined by bilateral bargaining, (iii) when bargaining traders take account of their opportunity to return to the market and search for a new partner, and (iv) the scarcity or abundance of buyers (sellers) affects the delay a seller (buyer) experiences before finding a partner. We also assume preferences are private, which augments the descriptive realism of our model. In contrast to the existing literature concerned with price formation under asymmetric information, no restriction is imposed on traders' possible bargaining positions.  In addition, we conduct market experiments in which trade is decentralized.  These experiments constitute a `stress test` of supply and demand theory, i.e., a test of the theory in a situation where it might not be expected to perform well, and provide data which allow for a test of the rich set of predictions for prices and trading patterns generated by our game theoretic analysis. In our basic experimental market there is one time entry, complete information, and a relatively short time horizon (to allow for many repetitions in one session, thereby giving the subjects the opportunity to come to have common expectations). This experimental design is flexible enough that it can be conveniently modified to introduce different conditions on entry and information, as well as different trading institutions, enabling us to explore other issues (efficiency, convergence, etc.) which may motivate further theoretical research.",
