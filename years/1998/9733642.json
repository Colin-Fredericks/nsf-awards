 "awd_abstract_narration": "We witness an ever-increasing demand for servers that handle continuously accumulating volumes of data. As a result, there is a constant need to develop systems and techniques that effectively support such data. In this direction, Client/Server Database Systems (C/S DBSs) have helped considerably by exploiting transient caching and harnessing networked system resources. However, they have not been able to deliver highly scalable behavior. To this end, cooperative processing methods are investigated and options offered by emerging network technology are explored in order to achieve higher scalability. More specifically, this project examines: techniques that facilitate multi-client cooperation; the effects of high-speed and Gigabit networks on the design of C/S DBSs; and access methods for spatial and multi-dimensional data in C/S environments. The project results will include techniques for cooperative query processing and analysis of their tradeoffs, flexible transaction protocols in the presence of high-speed networks and experimental evaluation of their behavior, as well as indexing methods for C/S environments. As organizations manage increasing volumes of data, such techniques will help ease the strain corporate data servers currently experience. In addition to student supervision, the educational plan includes: introduction of two new courses, participation in outreach programs, and further development of a newly established laboratory.     http://naxos.poly.edu/~ad",
