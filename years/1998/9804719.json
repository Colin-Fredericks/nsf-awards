Research will be undertaken to  determine the effects of strain and doping on the physics and  chemistry of InGaAs/GaAs and InGaP/GaAs (001) surfaces. In  addition, alternative precursors will be studied for  low-temperature growth and doping of these materials. Surface  structures produced by MOCVD will be characterized in situ by  infrared, x-ray photoemission and thermal desorption  spectroscopies, and by scanning tunneling microscopy. Bulk  properties of films will be characterized by triple-axis x-ray  diffraction, electron microscopy, and Hall analysis. New  deposition processes that are developed will be further examined  and tested for fabrication of heterojunction bipolar transistors  (HBTs). The epitaxial layers will be processed into devices by  industry partner, Rockwell, and then tested to compare their  performance relative to commercial HBT products. The project is  co-supported by the DMR Electronic Materials and Solid State  Chemistry Programs, the Office of Naval Research, and the MPS  OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities).  %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  materials science having high potential technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at  a fundamental level to new aspects of electronic/photonic  devices.  Experimental tools are now available to allow atomic  level observation of elementary surface processes which when  better understood allow advances in fundamental science and  technology. The basic knowledge and understanding gained from the  research is expected to contribute to improving the performance  and stability of advance d devices and circuits by providing a  fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing  improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important  feature of the program is the integration of research and  education through the training of students in a fundamentally and  technologically significant area. Students and postdoctoral  scholars working on this project will obtain valuable experience  processing and testing devices at the facilities of industrial  partners.  ***",
