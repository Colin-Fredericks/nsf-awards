 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation project examines the general hypothesis that political values and conceptions of expertise are systematically related with the constructions of citizenship found in the designs of public policies for controlling automotive air pollution.  A two-by-three conceptual matrix, drawn from the researchers previous work in historical political theory, will provide intermediate hypotheses indicating how different conceptions of politics and expertise might combine to form different constructions of citizenship.  This matrix will guide the collection and analysis of the primary data.  The data will be drawn from two carefully bounded areas in California automotive air pollution policy: the development of Inspection and Maintenance programs during the years 1978-1997 and the development of a program for promoting electric vehicles during the years 1990-96.  The proposed project draws on, and addresses shortcomings in, three academic subfields: policy studies, political theory, and the sociology of scientific knowledge.",
