To realize the potential of these advanced materials several issues must be considered, including the development of secondary processes such as machining and precise process control for quality assurance as well as reliability and cost.  The  research has three major objectives: determining the influence of various grinding parameters on intermetallic compounds, developing a mechanistic model for damage formulation, and verification of the damage model via experimental methods.  To develop an empirical model relating grinding parameters and resulting plastic deformation in the material, a set of factorial experiments will be conducted on a highly instrumented grinder.  These data sets will be used to develop and verify the model.  The model development will be based on the understanding of the grinding process physics (including both the mechanical and thermal process characteristics) applied to IMCs.  Once the model has been developed and validated, a controller will be designed and implemented that manipulates the control parameters to achieve the desired results.  Furthermore, a higher-level controller for defining process parameter trajectories will be developed that also addresses economic considerations (e.g., machining time).\r\n\tSuccessful completion of this project will lead to a good understanding of the physics of grinding IMCs, a mechanistic model for damage formulation, and a valuable control strategy for achieving desired grinding results.  The collaboration with several industrial firms provides excellent synergy and sharing of institutional resources.  The project should impact especially on the aerospace, automotive and chemical sectors.\r\n",
