 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested from the NSF to assist in the  purchase of a 500 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  console and two probes. The requested console will replace an  existing Varian VXR-500 console (made in 1987) and will be  located in the recently expanded Department of Chemistry's  Instrumentation Facility (DCIF). The addition of a modern 500  MHz NMR console is an integral part of a major initiative,  including a $540,000 renovation, which is already underway to  upgrade and modernize the multi-user DCIF at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The new capabilities  provided by a 500 MHz NMR instrument with three rf channels  and pulsed field gradients are vital for the carrying out of  biologically-related research in the Department. Projects  that will benefit from the acquisition of a high-field NMR  instrument fall into the following general categories: (1)  investigations of drug-DNA interactions; (2) design of drugs  that selectively inactivate tumor cells; (3) development of a  chemical understanding of the basis for helicity in proteins;  and (4) NMR studies of small proteins.       At present, the two 500 MHz NMR consoles in the DCIF are  more than 10 years old. The lack of modern, high-field NMR  instrumentation requires Departmental researchers with a need  for state-of-the-art NMR technology to obtain time at  regional facilities and negatively impacts productivity.  Biological research being carried out in the Department would  be greatly facilitated by a 500 MHz NMR console with  increased sensitivity, better shims, digital filtering,  pulsed-field gradients, selective excitation, and triple  resonance.",
