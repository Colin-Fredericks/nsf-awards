 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731511  Stroud    Theoretical studies will be conducted in three areas of  research.  The first involves the study of the properties of  superconducting arrays.  The circumstances under which these  arrays can be made to oscillate coherently will be studied  by both numerical and analytical techniques.  Additional  calculations are planned to treat vortex motion, quantum  effects, flux noise, a.c. magnetic susceptibility, classical  magnetoresistance, and long-range interactions in such  arrays, using a variety of theoretical techniques.  The  second area is a theoretical investigation of flux lattice  melting and related phenomena, primarily in high temperature  superconductors.  A previously developed lowest-Landau level  representation will be extended to treat flux lattice  melting in the presence of disorder, and to study the  behavior of the c-axis Josephson plasmon in the flux liquid  state, both with and without disorder.  Further calculations  of flux lattice melting are planned in a uniformly  frustrated XY model and a layered London model, both with  and without pinning.  As a speculative project, the  possibility of extending these approaches to layered  magnetic materials will be investigated.  Finally, several  aspects of the physics of classically inhomogeneous  materials will be studied.  The emphasis will be on the  nonlinear optical response of such materials, and on the  linear a.c. response of polycrystals of anisotropic  materials (such as quasi-one-dimensional conducting  polymers).  It is also planned to examine the possibility of  treating a disordered two-dimensional superconductor as a  model system for chaotic propagation of classical  electromagnetic waves.  %%%  Theoretical research will be conducted in three areas of  research using numerical and analytical techniques.  These  three areas are the study of superconducting arrays; flux  lattice melting; and classical inhomogeneous materials.  The first two areas are ones which have received increased  attention due t o their applicability to the high temperature  superconductors.  The third area is one of great interest in  designing composite materials with unique (optical)  properties.  ***",
