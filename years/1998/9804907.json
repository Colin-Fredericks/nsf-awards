 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humans and other primates have complex dentitions, consisting of teeth of various numbers, types, shapes, and sizes.  An important problem in the basic nature of biological development, is to understand the genetic basis for how such structures are produced.  We cannot ethically work directly on primates because the critical developmental events take place in the embryo.  However, this problem can be studied in the laboratory mouse.  We and others have identified genes that are expressed in developing mouse teeth, and will use various experimental methods to inactivate these genes to determine their role in the process.  In addition, we will be taking a modern DNA sequencing approach (called EST identification), to find genes that are expressed in developing incisors or molars, but not both, and hence may help determine the type of tooth.  The expression of these genes in developing tooth germs will be characterized.  Because mice have incomplete dentitions we cannot translate findings in them automatically to humans or related primates.  However, we will be looking at the expression of the same genes in the laboratory possum, which does have a complete dentition, similar to humans and other primates, to identify constant elements in dental patterning which we might then study in humans in various ways (not part of this project).   Generally, we expect this work will lead to an understanding of how the dentition, or other similarly complex traits, are produced in an embryo and how they vary among species.",
