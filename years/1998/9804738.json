 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Barbara Stark and her colleagues will conduct two field seasons of archaeological survey and analysis in the Western Papaloapan basin in Central Veracruz, Mexico. During past fieldwork in a 62 sq. km. area Dr. Stark mapped 17 formal complexes of building remains as well as a total of 1900 features.  On the basis of associated ceramic remains these have been dated to the Classic period (300-900 AD) and are associated with the Mixtequilla civilization. Dr. Stark now wishes to set them into a broader geographic context and reconstruct the functional relationships among them. To accomplish this goal she will conduct a large scale surface survey of surrounding regions to locate additional structures and complexes. Surface materials including pottery and stone artifacts will be collected and analyzed. On this basis it will be possible to date individual occurrences, determine the degree of interaction among them and gain insight into the range of manufacturing and subsistence activities which took place. Based on relative size and associated remains it will also be possible to determine the extent to which individual features were incorporated into a centralized hierarchical political structure.  Although archaeologists know a great deal about the Mayan civilization, this is only one of many cultures which flourished in prehistoric Middle America. Scientists wish to understand the range of variation in political, economic and social organization which characterizes these complex entities and the Mixtequilla civilization provides an excellent source of data. Although the number of habitation groups is surprisingly high in the relatively small region surveyed, it is not clear how they fit (or don't fit) together. Were they closely integrated into a single hierarchical system or did individual units function with relative autonomy, in contrast to the Classic lowland Mayan case? Dr. Stark's study will provide valuable insight. It will produce data of interest to many archaeologists and assist in training both US and Mexican students.",
