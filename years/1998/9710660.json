 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9710660  One Cell Systems, Inc  Trnovsky      This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to isolate cocaine specific antibodies with catalytic properties by encapsulating cells in gel microdrops (GMD) and subsequently analyzing and sorting them using flow cytometry.  Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility of using GMD technology to screen cells for catalytic activity using four different models each representing a distinct location for catalytic antibody expression.  Fluorescent products are retained within the agarose microsphere and cells of interest recovered for cloning or gene analysis using fluorescent activated cell sorting.  Employing this assay in defined microenvironments allows the identification and recovery of single cells based on product formation and/or binding.  Since cocaine specific antibodies are expected to be rare and weakly catalytic, the microencapsulation technology is particularly suited for these investigations.  Successful completion of these studies will lead to development of a rapid, automated method for isolating, analyzing and recovering cells producing antibodies of interest.    Catalytic antibodies represent a virtually inexhaustible source of biocatalysts.  The ability to generate specific proteases would have a significant impact on biotechnology and medicine for use as therapeutics as well as industrial enzymes.  The total worldwide market for catalytic antibodies is estimated to be in excess of $1.0 billion.  ***",
