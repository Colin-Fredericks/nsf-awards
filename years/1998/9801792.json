Specifically, this project investigates the pinning of  the CDW by the randomly distributed defects in a material such as  NbSe3.  This  is  considered a model system for a one-dimensional  metal, and it is pointed out that the mathematical description of  motion  of  a  CDW  is  in  many  cases  identical  to  equations  describing  growth  of  materials or the motion  of  a  flux-line  lattice  in  a high Tc superconductor. Thus new understanding  on  CDW  behavior  may  be useful in these other contexts  also.  The  experimental project focuses on the kinetics of the CDW  and  how  these  kinetics  are  affected by quenched  random  defects.  The  effects  of  such pinning defects are sought on the  kinetics  of  equilibrium,  near-equilibrium, and  highly  non-equilibrium  CDW  systems.  The  experimental probe employed is x-ray  diffraction,  using  state  of the art methods which are enabled  by  the  high  intensities  of  modern synchrotron sources. The  methods  to  be  employed  are  time-resolved high-resolution diffraction,  micro-  diffraction,  quasi-elastic scattering and inelastic  scattering.  Measurements  with these techniques focus on the  time-dependence  of  the  phase  fluctuations of the  CDW  state  as  affected  by  quenched  random  impurities. The data will be  used  to  perform  quantitative  tests  of several current theories.  This  research  program  is interdisciplinary in nature and involves one or  more  postdoctoral   and  graduate  students,  who  receive   excellent  training  in  preparation  for careers  in  industry,  government  laboratories or academia.  %%%  This  experimental  research project is  concerned  with  unusual  electrical  conduction  processes  which  occur  in  a  class  of  conducting  materials  which are call ed  \"quasi  one  dimensional  metals\".  Such  a  material  is  NbSe3  which  forms  needle-like  crystals  which reflect the one-dimensional or linear  tendencies  of  this material. In these materials, electronic charge can move  only  in  one direction, along the needle-like crystal.  This  is  quite  unlike common metals like copper in which electron  motion  is  three-dimensional,  and substances like  graphite,  in  which  motion  is  confined essentially to a plane.  There  are  special  effects which occur in the one dimensional case, and one of these  is  called  a charge-density-wave (CDW). In this case  electrical  conduction  occurs when the CDW wave, representing  a  correlated  motion of all the electrons along the crystal, moves together  as  a unit. This is an extreme example of correlated electron motion.  This   type   of  conduction  process,  in  quasi-one-dimensional  materials, is of considerable interest, and is the focus of  this  experimental  project. The experimental probe employed  is  x-ray  diffraction, using state of the art methods which are enabled  by  the  high intensities of modern synchrotron sources. The  methods  to  be  employed  are time-resolved high-resolution  diffraction,  micro-diffraction,   quasi-elastic   scattering   and   inelastic  scattering. The information gained in this investigation will add  to the base of knowledge about conduction of electricity in solid  state  materials,  and  could lead to  new  types  of  electronic  devices. This research program is interdisciplinary in nature and  involves  one  or  more postdoctoral and graduate  students,  who  receive   excellent  training  in  preparation  for  careers   in  industry, government laboratories or academia.  ***",
