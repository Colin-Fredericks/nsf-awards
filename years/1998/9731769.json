Although these powders are  processed in nonaqueous media satisfactorily, the need for  environmentally safer media for manufacturing ferroelectric  components is increasing.  Two of most widely used ferroelectric  ceramic powders, barium titanate (BT) and lead zirconate titanate  (PZT), will be used as \"model\" systems.  Fine powders of BT and  PZT will be characterized and dispersed in aqueous media, and the  particles will be stabilized by adsorbed organic molecules.  The  stabilizer molecules will be selected for their solubility in  water, strong anchoring groups, and sterically stabilizing chains  for dispersion and binding of the ceramic particles.  Strong and  uniform adsorption of the organic stabilizer acting also as  passivating agents to prevent the dissolution of metal ions from  the powders will be investigated.  The interaction between  liquid-particle, particle-dispersant, and liquid-dispersant will  be studied based on the physicochemical properties of the  participants.  The effect of the dispersant on stabilization of  the submicron ferroelectric ceramic particles will be assessed by  analyzing the rheology, zeta potential/isoelectric points,  sedimentation behavior, particle characteristics, conformation of  the adsorbates, green body properties, and metal ion dissolution  of BT and PZT.  %%%  The ultimate goal of this study is to obtain high density green  bodies with uniform microstructure of high reproducibility and  reliability.  Formed under these conditions, the green ceramics  will lead to lower organic content with high green density which  will shorten processing times and lower sintering temperatures.  The results will provide the needed assistance to the  manufacturing problem the industry is facing now by better  controlling the reproducibility of ferroelectric powder slips.  This control wil l bring lower manufacturing cost with higher  product quality and more environmentally \"friendly\" systems. This  project will be carried out under interdisciplinary cooperation  among the Ceramic & Materials Engineering Department at Clemson  University, Kemet Electronics Corporation, and the National  Institute of Standards and Technology. Kemet Electronics  Corporation, the industrial partner, will provide their research,  analytical, and production capabilities available to Professor  Lee, as well and providing a summer internship for a graduate  student.  In addition, a graduate student will spend a summer  working at the National Institute of Standards and Technology,  using facilities that are not available at Clemson or at Kemet.  The scientific results obtained from this study will be  transferred to the industrial partner.  Because of the strong  linkage with industry, the educational aspects of the project are  enhanced.  The summer internship at Kemet will expose the  graduate student to industrial-type research.  This GOALI project  is co-funded by the Ceramics Program of Division of Materials  Research, the Particulate and Multiphase Processes Program of  Division of Chemical and Transport Systems, the Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical  Sciences Directorate, and the GOALI Office of the Engineering  Directorate.  ***",
