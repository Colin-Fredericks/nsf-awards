These problems are   connected to the study of changing sign solutions for Yamabe type   problems as well as the study of Yang-Mills and Einstein equations.   They are also connected to the finding of periodic orbits for contact   vector fields.  There is finally some relation to quantum mechanics.   The tools are extracted from partial differential equations, geometry   and variational theory.  \\medskip    There are in Physics several open problems regarding the shape and the   behavior of the universe as well as the behavior of its elementary   particles.  Using these tools from mathematics, variational theory and   its extensions in particular, we are trying to give some contribution   to the understanding of these problems, which have an independent   mathematical interest.          \\end",
