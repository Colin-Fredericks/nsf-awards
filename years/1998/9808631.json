 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 98-08631  COOPER      The nerve cell (\"neuron\") is chemically integrated with other  cells at morphologically-identified locations called synapses.  Just how much effect a neuron has on its synaptic targets varies.  The characteristics of neurons' differences in synaptic efficacy  are affected by their intrinsic activity.  Different levels of  activity modulate long-term alterations in both structure and  performance of synapses.  There are chemicals, \"neuromodulators,\"  endogenously released within an animal, which may enhance or  suppress synaptic efficacy.  These in turn affect the animal's  behavior.  Neuromodulators affect cellular processes by  stimulating various signaling cascades mediated by different  classes of ligand receptors (protein molecules in the cell  membrane which neuromodulators specifically recognizes and bind  to). Such changes are believed to play roles in learning and  memory, as well as in behavior. There are two objectives to the  present study:  1) to determine if neuromodulators acutely affect  different neuromuscular synapses (synapses from neurons onto  muscle cells, through which the nervous system causes muscles to  contract) differently, and  2) to examine the long-term  physiological and anatomical effects neuromodulators have on such  synapses. The crustacean nervous system is being used because it  easily lends itself to experimentation in this area. The activity  of individual synapses on identified single cells can be analyzed,  the synapses and cells can be marked, and the same synapses can be  identified later for structural investigation by electron  microscopy. The crayfish model systems described here provide  direct correlation of structure and function at individual  synapses of identified single cells. This model nervous system not  only makes it possible to assess effects of neuromodulators on  well-characterized behaviors, but it also allows direct  correlation between identified synapses and certain behavioral  components. It permits the ide ntification of specific cellular  mechanisms responsible for the various manifestations of synaptic  differentiation.  Progress in this area will provide a clearer  general understanding of the mechanisms by which neuromodulators  modify behavior by altering the fine structure and cellular  physiology of the nervous system. The project will examine how  altering synaptic efficacy by neuromodulators affects motor neuron  structure and function, and will analyze how these changes affect  the muscles they innervate.",
