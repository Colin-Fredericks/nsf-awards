 "awd_abstract_narration": "A one day meeting, called the East Coast Computer Algebra Day  (ECCAD), will be held at the US Naval Academy, Annapolis,  Maryland, on April 25, 1998. This series of meetings has become a  regular event for  the region, with different academic and  industrial institutions hosting the meeting in rotation.  The  purpose of this meeting is to stimulate interest in and enhance  understanding of the technical aspects of computer  algebra, by  providing a way for those in the region who are active or  interested in becoming more active in computer algebra to meet  with each other in an inexpensive and easily accessible way.  This meeting is more informal than the annual ISSAC meetings,  with ample time for unstructured interaction.  Participation by  the region's graduate students is  particularly encouraged  through special invitation to  contribute to the poster sessions,  and through travel support.  Three invited lectures will anchor  the meeting and will help attract participants.  The invited  talks and poster sessions contributed by  the community will  cover the breadth of computer algebra: algorithms, software,  and applications.",
