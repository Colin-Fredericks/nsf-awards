This       synchronization is accomplished in higher-order organisms, such as       mammals,  by  a network of neural cells in a small region  of  the       brain  called  the  suprachiasmatic nucleus. This  neural  network       forms  a \"biological clock\" that acts as the dominant time-keeping       mechanism  in  mammals,  and ensures that all  physiological  body       systems  are  in synchrony. It is now becoming apparent  that  the       biological clock in mammals does not act independently, but rather       the  clock' s timing can be influenced by input from other regions       of the brain. This study seeks to identify how activation of these       other brain regions can affect the timing of the biological clock.       The results of this investigation will likely demonstrate that the       biological  clock  in the suprachiasmatic nucleus  is  part  of  a       larger pacemaker system in the mammalian brain, and that the clock       integrates  input from other brain regions before  sending  out  a       synchronizing   signal  to  the  body.  This   study   will   also       significantly  enhance the training of undergraduate  students  in       the  sciences, both by the acquisition of new tools which  can  be       utilized for research and teaching, and by employing undergraduate       students   in   every   aspect  of  the  research   performed   in       accomplishing the objectives of this proposal.",
