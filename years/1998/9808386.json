 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 98-08386  ANDERSON     Voltage-gated calcium channels are complex proteins found in the  membranes of many types of cell that are essential for many of  their functions. Structurally, they usually consist of a pore-  forming alpha1 subunit, and associated beta, gamma, and  alpha2/delta subunits.  Because there are at least 7 varieties of  alpha1 subunit in mammals, and 6 beta subunits, there is enormous  structural and functional diversity within the calcium channel  family. The project will determine whether the structural  diversity of calcium channels in higher animals has been selected,  in the evolutionary sense, to fulfill the many different functions  of calcium channels, or rather is an 'accidental' consequence of  gene duplication and subsequent tissue-specific or developmental  gene isolation. The hypothesis is that in cnidarians (jelly fish  and their relatives), the earliest existing animals to have a  nervous system, there are very few calcium channel types, but that  they can meet the needs of a fully functional nervous system. If  this hypothesis is correct, it would argue that enormous  structural diversity among calcium channels is not required for a  functioning neuromuscular system.  Aim #1 of this proposal is to  identify all calcium channel subunits in the jellyfish Cyanea  using conventional molecular cloning techniques.  Aim #2 is to map  the distribution of those subunits in all stages of the animal's  life cycle using immunohistochemistry, and to identify any  patterns of co-localization of the subunits. Aim #3 is to express  the cloned subunits in oocytes (developing eggs) from the clawed-  frog Xenopus together with the previously cloned pore-forming  alpha1 subunit and to characterize the types of calcium currents  produced by the various subunit assemblies identified during Aim  #2.  The proposed research will provide fundamental information  about the evolution of calcium channels.",
