 "awd_abstract_narration": "9812531  Chopra  It has been recognized by the profession the need for designing  structures to meet stated performance goals.  A major challenge  is to develop simple, yet effective analytical methods for the  design, verification, evaluation and quality control of  structures so that they realistically meet the selected  performance objectives.    The overall objectives of this research project are to develop  dynamic analysis procedures suitable for the next generation of  seismic codes and guidelines to design new buildings and to  evaluate existing buildings.  A hierarchy of (i) elastic analysis  procedures to design or evaluate buildings for \"fully  operational\" or \"operational\" performance levels, (ii) inelastic  analysis procedures to design and evaluate buildings for  \"operational,\" \"life safe\" or \"near collapse\" performance levels,  and (iii) criteria to evaluate the accuracy and the range of  applicability of each procedure will be developed.    Further, investigations will be conducted to (1) evaluate, from a  fundamental point of view, applicability of the present knowledge  to near-source ground motions; and (2) generalize the existing  analytical procedures or, if necessary, develop fundamentally  different methods for near-source excitations.    This project represents a collaborative effort with Japanese  researchers and Degnenkolb Engineers, (CMS-9812573).  Researchers  in the U.S. and Japan will use common near-source ground motions  recorded in both countries an calibrate their simplified  analytical procedures against common structures whose motions  have been recorded during past earthquakes.     This project is supported under the first round (FY'98)  competition of the joint CMS-INT initiative NSF 98-36, \"US-Japan  Cooperative Research in Urban Earthquake Disaster Mitigation.\"  ***",
