 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727037  Holtsford    Flowers exhibit a wide range of shapes, sizes, colors and scents.  The   diversity of floral features is thought to have evolved as a consequence of   a long history of interactions with the animals that forage for pollen and   nectar and in so doing, transfer pollen among flowers.  Plants with flower   traits that elicit favorable pollinator service should have more offspring   so that favorable floral traits will increase in frequency.  If different   pollinators prefer different types of flowers then pollen transfer between   plants with different flowers will be reduced which may lead to the   evolution of new plant species.  This project will experimentally address   two key questions in the logical but untested scenario outlined above -   what floral features affect pollinator interactions and are pollinators   choosy enough to cause a divergence in floral form?         Two species of wild tobaccos (Nicotiana  alata  and N. forgetiana,   Solanaceae), provide an excellent opportunity for experimentation. These   species are interfertile, morphologically divergent, and their ranges   overlap in southern Brazil. Their floral morphology, color, phenology, and   our observations suggest they are adapted to different pollinators (N.   alata  is pollinated by hawkmoths, N. forgetiana is pollinated by   hummingbirds and bees).  An F2 population derived from interspecific   crosses shows tremendous variation in many floral traits.  By sowing this   hybrid population in an experimental garden within both species' natural   range we will be able to determine which floral traits are most important   in attracting different kinds of pollinators.  Then, the offspring of these   open-pollinated flowers will be grown to see whether the pollinators'   behavior changed the distribution of floral traits in the next generation.         This work is important because it will provide detailed information about   plant-pollinator interactions and will provide an experimental test of a   pro minent speciation scenario.  We know very little about the formation of   new species, a shortcoming that is especially important because we are   losing species to extinction at an unprecedented rate.",
