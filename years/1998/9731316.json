 "awd_abstract_narration": "ESI  9731316    This Local Systemic Change proposal is submitted by a partnership involving 5 school districts in collaboration with scientists and science educators from the University of Rhode Island.  The project will offer high quality professional development to 350 teachers, grades K-8, in 29 schools.   Ten Kindergarten Science Resource teachers will be among these participants.   Inquiry based kits from well established curriculum projects, FOSS and STC, have been selected for implementation grades K-6 and will be delivered to teachers and refurbished by the regional instructional materials Resource Center used by the KITES project.    The extension of the common science curriculum to grades 7 and 8 has been accomplished in partnership with high school science department chairs and middle school science teachers.   The middle school curriculum changes will be led by a group of 10 middle school science teachers exploring the extension of the common science curriculum into grades 7 and 8, with SEPUP instructional materials being considered for implementation.  Science mentors recruited from the university and the private sector will partner with elementary teachers.  The project will have significant impact on elementary and secondary teacher preparation as materials and curriculum used with the preservice teachers will be adapted for use in science methods courses.  Computers and connections are available in all five districts to facilitate networking among teachers.   The request is for $1,047, 908 for 5 years with cost sharing estimated as $1,166,823.",
