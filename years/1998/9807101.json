 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ng - 9807101  A research program is planned to develop a procedure to identify a multiphase reactor for carrying out a given reaction at the early stage of process development.  Such gas-liquid, gas-solid, liquid-liquid and gas-liquid-solid reactions, with the solid being a catalyst or a reactant, provide the basis for a large number of chemical, petrochemical and biochemical operations.  There are three elements to this screening approach --- a generic reactor model, an accompanying sensitivity model, and a knowledge base consisting of heuristics, and correlations on hydrodynamics, heat and mass transport.  In synthesizing a generic reactor model, the conventional multiphase reactors are decomposed into common attributes and constituent parts, and reaggregated for the reaction under consideration.  Thus, in addition to choosing between conventional reactor types, the procedure also provides insights for the creation of novel reactors.  The sensitivity model quantifies the relative impact of the model parameters on the reactor performance.  The knowledge base provides heuristics, estimates and reality checks in the decision making process.    The PI has initiated work on isothermal, single reaction systems.  Heat effects, multiple reactions and safety will be emphasized in this work.  For a given reaction, the alternative reactors identified in the screening approach can be represented in a superstructure, which will then be examined rigorously using optimization techniques to produce an optimal design.  Case studies will be used to help identify heuristics and to provide users with concrete examples.  A computer code is planned to demonstrate the procedure, and to facilitate the use of this procedure by chemists, engineers and students.  The physics and chemistry of reactions will be emphasized in all aspects of the program.  The results could contribute to reactor design in industry, both in conceptualization and process development, and provide a coherent body of knowledge and concrete exampl es for teaching design of reaction system synthesis.",
