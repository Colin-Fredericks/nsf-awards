 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802784  Levy  This award provides partial support to develop a variable-  temperature \"apertureless\" near -field scanning optical  microscope (ANSOM) for studying local electronic and lattice  dynamics in nanostructured optoelectronic materials.  The  instrument will have unique and unprecedented capabilities,  combining near-atomic spatial resolution, femtosecond  temporal resolution, a wide operating temperature range  (1.6K-400K), and operation in magnetic fields up to 10  Tesla.  The instrument is specifically suited for the study  of material properties which couple to refractive index  changes.  The contrast mechanism for ANSOM comes from  measuring small phase shifts in scattered light from an  atomic or magnetic force microscope tip.  By modulating the  tip-sample separation, it is possible to measure local  sample polarizabilities (electric or magnetic) at length  scales significantly smaller than those attainable by either  conventional optical or fiber-based near-field scanning  optical microscopes (NSOMs).  The instrument design will  also allow it to be used as a confocal scanning optical  microscope, which can focus or collect light with high  efficiency and diffraction-limited spatial resolution.    There are presently several low-temperature NSOMs operating  in laboratories around the world.  Sub-wavelength spatial  resolution for these instruments is obtained by scanning a  tapered optical fiber close to the sample to form an image.  However, both practical and fundamental constraints prevent  the optical resolution from approaching that of atomic-force  microscopy (AFM) or scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).  The unique power of this instrument will come from the  ability to combine traditional strengths of optical methods  (e.g., time resolution or energy selectivity) with the  spatial resolution of atomic force microscopy.  It is  possible using ANSOM to achieve spatial resolution below 10  A.  The combination of spatial and temporal resolution will  open many new research  avenues related to dynamical  processes in nanometer-scale condensed matter systems.    The immediate scientific applications are threefold: (1) the  study of exciton dephasing in semiconductor quantum dots,  (2) spectroscopic and time-resolved studies of neutral  excitations in single conjugated polymer chains, and (3)  lattice dynamics and domain wall motion in ferroelectrics  and quantum paraelectrics.  Longer-range goals include the  study of magnetization dynamics in ultrathin magnetic films,  applications in biology (e.g., DNA sequencing), and  optically detected magnetic resonance.  The construction of  this instrument will benefit from the design principles of  earlier pioneers in the area of low-temperature scanning  probe microscopy.  Principles that ensure sufficient  vibration isolation, coarse approach mechanisms, etc., have  been incorporated into the proposed design.  Many of the  critical design parameters have been assessed from the  construction of a room-temperature prototype, which is  currently being used to study domain dynamics in  ferroelectric thin films.    The construction of this instrument will provide valuable  experience for students at both the graduate and  undergraduate level.  The project will be overseen by the  principal investigator, who will direct a postdoctoral  researcher, a graduate student, and several undergraduate  students.  The graduate student will work closely with  undergraduates on various subtasks related to the larger  goal of  building the proposed instrument,  such as writing  software drivers for instruments such as lock-in amplifiers  and temperature controllers.  The overall goals of the  project will be discussed during group meetings so that  undergraduates (and graduate students) can see how their  project fits in with the larger goal.  Support for both the  graduate and undergraduate students comes from an NSF  CAREER award DMR-9701725.  %%%  ***",
