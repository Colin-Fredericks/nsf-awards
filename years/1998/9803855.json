 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid technological advances in recent years have made  wireless communication an integral part of modern society in  this information age. Among several digital cellular  systems, GSM is a successful and dominant wireless system in  today's market. Because of its potential application in  wireless systems, blind equalization has become an important  research subject of communication signal processing in  recent years. Although a large number of published works  propose various blind algorithms, few have dealt with  practical wireless cellular systems. Such a lack of  practical consideration of actual wireless systems is  alarming and frustrating to practitioners. The main  objective of this research is to determine effective means  to apply blind equalization into GSM and other similar  wireless systems. Its importance arises from considerations  that (a) exploiting blind equalization criteria may improve  the reliability of GSM receivers; (b) future wireless  standards can benefit from blind equalization algorithms by  reducing training overhead; (c) studies of practical  wireless system will help advance the general research on  blind equalization. The challenge as well as the application  of blind equalization lies in the practical need for  communication receivers to equalize unknown channels without  the assistance and expense of training sequences. This  research will not only study generic algorithms for QAM  blind equalization, but also investigate key issues involved  in the application of linear and nonlinear blind  equalization algorithms in wireless communications.",
