 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops, evaluates, and disseminates, hands-on laboratory exercises specifically designed for undergraduates who are not majoring in SMET disciplines.  A portion of the project focuses on teacher prepartation with a significant number of the target audience being future K-12 teachers.      Exercises explore both the technological and the scientific aspects of familiar technological devices and demonstrate how technology incorporates a scientific understanding of nature.  Familiar technological devices such as the automobile, the radio, and the telephone are used to engage the interest of students in learning about technology and science.    All exercises are designed to result in tangible evidence of accomplishment on the part of the student such as construction of a simple working radio.  Approximately half of the projects are made from inexpensive and simple materials so that each student can take home the working device.  Other exercises stress an uncommonly high degree of contact with the workings of technology such as construction of an uncommonly high degree of contact with the workings of technology such as construction of a diode laser light source or construction of a 4-bit binary adder from basic logic circuits.  Exercises are optimized for non-engineering and non-science students with little prior technical background.  All laboratories are inexpensive, do not require any specialized equipment or facilities, and are capable of being modified to suit different institutional circumstances.    A semester-long series of approximately twelve exercises are developed within this project.  Both a student and instructor's laboratory manual are included.  The proposed work is based on the \"Science and Technology of Everyday Life,\" taught a Hope College since 1995.  Dissemination includes approaching a commercial publisher for possible publication.",
