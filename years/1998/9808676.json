 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nRogers, Scott\r\n9808676\r\n\r\nA surprising number and variety of microorganisms can be recovered from the interior of deep-core samples of polar ice in Greenland and Antarctica, perhaps dating back 250, 000  years. Although filamentous fungi, yeast, bacteria, and a plant virus have recently been detected in samples of this ancient ice--carefully protected from modern contaminants--systematic surveys of these cores for microbes have not been conducted These discoveries confirm the opinion that glacial (polar) ice is a natural air-sampling mechanism, which has trapped wind-transported microorganisms through geological epochs. These organisms (representing taxa that are endemic to the polar regions, as well as exotics from temperate and tropical regions) originated from aerosols generated by sea wave action, wind-borne pollen and soil particles, infected plant surfaces, and many other sources. Thus, glacial ice provides a unique global source of microorganisms that presents a view of both contemporary and ancient fungal, bacteria!, and viral diversity.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this work is to characterize microbial biodiversity within ancient communities of fungi, bacteria, and viruses for comparative studies with contemporary species. Specific objectives are to: identify and characterize endemic and exotic fungi, bacteria, and viruses entrapped in glacial ice; identify those in ice of the same age from both Greenland and Antarctica; and study phylogeny and longevity in selected persistent species. A potential objective of this study is to use the above profiles to compare the relative proportions of the various fungi, bacteria, and viruses, and to correlate these with environmental characteristics (climatic conditions, vulcanism, etc.) at each of the time points. \r\n\r\nHypotheses to be tested are: First, viruses that infect humans, animals, plants, and bacteria are present and can be detected in polar ice. Second, identical fungi, bacteria, and viruses occur in ice of the same age from Greenland and Antarctica. Third, specific fungi, bacteria, and viruses (or their nucleic acids) persist in ice over long periods of time.\r\n\r\nProfiles of successively older ice strata from cores collected in Greenland and Antarctica will be utilized to test the hypotheses.  The proposed temporal and spatial analyses will extend the assessment of microbial biodiversity to geologic timeframes. If identical microbial species can be detected in ice of similar age collected from both polar regions, as evidence of global distribution, they might then be utilized in subsequent studies as bioindicators of global changes in climate, and geologic and human activity. Thus, bipolar studies are essential. \r\n\r\nThe protocols developed and tested may contribute to future searches for microorganisms in Martian polar ice or recently discovered lunar ice. Therefore, for comparative purposes it will be essential to know what microorganisms are present in ancient Earth ice.\r\n\r\n",
