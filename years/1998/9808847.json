 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fertilization is an attractive model in which to study phenomena of cell-cell recognition, adhesion and fusion during development. Most prior work in this area has relied on biochemical and immunological approaches and a genetic approach has been lacking. Sperm-egg interactions in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an attractive model system in which to study the genetic control of cell-cell interaction that occur during fertilization. Several mutants (including spe-9 and fer-14) produce cytologically normal sperm that are motile, but they cannot fertilize when they collide with an oocyte. The spe-9 gene encodes an epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain containing integral membrane protein, and such EGF cell surface proteins are known from much prior work to play critical roles in cell-cell interactions. Therefore, it is likely that spe-9 mutants are defective in either sperm-oocyte recognition, adhesion or fusion. Equivalent mutants affecting gamete interactions have not been described in any other metazoan. The proposed experiments within this project are guided by four Specific Aims, which are:\r\n\r\nSpecific Aim 1: Immunofluorescence will be use to localize SPE-9 on the spermatozoon surface to reveal the region important for gamete interaction.\r\n\r\nSpecific Aim 2: Extragenic suppressors of spe-9 will be selected to identify additional genes involved in sperm-oocyte interactions and begin construction of the genetic hierarchy in which spe-9 functions.\r\n\r\nSpecific Aim 3: Other mutants that appear to have a phenotype similar to that caused by spe-9 will be further investigated. Those that fulfill a set of criteria developed based on the spe-9 phenotype, such as fer-14, will be subjected to detailed cell biological, genetic, and molecular analyses.\r\n\r\nSpecific Aim 4: Movements and gamete interactions in spe-9, fer-14 and other mutants will be followed in vivo by newly developed nontoxic methods that fluorescently label sperm and allow real time observations.\r\n\r\nThese studies should reveal novel information about gamete recognition and cell surface phenomena that are important prior to and during fertilization.",
