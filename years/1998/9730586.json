The activities employ the learning cycle and address student preconceptions.  Students explore physical phenomena, find patterns and relationships and develop explanations and interpretations for how nature works.  PRISMS has been disseminated in the National Diffusion Network and via teacher workshops.  The PRISMS activities are to be revised to more completely address the National Science Education Standards.  New activities demonstrate connections to other disciplines, increase the level of inquiry by introducing longer term projects and requiring communication to parents and other students, and incorporate technological design and educational technologies.  Authentic assessments and rubrics for their use are developed.  Activities are also available in Spanish.  Teachers are involved in the development of the materials and in the pilot and field-testing.  The materials are commercially disseminated.",
