 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728662  DE LEON     Axons are a functional and distinct extension  of the cell bodies (soma) if nerve cells.  Axons transport  materials that are needed to carry on the daily cell-to-cell  communications that occur distant from the soma.  At times of  rapid axon growth, such as during normal development and axon  regeneration, the nerve cell's soma (where the nucleus is located)  synthesizes high levels of key proteins and phospholipids.  These  newly synthesized materials are efficiently transported to the end  of the axon where regenerative or developmental growth occurs.  Presumably, some of these newly synthesize proteins are important  for axon growth.  This research will determine if a recently  discovered neuronal fatty acid binding protein, named DA11FABP, is  required for nerve cells to grow neurites successfully.  Previous  studies from the PI's laboratory have shown that DA11FABP exhibits  a robust induction during both developmental and regenerative  axonal growth.  The first goal of the study will be to create a  neuronal-like cell line expressing significantly reduced levels of  DA11 protein and determine if these cell lines exhibit a deficit  in producing neurites during cellular differentiation.  The next  goal of the study is to determine what is the biological ligand of  DA11 in these cell lines.  This part of the study includes the  production of recombinant protein and conducting binding studies  to determine the affinity of the ligand(s) for DA11.  The last  part of the study will determine whether the biological action of  DA11 during cellular differentiation is directly linked to its  binding of its ligand(s).  The results obtained from this study  would likely increase our understanding of the molecular and  cellular mechanism of axon growth and nerve regeneration.",
