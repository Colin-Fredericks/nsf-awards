 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810524  Van BOCKSTAELE  The brain nucleus locus coeruleus (LC)  has been intensely investigated because it provides the  neurotransmitter norepinephrine to all major levels of the brain  and spinal cord.  Neurons in the LC are the first norepinephrine-  containing cell group to develop in the central nervous system.  Numerous lines of research have shown that norepinephrine from the  LC may be involved in regulating neuronal outgrowth in regions of  the brain which receive norepinephrine innervation, such as  cortical and limbic brain regions.  Interestingly, the intrinsic  physiological activity of LC neurons varies during development and  may account for their involvement in these functions.  Electrophysiological recordings from neonatal LC neurons in brain  slices display oscillations in their membrane potentials which are  synchronous throughout the entire nucleus.  The frequency of  oscillations increases from 0.3 Hz to 3 Hz until about three weeks  of age when they disappear.  The synchronous activity observed in  neonatal LC neurons is thought to be the result of electrical  coupling between LC cells.  However, gap junction proteins, the  anatomical substrate for electrical coupling, have not been  demonstrated by electron microscopy nor has their existence been  established at different periods of development in the LC.  In  addition, there have been no electrophysiological experiments that  have examined the modulation of electrical coupling by compounds  known to inhibit or stabilize gap junctions.       The primary objective of our research is to unequivocally  establish the existence of gap junction proteins that can couple  LC neurons to each other or to glial cells at different stages of  development.  The methods include dual labeling  immunocytochemistry at the electron microscopic level in young and  adult rat brain using antibodies specific for the gap junction  protein family, known as connexins, and for the norepinephrine  synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase.  Addition ally,  electrophysiological recordings from individual LC neurons will be  conducted in vitro and to test their responses to agents known to  modulate gap junctions.  Finally, individual LC neurons will be  intracellularly filled and examined for dye coupling at both light  and electron microscopic levels.  Taken together, the anatomical  and electrophysiological results obtained from this research will  shed light on the functional architecture of LC in development and  will thus lay the groundwork for future studies aimed at  elucidating the role of the LC/norepinephrine system in regulating  control of its postsynaptic targets.",
