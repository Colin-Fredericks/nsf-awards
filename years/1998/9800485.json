 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800485 Gschwend The objective of this project is to determine the significance of soot, much of which is produced during combustion processes, in sorption of organic contaminants from sediments and soil.  Sorption of contaminants by soot limits the mobility of contaminants in soil and sediments and controls their availability for being degraded biologically.  In this project, soot carbon will be isolated from contaminated sediments at two sites with contrasting histories of pollutant inputs.  One has received contaminants from adjacent land by direct atmospheric fallout, overland flow during storms and release to groundwater from exfiltration.  The other site is a coastal harbor location, sediments at which have been heavily contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls.  The soot carbons from these sources will be characterized for their physical properties, their adsorbed pollutants removed and then used for experimental determination of their sorption properties.  The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon sorbates planned for use include naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene, exhibiting a range of hydrophobicities.  A mix of planar and nonplanar polychlorinated biphenyls will also be evaluated to determine the behavior of compounds that come in contact with the soot carbon only after both have been separately introduced into the environment.\r\n \r\nResults of this project are expected to enable assessment of the role that soot carbons play in influencing the engineering design of processes and systems for decontamination of sediments and soils contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other contaminants that are sorbed to this type of carbon.  Knowledge of the capacity that soot carbon has for restraining release and migration of those contaminants is likely to play an important role in determining the need for engaging in decontamination procedures, and when found to be needed, the extent to which decontamination must be practiced to reach the level at which contaminants are bound to soot carbon and no longer pose an environmental threat.  \r\n\r\n",
