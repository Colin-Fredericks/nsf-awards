 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705648  Scanlan  By theory of aeroelesticity, motion of a body or object in wind  is accompanied by time-varying aerodynamic lift occasioned by the  crossflow.  This lift lags behind the body motion, exhibiting a  time delay in its \"build-up\".  Such characteristics are typified  by indicial lift functions that accompany a unit step change in  angle of attack of the body.    This project will study the character of such indicial functions  for various bridge deck shapes through a novel application of  Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) which, while employing an  established computational code, applies it in a new way that  avoids the considerable complications associated with following  full-cycle body oscillation.    The particular application - the stability of bridge decks under  high winds- is of direct usefulness in design studies for long-  span bridges.    The research offers the prospect of entirely avoiding certain  wind tunnel experiments related to bridge stability, thus making  the design cycle more efficient, particularly for long-span  bridges.  ***",
