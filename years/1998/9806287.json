 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: CMS-9806287, Frank Gonzalez, PMEL/ NOAA    The objective of a Community Model is to provide a stable Research  and  Development infrastructure; an essential for the systematic and  efficient  development, improvement and application of mathematical/computer  models of  a physical process (in this case of the impact of a tsunami on a  coastline). It provides a more effective mechanism to update and  promulgate  needed changes in the models, to incorporate important advances in  the  technology. The concept of a Community Model has been embraced and  exploited with considerable success by other scientific  communities.    This action is to support a workshop that will bring together  leading  tsunami modelers and experts in tsunami hazard mitigation to  discuss the  idea of the Tsunami Community Modeling Facility (TCMF), to guide  and  critique the concept of the TCMF, and to identify important  organizational,  procedural, and technical issues that the tsunami hazard  mitigation  community must deal with in order that the TCMF can function  effectively  and provide a much-needed focal point for advances in tsunami  hazard  mitigation.    The Tsunami Community Model will function as a (perhaps  distributed)  repository for state-of-the-art tsunami models, for ancillary data  required  to run the models (bathymetry, topography, ...), for field  observational  data to test and verify models, and for an archive of documented  model runs  and numerical experiments. Internet and World Wide Web technology  will be  exploited to make this facility accessible and useful to the  entire tsunami  community. The concept is simple but very effective, and is most  easily  visualized in terms of the functions and activities of several  important  participants: the Model Steward, the Scientific User, and Tsunami  Hazard  Planners. (The Model Steward functions as the expert on models  supported by  the community modeling facility, and maintains and provides the  latest  release of the model code to users .) Periodic meetings of Users,  Planners,  and the Model Steward are crucial. Here, important decisions on  the further  modification and evolution of the models and associated hazard  mitigation  products are discussed and agreed upon, in order to achieve the  primary  goals of the Tsunami Community Model.",
