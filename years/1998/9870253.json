 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870253  The goal of this grant is the development of very  expressive, yet provably statically type-safe, object  oriented programming languages. The following topics will be  the main focus of this work:  (1) The design of module  systems for object-oriented programming languages.  The  module system will be designed and implemented as an  extension of the language LOOM.  (2) The application of the  knowledge learned in the design of LOOM to extend the  expressiveness of Java by adding a \"ThisType\" construct and  parametric polymorphism. This work will include adding a  generalization of the ThisType construct to support the  equivalent of Beta's virtual types in a type-safe way.  (3)  The development of materials to better communicate the  results of recent work on the foundations of object-oriented  languages to a broader audience. (4) The extension of  preliminary work on the design of a statically-typed  concurrent object-oriented language.   Major problems to be  solved include reserving objects during method calls and  providing more robust constructs to make it easier to avoid  deadlock.  Techniques for investigating all of these areas  include both formal methods (e.g., proofs of type safety) as  well as the construction of interpreters and/or compilers to  support experimentation with the new languages and  designs.***",
