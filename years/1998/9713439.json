The focus is on two  prototypical systems, Ti/Al and Nb/Al.  The former system is  of importance in semiconductor metallization schemes while  the latter is a simpler model system with qualitatively  similar reaction kinetics.  Studies include the reactions of  Ti and Nb with pure A1 and the effects of Cu in A1 on phase  reactions in these systems given the importance of Cu  alloying in mitigating electromigration failure in  integrated circuits.  Reaction kinetics are investigated by  differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the  microstructure of reactant and product phases by  transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  TEM studies are  used to correlate the location of product phase nucleation  sites with the microstructural features of the reactant  layers, such as triple junctions.  Partially reacted samples  are examined in cross section by high resolution analytical  electron microscopy (AEM) to measure the composition  profiles in the reactants and products at various times and  to clarify the effect of reactant and product grain  boundaries on the progress of the reaction.  Complementary  analytical calculations and simulations are used to  interpret the experimental results.  These include a kinetic  model of phase formation based on coupled rate equations and  a lattice model of phase growth and impingement which  permits the determination of space-time correlations in  evolving microstructures.  %%%  This research on the kinetics of microstructure formation in  thin films is important to the application of metallic films  in the magnetics and electronics industries.  ***",
