The central focus of the meeting is to discuss the latest developments and discoveries in membrane transport including ion pumps, cotransporters and ion channels, and in long distance transport.  The control of ion and metabolite transport across plasma membranes and organellar membranes is a integral function of many life processes, including nutrient import and distribution, transduction of hormonal and environmental signals in development, and adaptation to environmental stress.  Recent advances in this field have been dramatic and remarkable.  The funds will provide a rare opportunity for young scientists to learn and interact with an international group of scientists, most of whom have not spoken at meetings held in the United States.  This is the only meeting that brings such a large and diverse group of plant membrane biologists together from all over the world.",
