 "awd_abstract_narration": "9711076  Smith        It has long been known that mountains influence not only local, but also regional  and synoptic-scale weather.  The understanding of how mountains influence the weather  and climate has advanced considerably over the last forty years, but there remain  significant areas of uncertainty which limit accurate weather forecasting and  environmental decision making.  Two important scientific frontiers are (1) the influence  of mesoscale mountain features on regional, synoptic and global weather patterns and  (2) new technologies for observing orographic influences and testing numerical models.           Methodology to be utilized by the Principal Investigator will include the use of  theoretical fluid mechanics and numerical calculations using a simple, two-layer fluid  model and an advanced three-dimensional mesoscale numerical model.  Additionally,  the Principal Investigator will pursue a variety of observational techniques by  conducting small, focused field efforts.  The Principal Investigator also will be a major  participant and coordinator of the U.S. component of  a large, international research  project know as the Mesoscale Alpine Program (MAP).  The MAP will focus on  several aspects of the impact of mountains on local, regional and synoptic-scale  weather.        Successful completion of this research will result in enhanced knowledge of the  impacts of orography on weather.  This may lead to better representations of orographic  impacts in numerical models which in turn could result in improved weather forecasts.  ***",
