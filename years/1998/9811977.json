 "awd_abstract_narration": "9811977\r\nQuate\r\nWe propose to exploit the ultra sensitivity of microfabricated cantilevers to study molecular processes such as hybridization of DNA and protein protein interactions, The microcantilever was developed for the Force Microscope as an instrument for imaging.  That program was successful and we now have the capability measuring sub-Angstrom deflections, In a second phase the group with Gimzewski in Zurich has pioneered the use of the microcantilever for purposes other than imaging.  In the first instance they determined that a bimetallic cantilever serves as a calorimeter with sensitivity exceeding that of conventional instruments.  They have further demonstrated that the stress induced by the self-assembly of molecular monotayers (thiols on gold) is sufficient to bend the cantilever by measurable amounts.  These two effects, heat and induced stress, give us new tools for the study of molecular reactions.\r\n\r\nOur focus in this proposal will be on the processes that occur when DNA molecules and Proteins interact.  Hybridization of DNA is a fundamental step in the 'Gene Chip' technology as mentioned by President Clinton in his State of the Union address.  In our proposal we will use the microcantilevers to study three aspects of  biomolecular reactions: 1) evolved heat, 2) induced stress induced by the formation of molecular monolayers, and 3) the change in molecular charge during DNA hybridization.  We suspect that items 2) and 3) will be the most likely candidates but we will examine all three aspects.  We are confident that we can increase our understanding of molecular reactions with these new tools.\r\n***\r\n",
