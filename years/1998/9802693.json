Badarch, Mongolian Technical University.  Dr. Ramarkrishnan requests funds for 10 U.S. scientists to  travel to Mongolia to attend a joint U.S. and Mongolia  bilateral workshop on high performance concrete for  construction and/or rehabilitation of transportation  structures on August 24-27, 1998.  The purpose of this  workshop is to discuss the issues related to high  performance concrete application and the repair,  retrofitting, and renovation of high performance concrete.  The proposed participants are leaders in this area of  research.  This is a fast developing engineering field and  has a major impact on transportation infrastructures and the  construction industry.  The challenging environmental  conditions in Mongolia offer unique opportunities for U.S.  scientists to test and develop high performance concrete  products.  At the same time, this workshop can bring to  Mongolia the latest available technology for building  urgently needed transportation infrastructure.",
