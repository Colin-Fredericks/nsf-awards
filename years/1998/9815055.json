 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mast cells are a class of cells found in the brain that are not  themselves nerve cells, or neurons.  Although often associated  with allergies, they are present in normal brains.  Their numbers  can change in adults as a result of hormonal changes, and there is  molecular evidence that mast cell secretions can affect long-term  modifications of excitability of nerve cells.  A novel recent  hypothesis, based on some preliminary data from birds, is that  mast cells may be small migratory glandular units, capable  releasing compounds with neurotransmitter or modulator activity.  Release of compounds from mast cells appears to be different from  release of neurotransmitter from nerve cells; in mast cells  granules appear to form within the cell and may fuse to form large  secretion chambers, or sometimes much smaller releases are seen.  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) supports studies  to develop electron microscopical techniques to substantiate how  this novel release mechanism occurs, to compare observations on  mammals with prior observations on birds, and to add histochemical  techniques to determine what compounds may be passed from mast  cells to neurons.      Results will have a substantial impact beyond  neuroendocrinology because mast cells occur in all vertebrate  brains, and these mechanisms could be very important for  understanding the plasticity of neuronal function in the brain.  A  novel form of cellular secretion also will be important to general  cell biology.",
