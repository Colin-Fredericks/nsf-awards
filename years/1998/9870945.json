 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe NSF Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) is designed to improve the condition of scientific and engineering equipment and facilities for research and training in the Nation\u00c6s academic institutions.  For twenty-five years the University of Washington (UW) has maintained and utilized a sophisticated airborne facility for atmospheric research and for the training of students. This facility has been used for a wide range of important (often unique) investigations, including studies of the sources and sinks of atmospheric trace gases and particles (e.g., volcanoes, biomass burning and various anthropogenic sources), the role of clouds in weather and climate (e.g.. clouds as chemical processors; the microstructure of clouds; the optical and radiative properties of clouds and their effects on climate), and the mesoscale structures of large storm systems (e.g., the organization of clouds and precipitation in mid-latitude cyclones).\r\nIn 1997 the UW acquired a new platform for such studies (a twin-engine turboprop Convair 580). which has significantly greater performance capabilities than the previous aircraft used by the UW.  This MRI award provides for the purchase of a new generation of research instruments to be carried on the Convair 580.  These include instruments for measuring several trace gases of key importance in atmospheric chemistry, several new instruments for measuring the size distributions and concentrations of airborne particles, measurements of the size spectra of precipitation particles, measurement of three-dimensional air motions, and a new data acquisition system for the aircraft.\r\nThese instruments will permit investigations of a variety of outstanding issues related to the earth's changing atmosphere, weather and climate and will aid the formation of new research partnerships.  The new integrated research facility will be used also for the enhanced training of undergraduate and graduate students in airborne atmospheric research.\r\n",
