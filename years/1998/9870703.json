 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870703  Nowak       This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training  (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a broadly-  based graduate training program that will equip students to  combine the social, economic and biological sciences in the  study of environmental problems presented by freshwater  ecosystems. Problem areas to be emphasized will include  studies of the economic value of environmental resources, the  role of humans in the vulnerability of ecosystems to natural  change, the impact of irreversible environmental changes, and  the effect of ecosystem features on societal interactions.  The project is a joint effort of 20 faculty from the  Departments of Agriculture and Applied Economics, Civil and  Environmental Engineering, Forest Ecology and Management,  Limnology, Rural Sociology, Soil Science and Zoology.  NSF  support will provide stipends for 14 graduate students each  year, for one postdoctoral student and for related costs of  student research training.  Educational opportunities will  center on three required IGERT seminar courses, one on  selected topics related to current IGERT faculty research, one  on relevant research methods, and one on team research during  which student teams will test hypotheses generated from the  topics and methods seminars.  Students will also spend at  least three months as an intern in a Federal or Wisconsin  State natural resources management agency.  The postdoctoral  student will both participate in and help organize the IGERT  training activities, including an annual retreat for  participating faculty and students.  In addition to its  education and research initiatives, the program plans a  continuos self-evaluation effort led by a faculty member from  the School of Education.    IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program whose goal is to sponsor the  establishment of innovative, research-based graduate programs  that will train a diverse group of new scientists and  engineers to be well-prepared for varied careers in the  private  and public sectors.  IGERT provides an opportunity for  the development of new, well-focused multidisciplinary ograms  that bridge traditional organizational barriers, uniting  faculty from several departments or institutions to establish  a highly-interactive collaborative environment for both  training and research.  In its first year, the program will  provide support to 17 institutions for new or nascent programs  that collectively span all areas of science, engineering and  mathematics eligible for support by the NSF.",
