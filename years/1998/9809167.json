 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current understanding of the physical, geochemical, and ecological processes characteristic of most of the world ocean is limited by our ability to sample the marine environment at sufficiently high frequency in space and time. In particular at geographically fixed ocean time series stations, such as the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) and the Hawaiian Ocean Time Series (HOT), interpretation of the data stream is severely limited by our ability to make measurements economically in surrounding waters.  In this project, the scientific director of one of the major ocean time series sites will explore the use of autonomous vehicles as platforms for making physical and chemical measurements in the waters surrounding the BATS station. If successful, such new technology could eventually revolutionize our approach to monitoring open ocean as well as coastal marine environments inasmuch as replacement of relatively expensive, manned oceanographic vessels becomes technologically feasible.",
