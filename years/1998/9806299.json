 "awd_abstract_narration": "9806299  Myers    This project aims for greater understanding of point defect  formation in ZnSe and associated alloys including a fundamental  understanding of the nature of the point defect(s) and point  defect complexes as well as defect origins during growth. Initial  studies will focus on ZnSe, with subsequent efforts including  ZnMgSe alloys. The approach combines molecular beam epitaxial  growth; quantitative measurement of point defect concentrations  in epilayers using electron paramagnetic resonance; detailed  photoluminescence studies; and, in parallel with the experimental  techniques, a first principles approach to modeling defects in  ZnSe.  %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  materials science having high technological relevance. The  research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a  fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic  devices.  Experimental tools are now available to allow atomic  level observation of materials defects and their origins which  when better understood will allow advances in both fundamental  science and technology. The basic knowledge and understanding  gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving  the performance and stability of advanced devices and circuits by  providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing  and producing improved materials, and materials combinations.  An  important feature of the program is the integration of research  and education through the training of students in a fundamentally  and technologically significant area.  ***.",
