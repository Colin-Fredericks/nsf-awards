 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9870456  Nicoletti    Protection for power transformers against large currents, known as arc currents, is commonly based on differential relays.  These relays are used on transformers of the size 20 MVA and up, which accounts for approximately 40% of the transformers used in electricity distribution in this country.  The protection of these transformers is important because the cost of replacing such a transformer is $1-5 per kVA.    While these relays do offer protection, there are substantial difficulties in application.  The aim of this research to is to develop a new and sophisticated signal processing algorithm based on wavelets that will reliably detect internal faults in a way that will provide rapid detection not effected by inrush currents.  A brief review of the theory of wavelets is provided along with some preliminary results of simulations.  It is shown that wavelets, along with percentage energy contained in certain time-frequency tiles, show promise for the task at hand.    The proposed research has two major phases.  Phase I is the development of algorithms that will distinguish inrush versus arc currents.  Phase II is the design and testing of a prototype system that will implement the algorithms developed in Phase I in a way that is as close to the industrial set-up as possible.    The PI plans to bring her strengths and expertise from the materials and signal processing areas into the electrical power systems which can benefit from her knowledge.  A POWRE grant will provide the essential equipment, supplies and time to help keep the PI focused in her new research ventures",
