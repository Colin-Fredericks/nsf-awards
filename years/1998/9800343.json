 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project deals with the design and development  of a unique spherical mobile robot having a spherical exo-  skeleton, an internal mechanism for self-propulsion, and a  variety of sensors for motion control and reconnaissance.  Unique Features of the robotic system include its  retractable camera, retractable manipulators, and telescopic  limbs. The arms and limbs are deployed for manipulation and  support when the robot is at rest and retracted before the  robot resumes its motion. The robot is able to perform rapid  maneuvers and move over rough terrain with relative ease. In  the process of development of the spherical robotic system,  three fundamental problems in the areas of dynamics,  control, and design of mechanical systems are addressed. The  first problem relates to the development of a nonlinear  feedback control strategy for nonholonimic systems with  primary application to the rolling sphere. A smooth and time-  invariant controller will be developed for the  reconfiguration of the sphere. Despite significant progress  in nonholonomic control systems, the reconfiguration of the  rolling sphere is still an open problem. The second problem  of this research is to design an internal mechanism for self-  propulsion of the sphere and to construct a closed loop  controller for the effective operation of the mechanism. The  mechanism provides the sphere with the capability to  accelerate, move with constant velocity, or servo at a  point. The final problem relates to the development of the  spherical mobile robot, which is expected to achieve  autonomy thorough coordination between sensing and control.  This problem deals with design of the truss, choice and  placement of sensors, and design f the overall control  system through integration of the two controllers mentioned  above. The nonholonomic control strategy, developed as a  part of this research, is incorporated in the Advanced  Control Systems course, offered in the Department of  Mechanical Engineering at Michigan State University. The  internal mechanism for self-propulsion of the sphere and the  design of the spherical mobile robot are used as  motivational examples in a number of graduate and  undergraduate courses in design, structures, mechanics, and  controls.",
