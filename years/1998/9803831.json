 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803831  Zylstra   As part of the four-agency Joint Program on Bioremediation (NSF, EPA, DOE, and ONR), officials in ONR encouraged Dr. Gerben Zylstra at Rutgers University to collaborate with European colleagues in developing a summer short-course that would teach new molecular-biological methods, mostly relating to DNA methodologies, for microbial sampling and identification to advanced graduate students and postdoctoral associates. Dr. Zylstra has assembled an impressive team of U.S. and European Union (EU) scientists to conduct a two-week laboratory and field course for approximately 24 students, half from the U.S. and half from European institutions. The course is designed to give young scientists hands-on experience with modern biotechnological methods for the analysis of microbes and their metabolic activities in the remediation of pollutants in the environment. Basic principles of taxonomic identification and classification, and of ecological assembly and functioning, are taught within a bioremediation framework that focuses on restoration of healthy ecosystem dynamics of microbial populations. Specific topics include molecular-genetic analyses of soil microbes, bioavailability of contaminants such as toluene, PCR amplification and identification of taxon-specific or activity-specific genes, and enzyme assays for pathways of contaminant degradation. Student applications are solicited through targeted mailings to university departments and science associations as well as interactive Web sites.    The problems of environmental pollution in water and soils have intensified the need for basic scientific understanding of microbial composition and activity in natural and human-dominated ecosystems. New molecular and DNA-based probes have revolutionized scientists' ability to identify particular microbes with desirable metabolic functions or to target and enhance metabolic pathways present in numerous microbes but usually of secondary status. Advances in both basic and applied aspects of microb ial ecology and evolution are happening rapidly, and targeted courses like this one are an effective means of dissemination of new ideas and methodologies.",
