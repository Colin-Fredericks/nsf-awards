 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROPOSAL #:  IBN 9728767    PI:  Zyleyma Tang-Matrinez      The proposed research will examine the genetic and  behavioral effects  of inbreeding, using the vole, Microtus ochrogaster as the  model organism.  The research will address:  1. The effects  of inbreeding (defined as mating between close relatives) on  the number of young produced per litter, as well as the  weight, growth rates and survival of the pups.  2. The  effects of inbreeding on parental behaviors.  3. Preferences  of voles for related versus unrelated partners, or for  inbred versus outbred partners.  Systematic, quantitative  behavioral observations along with weighing and monitoring  of pups produced by inbred versus outbred matings will be  employed to address the first two objectives.  Mate choice  experiments will demonstrate whether voles show preferences  among four potential mates of different degrees of genetic  relatedness ofrinbreeding.      Inbreeding has detrimental effects in many species of  animals,  including humans. These effects may include decreased  growth, reduce vigor, and the expression of genetic diseases  of defects.  Deficits in parental behaviors may cause or  exacerbate some of these effects but almost nothing is  currently known about the interactions between inbreeding  and parental behavior. Similarly, little is known about the  importance of inbreeding in determining mate choices.  This  research is expected to provide insights into possible  behavioral effects of inbreeding in animals that could  potentially be extrapolated to humans.  Moreover, the information generated will be valuable to  husbandry and  conservation efforts that require the maintenance of genetic  diversity in populations.",
