 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will develop a methodology for the automated determination of Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) process performance for a given part.  The primary goal of this project is to provide the knowledge and the means through which manufacturing and prototyping decisions can be made by the design engineer, thus improving the interface between the design and the manufacture of SFF parts, and providing important evaluation capabilities for design feedback.  The project plan includes the formulation, development, and software implementation of: (1) tolerance representation schemes, algorithms, and methods for extracting feature-based process information from computer-aided design models, (2) algorithmic solutions for defining part orientations that optimize feature-specific precision constraints, and (3) a computerized process model used to quantify and assess the quality of fabricated features with minimum human effort.  The project intends to focus on the special needs of small business manufacturers, who (by nature) sometimes suffer from the limitations of a smaller work force.  Demonstration and validation of the decision support system will utilize industry data provided through collaboration with local manufacturers and the Small Business Development Center (SBDC).       If successful, this research will serve to provide time-saving tools that facilitate the rapid identification of design possibilities and the early integration of manufacturing considerations.  SFF throughput improvements will be complemented by the automation of feature-based optimization routines.  The developed methodology will highlight the important elements in manufacturability assessment, and demonstrate how they can be linked back to the product model in investigating redesign options.  Improved decision support and assessment capabilities will also serve to promote the further use and industry approval of layered manufacturing methods as more than a rapid prototyping technique.",
