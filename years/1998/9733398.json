The growth behavior of noble  metals will be examined on unique templates provided by  high-index (\"tilted\") silicon surfaces. The structural and  electronic properties of these interfaces will be studied using  scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in conjunction with  first-principles, electronic-structure calculations. This  approach is expected to enable the development of atomic  structural models and a deeper understanding of the formation and  properties of these interfaces. The research is motivated by  recent STM investigations of clean high-index surfaces oriented  between (001) and (111) that have revealed unique row-like  structures which do not exist on the more well-known low-index  surfaces. It is anticipated that the underlying Si structure will  cause metal overlayers to form novel structures on the nanometer  scale (e.g. nanowires). A complementary teaching component of  this project focuses on course development in an introductory  calculus-based physics sequence. Labs for this three-semester  sequence will introduce computer-interfaced experiments and more  effective integration of lecture components. The aim is to  provide a firm foundation in materials physics, and especially to  develop studentsO experimental and analytical skills.  %%%  The project addresses forefront research issues in a topical area  of materials science having high technological relevance.  The  research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a  fundamental level to important aspects of electronic materials  and devices, in general. An important feature of the program is  the emphasis on education, and on the integration of research and  education through the training of students in a fundamentally and  technologically significant research area.  ***",
