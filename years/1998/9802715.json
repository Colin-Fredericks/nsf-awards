The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-four-month postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Karina J. Nielsen of Oregon State  University to work with Drs. Sergio A. Navarrete and Juan  Carlos Castilla at Catholic University in Santiago, Chile,  and with Professor Bruce A. Menge and Jane Lubchenco at  Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon.  Her research  is on upwelling patterns and marine plant herbivore  interactions.  Specifically, Dr. Nielsen and her Chilean  collaborators will look at several sites along the central  Chilean coast which have different community composition and  which have important differences in productivity and  upwelling conditions to measure the nature and intensity of  the link between nutrients, macroalgae and herbivory.  Upon  Dr. Nielsen's return to Oregon, she will compare her results  with work done in New Zealand and Oregon by her U.S.  collaborators.  This research will provide baseline data on  the structure and dynamics of rocky intertidal communities  along both north and southeastern Pacific shores, allowing  the evaluation of the ecological consequences of global  change on coastal marine communities.    Dr. Navarrete is the director of the Estacion Costera de  Investigaciones Marinas of Las Cruces, which is one of the  best facilities for marine research in South America.  In  addition to Drs. Navarrete and Castilla, Dr. Nielsen will be  working closely with Drs. Bernabe Santelices and Juan  Correas, who are world experts on the physiology and ecology  of intertidal macroalgae.  ***",
