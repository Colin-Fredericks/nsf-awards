 "awd_abstract_narration": "9813449\r\nGreenwood\r\nThe application of evolutionary computation (EC) techniques to various optimization problems in molecular biology has become increasingly common.  Of considerable interest is the prediction of side-chain conformations in proteins [1, 2].  Because of the high density of side-chains in the protein interior, side-chain conformations are determined by packing considerations, which involve steric effects with other side-chains.  The solution is difficult because of the large number of combinations possible.  Nevertheless, an efficient solution to this problem is essential for most ab initio protein structure prediction procedures.  It will also aid in determining permissible mutation sites for increased protein stability and for a large scale protein re-design.\r\nEach point in the search space of an optimization problem represents a unique solution; optimization algorithms are therefore search algorithms.  EC algorithms are probabilistic optimization algorithms which conduct searchs using the principles of Darwinian evolution.  For the side-chain packing problem (SCPP), each individual in a population represents a distinct side-chain conformation.  During each generation (iteration of the EC algorithm), stochastic reproduction operators perturb existing conformations to produce new conformations.  The optimization problem provides a measure of the solution's quality which is indicated by the individual's fitness. (In SCPP high fitness may represent a minimal van der Waals interaction energy.) Highly fit individuals will tend to survive and reproduce in future generations.  Studies have shown that the EC algorithms are superior to Monte Carlo methods in molecular biology optimization problems [2, 3, 4].\r\nGenetic Algorithms (GAs) have been the predominant EC algorithm applied to SCPP (e.g., see [5]).  Yet, there are certain aspects of CAs which suggests they may not be the best EC algorithm for molecular biology problems [6, 7).  This work will use an ES to find optimum packing arrangements for side-chains.' The ES algorithm has never been used to find solutions to protein structure prediction problems.  Nevertheless, the ES algorithm may well prove to be superior to the GA approach if the results of previous work with atomic clusters are any indication [7].\r\nFor this work the Cc' positions of the protein backbone will be assumed fixed, but the peptide groups of the backbone will be assumed rotatable and their optimum orientations will be found as a part of the side-chain packing optimization problem.  The bond lengths and angles will also be fixed so the EC must only identify the peptide orientation angles and the side-chain torsion angles.  The fitness will be determined using an energy function that includes the van der Waals interaction, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic effects.\r\n***\r\n",
