 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ryan  9801041    Few studies have examined the function of and natural  variation in acoustic signals in the 65 families of  coniferous fishes. This lack prevents scientists from  understanding patterns and processes in communication across  vertebrates. The structure, context, and variation of  acoustic signals of longear sunfish (Lepomis megalotis,  Centrarchidae), a relative of the largemouth bass, will be  studied to establish the basis for future work and  comparative studies. Calls of these fish will be recorded in  natural populations, analyzed using wavelet transforms, and  behavioral context videotaped to characterize the signal.  Hypothesized functions will be tested using playback  experiments. Acoustic signal variation at various levels  will be determined to verify that population differences are  not due exclusively to variation within an individual or  between individuals. Two possible sources of variation,  physical and species composition differences, will be  examined. The physical differences between sites in  underwater sound propagation and degradation will be  determined using playbacks of tem signals. Alternately, most  Lepomis species compete for acoustic space and produce  viable hybrid offspring, which may result in differences in  signals at sites with multiple species. The calls of hetero  specifics will be recorded, analyzed and compared to longear  sunfish calls to determine call parameter overlap.       The microgeographic variation in acoustic signals in  longear sunfish may indicate localized population  divergence. Understanding this variation may be important in  understanding the implications of habitat fragmentation and  degradation. Research on acoustic signals in natural  populations of sunfish will contribute to general knowledge  of acoustic signaling systems and the selection acting on  them, as well as specific information on teleost acoustic  behavior and underwater sound propagation.",
