May studies various areas centering on global structures\r\nin stable homotopy theory and related fields.  He and his collaborators\r\nhave opened up stable homotopy theory to serious point-set level\r\nalgebraic study with their recent new approach to highly structured ring\r\nand module theory.  Rings, modules, and algebras can now be defined as\r\nobjects with well-behaved products in a symmetric monoidal category of\r\nspectra, allowing many constructions and applications that were not\r\npossible previously.  He and Greenlees have opened up new interactions\r\nbetween equivariant and non-equivariant stable homotopy theory with\r\ntheir analysis of Tate cohomology and their proof of a completion\r\ntheorem for module spectra over MU.  Rothenberg studies analytic and\r\ncombinatorial torsion invariants in geometric topology.  He and his\r\ncollaborators have explored generalizations of the classical invariants\r\nto equivariant and non-compact situations and have constructed torsion\r\ninvariants for fiber bundles with compact fibers, these being cohomology\r\nclasses rather than just numerical invariants.  Weinberger's work centers\r\non geometry and analysis on compact spaces with singularities and on\r\nnoncompact manifolds.  His surgery theory on stratified spaces can be\r\napplied directly to various problems and has led to a changed perspective\r\non group actions, both in terms of answering old questions and in\r\nformulating new ones.  The perspective is completely integrated with the\r\ntheory of homology manifolds at the level of conjecture, and somewhat\r\nat the level of theorem.  Furthermore, detailed analysis of what would\r\nbe involved in proving such conjectures seems to have deep connections\r\nwith logic, complexity theory, and non-commutative geometry.\r\n     A major emphasis of the project is graduate education.  With three\r\njunior faculty and fifteen current graduate students in topology at\r\nChicago, the topology program supported by this grant is one of the\r\nworld's largest.  In the three years 1996-98, it has graduated ten new\r\nPhD's, with 1998-99 jobs at MIT (2), Michigan (2), Illinois (2), Berkeley,\r\nCUNY, Rutgers, and Utah.  Students supported on the grant work in a wide\r\nvariety of areas of algebraic and geometric topology, and some of them\r\nwork on the interfaces between algebraic topology and algebraic geometry\r\non the one hand and between geometric topology and differential geometry\r\non the other.  Although focused on topology, the work supported by this\r\ngrant impinges on many other areas of mathematics.  Some of it also\r\nimpinges on current work in mathematical physics, where the kinds of\r\ntopological and geometric structures studied by the investigators have\r\ndirect relevance.\r\n***\r\n",
