 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804076  Result checking of computations is investigated using a  certification-trail technique.  Certification trails offer an  effective and efficient alternative to result checking approaches  employing replication or N-version programming.  Certification-  trail techniques are designed to support a secondary computation  of a result by using the same input together with a special  output, the certification trail, utilized by the primary  computation.  By making use of the certification trail, the cost  of the check can be substantially less than that of the primary  computation.  This research extends the certification trail  technique to new application  domains, including important computationally intensive problems  for which best known solutions generally require extensive  computing time and commonly used systems programming operations.  The research also develops a distributed applet-based certifiable  processing technique which distributes computational problems to  clients across a network and then certifies the correctness of  the accumulated solution efficiently using certification trails.  Finally, by using properties of computations and solutions,  certification-trail techniques are  developed to support result checking with predetermined degrees  of correctness rather than total precision.  An important goal to  assure a significant impact of this research is to establish a  WWW library of certification-trail techniques and solutions for  general use by researchers and software developers.***",
