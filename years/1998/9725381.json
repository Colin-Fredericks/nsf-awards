 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725381   Jersey      KCTS is producing Sci-Squad, a national weekly science education television series for children ages 8 to 10.  The thirteen half-hour programs in the series will show a team of kids, the Sci-Squad, who use inquire and collaboration to seek the solution to a science problem.   The team is led by Howzit, a young woman computer whiz.  Working cooperatively the team investigates each scientific subject through a combination of first-hand experimentation, Internet surfing, field research, and visits to real-world scientists.  Each of the characters models a different mode of science inquiry in search to a question the team receives at the beginning of each program.    Youth who view the programs will be encouraged to follow along with the Sci-Squad and will be challenged to observe, measure, think critically, analyze results, and devise further experiments.  Outreach materials to support science activities by viewers include an Explorer's Guide for youth, a Parents Guide, and a Guide for Teachers.  There also will be collaborations with science and youth serving organizations such as Boys & Girls Club of America, Family Math, GEMS, Science Linkages in the Community, the National Science Teachers Association, the National PTA, and, for the Hispanic population, ASPIRA and the National Council of La Raza.    Bill Jersey, President of Quest Productions, will be the Senior Producer, Director, and Co-Project Director.  The creator of the project and Co-Project Director is Pierre Valette, a producer and writer of documentaries for Quest Productions and previously an Associate Producer in Children's Programming at WGBH.  Elizabeth Brock will be the Executive-in-Charge of Production for KCTS.   The Senior Science Consultant is Ted Ansbacher who previously was Director of Exhibits at the New York Hall of Science and Director of Education/Senior Scientist at The Chicago Museum of Science.",
