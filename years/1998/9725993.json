 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725993  Eggleston    This grant provides partial support of the costs of acquiring  components to develop optical second harmonic generation (SHG)  instrumentation to study molecular structure of adsorbed organic  molecules on mineral surfaces.  Coupled with the existing  scanning probe microscope (EAR-9634143) at the University of  Wyoming, this technique could yield unprecedented information on  the orientation of adsorbed organics on mineral surfaces with  single-crystal face specificity. SHG promises significant  advantages over other analytical techniques for the analysis of  molecular structure at mineral-fluid interfaces (i.e. X-ray  absorption spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared  spectroscopy), the most important being that is useable in situ,  at atmospheric pressure, and on non-powdered samples.  Knowledge of the atomic-scale structure of fluid-rock geochemical  interactions is fundamental to studies of mineral  dissolution/growth and the fate of environmental pollutants.  Therefore, analytical advances in mineral surface chemistry are  at the frontier of our understanding of problems of pressing  environmental significance.  To that end, development of SHG  should advance our knowledge of the pH dependency of surface  electric fields, molecular adsorption and orientation, and  fundamental electron transfer properties of redox centers at  mineral surfaces.  ***",
