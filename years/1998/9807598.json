 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Environmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry Program   is jointly supported by the Divisions of Earth Sciences and Chemistry.    Drs. Jillian F. Banfield, Geology Department, and Robert J. Hamers,   Chemistry Department, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison will   investigate effects of microbes on pyrite surfaces.  Abundant organisms   (bacteria and archaea) have been shown to attach to pyrite and to occur   in the low pH solutions produced by pyrite dissolution.  The mechanism of   `direct` biological catalysis of pyrite dissolution involving attached   organisms is poorly understood, however, as are the geochemical controls   on the distribution of attached and non-attached Fe and S oxidizing   organisms.  In this research, the abundance and distribution of   chemolithotrophs will be studied as a function of pH, ionic strength and   geochemical conditions.  Attachment sites for organisms will be   correlated with surface morphology using precharacterized surfaces and   cultured microbes as well as microbes in the natural environment.  The   polymeric binding layer whereby microbes attach to pyrite will be studied   at low pH and the relationship to pyrite dissolution determined.  The   results will be compared to kinetic data from field studies of acid mine   drainage generation.   Experiments will be constrained by both molecular   biological information about the relevant species at the site and   physical and chemical details of the solid-liquid-organic interfaces.  The role of bacteria in acid mine drainage is not well understood.  Until   recently, only chemical and geological factors were considered in models   for dissolution of iron sulfides (pyrite) at locations such as Iron   Mountain (Redding, California).  The identify of some bacteria associated   with iron pyrite dissolution was determined in previous work.  Here the   role of bacteria in dissolution of the metal sulfides will be determined.    Factors such as how bacteria attach to mineral surfaces and how   transport of metals is affected by that attachment will be explored",
