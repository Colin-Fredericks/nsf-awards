 "awd_abstract_narration": "Around 1980, V. D. Goppa used the theory of algebraic curves to construct a new family of codes, now referred to as algebraic geometric (AG) codes.  Code performance depended upon certain curve  parameters.   Shortly after, Tsfasman, Vladut and Zink showed the existence of curves such that the resulting AG codes had long lengths and performance exceeding that of the Gilbert-Varshamov (G-V) bound -- a feat that until then was widely considered unattainable.     However, the Tsfasman-Vladut-Zink result does not provide an explicit description of the curves.  Recently, Garcia and Stichtenoth exhibited two families of curves having an explicit and simple description, that also give rise to codes better than the G-V bound.   An explicit description of the AG code is still lacking however, as this requires the determination of a basis for a certain vector space, consisting of functions defined on the curve.        This remains an open problem and its solution using the theory of function fields is a principal goal of the research activity under this grant.   Recent progress in decoding AG codes has also increased interest in this problem.       Also under investigation are a second set of curves arising from the trace function over Galois rings and the intersection of hyperplanes in projective space.  The latter have application to the study of codes and pseudonoise sequences.",
