 "awd_abstract_narration": "Duncan \r\nTranslation controls the expression of many critical regulatory proteins, such as proto-oncogenes, transcription factors, and nerve cell receptors. Determining the molecular mechanisms of translational control is key to understanding the basis for this level of genetic regulation. Heat shock has proved to be an invaluable model system for unraveling how translation is regulated, as well as many other aspects of the regulation of gene expression. Heat shock provides the preeminent example of how one class of messenger RNAs can be preferentially, efficiently translated at a time when virtually all other (\"normal\") mRNAs are excluded from active translation. Understanding this unique capacity of the heat shock mRNAs has broad implications both with regards to basic translation molecular mechanisms and for devising strategies that optimize gene expression.  This proposal will investigate the hypothesis that specific 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) sequence elements are required for preferential translation of HSP mRNAs. It is well established that the entire HSP mRNA 5'UTR is sufficient to confer preferential translation. However, the identity of any required sequence elements and how they promote an unusual translational pathway that can evade translational repression remain critical unresolved issues. These studies will identify the critical features or sequence elements in HSP mRNA 5'UTRs that confer preferential translation. From a broad perspective, it has been well-established that the heat shock response promotes survival following environmental insults, such as wounding, UV-induced damage, and environmental hyperthermia in non-motile organisms (e.g. plants). These studies will elucidate how preferential translation optimizes heat shock protein production during the heat shock response, and thus enhances survival.  The first series of experiments will investigate the hypothesis that a specific nucleotide sequence is required for preferential translation. A minimum length, heat shock-active 5'UTR will be fine-scale mutagenized to identify critical nucleotide sequences that confer preferential translation. The second and related hypothesis is that preferential translation results from an unusual mode of translation initiation, such as internal initiation or non-linear ribosome scanning. Site-directed mutagenesis will be used to create various test 5'UTRs, containing stem-loops and upstream AUGs introduced at several locations. These elements produce predicted, diagnostic effects on translation depending on the mode of translational initiation. Bicistronic mRNAs will be used to directly test for internal initiation. These studies should suggest a molecular mechanism for heat shock translational reprogramming. Previous studies have shown that stable HSP70 5'UTR-protein interactions cannot be detected. An intriguing possibility is that RNA-RNA interactions recruit ribosomes to the HSP mRNAs. If sequence analysis proves consistent with this model, a putative 18S rRNA-HSP70 5'UTR interaction will be investigated via several complementary approaches. Other HSP mRNA's 5'UTRs will also be characterized to assess whether one translational control mechanism accounts for all instances of heat shock preferential translation.    Protein synthesis (translation) controls the expression of many proteins that regulate cellular processes.  During heat shock, the synthesis of a particular set of proteins is enhanced, while other cellular proteins fail to be synthesized.  The objective of this research is to identify sequences within heat shock messenger RNA that result in enhanced synthesis of heat shock proteins and to investigate a number of different mechanisms that may explain how heat shock protein synthesis is specifically enhanced.  These studies may elucidate novel mechansims for protein synthesis and lead to strategies to optimize synthesis of foreign proteins.",
