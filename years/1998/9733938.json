 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733938  Ben Shen  This CAREER project integrates research and education on a central theme to bridge chemistry and biology in the current undergraduate and graduate programs. The research aspect of the project aims at investigating nonactin biosynthesis in Streptomyces griseus DSM 40695 to provide mechanistic insight on how type I polyketide synthase (PKS) controls the stereospecificity during polyketide biosynthesis. It is based on the hypothesis that nonactin is derived from tetramerization in a stereospecific (+)(-)(+)(-) fashion of (+)- and (-)-nonactic acid whose biosynthesis from acetate, propionate, and succinate is catalyzed by the nonactin synthase, a type I PKS catalyzing the complementary assembly of two enantiomeric polyketides. The specific goals of the project are first to characterize at the genetic and biochemical level how the nonactin synthase controls the stereospecificity during polyketide assembly and then to explore ways to make novel polyketide metabolites with predicted stereochemical centers by genetic manipulation of the nonactin synthase as well as other type I PKS genes. The outcome of these studies will reveal new insight about polyketide biosynthesis and shed light for rational engineering of PKS enzyme complexes to generate chemical structural diversity, leading to the discovery of new drugs. The educational aspect of the project aims at providing the undergraduate and graduate students a multi-disciplinary training in chemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology. This will be accomplished by providing on the webpage modules consisting of biological examples of the chemistry covered in the current organic chemistry lecture and by developing plans for the establishment of \"Biological Chemistry\" as the fifth field of interests for the departmental graduate program. These efforts shall better prepare students who desire to pursue a career working at the interface of chemistry and biology. It is in programs that effectively combine chemistry and biology that new che mists with a broad range of skills and sound understanding of biology for solving important bioorganic chemistry problems will be produced.",
