 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710717  Harshavardhan   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project has the primary objective of developing high temperature superconducting (HTS) films with a high power handling capability for high power RF (radio frequency) and microwave components.  Even though HTS thin film components exhibit very high-Q values, their power handling capability is often limited, imposing restrictions on the range of possible applications.  Power handling capability of HTS films continues to be a challenging arena requiring improvements. Leveraging on several successful advances made in the area of epitaxial HTS thin films and prototype device development on various technologically important substrates, the proposer explored new materials with possible high power handling capability.  The approach combined improved superconducting microwave properties in Ag-doped YBCO films with the design flexibility offered by a low dielectric constant substrate (MgF2) in achieving this goal.  Microwave measurements have been carried out.  Parallel Plate Resonators made from the YBCO films on MgF show no inter- modulation products within 41 dB of the carrier at surface field strengths of up to 0.5 mT at 77-80 K indicating a possible high power handling capability in these films.  Based on the success achieved in Phase I, the proposer will, refine the materials properties of AG:YBCO for optimum performance in the Phase II program.  By further refining the AG:YBCO materials base, they will build prototype band pass filters with high power handling capability (30-40 dBm) operating at 77 K in the frequency range around 2 GHz and 10 GHz.   The major reduction in volume and weight together with improved performance of such devices in emerging high performance Transmit/Receive systems have a large market potential both in defense and civilian telecommunications.  ***",
