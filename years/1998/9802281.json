 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802281  Shi  The application of high temperature superconductors (HTS) to high frequency components used in mobile and personal communication networks, will result in substantial improvements in spectrum utilization and signal filtering.  The proposed work is a novel and an effective alternative to the thin film synthesis of HTS materials for telecommunications applications.  Using a seeded-melt-growth (SMG) method, we have developed large (> 50 mm) single-domain YBa2Cu3Ox bulk materials with ultra-low surface resistance (0.03 m( at 77 K and 13 GHz).  The advantages of this approach include inexpensive and high volume processing, easy manipulation of geometry, elimination of grain boundaries, better control of crystal orientation and the elimination of high loss dielectric materials from the high frequency components.    The proposed research is a fundamental study on the effect of materials parameters on microwave properties of SMG YBa2Cu3Ox.  First, the SMG method will be used to produce a single-domain structure with ultra-low surface resistance.  Second, a relationship will be established between the surface resistance and materials parameters such as second phase concentration and morphology, crystal orientation, and oxygen homogeneity.  Upon optimization of these parameters, various new approaches will be used to fabricate materials of required geometry for a specific RF component design.  Finally, a high-Q resonator, suitable for inclusion in existing telecommunications systems, will be constructed and tested for the overall performance of the materials.    The proposed program addresses both fundamental questions and critical issues in industrial applications.  The principal investigators have significant expertise in HTS materials processing and characterization, and an established reputation in superconductivity community.  The successful implementation of HTS RF components will revolutionize the telecommunications industry and have a strong impact on the economic growth of US.  ***",
