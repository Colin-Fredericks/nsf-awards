This proposal will development new  protocols, and conduct scientific research with GLOBE data.  The project will develop a new protocol for the measurement  of Atmospheric Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT), and is based  on an inexpensive hand-held sun photometer, and/or sky-color  cards.  Measurements of AOT will introduce students to the  connections between air pollution, natural events such as  dust storms and forest fires, and variations in surface  insolation.  More advanced students can use the data is  studies of Beer's law for radiative transfer.  These measurements will enhance data from extremely sparse  networks of ground-based AOT observations.  Reducing the  uncertainties in the global radiative transfer effects of  the aerosols s currently one of the highest scientific  priorities of the climate studies community.  Local and global environmental conditions are affected by  the presence of atmospheric haze layers.  Visibility is a  major parameter in environmental quality in its own right  and haze layers affect the surface radiative transfer  balance of Earth as well as influencing optical remote  sensing measurements which are a major source on information  for study of global environmental change.  Students will be  contributing  quantitative measurements to the study of haze  layers.  %%%  In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global  Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program  (GLOBE) this project is designed to meet GLOBE goals and  objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren in a  global information network with the ultimate goal of better  understa nding Earth's environment and changes that take  place within it.
