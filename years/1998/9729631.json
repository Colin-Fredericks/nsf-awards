 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729631  Bannon        The dryline is the surface boundary between two distinct air masses that  frequently inhabit the south central United States in Spring and early Summer.  To  the east of the line lies a relatively shallow cool moist maritime air mass and to the  west a deeper warm dry continental air mass.  This mesoscale phenomenon is  significant because it is often linked to the occurrence of severe weather (damaging  winds, hail and tornadoes).  Thunderstorms tend to develop along and to the east of  the dryline. The dryline often migrates several hundred kilometers to the east during  the day and then retrogrades westward during the night. This diurnal evolution of the  dryline helps make the forecasting of severe weather a major challenge.        The purpose of this research is to model the diurnal evolution in structure and  position of the dryline.  The fundamental approach is to treat the dryline as the  western edge of a shallow layer maritime air mass.  The dynamics of this air mass  will first be studied using a simplified numerical model know as the shallow water  model.  The sensitivity of the model dryline to mass, momentum, and thermal  forcings will be ascertained and compared with existing theories.  A slab mixed-  layer model of the air mass will then be developed to more accurately represent the  major thermodynamic processes.  Refinements of the modeling effort include two  dimensional studies and an extension to multiple air masses.  This theoretical  approach of using models of intermediate complexity between analytic theory and  sophisticated mesoscale numerical models should be able to capture the essential  physics and provide insight into the dynamics of the dryline.  The results of the  research should provide a better understanding of the dryline and help the  forecasting of severe weather.  ***",
