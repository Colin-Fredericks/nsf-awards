Tectonic deformation and fluid transport are coupled in a complex manner.  This is a proposal to initiate an experimental program to investigate the relationship between deformation and transport properties of\r\ncrustal rocks.  Experiments will be conducted to investigate stress-induced dilatant and compactive deformation and its influence on the electrical and hydraulic transport properties.  The stress-induced microstructure will be characterized quantitatively, and network models will be developed to simulate the evolution of transport properties with deformation.  Electrokinetic phenomena associated with the coupling between fluid flow and electric field will also be investigated.  The overall objective is to establish dynamic links between the evolution of transport properties and the micromechanics of failure in crustal rocks.  The scientific results are of importance in geophysical applications ranging from the near-surface prospecting for oil and minerals through deeper crustal sounding to study the dynamics of seismogenic, volcanic and geothermal systems.\r\n\r\n",
