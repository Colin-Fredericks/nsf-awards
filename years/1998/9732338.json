 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU in Industrial Mathematics and Statistics at WPI focuses  on mathematics and statistics applied to industrial problems.   Teams of 2 - 4 students will work for eight weeks on problems  that come from businesses and industries that have collaborated  in the past years with the Center for Industrial Mathematics and  Statistics (see the Center's web page http://www.wpt.edu/~cims).    The students will work closely with a company representative who  will introduce the problem and help guide their work toward a  solution that the company can really use.  They will also work  closely with a faculty advisor to maintain a focus on the  mathematical issues at the core of the problem.  Organized visits  to each of the sponsoring companies will give the students the  dimension of the importance of their project by learning more  about the range of problems facing the companies.  In addition  there will be presentations and discussion sessions with  mathematicians working in industry.    The whole experience is designed to provide the students with a  glimpse of the ways that advanced mathematics is used to solve  real-world problems.  The projects will help develop some of the  skills in communication and teamwork that are crucial for success  in a nonacademic environment.    Each participant will receive a stipend of $ 2400 and university  housing.  A travel stipend of up to $ 400 will be available as  needed.",
