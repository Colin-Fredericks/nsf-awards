Results are expected to include univariate and multivariate normal approximations, Central Limit Theorems and series expansions of distributions for dependent summands.  Such results will extend the classical theory, which assumes independence, and allow many new applications in statistics, combinatorics and computer science, where one deals with sums and counts of dependent variables.  Stein's methods play an important role in the proposal, but other methods are featured as well.  A careful study of convergence rates is proposed. Applications to game theory, large sample theory, particle systems in statistical mechanics and others, are described in the proposal.\r\n\r\nThe probabilistic behavior of large systems of particles, large statistical surveys, large computational systems, etc., is often studied by considering limits as the size of the system grows, and assuming independence of the particles, or opinions surveyed etc.  However, for many systems or sampling schemes, the dependence between the random outcomes cannot be ignored.  This research concentrates on methods of studying large systems or samples in the presence of dependence, and under various dependence structures.  The rate at which finite systems approach their limiting behavior is studied, thus allowing applications of the results to systems of a given finite size.\r\n",
