 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this project is to design and fabricate  three-dimensional models that illustrate key structures and  relations in biology and chemistry for use by visually-impaired  students and scientists.  The principal subject areas of focus  are cellular physiological properties and biochemical/molecular  processes of the cell.  Ten stand-alone physical models  representing key processes will be created and evaluated during  the course of the project.  An eleventh model that combines the  periodic table of the elements and the chart of the nuclides into  a three-dimensional tactile array will introduce students to  fundamental principles in chemistry and physics and thus give a  context for understanding more complex biological processes.  The  models created will be used as central study aids for  visually-impaired students in beginning and intermediate level  courses in general biology, cell biology, biochemistry, molecular  biology, genetics, biophysics, and chemistry.  Model design and  fabrication will be carried out by a team of individuals from the  scientific disciplines and specialists from the Department of  Design and Industry.  Audio tape descriptions and a research  guide for each model will be developed to introduce the student  both to the model and to its broader scientific implications.  In  addition, a speech recognition program that runs on a PC will be  used to access and retrieve spoken information about individual  model components.  Prototype models will be fabricated, and a  strategy will be developed to reproduce them inexpensively to  enable blind students and scientists to acquire these models  without significant financial hardship.",
