 "awd_abstract_narration": "Patton\r\n9801649\r\nThis condensed matter physics project is devoted to the study of dynamical magnetization behavior in thin magnetic films. The nonlinear physics of microwave magnetic envelope solitons will be investigated.  (1) Feedback techniques will be used both to self-generate pure eigenmode solitons and to form solitons from input pulses.  (2) The eigenmode, eigenvalue, amplitude, phase, decay, and velocity characteristics of these fundamental soliton excitations will then be investigated.  (3) Parametric techniques will be used to excite both solitons and modulational instability signals under short and long signal pulse conditions, respectively, and the fundamental connections between these key nonlinear processes and soliton properties will be investigated.  (4) The two dimensional spatial distributions and wave vector distributions of MME solitons and modulational instability response profiles will be investigated by Brillouin light scattering. The work aims at new insights into the behavior of nonlinear pulses which are of interest from fundamental viewpoints as well as technical applications in areas such as, optical communications, and radar signal processing. The project provides a state-of-the-art experience for undergraduate students, graduate students and post-docs. This provide fundamental training in basic physics, microwave and light scattering methods that have applications in data processing, high speed computation, mass data storage, and defense.\r\n%%%\r\nThin single crystal ferrite films provide an ideal medium to investigate the properties of very high frequency pulses in nonlinear media. The nonlinear interactions lead to pulse narrowing and soliton formation.  Solitons are robust pulses which may be used for long range optical communications, microwave signal processing, and fundamental studies in nonlinear physics. This research will utilize feedback techniques, parametric excitation, and optical methods to probe these properties.
