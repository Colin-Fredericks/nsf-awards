 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 98-07894  RANE      The cells of the nervous system (\"neurons\") acquire the  capability for generating electrical impulses in response to  biological molecules known as \"growth factors\". Growth factors are  proteins produced naturally by the nervous system and the tissues  which it controls. When growth factors contact neurons, they evoke  a series of yet undetermined chemical events, which cause the  neurons to produce other proteins called ion channels. These ion  channels are part of the neuron's structure, and they give it the  ability to generate electrical signals. In addition to causing  long-term induction of ion channels, growth factors also generate  chemical signals which have immediate effects on ion channels  already present in the cell. Because virtually all nervous  function is dependent on the electrical signals generated by ion  channels, it is critical to understand channel regulation by  growth factors and growth-factor-generated chemical signals. Dr.  Rane and colleagues will use several techniques, including  cellular patch clamp electrophysiology, genetics, and  pharmacology, to investigate these issues. The work will delineate  the actions of growth factors and growth-factor-mediated signaling  in governing the electrical behavior of nerve cells, and thus the  functioning of the nervous system.",
