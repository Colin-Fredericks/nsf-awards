 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of new preparation methodologies for the  creation of novel organic thin film assemblies for use as optical and electronic elements is the focus of the research in this  project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.   Professor Armstrong and his students at the University of Arizona  will use a comprehensive approach of synthesis and characterization  of these thin film systems.  Organic molecular beam epitaxy (OMBE)  and Langmuir-Blodgett (L-B) approaches will be employed to deposit  films on a variety of substrate surfaces.  The preparation of  organic films of highly luminescent dyes by OMBE will be  characterized through a variety of spectroscopic and  crystallographic methods to gain understanding into the role of  structure and composition in their ultimate use as microcircuitry  elements.  Bilayer and multilayer films of a number of  phthalocyanine derivatives will be prepared using the L-B  technique.  The films are being investigated for future  applications as microcircuitry and field effect transistor (FET)  devices.       The controlled growth of organic molecular thin films is an  area of intense interest due to its potential impact in the  creation of molecular electronic devices.  The development of new  preparation and characterization strategies is a vital component in  the evolution of this technology.  Professor Armstrong and his  students at the University of Arizona will apply new synthetic  methods and a host of spectroscopic techniques to gain insights  into the fundamental electronic and optical properties of organic  thin films.  The combination of synthetic and characterization  aspects of molecular thin film systems undertaken here will have  relevance to a wide range of projected applications of organic thin  films.",
