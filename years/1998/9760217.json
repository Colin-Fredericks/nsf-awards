 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (Sbir) Phase I project will develop a layer-by-layer method to manufacture electric motors that are exceptionally efficient and compact.  In conventional motors, the magnetic field is produced by current flowing through coils of insulated wire placed in slots punched in low silicon steel laminations.  Phase I would eliminate wire and improve the magnetic efficiency of the laminations.  Conductors and their insulators will be built up in layers using a computer-controlled laser to produce ceramic insulators and fused powder metal conductors.  Techniques to increase the silicon content of the laminations and reduce their losses will be developed.  Compared to conventional motors, this technique would reduce core losses by a factor of three, winding losses by a factor of 2.5, and reduce energy consumption by 2.5-5% through greatly increased thermal conductivity.  In addition to motors, this technology may be applied to generators, transformers, and similar devices.  Where size, weight, and efficiency are important, applications include: traction motors for electric cars, compact automobile motors and generators, lightweight motors for aircraft and space vehicles, and high power motors for machine tools.",
