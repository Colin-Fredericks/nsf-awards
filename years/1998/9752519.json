 "awd_abstract_narration": "A consortium of nine Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in Texas and Louisiana is engaged in a four-year innovative initiative to develop a new inter-disciplinary, project based College Algebra program and to change the culture surrounding the present College Algebra courses. The Consortium, headquartered at Texas Southern University in Houston, Texas, comprises three universities, five four-year colleges, and a community college. The Consortium schools are Texas Southern University, Prairie View A & M University, Grambling State University, Huston-Tillotson College, Jarvis Christian College, Paul Quinn College, Texas College, Wiley College, and Central College of the Houston Community College System. Each school's involvement is under the direction of a Local Coordinator.    College Algebra is the basic mathematics course in these schools in the sense that it is the first mathematics course to carry college or university credit. It is a prerequisite for the large majority of majors and programs and it has an enrollment that is three to four times as large as all other credit mathematics courses combined.    The two goals of the consortium are to:     (1) Develop a new course that will (a) be project-based-small group projects developed by inter-disciplinary teams of faculty members; (b) incorporate a strong technology component; (c) develop communication skills; and (d) develop students' mathematical self-esteem and confidence as problem solvers.    (2) Change the culture surrounding the present College Algebra program. This will involve (a) developing a sense of ownership and pride in the College Algebra  program in each member of the full-time mathematics faculty teaching  College Algebra in the consortium schools; (b) energizing faculty to develop modes of instruction that actively engage students in their own learning; (c) developing a sense of involvement and responsibility for the College  Algebra program on the part of faculty in disciplines that require  College Alge bra for their majors; and (d) developing administrative support for the new program in terms of  reduced class size, equipment purchase, and technical computer  assistance.    The project evaluation focuses on changes in the culture associated with the College Algebra Program and in the College Algebra course.",
