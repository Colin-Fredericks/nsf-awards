 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past thirty years public schools have systematically weakened their disciplinary measures, lessening the constraints on acceptable student behavior.  There is good reason to hypothesize that these changes in school disciplinary policies have had major effects on student achievement, since these policies provide the parameters in which student peer climates emerge.  Although there has been a national decline in the severity of public school disciplinary practices, states have varied to the extent that they have constrained the latitude of local school authorities.  Possible explanations for this state-level variation rely on theories that emphasize either internal organizational factors or external environmental forces.\r\n    The research will: use Office of Civil Rights data to create a map of state-level variation in school disciplinary practices from 1974 to 1992; create a state-level dataset of internal organizational and external environmental factors related to state-level variation in public school disciplinary practices, including coding of related legislation and litigation on student rights; and analyze state-level data separately and in multi-level models with individual-level student outcomes to identify the causes and consequences of changes in public school disciplinary practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
