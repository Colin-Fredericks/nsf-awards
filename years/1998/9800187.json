 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9800187  Newman  CAM-LEM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing of Laminated Engineering Materials) is a new manufacturing process constituting a next-generation advance in the field of Rapid Prototyping. The CAM-LEM process steps are:  analyze a CAD model in terms of contours of slice planes and in terms of surface tangents;  feed and laser-cut sheet tape-cast materials per the computed edge tangents; robotically extract the desired slice regions and stack them to assemble 3-D parts, interleaved with complementary shapes of fugitive material for temporary supports; and post-process to achieve lamination, binder burn-out, fugitive burn-out and sintering to full density. The objective of this investigation is to determine whether CAM-LEM can achieve the performance necessary to become a viable manufacturing process.  The investigation will identify and analyze the fundamental limits to CAM-LEM technology in terms of ultimate build speed, parts accuracy, maximum and minimum dimensions and aspect ratios achievable, and materials extensibility.  Design studies and simulations will lead to the construction of a fast, accurate and reliable machine for the realization of automated CAM-LEM.   If successful, this research will yield the enabling technology for the creation of a new, faster and more flexible manufacturing machine and process for direct fabrication of functional parts based on electronic descriptions.",
