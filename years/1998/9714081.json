 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program, focusses on the synthesis and characterization  of metal containing polymers that exhibit novel electron transfer  and electrocatalytic properties.  Professor Elliott and his  students at Colorado State University will pursue work in four  areas.  The development of electrochemical methods to directly  measure the flux of ions in conducting polymers, the use of  impedance measurements to evaluate a polypyrrole system as a  sensor for chlorocarbons, preparation of fixed redox gradients in  polymers and of low-work-function conduction properties in  polymer films for practical applications as light emitting  diodes, and the preparation of metal complexes in polymers that  will exhibit enhanced catalytic activity compared with  conventional coordination complexes will be pursued.    The synthesis of electroactive polymers that have properties  permitting their use in diverse practical areas such as chemical  sensors, light emitting diodes, and superior metal centered  catalysis will be pursued.  Professor Elliott and his students at  Colorado State University will employ a wide range of techniques  in both the synthetic aspects of this work and in the  characterization of the newly prepared polymers.  There are  exciting prospects for these new materials having real value in  numerous areas of analysis and synthesis.  New electrochemical  methods will be developed and a variety of established  electrochemical methods will be used in this work.",
