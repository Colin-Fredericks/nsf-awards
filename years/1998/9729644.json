 "awd_abstract_narration": "Six major and four minor users at the University of  Minnesota are requesting instrumentation needed to study the  structure and function of enzymes, muscle proteins,  apolipoproteins, bacterial toxins, and metalloproteins.  These instruments will be used to provide a vital linkage of  thermodynamic and dynamic properties to ongoing structural  analyses.  The investigators are studying biological  function through mutagenesis and protein design, using the  shared facilities of a recently established Structural  Biology Core Laboratory at the University of Minnesota.  A dynamic light scattering instrument will be employed by  all of the users to analyze the aggregation state of  proteins that are being designed and produced.  Understanding the oligomeric state of a protein or protein  complex is essential to NMR studies, to the preparation of  crystals for X-ray diffraction, and to a variety of  spectroscopic analyses.    A titration calorimeter will be used by three major and  three minor users to determine the energetics of protein  ligand binding, which is often required for the functional  characterization of mutant or covalently modified proteins  in structural studies.    A multifrequency phase fluorometer will be used by three  major and three minor users to analyze protein dynamics,  structure, and protein-protein interactions.  This  particular emphasis will be placed on the use of mutagenesis  to engineer labeling sites for fluorescent probes in  proteins, providing site-specific structural and dynamic  information to complement x-ray and NMR structural studies.",
