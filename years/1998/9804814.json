The study will \r\nfocus mainly on systems that model pulse propagation in parametric \r\nwaveguides made of materials with quadratic nonlinearity. These \r\nequations share the property that their solutions show highly phase-\r\nsensitive behavior (for example in collision outcomes). One part of the \r\nstudy will investigate the existence and stability of travelling waves for \r\ncertain systems, using variational techniques and detailed eigenvalue \r\nanalysis of linearized operators. A second part of the study will involve \r\nthe development of ordinary differential equations as models for phase-\r\nsensitive pulse behavior, including collisions between two quadratic \r\npulses.\r\n\r\nThe equations to be studied arise in fiber optics; their solutions model light \r\npulses travelling down a fiber. They are of interest to optical scientists and \r\nengineers because they model light pulses that are unusually narrow and \r\nrequire unusually low energies to produce; the hope is that many such \r\npulses could be packed closely together to increase the speed of data \r\ntransmission through optical fibers. This study will address fundamental \r\nproperties of these pulses by identifying factors important for predicting \r\ntheir stability (when a pulse is affected by noise and interactions with the \r\nfiber and other pulses, to what extent does it retain the pulse shape \r\nnecessary to transmit information?) and their behavior in collisions (when \r\ntwo pulses meet each other head-on).\r\n",
