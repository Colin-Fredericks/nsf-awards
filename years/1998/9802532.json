 "awd_abstract_narration": "Markman  9802532    The problems studied in this project arise from the  interaction of algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry and integrable systems.  Part 1 of the project consists of the study of a birational duality  among moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces arising from the Brill-Noether  stratification of these symplectic moduli spaces. The interaction of this  duality with a representation of the Heisenberg algebra on the total cohomology of sequences of moduli spaces is investigated.  In Part 2 of the project the theory of integrable systems will be  used to compare the boundary of the compactified Picard of an  algebraic curve with planar singularities to the boundary of coadjoint  orbits of loop algebras.      This is research in the field of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic  geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but  one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined  in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra,  but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding  application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.",
