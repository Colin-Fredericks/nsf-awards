 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    9730059  Michael Nathanson  Yale University  A Two-Photon Imaging System for Biological Research and  Education    This proposal will fund the purchase of a two-photon  excitation imaging system for the Center for Cell Imaging at  Yale University School of Medicine.  Specifically, the  Center's confocal microscope will be upgraded to have two-  photon capability.  Two photon laser excitation imaging has  several properties that make it unique, even relative to  point scanning confocal imaging.  Two photon imaging permits  more highly localized excitation of fluorophores, excitation  of dyes that excite at lower wavelengths, much deeper sample  penetration, less photobleaching, and less cytotoxicity than  conventional confocal microscopy.  These features improve  spatial resolution, especially in thicker tissue  preparations such as intact organs, and make it possible for  the first time to photolyse caged compounds or photobleach  dyes in highly localized, submicron-sized intracellular  regions.  No two-photon imaging system is currently  available at the School of Medicine, although a number of  investigators require this technology to advance their  research efforts.  The range of projects that will make  immediate use of this technology include flash photolysis of  caged second messengers to examine regulation of Cai2+  signals at the subcellular level, photolysis of caged  oligonucleotides to perform in situ PCR at the single cell  level, immunochemistry of intact embryos and larvae,  examination of acid production in intact gastric glands,  examination of intercellular Cai2+ waves in intact, perfused  livers, and distribution and trafficking of GFP-labeled  proteins in tissues (including brain slices) and in whole  brains of transgenic animals.  In addition, the Center for  Cell Imaging is the only such imaging resource available to  all investigators at the School of Medicine.  Therefore, the  acquisition of the two-photon imaging system by the Center   will insure that any investigator at the school will have  access to this technology now and in the future.",
