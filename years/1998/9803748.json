 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate the macroscopic response of both homogeneous \r\nand heterogeneous materials. For homogeneous materials it will obtain \r\nsharp tests as to whether actual measurements of the electrical or viscoelastic \r\nresponse over two different frequency intervals are compatible.  For \r\nheterogeneous materials it will bound the dielectric and viscoelastic \r\nresponse of materials both in the frequency domain and in the time domain. \r\nIn addition the principal investigator will determine what macroscopic \r\nstress strain combinations can or cannot occur in both linear and non-linear \r\ncomposites and will identify microstructures which have extremal stress-strain \r\ncombinations.  These are expected to be important in applications where one \r\nwants to channel stress from one area to another.  The research will shed \r\nfurther light on exact microstructure independent relations amongst the \r\neffective moduli of composites.  It will also obtain dramatic accelerations of the \r\nconvergence rate of certain iterative numerical schemes which have been \r\ndeveloped to compute the properties of both linear and non-linear composites.  \r\n\r\nA better understanding of the macroscopic response of materials is of central \r\ntechnological importance. This importance stretches across the board, from \r\nunderstanding the macroscopic response of engineered materials (of critical \r\nimportance to the defence, automative, and aerospace industries), to \r\nunderstanding the macroscopic response of polycrystalline and porous rocks \r\n(relevant to earthquake prediction and to the oil industry), to understanding \r\nthe macroscopic response of sea ice (important to climate modelling), \r\nto understanding the macroscopic response of biological materials \r\n(such as tissues, bones, shells and tendons).  The research funded with this\r\naward will enhance our understanding in ways that will facilitate the development \r\nof new materials, provide procedures for testing the reliability of experimental \r\nmeasurements, and accelerate numerical computations. \r\n\r\n",
