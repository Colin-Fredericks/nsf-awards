 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atomic analysis is of very great importance in analytical chemistry. Of the available techniques, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy has become the most widespread due to its wide applicability. Chemistry students at Hunter do not at present have the opportunity to use ICP equipment in their undergraduate labs. The objective of this proposal is to give Hunter students that opportunity. Our plan is to introduce experiments which will allow students extended use of a state-of-the-art ICP spectrometer with the most advanced data collection capability. Students studying Physical Chemistry will have the opportunity to investigate the idea of temperature, one of the most fundamental concepts in science, in some depth. In addition to using modern instrumentation, they will be able to make use of current computer-based data reduction methods. Students in Analytical Chemistry courses will learn the capabilities and limitations of ICP-based analyses and be able to compare ICP methods to others. Their experience of analytical methodologies and modern equipment will be substantially extended.  Spectroscopy is a major area of chemistry, and atomic spectroscopic data are important components of regulatory and public health decisions. Adoption of the materials developed in the project will result in students who have a more realistic idea of modern chemistry, and who are better prepared for graduate training or available jobs in chemistry. Those who go on to teach will be better able to convey to their students the impact of chemistry on their lives.",
