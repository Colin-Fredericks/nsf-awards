 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reed\r\n9805761\r\n     The investigator and his collaborator, Joseph Blum, have\r\noffered the only proposal for how the neurons in the lateral\r\nsuperior olive collectively compute and encode azimuthal location\r\nbased on sound level difference at the ears.  Recent experimental\r\nevidence indicates that their proposal may be correct.  In the\r\nfirst part of this project, the investigator works with\r\ncollaborators to compare the model predictions with experimental\r\nresults.  Analytical investigations explain why the model encoding\r\nis very independent of sound level and exceptionally robust to\r\nparameter variations and synapse and cell death.  A second part\r\nof the project uses mathematical models and machine computation\r\nto investigate neural processing in the dorsal nucleus of the\r\nlateral lemniscus, DNLL, an important intermediary processing\r\nregion between the superior olivary complex and the midbrain.\r\nRecent experimental studies have shed new light on the anatomy\r\nand physiology of the DNLL, but no modelling studies have been\r\nperformed to understand how the DNLL neurons process their inputs\r\nand influence the encoding of a map of space in the auditory\r\nmidbrain.\r\n     Using mathematics and computation, the investigator  studies\r\nthe structure and function of specific groups of nerve cells.  The\r\nmain focus of this project is to understand how groups of nerve\r\ncells in the brain perform together calculations that individual\r\nnerve cells cannot do.  These investigations not only help us\r\nunderstand normal brain function, but should also enable the\r\ndesign of prosthetic devices and treatment strategies in certain\r\ncases of brain injury.  In connection with these research\r\nactivities, the investigator trains mathematics Ph.D. students\r\nand post-doctoral associates in the applications of mathematics\r\nto biological systems and medicine.  In addition, he teaches a\r\nfreshman course entitled \"Applications of Mathematics to\r\nPhysiology and Medicine,\" which introduces excellent college\r\nfreshmen to this new and exciting field.\r\n",
