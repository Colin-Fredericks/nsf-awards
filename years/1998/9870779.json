 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new method of optical tomography is developed for noninvasive photon  migration imaging of biological tissues. Major objectives of the project  are to adapt methods devised for geophysical applications to optical  imaging, investigate the? effects of a priori assumptions on convergence  behavior, and extend the resulting methods to three dimensions. The method  produces estimates of the number, geometry, value, and covariance of  spatially distributed parameters, such as absorption and scattering  coefficients, that are correlated with biological structure and function.           The new inverse method incorporates Bayesian statistics, unlike other state-  of-the-art photon migration imaging methods.  An approximate extended  Kahman filter is used, in which the inverse of an a priori estimate of the  parameter error covariance matrix regularizes the system and the weighting  matrix includes the inverse of the measurement error covariance. The  efficiency of the extended Kalman filter is improved by approximations that  significantly reduce computational requirements without compromising the  accuracy of the filter estimates.  In addition, the recursive nature of the  filter is exploited to keep the size of required matrix inversions low by  processing data from separate source-emission events sequentially.  Automatic parameterization is alternated with data conditioning to  dynamically determine the number and geometry of spatially distributed  parameters.  The dimensionality of the parameter space is kept high where  there are adequate data to warrant high resolution, while the computational  efficiency and regularizing effects of low dimensionality are exploited in  regions where data are sparser.",
