 "awd_abstract_narration": "9722546  Yuan      A basic goal of physics is to explain the workings of the  natural  universe with the most simple, elegant theory possible.  In  addition,  a good theory must also make concrete predictions that can  be tested  by experiments.  In these regards, the standard model of  particle physics  has been an outstanding success.  However, there are certain  questions  that the standard model cannot address, the most basic of  which is  the origin of the particle masses.  To go beyond the  standard model,  we need input from new high energy colliders, such as the  Large Hadron  Collider, which is currently under construction in Europe.    In this project the group at MSU and colleagues at Tsinghua  University, Beijing,  will study the problem of mass generation, and how it can be  probed by these new  colliders.  Theoretical arguments predict that new physics  must arise at these  high energies.  In this project,  both specific models will  be used  as well as  model-independent analyses to show how the data can shed  light on the more  complete theory.  Both groups bring complementary expertise  to bear on the problem;  both groups will involve graduate students in the research  programs.",
