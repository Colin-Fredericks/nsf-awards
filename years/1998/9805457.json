S. to a special symposium  on the conservation and ecology of seabirds of the southern  oceans. This symposium will be convened at the annual  meetings of the Society for Conservation Biology, Sydney,  Australia, 13-16 July 1998. A discussion session and  workshop will immediately follow the symposium and  facilitate greater interactions and new collaborations among  scientists and students from the United States with those  from Australia, New Zealand and other southern hemisphere  countries including Indonesia and the Philippines.  Funds  are included to invite four scientists and/or students from  the Philippines and Indonesia to attend. These countries  have growing conservation programs that include seabird  species. Participation by individuals from these programs  will enhance their knowledge on seabird conservation and  promote new collaborations. All participants in the  symposium and workshop will be invited to submit their  papers for peer-review and publication in a proposed special  volume of the Antarctic Research Series, to be published by  the American Geophysical Union in 1999. This volume also  will include solicited papers from scientists worldwide,  will be an important reference on recent investigations  using new technology on seabird conservation, and will have  broad distribution.",
