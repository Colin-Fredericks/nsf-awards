 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cooper  97-29965  This is an award to support research on a disinfection process  for water by use of ionizing radiation produced by a beam of  energized electrons.  The research will focus on use of the beam  for inactivation of Cryptosporidum sp and Giardia sp.  It will  consider the potential use of the beam for treatment of raw water  prior to its treatment using conventional coagulation,  sedimentation and filtration processes.  The research will also  consider the possibility of using the beam to treat filter  backwash water prior to its return to the raw water supply line.  Since it is likely that a residual disinfectant will be needed  before placement of water into a potable water distribution  system, this research will also address the potential the  electron beam has for destruction of precursors of disinfection  byproducts produced by chemical disinfectants such as chlorine.  Since many of the common contaminants of surface and ground water  supplies are organic chemicals originating from both point and  non-point sources, the research will also examine the potential  use of the beam for destruction of organic pesticides, herbicides  and organic compounds that adversely affect the taste and odor of  water destined for potable consumption.    The results of this project are expected to provide information  potentially useful in considering electron beam radiation as an  approach to disinfection of water contaminated with the target  organisms.  Co-investigators include Dr. Joan Rose, Professor in  the Department of Marine Science at the University of South  Florida, Dr. Kevin O'Shea, Associate Professor in the Department  of Chemistry at Florida International University and Dr. Prashant  V. Kamat, Senior Scientist, Radiation Laboratory, University of  Notre Dame.      Edward H. Bryan, Ph.D., Program Director  Environmental Engineering  March 2, 1998",
