 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733928  Meaney  Cells in the human body are aware constantly of their  outside environment and often respond to even small changes  in surrounding mechanical forces.  However, the exact nature  and course of these mechanically initiated changes remains  largely unexplained.  If better understood, the adaptation  of cells to mechanical stress could be better controlled to  understand and direct cell growth, maintenance, and the  restoration of cell function.    The underlying premise of the research and educational  activities of this CAREER award is that critical new  advances in the control of cell function are accomplished by  combining molecular based control of biological systems with  an engineered modulation of the external mechanical forces  sensed by the cell.  An experimental approach is used to  understand how mechanical forces are sensed, or transduced,  by neuronal cells of the brain and spinal cord.  The focus  of research  in this CAREER award is on understanding how  changes to the structural architecture of the neuron can  affect the sensing mechanisms for the cell.  By developing  structure-function relationships for normal neurons, we seek  to extend these studies and accomplish our long term  objective of using these sensing mechanisms to assist in the  repair or recovery of the diseased or injured neuron.    The central aim of the educational plan is to bring elements  of cellular bioengineering research to the undergraduate  level and form a stronger interface with the clinical  sciences in the bioengineering undergraduate program.  These  two elements as critical for bioengineering undergraduates  to experience, since they both bring undergraduates closer  to the process of creating new knowledge through basic  research and viewing the practical applications of basic  bioengineering research in medicine.  It is expected that  the exposure to research based laboratories and modern tools  in biomedicine at the undergraduate level will help prepare  students for careers where  research is a more pervasive  element and is constantly translated into improvements in  health care technology.  ***",
