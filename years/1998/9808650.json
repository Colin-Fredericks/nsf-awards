IBN 98-08650        This application is for the sixth in a very successful series of FASEB conferences on plant molecular biology, which have been devoted to plant development since 1994. The conference will be entitled \"Mechanisms in Plant Development\" and will be held from August 15-20, 1998 at Saxton's River, Vermont. Plant development has become an enormously popular field, and the last few years have seen major discoveries that illuminate the principles and theories debated by plant biologists in the past. In particular, we!l-characterized genetic models such as pea and snapdragon, and especially maize and Arabidopsis thaliana, have provided insights into the molecular genetic basis for many key processes in plant development. The widespread availability of gene finding tools such as insertional mutagens, and rapid progress in genome mapping and sequencing make the isolation of mutants in virtually any aspect of plant development, and the molecular isolation of the corresponding genes, a routine procedure. The field is now, or soon will be, in a position to directly address the molecular mechanisms of development using these sophisticated tools.    The scientific sessions in this meeting have a more mechanistic bias than the previous conference, but the overall progress through the plant life cycle, from gametogenesis to flowering, has been retained. There is a new session on epigenetics, an area of considerable biotechnological as well as fundamental interest, and increased the emphasis on cell-cell interactions, hormonal and environmental regulation of development. The invited speakers include both young and established investigators from within and outside the U.S.. Additional speakers will be drawn from attendees on the basis of submitted abstracts. By bringing together investigators who study these various systems, we hope to facilitate an exchange of ideas and information, and we hope that some understanding of the underlying mechanisms of plant development wil l begin to emerge.",
