 "awd_abstract_narration": "Winglee, Robert  AST  97-29096      While jets from young stellar objects are common in regions of star formation, and recent theoretical and observational work implies that jets are an integral and perhaps necessary component of the early evolution of low-mass stars, the mechanisms that launch them are not fully understood.  Drs. Winglee and Bohm investigate the hypothesis that the jets are the result of a time dependent interaction between the magnetic field and the accretion disk around a typical young star.  Their work builds on early simulations that have corroborated the basic features of this launching mechanism for jets, and produced a two-component outflow of jets and winds which is in agreement with observations.  Their work extends this model to a more complete parameter space, and tests the model against a variety of existing imaging and spectroscopic observations.  The model makes predictions on the velocity spectrum of the outflow, the time variability of the outflow observables, and the correlation of these observed parameters with X-ray flares, as well as  ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) excesses associated with accretion streams and disks, which can be tested against existing observations.",
