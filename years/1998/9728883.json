 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728883  Clemens    A major biological issue is understanding the nature of sex differences and similarities in the regulation of behavior.  One of the problems that arises in comparing males and females is that we often use different measurement scales for males than we use for females.  Moreover, scientists tend to focus their attention only on the differences between the sexes.  Dr. Clemens notes that when functional units of behavior that are comparable between males and females are used, then general principles emerge that can apply to both genders.  Using state-of-the-art neuroanatomical tools to examine neural activity, he will determine whether males and females have evolved forebrain mechanisms that respond similarly to the same contextual features of a situation.  On the other hand, Dr. Clemens also notes substantial physiological differences exist in the peripheral nervous system of males and females which emerge as a result of endocrine processes during early development.  He will use a variety of biological and behavioral techniques to investigate underlying mechanisms.  These experiments will allow him to specify with great precision, exactly which cells in the central nervous system are active during different phases of the physiological and behavioral process in both males and females.  The results from these fundamental studies could provide a new framework within which to view sex differences and similarities in the neuroendocrine substrates of behavior.  Moreover, the findings could lead to a better understanding of how complex patterns of peripheral neural activity are integrated and controlled by the central nervous system.",
