 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Sen is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry Program to study the mechanisms of homogeneous catalysts.  He   has developed a rhodium chloride based catalytic system that is capable   of the selective oxidation of methane to methanol or acetic acid in the   presence of oxygen and carbon monoxide.  Further, this system will   preferentially cleave carbon-carbon bond of higher alkanes to produce   methanol or acetic acid.  A second catalytic system based upon copper   chloride and palladium is able to oxidize the carbon-hydrogen and   carbon-carbon cleavage products of alkanes at rates comparable to   commercially utilized processes.  The PI has proposed to undertake a   detailed kinetic and mechanistic study of the bimetallic catalytic   system.  Key issues to be addressed in this investigation are the roles   of carbon monoxide and water in the catalytic cycle and the nature of   carbon-hydrogen and carbon-carbon bonds upon oxidation products.    Specific methodologies will include kinetic isotope effect studies and   the design and fabrication of a custom flow reactor.  Selective partial oxidation chemistry is one of the most actively   explored fields in the US chemical industry.  The conversion of   hydrocarbons to commercially valuable feedstock materials such as   alcohols and carboxylic acids is commercially important.  The development   of new catalysts to perform this function is of great practical   importance due to the value-added nature of the process.",
