 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. John A.Gladysz, Chemistry Department, University of Utah, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program, to investigate complexes in which chains of sp hybridized carbon   atoms span two transition metals. The objective of the project is to   synthesize complexes in which wire-like sp hybridized carbon chains   connect two transition metal end groups. After deprotonation of M(CC)nH   the reaction with metal halides will link the two metals through an even   number carbon chain, while reaction with coordinated carbon monoxide   followed by deoxygenation of the carbonyl will yield a link with an odd   number of carbon atoms. A series of preparations will be designed to   produce the requisite metalla-poly-ynyl starting materials with a variety   of carbon chain lengths. The charge transfer and redox chemistry of the   dimetalla species will be determined to define the effect of chain length   on the structure and electronic properties of the complexes.   The compounds targeted in this investigation contain two metals that are   linked through a long chain that consists solely of carbon atoms. These   chains can serve as 'wires' through which electrons or magnetic   information can be transferred from one metal to the other. As such they   can form the basis for micro-electronic devices and for the basic   understanding of how well separated metals can influence one another   through extended linking units.",
