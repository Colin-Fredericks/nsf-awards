 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program supports research by Dr. James Burlitch to investigate the   synthesis and reactivity of silica-supported magnesium hydroperoxides.  A   primary goal of the research is to characterize and develop the redox   chemistry of the proposed -SiOMgOOH group.  Characterization will include   the use of Raman, infrared, and solid-state NMR spectroscopic techniques.    Spectroscopic properties of the magnesium hydroperoxides will be   compared with those of similar groups that are bound to surface-modified   silica gels and to discrete model compounds.  The reactivity of these   solid-state oxidants will also be explored.  Reactions will be carried   out with model reductants and, once conditions are established for simple   oxidations, studies will be extended to base-sensitive groups such as   chlorinated hydrocarbons.  This program will not only provide fundamental information in the area of   oxidation chemistry, but may also lead to the development of a   convenient, mild, and selective reagent for carrying out chemical   transformations.  Additionally, magnesium hydroperoxides have the   potential to replace more dangerous and less environmentally friendly   industrial oxidants.",
