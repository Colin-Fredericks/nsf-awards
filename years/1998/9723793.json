 "awd_abstract_narration": "Karasov  9723793  A  widespread  notion  is that sugar (D-glucose)  is  mainly  actively  absorbed by the intestine. The Pi's have evidence,  however, that birds can absorb considerable amounts  of  the  other  form  of glucose, L-glucose, which is thought  to  be  absorbed passively, not actively. The proposed studies  test  the  assumption  that L-glucose is absorption  passively  by  birds,  and the inference that most D-glucose absorption  is  passive.  The  studies  will  also  determine  how   passive  absorption  by  the  avian intestine  varies  with  size  of  water-soluble  molecules,  and  whether  the   movement   of  absorbed solutes occurs across or between intestinal  cells.  The   findings   will   be   important   to   physiologists,  evolutionary  biologists, toxicologists, and  ecologists.  A  finding  that  most  sugar is absorbed  passively  would  be  important    because    it   would   challenge    prevailing  physiological  ideas about nutrient absorption  as  well  as  current  analyses in evolutionary digestive physiology  that  attempt  to  match  the  physiological  capacity  to  absorb  nutrients   with   nutrient  intake.   A   high   intestinal  permeability  permitting  passive  absorption  might  permit  toxins to be absorbed from plant and animal material in  the  intestine.   This  scenario  would  beg  research   on   the  ecological cost associated with exposure and detoxication of  natural  toxins, and perhaps the sensitivity of wild animals  to  the  new  generation  of  water-soluble  herbicides  and  pesticides produced by humans.",
