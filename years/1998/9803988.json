 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803988  Wagner    The Zoological Society of Philadelphia will develop Primate Reserve.  This project will include the development of a two acre indoor/outdoor primate habitat for up to 60 primates and a variety of complementary programming including hands-on interpretative activities for visitors, a Discovery House/Conservation Action Center, live performances, school programs and teacher training activities that link with the formal education curriculum, and a World Wide Web site.  The goal of this program is to communicate basic information about primate biology, behavior, social structure, and habitats, and the problems face by primates in the wild.  Visitors are to learn that \"Conservationists around the world work together to help primates and you can help too.\"  Specifically visitors will learn details about conservation biology/population biology including a) a species' biology affects its vulnerability to extinction, b) small populations are vulnerable to inbreeding depression and loss of genetic diversity, c) small populations in small areas are vulnerable to stochastic events, and d) these concerns apply to both wild and zoo populations.  To make the story more personal and to provide career role models, primatologists engaged in their research will be featured in the exhibit.  The exhibit will open in June, 1999 and the school program will begin October, 1999.",
