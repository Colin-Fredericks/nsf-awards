The research objective  over the period of the next three years is to synthesize a large  number of mixed metal oxyfluorides prepared from (hydrogen  fluoride) x pyridine/pyridine/water solution (150 degrees  centigrade, autoclave autogenous pressure) using metal oxides as  reagents.  The \"composition space\" approach will establish  individual regions of stability (crystallization fields) and  enable the selective crystallization of different phases within  each system studied.  Structures are expected which range from  polynuclear clusters to one dimensional chains, two-dimensional  layers and three dimensional frameworks.  The hydrolytic  chemistry of multi-cation precursors, templating methodology, and  pH controlled oxolation (polyanions) and olation (polycations)  reaction chemistry under study will advance our understanding of  inorganic chemistry.  %%%  The design of inorganic solids is the important step in the  development of materials that enhance our living standards.  Research is proposed to develop new methodologies for inorganic  chemistry leading to more complex inorganic solids compared to  those that are presently available for use in computers,  automobiles and as catalysts in the chemical and petroleum  industry.  ***",
