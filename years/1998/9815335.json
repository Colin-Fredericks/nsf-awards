This workshop follows a \"Workshop on Amphibian  Declines\", held May 28-29, at the National Science Foundation. That  workshop brought together a number of biologists who have been working on  amphibian declines around the world. Several presentations focused on the  role of disease as a factor in amphibian mortality in the field. Since  amphibians have robust iminune systems that should be capable of defending  against all but the most virulent pathogens, the existing data suggest that  one or more environmental factors are altering the balances between  pathogens and hosts in a manner that is detrimental to the amphibians.  Since outbreaks of disease have recently been noted in a number of  different types of organisms, including coral reefs, turtles, and mammals,  these observations together may signal global environmental deterioration  to the extent that humans may also soon be at risk. The workshop will bring  together individuals who have observed amphibian declines in the field,  pathologists, epidemiologists, neuroinimunologists, endocrinologists, and  immunotoxicologists to identify what is known and what needs to be learned  about these mass die-offs. Identification of the pathogens involved in  amphibian mass-mortality, the manner by which they are successfully  infecting amphibians, and the reasons why the immune systems of amphibians  are not successfully protecting them is essential for predicting which  environmental factors might be the ultimate causal factors in amphibian  declines. A review of the findings will be published in Developmental and  Comparative Immunology.",
