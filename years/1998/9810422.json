 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810422  Mohamed    This research focuses on the substructural details of  superplastic flow in metal alloys with special focus on the  superplastic region (region II).  This includes a systematic  examination of the effects of selected types of impurity  atoms on superplastic flow and cavitation.  Such an  examination addresses synergistic interactions among various  impurities on cavitation and ductility.  An in-depth study  of the effects of impurity type and level on the cavitation  process is carried out, looking at cavity nucleation and the  relationship between deformation and cavity growth.  Impurity distribution at boundaries is characterized.  Microstructural details associated with superplastic  deformation (boundary sliding and migration, grain shape,  grain rotation, and ligaments) are determined as a function  of impurity level and type, large strains (>30%), and  deformation mode (tension and double shear).  Three  different model materials, Zn-22% Al, Pb-62% Sn, and Al-33%  Cu, are examined.  For these alloys, high-purity grades and  grades doped with impurities are tested.  In addition,  selected commercial superplastic alloys are included to  examine the orientation of cavity stringers as a function of  strain rate in light of a new mechanistic model proposed for  the stringers.  Also examined are the effects of major  impurities, such as Cu and Mg, on cavitation and ductility  behavior in two near-nano scale A1 alloys, which exhibit  high strain rate superplasticity.  An innovative technique  employs flat double-shear specimens to simplify the test  procedure and avoid problems associated with torsional and  tensile loading.  %%%  The results of this program should have significant impact  in the science and technology of metal alloy  superplasticity.  It will advance understanding of the  processing of commercial superplastic alloys and could lead  to improvements in the performance of these materials.  ***",
