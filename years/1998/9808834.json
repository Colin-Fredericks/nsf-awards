The  response  of  female  crickets  to   behaviorally  significant  sounds representing potential mates is one  of  these  models  and  it  offers  several advantages.  Most  important  the  cricket's   nervous  system  is  rather  accessible  and   single,  identified auditory nerve cells play demonstrably important  roles  in  the  regulation of the rather complex orientation response  of  females  to  the  calls of males. The single nerve  cells  can  be  photoinactivated (killing an individual cell using a laser  and  a  fluorescent  dye) prior to behavioral testing, to  determine  that  cell's  role  in  behavior. The goal of studying this  system  has  been,  and will continue to be to determine how the cells involved  in  the  auditory system work together in a circuit to  allow  the  female  cricket to recognize the calling song of the male  of  its  species  and to locate the source of that call. Since most animals  and  human  communication  systems also  involve  recognition  and  localization  of  the communicative signal,  what  is  learned  by  examining  this  model system will further our  understanding  how  animal  communication  is accomplished and controlled  by  nervous  systems in general. Besides these goals, which focus on increasing  our   understanding  of  communication  systems,   several   other  accomplishments  are  planned.  Post-doctoral  opportunities  will  involve   training   and  experience  in  neurobiology   including  learning/using  these photoinactivation/behavioral  techniques  to  evaluate  causal  relationships between nerve  cell  activity  and  behavior.  The  investigators of the grant and these post-doctoral  candidates  will  provide specific training  and  involve  several  graduate  students  (at the MS level) and undergraduates  in  this  research.  The  research trai ning program at  Andrews  University,  where  this  work will be done, has and will continue  to  attract  minorities  and  women  into  laboratory  courses  that  lead   to  opportunities   for  undergraduate  research  including   research  opportunities in neurobiology outlined in this proposal.  Many  of  the  students that participate in such a project would be able  to  continue  on  for  more advanced training in the  rapidly  growing  fields of neuroscience.",
