Florida State University  Title: The ENSO Signal in Botswanan Rainfall and Anticipated  Impacts of the Current ENSO Event    ENSO events are usually associated with drought in much of Southern  Africa.  One of the areas most strongly affected is Botswana where  rainfall was 40 to 80% below normal during the 1991/92 ENSO  episode.  Preliminary work shows that the association between ENSO  and rainfall in Southern Africa is more complex than the simple  occurrence of drought.  Although droughts commonly occur during  ENSO episodes, early in many episodes there is actually an increase  of rainfall in some regions and not all ENSO events are associated  with droughts.  This SGER award supports research to better  understand the sequence of rainfall response within the current  ENSO episode and the conditions under which a given ENSO event  evokes a precipitation signal over Southern Africa.  The sequential  development of ENSO episodes also appears to have changed since the  late 1970's, when a general warming occurred in the world's oceans  and the current ENSO appears to be taking a somewhat different  course than other intense events.  The on-going ENSO event will be  used to address the nature of these events and the character of the  paleoclimate signal evoked.",
