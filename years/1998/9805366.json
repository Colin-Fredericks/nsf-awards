 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algorithms on graphical structures play a central role in both  communications technology and formal verification.  Minimal  trellises are graphical representations of error-correcting codes  that have emerged as a unifying framework for understanding and  manipulating codes of all types.  Ordered binary decision  diagrams and their variants are graph-based data structures for  representing Boolean functions that have found widespread use in  formal verification for a range of problems, including circuit  checking, logic synthesis and test generation.  This project  builds on the close correspondence that has recently been  established between the code trellis and binary decision diagram,  and investigates the transfer of ideas between these previously  disparate fields.  The fundamental challenge that confronts both  uses of graphical methods is the same: devise techniques to  combat the exponential blowup in the size of the graph.  The  research is interdisciplinary, and can be expected to have a  broad range of application, both within coding and verification,  as well as to such areas as artificial intelligence, database  search, and combinatorial optimization.",
