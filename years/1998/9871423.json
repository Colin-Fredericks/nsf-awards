 "awd_abstract_narration": "9871423  Ripperdan    This grant, supported equally by Experimental Program to  Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and the Major Research  Instrumentation (MRI) Program, provide partial funding for the  acquisition of a gas source stable isotope ratio mass  spectrometer (SIRMS) for the Geology Department at the University  of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez.  Establishment of this SIRMS facility  at Puerto Rico will make it the only one of its kind both on the  island and within the greater Caribbean region. As a result,  acquisition of a SIRMS by the University of Puerto Rico provides  an infrastructural improvement for the commonwealth and the  University that significantly increases the ability of the PI and  UPR colleagues to compete for federal and private sector research  and development funding.  While the main users of this facility  are relatively young, they have already begun a number of  research projects that require stable isotopic analyses of carbon  and oxygen in marine microfossil tests, coralline skeletons,  dissolved organic and inorganic carbon in groundwater and  biological samples.  Specific studies that will make use of the  SIRMS include: combined chemostratigraphic and paleontological  studies of the late Ordovician marine mass extinction, research  on millennial-scale stable isotopic proxies of sea surface  temperatures as recorded in coral skeletons, isotopic studies of  adsorbed and structural water within natural and artificial  zeolites in order to appraise their effectiveness for use in  environmental remediation efforts and to improve their design,  isotopic studies of hair for use in forensic toxicology, and  ecological studies of the fate and pathways of organic matter in  tropical ecosystems.  Finally, given the number of currently  funded NSF researchers that continue to conduct stable isotopic  investigation on Caribbean samples, be they aqueous, coralline,  igneous or otherwise, this facility will undoubtedly find use by  a large number of visiting scientists and  their students from  U.S. mainland institutions.     ***",
