 "awd_abstract_narration": "An integrated mathematics and science course and accompanying pilot technological enhancements are being developed that use fractals and chaos to build a conceptual understanding of scientific principles in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology for undergraduate students training to be pre-college teachers.         The course uses fractals and chaos to develop concepts in science. Units that are most successful in the course, will be implemented in technological form that can be disseminated and used in similar integrated courses, or as separate units in other introductory college level science and mathematics courses. The technological enhancements consist of: 1) interactive exercises based on spreadsheets, 2) Java applets, and 3) hypertext curricula and evaluation material.  The spreadsheet and Java exercises emphasize active learning.  The students vary the parameters of the systems to discover how their properties depend on the parameters.  The use of spreadsheets give students real-world technological skills by providing experience in a media used throughout the academic and business worlds.  The hypertext curricula material provides reference information on the content area, support the interactive spreadsheets and Java applets, and include performance based assessment of these pilot technological enhancements.  Specific examples of the content areas: 1) SYMMETRY: the mathematical properties of translational, rotational, and self-similarity symmetries are used to provide a basis for understanding the concept of invariants, that is, the consistency of physical properties under transformations in the conservation of energy, momentum, and electromagnetism. 2) PATTERN FORMATION PROCESSES: the mechanisms of processes that generate tree structures are used to understand the vascular and pulmonary branching patterns in biological systems; and the spatial patterns generated by diffusion in chemical systems and their resultant time dependencies. 3) PREDICTABILITY: the mathematical prope rties of nonlinear, chaotic systems, such as sensitivity to initial conditions, bifurcations, and attractors in phase space are used to develop the concepts of stability and instability in physical systems such as fluid flow, in chemical systems systems such as biochemical reactions, and in biological systems such as predatory-prey relationships.  A central goal of this project is to develop course curricula and technological enhancements that reach students who have math/science anxiety.  This is being accomplished by integrating the math and science, using specific applications as examples, covering few topics in depth rather than many topics superficially, and by fostering feedback and active participation by the students in the learning and evaluation processes.        This project builds on the previous K-12 project, Mathematics and Science Teacher Enhancement through Chaos and Fractals (ESI-95550052), by transforming the previously developed materials into new forms, technological enhancements in spreadsheet programs and hypertext curricula, and orienting them towards a different audience of college undergraduates training to be teachers.  It will uses the knowledge and skills developed by the previously trained lead teachers to develop, use, and evaluate the effectiveness of the technological enhancements.",
