This is a collaborative research project between   investigators from ten academic and government research   institutions.  The research is being conducted under the   auspices of the NSF Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP) program   and the NOAA Coastal Ocean Program.    This collaborative, 5-year research program will focus on   the importance of episodic events on nearshore-offshore   transport and subsequent ecological consequences. The study   seeks to 1) determine what processes control the cross-  margin (inshore to offshore) transport of biological,   chemical, and geological materials in the coastal margins of   the Great Lakes, and to 2) develop and test scientific   strategies for assessing, quantifying, and predicting the   impacts of multiple stresses both natural and anthropogenic,   in the Great Lakes or selected coastal sub-regions.    A tight coupling between sediments and overlying water   exists in lakes and coastal ecosystems through the process   of sediment resuspension. Satellite observations in Lake   Michigan illustrate an annually recurrent episode of   nearshore-offshore transport, a 10 km wide plume of   resuspended material extending over 200 km along the   southern shores of the lake. Preliminary evidence indicates   that this episodic event may be the major mechanism for   cross-margin sediment transport in Lake Michigan. The   program results will be applicable to similar events in many   coastal areas.    This component of the study addresses the general   hypothesis: large episodic events, such as the Lake Michigan   Recurrent Coastal Plume (LMRCP), change mesozooplanktonic   community structure and production by altering species and   life-stage distributions of certain organisms and their   trophic interactions. Field observations, process studies,   and laboratory investigations will be combined to evaluate   physical  and biotic effects of the plume on the   mesozooplankton community. Biweekly sampling of nutrients,   physical variables, and other parameters will serve to put   the LMRCP in perspective with ongoing changes in the   plankton and other events, and help evaluate its   significance to the Lake as a whole. The response of   mesozooplankton to large scale episodic events during the   winter-spring period in the Great Lakes and other similar   aquatic systems is important at the ecosystem level because   these populations play a pivotal role in energy transfers   and nutrient transformations that occur throughout the rest   of the year.",
