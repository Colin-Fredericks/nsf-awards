 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is exploring a class of verification methods,  called design reductions, which have advantages over  conventional approaches. Design reduction works by  simplifying a design incrementally. At each step,  consistency checking is done using symbolic verification  methods, which use symbolic simulation and automatic  decision procedures for fragments of logic. For example,  initial design reductions are proposed to remove pipelining  and similar optimizations, eliminate caching, simplify  interfaces, and eliminate traps and interrupts. Once a  design has been simplified as much as possible, it can be  compared with a user-supplied specification much more easily  than can the original design. The project is also  investigating several promising avenues to avoid or simplify  the generation of inductive invariants, which is the most  time-consuming aspect of symbolic verification. The project  is searching for: new proof methods that only require  invariants for certain states where the invariants are  comparatively simple to express; ways of identifying  internal correctness conditions that contribute to an  invariant; and methods integrating approximate model  checking into a more general framework.",
