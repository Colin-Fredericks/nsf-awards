The two plan to formulate the free and forced vibration problem of cylindrical and non-cylindrical helical coil springs made of composite (anisotropic) materials, and to perform experiments for verification of the analytical results.  The work is expected to ultimately lead to the development of a methodology for relating the spring's natural frequency to the design parameters of the spring, which include geometrical as well as material parameters.  The scientific benefits include the development and testing of mathematical and numerical methodology, while the technological benefits include the provision of tools for proper design and use of composite springs in a variety of products.  The applications may include designing of springs for vibration isolation, for energy storage, and for power transmission under conditions where weight and chemical resistance are primary concerns. \r\n\r\nScope:  This award will allow collaboration between a US scientist and a Turkish counterpart who have complementary capabilities.  The US scientist brings to the project experience and expertise in mechanical engineering design, polymeric and composite materials, manufacturing and testing.  He also has access to significant composite manufacturing facilities and testing equipment.  The Turkish scientist has experience and expertise in analytical and numerical methodology, as evidenced by her impressive publication record.  She will be able to utilize the extensive computation facilities at the US scientist's laboratory at the University of Akron.  This proposal meets the INT objective of increasing US-foreign collaboration in areas of mutual benefit.\r\n",
