The collaborators are US PI  Anandu D. Vernekar, Department of Meteorology,  University of Maryland and Indian PI S.K. Dash,  Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, Indian  Institute of Technology, New Delhi.  This  research examines the effect of the Eurasian  snow cover on the interannual variability of  the Indian monsoon.  The hypothesis that  excessive winter Eurasian snow cover has  adverse effect on the subsequent summer monsoon  rainfall over India will be studied through  numerical experiments on a high resolution  regional model linked to a global general  circulation model.  The results will have  important predictive value about the onset and  strength of the Indian monsoon.   Scope:  This is a new collaboration linking the  Department of Meteorology, University of  Maryland and the Center for Atmospheric  Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology,  Delhi.  This project combines the pioneering  expertise of Vernekar's group at Maryland in  numerical experiments with general and regional  models with the capability of the Delhi group  in modeling atmospheric and ocean processes.   The National Center for Atmospheric Research  (NCAR) will provided Cray supercomputer  facilities to support this research.    ***",
