This project will evaluate the   assumptions and predictions of the cost-benefit framework for the   extrafloral nectar-mediated mutualism between ants and Chamaecrista   fasciculata, the partridge pea.  A field experiment will evaluate four   assumptions: 1) the mutualistic trait (extrafloral nectar) is costly to   provide, 2) the extrafloral nectar provides a benefit through reduction   of herbivore damage by ants attracted to the nectar, 3) the balance of   costs and benefits produces stabilizing selection favoring an   intermediate optimum, and 4) manipulation of costs and benefits should   change the value of the selective optimum.  In addition, this project   will assess whether the cost-benefit framework can explain geographic   variation in extrafloral nectar traits in C. fasciculata.  Geographic   variation in the trait will be surveyed, and the hypothesis that   variation between populations is consistent with the presence of   different selective optima will be tested using a reciprocal transplant   experiment.   Mutualisms are ubiquitous, but theoretical and mechanistic   understanding of the processes that underlie them has progressed slowly.    Of the models that have been used to explain the evolution of mutualisms,   the cost-benefit approach is the most general and the most appropriate   framework for understanding the evolution of adaptive traits involved in   mutualisms.  This project will evaluate the assumptions and predictions   of the cost-benefit approach in regard to a mutualism between ants and a   common annual plant of the eastern United States, Chamaecrista   fasciculata (the partridge pea).  Data from this project should provide   an important empirical basis for future discussion of the pattern of   selection on mutualistic traits.",
