 "awd_abstract_narration": "To cope with unknown multipath propagation in wireless multiuser  communications, existing blind CDMA approaches rely on the  received data and the user-codes in order to suppress multi-user  interference (MUI) at the receiver. Starting with a multirate  equivalent model, this project takes a fresh look at designing  appropriate codes that lead to low-complexity quasi-synchronous  CDMA systems capable of eliminating MUI deterministically in the  presence of unknown and even rapidly varying multipath. Judicious  design of user codes converts the effect of frequency selective  channels into flat fading. Residual flat fading effects are  handled with differential encoding, and  deep channel fades via a  user code hopping technique at the transmitter -- an idea  permeating benefits of frequency-hopping to direct-sequence CDMA.  Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) follows as a  special case and optimal user codes are investigated when carrier  frequency errors, Doppler effects, time- and frequency-selective  multipath, oversaturation, and different priority users are  involved.  Comparisons and performance studies are conducted  using analytical tools, simulations, and real data collected from  a software radio testbed.",
