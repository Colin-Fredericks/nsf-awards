 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many undergraduate programs in mathematics and science do not adequately emphasize the central role played by mathematics in the investigation of problems that originate in biology and chemistry. The central role that mathematics plays in the advancement of all branches of science has created the demand for biologists and chemists who are quantitatively literate, mathematicians who can work with scientists in collaborative problem solving efforts, and educators who have a broad perspective on the interplay between mathematics and the sciences. This project is developing a library of modules through which students majoring in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and mathematics education will gain substantial practical experience in the application of mathematical methods to biology and chemistry.  Each module will be developed through a collaborative effort by mathematics and science faculty and will address individual applications at four levels -- precalculus, differential calculus, integral calculus, and differential equations. At each level, different aspects of the application will be explored depending on the mathematical tools available at that level. Through use of the modules in mathematics courses and science laboratory courses, science and mathematics students will learn to work together as a problem solving team and to accurately express the results of their mathematical and scientific investigations in writing.  The modules to be developed will be made available in hypertext and printed forms and will be disseminated via the World Wide Web. Faculty workshops on the use of the modules will be held at appropriate national meetings and working relationships with faculty who adopt the modules for use in their courses will be cultivated.",
