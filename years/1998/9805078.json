Within the broader study of sustainability, the research pays particular attention to the systemic approach to science education reform as well as the role that external funds can play in initiating reforms that are sustained. The goal of this study is to identify and document factors in school systems that contribute to sustained educational change.  The purpose is to provide districts now engaged in improving their science education programs and districts that are considering doing so in the future, with information that can help them more strategically and effectively build an infrastructure for long-term improvement. Specifically, this study focuses on nine communities with K-6 science education programs begun 10 to 30 years ago.  These communities differ in their sources of funding as well as the longevity of their programs.  This study investigates how and the extent to which these communities have sustained their science education programs and the factors that have contributed to this sustainability.",
