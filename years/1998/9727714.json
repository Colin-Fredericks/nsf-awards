Computer simulations represent a powerful tool for  obtaining fundamental information about wide ranging  problems in statistical physics and can complement  traditional theoretical and experimental approaches.  This  research will continue development and refinement of large  scale simulation methods for the study of phase transitions  in systems which are difficult to treat analytically.  The  techniques to be used include diverse Monte Carlo and spin  dynamics simulations.  Models are expected to be relevant to  magnetic materials, cubic binary alloys, adsorbed atoms on  crystalline substrates, and disordered media.  Several of  the problems include particles which may move continuously  in space and which are subject to elastic interactions,  whereas other problems will be confined to rigid lattices  (including classical spins with continuous degrees of  freedom) with discrete near neighbor interactions.  In many  of the systems finite geometries and/or the presence of  walls are responsible for behavior which is different than  that which is observed in the bulk.  Both static and dynamic  critical phenomena for systems in equilibrium will be  carefully examined. Simple non-equilibrium models of film  growth will be studied using kinetic Monte Carlo methods.  %%%  This is a renewal grant to a senior computational physicist  to conduct a series of simulations of condensed matter  systems.
