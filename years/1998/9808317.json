 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project intends to improve and extend the accuracy  and application of empirical potential energy functions for  peptides and proteins.  These functions form the basis of an  extensive set of modeling techniques widely used to  rationalize and predict the structure and conformational  energetics of organic molecules and biopolymers.  Based on  simple principles from classical chemical physics, this type  computer modeling software is widely used in a variety of  settings ranging from undergraduate chemistry and  biochemistry to research at the forefront of structural  biology.       While empirical potential energy functions often  exhibit exquisite accuracy in modeling nonpolar organics,  their application to typical biological systems presents  several additional difficulties.  The major goal of this  project is to find solutions to the problems that most limit  current application of this methodology in protein modeling:  (1) achieving chemical accuracy for protein structure and  energetics as governed by basic physics, and (2) describing  widely varied chemical environments such as the solvent  exposed surface of a protein and its hydrophobic interior.  Since the treatment of electrostatic interactions is the  largest source of error in these calculations, particular  emphasis will be placed upon developing an atom-centered  approach to electrostatics with inclusion of dipole  polarization effects.  A class of hybrid methods is proposed  for further development, using a shell of explicit water  coupled with a reaction field treatment of long range bulk  solvent effects.",
