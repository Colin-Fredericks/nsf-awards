The award is to partially support a workshop on \"Thermal Aspects of Manufacturing and Materials Processing.\"  The objective of the workshop is to bring together a cross section of people knowledgeable in areas of emerging technology and researchers with a strong interest in thermal processing to exchange information and to explore common technical areas.    The workshop is directed towards industrial and academic participation.  It will take place over two days in conjunction with the 1998 International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (to be held at Anaheim, California) and will involve presentations of current state-of-the-art, future trends, and critical thermal issues made by representatives from industry and federal laboratories and subsequent discussion by all attendees.  The topics range from chemical vapor deposition for electronics to property measurements for model reliability and includes ceramic, laser, plasma, polymer and thermal processing, MEMS, nanostructures, and in-situ measurements.  A printed report will be prepared for dissemination to government agencies and industry and web based version will be prepared for electronic access by academics and others.",
