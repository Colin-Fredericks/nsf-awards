The project's objective is to investigate parameters and develop procedures for economic selection of mechanical and electronic components required for building computerized and numerically controlled machining (CNC) systems.  The economic selection of components is based on predefined performance specifications.  The selection will be based on a procedure to be developed by the two sides to provide information relevant to markets in the US and in Egypt.  This is to be followed by the development of software to control the performance of the machining system.  The software is to be tailored to meet the needs of the private sectors in the United States and in Egypt.  Dr. Soliman will provide the machine and assess the design modification needed to have it used as a base for the CNC system.  Drs. Soliman and Tansel will select the actuators and servo drives for the operation of the CNC system, and will equip the machine with the electronic displacement and speed sensors.  The two sides will develop the interface software to couple the data acquisition system to an attached computer.  They will test the system performance against the desired specifications.  \r\n\r\nScope:  This award is for collaboration between two scientists, one in the US and one in Egypt, to develop and test a CNC machining system from machines currently used in less advanced industries in Egypt, instead of replacing the entire machines with new CNC systems.  The study is particularly useful for the developing countries' industries where it is too expensive to acquire ready made CNC machining systems, and where some of these machines may be difficult to operate and maintain.  It is also beneficial for the United States industries that provide the mechanical components and the computer hardware and software for the retrofitting.  This proposal meets the INT objective of enhancing US-foreign collaboration in areas that benefit both sides.   This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities. \r\n",
