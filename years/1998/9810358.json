 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9810358  Raymond Morris    The objectives of WISE 2000 is to support the participant of two additional engineering students each year in the 1998-2000 Washington Internships for Students of Engineering (WISE) programs.  The NSF grant will be used to help facilitate the participation of students from underrepresented minority groups and currently underrepresented engineering disciplines to make the program truly multidisciplinary and diverse as we move forward into the 21st century.    Since 1980, the WISE program has brought up to 18 students each summer-a total of 263 thus far-to Washington, DC to learn first-hand how engineers can contribute to important public policy debates.    The return on investment has been realized very quickly.  For example, within five years of participating in the Program, Paul Faeth received an award for his contribution to the development of the Reagan administration's farm legislation.  Brad Mitchell, a 1984 WISE intern, advised President Bush on science and technology policy issues and served as a White House liaison with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  Recent WISE interns garnered a Rhodes Scholarship, three Fulbright Grants, and a Top 10 College Women Award.  The most important contribution that the WISE alumni body has made over the past eighteen years has been its continued involvement in engineering and public policy beyond their ten-week summer programs.  In a recent survey, an overwhelming 77 percent of our former interns are involved in \"Public Policy\" in some form.  As one former intern said, \"I fully believe that the WISE Program affected my career and educational choices, primarily by providing the opportunity to see the numerous options available to me.  My experience in WISE showed me that engineers can, and should, make a difference in public policy.\"    The engineering community believes in the role of the WISE Program and the importance of engineer' involvement in helping develop new and better laws and regulation s in this technologically changing society.  Continued sponsorship by the engineering societies and NSF will ensure that this student program will continue to flourish and make positive contributions into the 21st century.  ***",
