 "awd_abstract_narration": "Micevych,  9728491    Receptors are plasma membrane associated molecules that  recognize intercellular signals.  G-protein-coupled  receptors are perhaps the most diverse family of membrane  bound receptors and mediate important functions in the  nervous system such as development, timing of puberty and  menopause, and nociception.  Dr. Micevych has been  interested in studying the mechanisms of cellular regulation  of neuropeptide receptors that belong to a class of G-  protein coupled receptors.  A new methodology, termed  \"receptor internalization\" presents a novel approach for the  visualization of receptor activation.  Internalization is  the sequestration of agonist-receptor complexes into  endosomal compartments within cells.  This is important  since removal of receptors from the plasma membrane prevents  further stimulation by intercellular signals.  An  internalized distribution of receptors is a marker of  activated receptors while a plasma membrane distribution  indicates no activation.  Dr. Micevych is developing and  refining the immunocytochemical techniques that will allow  him to monitor the activation of specific receptors on  individual cells or even single dendrites.  He will use this  methodology to define the neurochemical signature by which  the gonadal steroids estrogen and progesterone affect brain  activity to regulate reproductive behavior.  Specifically,  Dr. Micevych will use a combination of confocal fluorescence  and brightfield microscopy to determine the role of two  recently discovered endogenous opioid peptides, endomorphin-  1 and orphanin FQ/nociceptin, and their receptors in the  regulation of steroid-induced reproductive behavior.  This  exciting and novel method for the visualization of receptor  activation of discrete neurons will provide a better general  understanding of receptor function and neural circuits as  well as shed new light on the mechanisms by which estrogen  and progesterone act to stimulate neural circuits that  underlie behavior.",
