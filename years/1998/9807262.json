Recent commercial development of metallocene-catalyzed polymers  greatly increases the prospects for molecular tailoring of  molecular weight distribution (MWD) and long-chain branching  (LCB) distributions for optimal polymer processing  characteristics.  However, progress requires a much more detailed  understanding of the impact of MWD and LCB on the polymer  rheological properties.  It has already been shown that linear  rheological data can be used to infer the MWD of unbranched  polymers.  Inferring LCB characteristics, however, is much more  difficult, and cannot be done using linear viscoelastic data  alone, since without additional information, there is no unique  linear viscoelastic signature of LCB which could not also be  interpreted as a peculiar molecular weight distribution.  Fortunately, recent theoretical advances open up the possibility  of using nonlinear rheological data to quantify both the MWD and  LCB characteristics of entangled melts and concentrated solutions  of flexible polymers.  To exploit and enhance these new  capabilities, an experimental program that combines recent  advances in rheological instrumentation with the availability of  polymer synthetic methods will be carried out.  The group will  use a new commercial extensional rheometer and compliance-free  and compliance-corrected shear rheometers to study the time  dependent nonlinear rheological properties of well characterized  blends of linear polymers, and ideal, monodisperse, star and \"pom-  pom\" branched polymers.  The nonlinear data will be compared in  detail with newly developed theories.  Efforts to develop robust  methods for distinguishing mixtures of linear polymers from  branched polymers, using rheological methods alone will be   targeted.  %%%  Such research has powerful potential applications, since it could  turn rheometers into analytic instruments for determining polymer  MWD and LCB.  In addition, this GOALI research program is an  important educational tool, since it will bring graduate students  into close contact with a major commercial instrument developer,  and will require of them a thorough knowledge both of the most  powerful experimental tools and the most recent theoreticai ideas  in the field of polymer rheology.  ***",
