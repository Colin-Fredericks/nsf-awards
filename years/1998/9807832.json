This  collection, one of the largest in the world, houses over  55,000 samples of genetic material from terrestrial  vertebrates.  However, a large backlog of  uncatalogued  material (over 25,000 samples) has accumulated as a result  of several uncontrollable factors.  In addition, recent  changes in curatorial procedures, made in conjunction with  the modeling and development of a powerful new database  system, call for the integration and recataloguing of large  series of samples that are currently maintained in separate  collections.  Changes in MVZ staffing and curation of the  tissue collection will ensure that another backlog does not  accumulate and that regular operations of the collection are  maintained during and beyond the grant period.    This project will support the purchase of new equipment and  supplies for storage and organization of the collection, and  a full-time assistant for two years to complete the  following tasks:  (1) inventory the entire collection; (2)  cross-reference tissues to voucher specimens; (3) assign MVZ  catalog numbers to all samples; (4) label vials with the MVZ  number; (5) and reorganize and integrate all samples in the  collection.  The time frame for completion of the project is  based on detailed task analyses.    The proposed project is essential if data from the tissue  collection are to be integrated with those of the main  specimen collection in the museum-wide database system under  development.  Completion of the project will greatly improve  the availability of samples and associated data to the  national and international research communities.  Primary  and long-term benefits of this project include:  (1)  increased accessibility to over 25,000 samples that are now  uncatalogued and uncurated; (2) integration of all samples  of a give n taxon, thereby increasing retrievability; (3)  more accurate information regarding numbers and types of  samples of each taxon, and better tracking of use; (4) up-to-  date information on voucher specimens; (5) greater  efficiency in the processing of tissue grants and requests  for information; and (6) broader dissemination of data on  samples in the collection, including WWW access.  Providing  on-line accessibility to all MVZ specimen holdings and  associated data is a vital component of the Museum's long-  range plans.",
