It will involve, over the course of the project, parents, mentors, and community elements to create and expand a resource network and support primarily father-absent homes.   The design of the project is focused on providing resources and advocacy critical to the success of young children in SMT education.  It is a project designed to get parents actively involved with their children's science, mathematics, and technology education.  The program will serve Dade County, Florida families.  Museum staff and volunteers of BBBS will work closely in the development of mentor materials to be nationally distributed.  The strategies that are used and refined will be packaged in a Tripod Toolkit and Mentor Handbook that can be used by other community groups to aid and assist parents in becoming more active in the science, mathematics, and technology education of their children.  In addition to the toolkit materials, a set of Science/math Matters activities will be included designed to promoted science learning in the home with parents and their children.  These materials will be produced in both English and Spanish to meet the needs of a diverse and multicultural American society.",
