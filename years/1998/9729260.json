 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spanier  DMS 9729260      Monte Carlo & Quasi-Monte Carlo methods are very active and pervasively influential areas of applied mathematics in which highly sophisticated uses of mathematical modeling, simulation and probability theory are used to solve a wide variety of real-world problems not amenable to other solution methods. Conventional Monte Carlo methods provide tools for studying such problems on a computer, making use of probability theory and statistical error estimation. Quasi-Monte Carlo methods are essentially deterministic versions of Monte Carlo methods, based not on randomly chosen samples but carefully chosen deterministic nodal sets. Their analysis utilizes number theory, combinatorics, abstract algebra and even algebraic geometry. And in the past several years, exciting new hybrid methods, combining the best features of both stochastic and deterministic models, have been developed for application to many of the most difficult of today's problems.     The Third International Conference on Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods in Scientific Computing, to be held in Claremont, California June 22-26, 1998, will assess recent progress in Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo theory and address the application of these methods to a range of problems challenging scientists, engineers and economists today, problems arising in nuclear physics and engineering, semiconductor and computer modeling, cryptanalysis, oil exploration, and financial engineering - to name just a few important applications.",
