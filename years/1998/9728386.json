 "awd_abstract_narration": "DiNardo    Dr. DiNardo is investigating Drosophila spermatogenesis as a model stem cell system. He genetically identified a novel somatic signal that restricts proliferation of amplifying germ cells. In addition, he has shown that two known germline overproliferation mutants act autonomously in germ cells, regulating the same step as the somatic signal. These observations have revealed in outline the pathways regulating progression through germline stem cell lineages, in particular focussing on the transient amplifying cell population. He proposes to build on the initial studies by addressing how cells count division number, and to define further how these pathways relate to each other.    Specific Aim 1 Production of the somatic signal requires function of both punt and schnurri, two TGF-Beta-type signal transducers. Thus, activation of TGF-Beta signal transduction is necessary to restrict germ cell proliferation. He proposes to test whether activation of the TGF-Beta pathway in somatic cells is sufficient to restrict germ cell proliferation.    If so, this would suggest that the production of the initial TGF-Beta type ligand triggers cell counting. If not, this indicates that extrinsic signaling cooperates with other factors in coordinating division and differentiation. We continue to identify such factors next.    Specific Aim 2 Dr. DiNardo will continue saturating for germline overproliferation mutants.  In addition, he will test components representing known signaling pathways. He has found that rafis one candidate, and use it as an example demonstrating how we follow up prospective positives identified among other known pathways.    Specific Aim 3 Dr. DiNardo has defined the stage and lineage in which several genes are required, such as bag-of-marbles and benign gonial cell neoplasm, which act autonomously, schnurri and punt, which regulate a somatically-derived signal, and raf, which is dealt with in Aim #2. He will order these activities by genetic epistasis tests, deriving a testable mo lecular model.",
