 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Bakshi - 9733627    Efficient operation of chemical processes rely on the extraction of information about the process from measured data, the integration of various operations tasks, and engineers trained in advanced techniques for process operation.  Efficient operation also requires engineers trained in topics such as advanced process operation, statistical and stochastic modeling methods, communications and teamwork skills, and the capability to view a chemical process as an integrated system.  This CAREER award project strives to improve the efficiency of chemical process operations by integrated research and educational activities directed towards achieving these goals.    A new and general multiscale method will be developed for extracting empirical models from measured data.  This method will transform any linear or nonlinear empirical modeling method to a multiscale modeling method.  The multiscale modeling will be used to develop multiscale data rectification, process monitoring, and fault diagnosis techniques that perform better than existing methods.  The multiscale approach will allow efficient integration of these operations tasks, leading to better utilization of measured data, more efficient operation, and efficient computation for large-scale operation.  These methods will be applied to several practical examples in collaboration with various industries and federal laboratories.  This research represents an effort to develop a general approach for multiscale empirical modeling, most existing uses of wavelets are for multiscale analysis or stochastic modeling.    The results of the research will be disseminated via existing and new courses in the Chemical Engineering Department at Ohio State University, in industrial short courses, and may be included in a textbook on process operation.  New in-class and laboratory experiments and web-based resources will be developed for improved education in process operation.  Ways of improving students' communication and teamwork sk ills will also be studied. Modules will be developed to integrate the principles of process design and simulation across the curriculum, and to train chemical engineers to take a systems view of a process, as opposed to a unit operations view.                Abstract - Watkins - 9734177    The demands of present and future microelectronic and optoelectronic device fabrication place stringent requirements on metal deposition schemes.  These include high film purity, low temperatures and rapid, controllable deposition rates.  The PI postulates that these objectives can be met via Chemical Fluid Deposition (CFD), a new approach to metal deposition that involves the chemical or thermal reduction of soluble organometallic compounds in supercritical carbon dioxide at low temperatures (40-80oC) to yield continuous films on inorganic or organic substrates.    CFD exploits the unique, and adjustable, physicochemical properties of SCF solvents, which lie intermediate to those of liquids and gases, to circumvent the limitations of both vapor and liquid phase techniques.  In CFD, precursor transport and reduction occurs in solution at significantly lower temperatures and higher reagent concentrations than those of vapor phase techniques such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD).  While CFD is a solution-based process, the \"gas-like\" transport properties of the SCF and its miscibility with gaseous reducing agents such as hydrogen, render the process unencumbered by issues of poor mass transfer and poor deposition rates associated with liquid phase reductions.  Preliminary experiments demonstrate that high-purity, continuous platinum and palladium films can be deposited from SCF solution onto silicon wafers and other inorganic substrates at temperatures up to 170oC below those employed in CVD.    The research program will focus on the deposition of thin films from carbon dioxide solution by the hydrogenolysis of dimethylcyclooctadine platinum (II) and the deposition of copper films by reduction of copper(II)bis (hexafluoroacetylacetone) and copper(II)bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate).  The precursors were chosen to facilitate a direct comparison of film quality and reduction kinetics in CFD to those of existing techniques and the potential utility of the metal deposits in microelectronics copper and catalytic platinum devices.    The educational portion of the work are to: (1) train graduate students who will work at the interface of engineering and materials chemistry, (2) provide undergraduates with opportunities for research experience, (3) develop a two-course series in materials processing that addresses the interests of students and is reinforced by the expanding materials research efforts in the Department of Chemical Engineering, and (4) incorporate research problems and active learning principles into the classroom and assist in the implementation of interactive teaching tools across the curriculum.",
