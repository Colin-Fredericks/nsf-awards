This is a collaborative research project involving   investigators from several academic research institutions.    The research is being conducted under the auspices of the   NSF Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP) program and the NOAA   Coastal Ocean Program.  This collaborative,   interdisciplinary 5-year research program will entail an   integrated program of field and laboratory studies and   mathematical modeling to quantify the role of coastal   currents and thermal fronts in mediating cross-margin   transport in Lake Superior.      The western shore of Lake Superior's Keweenaw Peninsula   exhibits a dramatic coastal jet known as the Keweenaw   Current.  A strong, shore-parallel density front, the   thermal bar, also is characteristic of this region and   persists long into the summer. The goal of the proposed work   is to determine the physical, chemical, and biological   effects that arise from the intense physical forcing on this   system, and specifically, to elucidate how these effects   interact temporally and spatially to define distinct   nearshore and offshore environments in Lake Superior.  This   project represents the first effort to model coupled   physical, chemical, and biological processes in the coastal   zone of Lake Superior where both vertical and horizontal   thermal structure and transport processes are important.    The research team is divided into three subgroups: Physical   Processes, Chemical Gradients, and Biological Communities.    The Physical Processes group will examine the relative   importance of all forcing factors (e.g., wind-driven   variability, baroclinic instability) that govern cross   margin transport using in situ observations, numerical   modeling, and satellite observations.  The Chemical   Gradients group will characterize nearshore-offshore   differences in distributions of chemical species, eval uate   chemical tracers of water and sediment movement, and   investigate differences (inshore vs. offshore) in chemical   cycles induced by the current.  The Biological Communities   group will determine how gradients in primary production,   trophic structure, and rates of material transformation   develop. All three groups will interact closely throughout   the project to obtain and share complementary data sets and   to derive a coupled physical/chemical/biological model of   the system.  The detailed, process-level understanding   achieved by this project will advance our quantitative   understanding of the processes that regulate the transport,   transformation and fate of biologically, chemically and   geologically important matter in coastal regions and provide   a firm basis for future management decisions on how best to   preserve the pristine nature of Lake Superior.        The basic objective of this component of the Project is to   better understand and model the dynamics of sediments off   the Keweenaw Peninsula. The field program will focus on   factors controlling the movement of solids along the   Peninsula as well as processes which carry solids from   shallower to deeper waters of the lake. Processes to be   examined include storm-induced currents, surface and   internal wave motions, variations in the strength of the   Keweenaw current and instabilities of the Keweenaw current.   Special attention will be given to the influence of thermal   bar circulation. The study will also include an   investigation of small-scale processes influencing sediment   resuspension and motion in the bottom boundary layer. A   modeling effort will build on the findings of the field   observations in developing a 3-D model of fine sediment   transport. Also to be addressed as part of our modeling   program are issues of how settling particles become   incorporated into the bottom, and how sediment movement   influence the long-term fluxes and distribution of   constituents within the lake.",
