 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802620  Friedman  This award provides partial support for the fifth in a  series of specialized international meetings that began in  1983 at the Huachung Uiversity of Science and Technology,  Peoples Republic of China. Beginning with the first  conference the leadership group has been composed of world  class researchers and educators in biomechanics. The fifth  meeting adds to the legacy. It will be held in Sendai, Japan  August 9-13, 1998.    NSF provided travel support for all of the four previous  meetings in this series. U.S. participation in the  conference is arranged by the U.S. National Committee on  Biomechanics (USNCB), now chaired by the principal  investigator, Dr. Morton H. Friedman. The meetings have  provided an excellent forum for person-to-person information  exchange that could lead to future collaborative research  projects.    Two publications are to result from the meeting (a book of  abstracts and a permanent hard-cover book) and partial  travel support is to be given to (15) young investigators,  thereby providing an opportunity for them to confer with  leading international investigators in biomechanics. Each  recipient of support is to submit a report to the National  Science Foundation Division of Bioengineering and  Environmental Systems on the collaborations discussed or  arranged during the conference, and one copy of all  publications resulting from the conference is to be included  as part of the Final Report of the project.  ***",
