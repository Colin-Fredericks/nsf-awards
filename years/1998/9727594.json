The purpose of\r\nthe conference was to bring together researchers working in all strands of\r\nlow-dimensional topology and to enable them to gain an overall perspective\r\non developments in the field.  Recent years have seen exciting new\r\ndevelopments in the study of 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds and knot\r\ntheory.  Bringing researchers in these fields together encouraged a\r\ncross-fertilization of ideas and techniques, exposed graduate students\r\nto these ideas, and encouraged new collaborations.  The conference took\r\nplace one year after the end of a closely related year-long program at\r\nM.S.R.I.  Thus it was natural to review how progress had been\r\nconsolidated in this area over the ensuing year, and an added benefit of\r\nthe conference was to expose this progress to the wider mathematical\r\ncommunity.  Approximately 150 mathematicians attended the conference,\r\nmore than 50 of them graduate students.  Some talks were tailored\r\nspecifically for these students.\r\n     Topology addresses those geometric properties that depend only on\r\ncontinuity, i.e., on the notion of one point being close to another, but\r\ndisregards the stock in trade of high school geometry, measurement of\r\nquantities such as distance, angle, area, volume, and so forth.  Topology\r\nof the plane is often referred to in popular scientific literature as\r\nrubber sheet geometry, and this captures the essential spirit of the\r\ndiscipline without giving so much as a hint of the techniques topologists\r\nmight use in their science.  They confront some very basic but elusive\r\nproperties, those that remain after rigidity has been exorcised, and the\r\npast century has seen the gradual assembly of a considerable arsenal of\r\nweapons for dealing with these properties.  Low-dimensional topology,\r\nmainly the topology of 3- and 4-dimensional geometric objects, presents\r\nspecial problems of its own, for while we have the intuition that we\r\nshould be able to apprehend these object more readily, living as we do in\r\n3-dimensional space and 4-dimensional space-time, in fact much of the\r\nalgebraic machinery that has been developed for topology fails in these\r\nlower dimensions.  Recent years have seen some remarkable advances on this\r\nfront too, and this was the central theme of the conference at M.S.R.I. in\r\nMay.  It is also noteworthy that low-dimensional topology has become\r\nsufficiently highly developed to be useful, for example, in applications\r\nof knot theory to polymer chemistry and to the study of DNA.  As this field\r\ncontinues to progress, the immediacy of the objects with which it deals is\r\nlikely to lead its further technical advances to find equally natural\r\napplications in the real world.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
