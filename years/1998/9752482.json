 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer science educators across the nation are struggling to keep abreast of advances in research, technology, and pedagogy.  Knowledge of such advances is critical in developing and maintaining relevant curricula.  Access to information related to degree programs, curricula, faculty, and students will be extremely useful in planning and implementing course and curriculum developments.  Currently, there is no organized communication among institutions on issues related to curricula, pedagogy, or infrastructure.  Consequently, due to lack of information sharing, many departments \"reinvent the wheel\" by working to solve problems already addressed by others or working to solve problems without access to supporting information.    The primary goal of this project is to provide an easily accessible information resource for departments offering undergraduate computer science degree programs.  This resource will (a) facilitate the sharing and communication of information among departments, (b) provide information that can be used to monitor, compare, and assess programs in terms of curriculum issues, faculty composition, faculty work loads, student enrollment, and graduation rates, and (c) provide supporting information to be used in planning and implementing course and curriculum developments and overall program enhancements.",
