 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714605  Seible  Advanced composite materials such as carbon, aramid, or  glass fibers in polymer matrices, such as epoxies,  vinylesters and polyesters, have shown outstanding  mechanical and chemical characteristics to be of great  interest to civil engineering design and construction.    Recent developments in manufacturing technologies and the  need for new and more durable materials for rehabilitation  of existing civil structural systems and renewal  requirements of the aging building and bridge inventory have  shown that the light weight of these polymer matrix  composites can be cost-effectively employed, particularly in  the seismic retrofitting of buildings and bridges.    A concept which emerges from this combination of  conventional civil construction materials, and for the civil  engineering sector new polymer matrix composites (PMCs),  is  that of concrete filled composite tubes (CCTs), where the  concrete takes on the compression force transfer and the  carbon shell the functions of (1) formwork for the concrete,  (2) confinement of the concrete, and (3) tension force  transfer in both longitudinal bending and shear.  The thin  advanced composite tubes and stabilized against local  instabilities by the infill  concrete which can be pressure  grouted and contain normal or lightweight aggregates.    The research aims to systematically develop the basis for a  new framing system made of filament wound hybrid  glass/carbon tubes and filled on-site fully or partially  with concrete.  The research focus will be in three areas  namely, (1) the analytical modeling and characterization of  the fully and partially grouted advanced composite tube  system and the proposed connections, (2) development of  optimized hybrid schemes and fabrication techniques,  and  (3) the experimental full-scale validation of CCT beams and  connections.    The analytical models will be calibrated and verified by the  test  results and used for subsequent parametric studies to  form the basis for general design  model developments for  concrete filled advanced composite tube framing systems.  ***",
