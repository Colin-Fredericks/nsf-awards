The current project is concerned\r\nparticularly with three inter-related classes of problems and aims at\r\nelucidating their intrinsic structure as well as computation of significant\r\napplications:\r\n (I) homotopy associative differential graded algebras and Lie and\r\ncommutative analogs, particularly as they occur in various physical\r\nfield theories,\r\n (II) the homological aspects of Lagrangian and more general exterior\r\ndifferential systems, both classical and quantum, as embodied in the\r\nanti-field formalism of Batalin-Vilkovisky and its generalizations,\r\n (III) deformation theory as giving rise to higher homotopy algebra and\r\nas applied to physical systems.  Specific applications are projected\r\nto the problems of higher spin particles and of mixed open-closed\r\nstring field theory.\r\n     Cohomological physics refers to that part of mathematical physics,\r\nprimarily gauge and other field theories, in which a variety of cohomological\r\ntechniques are seeing increasing application.  Recently, further development\r\nof these techniques within the physical context has begun to have an effect\r\non more purely mathematical research, for example, providing new applications\r\nof the existing theory of ``higher dimensional algebra'' for which\r\n1-dimensional diagrams are inadequate.  Although defined in greater and more\r\nabstract generality, such structures, as they occur in or are inspired by\r\nmathematical physics, are the focus of this research.  The results should\r\naid in deeper understanding of the mathematical structures essential to the\r\nphysics (especially of higher spin particles and of mixed open-closed string\r\nfield theory) and of the inter-relation of physical and mathematical\r\nconcepts.  The results should also be of independent mathematical importance.\r\n***\r\n",
