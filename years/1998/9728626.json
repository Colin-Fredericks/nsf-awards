 "awd_abstract_narration": "Species of Aphytis wasps are among the most important  parasitoids of armored scale insects (Homoptera:  Diaspididae).  Many of the species used in classical and  augmentative biological control programs around the world,  including type and important voucher material, are  represented in collections of the University of California,  Riverside (UCR).  Because of their minute size, these wasps  are generally ignored by collectors and are not accumulated  in most insect collections.  The UCR collection includes ca.  30,000 specimens of Aphytis mounted on ca. 5,000 slides. The  majority of these specimens (28,224) are mounted in a  temporary, water soluble medium (Hoyer's) on 4,380 slides. A  significant number of these mounts are now in various stages  of decay.  Many specimens, including numerous type  specimens, have already been damaged.  It is urgent to  protect the collection by transferring a significant portion  to Canada balsam, a permanent medium better suited for  preserving specimens in taxonomically significant  collections of micro-Hymenoptera.  Specimens also must be  mounted individually and properly labeled. Currently, the  majority of the material is mounted with an average of 6.67  specimens per slide. sometimes with more than one species  per slide, and labeled very poorly.  This project will  support the remediation, and curation of the collection of  Aphytis at UCR.    The UCR collection of Aphytis formed the basis for a world  taxonomic revision of the genus by David Rosen and Paul  DeBach in 1979.  The monograph was based almost entirely on  the UCR collection of Aphytis, and because of this, it is an  invaluable resource for basic and applied scientists.  The  UCR collection of Aphytis is almost entirely composed of  reared and slide-mounted specimens collected from 74  different countries and territories over the last 70 years.  The magnitude and scope of the collection make it  irreplaceable.  Its revitalization will stabilize the  existing collection and stimulate additi onal taxonomic  studies of this important genus.",
