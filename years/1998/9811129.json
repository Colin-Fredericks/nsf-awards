 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to identify factors that contribute to the ease with which the same information can be effectively presented by a computer system in either written or spoken language.  Advances in computer technology lead to the prospect that in the near future linguistic messages could be automatically converted from text to speech or from speech to text.  This project will test the efficacy of strategies both for converting written language to spoken language, using text-to-speech synthesis systems, and for converting spoken language into written language.  It will also assess the degree to which user control of spoken-language presentation can enhance understanding of computer-based spoken messages by providing the auditory equivalent of rereading and scanning ahead.  Having the same message available in either spoken or written language would greatly enhance access to information technology when reading is impossible (because of the situation or because an individual has vision problems or limited literacy) or when understanding spoken language is impossible (because a situation requires quiet or because an individual has hearing deficits).  The results of the project will help to enhance the everyday use of computer technology, especially for individuals with impairments of hearing or vision.\r\n\r\n",
