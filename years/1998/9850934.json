 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern molecular spectroscopy and micro-analysis experiments recently developed at UCF (Am. J. Phys. 62, 429-434 (1994)) will be introduced into the intermediate and advanced undergraduate laboratories. Undergraduate students are learning skills such as materials characterization by micro-Raman spectroscopy which will give them useful knowledge in preparing them for graduate school or entering the job market. They are taking advantage of the technological revolution that has taken place in this field during the past decade making small, low-cost, high-throughput instruments possible. These experiments fit very well into the undergraduate curriculum since they allow the students to investigate basic physics phenomena as well as many useful applications.  The laboratory is equipped with a Raman spectrometer employing solid state laser excitation and a microscope attachment. In the intermediate lab the students have hands-on experience with absorption, emission and fluorescence using multichannel detection. Experiments in the advanced laboratory focus on Raman spectroscopy and microanalysis of materials. The choice of laser crystals and diamond films as examples illustrate ways that physics can be applied to relevant topical issues. The new instrumentation are also being used in undergraduate research projects and demonstrations. This allows students to investigate concepts in current materials spectroscopy. As a result of this program students have an improved understanding of spectroscopic instrumentation and should become highly employable in the large laser and electro-optics industry that is evolving in the Central Florida region.",
