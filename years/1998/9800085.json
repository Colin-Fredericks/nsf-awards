 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main focus of this proposal is on \"pattern matching\", the  identifying of an object, called the \"pattern\", in a larger body,  often called the `text\".  The pattern might be a DNA sequence and  the text a (large) collection of DNA sequences.  While it is  fairly well understood how to find exact matches of an object,  finding similar instances of an object is not as well understood,  or at least it is not known how to find them nearly as  efficiently.  Further, it is natural to suppose that this task  can be carried out progressively more efficiently the greater the  similarity between the objects being matched.  But, by and large,  achieving this remains problematic.  The aim of this project is  to develop methods whose efficiency improves in tandem with  increased similarity.  Motivating problems include the already  mentioned DNA matching, matching of words or phrases in bodies of  text, and matching of objects in images.  A secondary focus for  this proposal is the study of network switches; more  specifically, the devising of methods for sending (routing)  messages and designs for facilitating such routings.",
