 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731733  Chopra    This is a study of NiO-Co-Cu-based \"giant\" magnetoresistive  magnetic multilayers in spin valve configuration, deposited  by dc-magnetron sputtering.  The goal is to employ  surfactants to control elementary film deposition steps at  the atomic level in order to modify the nature of interfaces  and film morphology.  This approach should result in basic  understanding of the structure sensitivity of the magneto-  transport properties in these layered systems.  Deposition  of a suitable number of layers of a surfactant on a given  layer of a multilayer should alter the balance between  surface and interface energies.  The potential surfactant  species (Ag, As, Sn, Sb, and Pb) are soft metals having  large atomic volumes, properties that favor their \"floating\"  out to the surface during over-layer growth and leaving  behind intact layers with smooth interfaces less prone to  intermixing.  Surfactant assisted evolution of surface  topography with respect to surfactant-free spin valves is  studied at different stages of film growth in-situ and ex-  situ (using scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force  microscopy).  Surface segregation of surfactants is  monitored by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  Magnetic  properties, domain structures and wall transition in applied  field are measured.  %%%  Artificially modulated magnetic multilayers comprised of  magnetic and non-magnetic films are the subjects of intense  research.  These systems have potential device applications  as magneto-optical storage materials using multilayers with  perpendicular anisotropy and as next-generation read-heads  for high-density storage.  ***",
