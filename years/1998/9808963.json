University of New Hampshire  Title: Holocene Climate Variability    With the successful completion of deep drilling at Summit Greenland  there is now a well-dated, high resolution, multi-parameter record  of climate change for the Northern Hemisphere that covers the last  glacial cycle.  The GISP2 record reveals evidence of rapid and  dramatic change in climate.  Recent examination of the Holocene  portion of the Greenland record has demonstrated that, while  relatively stable by comparison with glacial age climate, the  Holocene contains subdued versions of glacial age millennial scale  rapid climate change events.  The Holocene record is characterized  by significant annual to centennial scale variability plus  significant and complex forcing and response histories.   Understanding Holocene climate is essential to the differentiation  of natural versus anthropogenic climate response and forcing and to  any prediction of future climate.  This award supports an  investigation designed to refine and expand our knowledge of the  Holocene GISP2 glaciochemical record and to utilize several other  existing paleoclimate records (e.g., ice core, marine sediments)  for comparison.  The primary analytical emphasis is the production  of ultra-high resolution major ion series (chloride, nitrate   sulfate, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium and ammonium) and  MSA.  These represent >95% of the soluble ions in the atmosphere  and can be used: (1) to develop environmental records (e.g.,  volcanic history, marine and continental biogenic source  productivity); (2) in the reconstruction of atmospheric circulation  systems and (3) to develop more precise dating of existing ice core  records.  This study will add a new dimension to the classic stable  isotope-temperature reconstruction of climate by defining, through  the examination of glaciochemical series, complementary measures of  variability in atmospheric circulation.",
