 "awd_abstract_narration": "9730634  Stacy    Living by Chemistry is a modular high school course to promote change in teacher practice and increase in student science literacy by embedding the concepts of inquiry-based chemistry in meaningful contexts.  The six modules, focusing on a life theme, are diagnosing disease, the sense of taste, enzyme reactions, breathing, blood chemistry, and energy from food.  The first two modules focus on bonds between atoms; the next three modules focus on how arrangements of atoms change in transformations; the last module focuses on using energy concepts to predict chemical and physical changes.  The multidisciplinary context can engage a diverse set of students.  The core content addresses the National Science Education Standards and the Project 2061 Benchmarks.  The science processes emphasize learning science the way science is done.  Students ask questions, provide initial ideas, gather data and refine the ideas.  Initially, the instructor models the thought processes of scientists and guides the investigations that model the nature of science.  In later modules, students ask their own questions, design experiments to answer them and monitor their own understanding.  The assessment measures conceptual understanding, model generation and refinement, and experimental design.  Teachers are involved in the development and testing of the materials.  Dissemination is by commercial publication.  Products include a CDROM and print materials.",
