 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the development of new synthetic methodologies   for the synthesis of novel mesoscopic molecular architectures that serve   as scaffolds for very-high-spin polyradicals, and the experimental and   computational characterization of the polyradicals.   The principles of   fractal geometry will be applied to achieve connectivities differing    from those obtainable with the current dendritic approach.   MNDO, EHT   and MM3 molecular calculations of the electronic structure of these, and   mesoscopic systems possessing chiral pi-conjugated systems, will be   correlated with measurements of the magnetic and electronic properties of   the two- and three-dimensional polyradicals to achieve spin-coupled   organic magnets with high Curie temperatures.   Graduate and postdoctoral   students carrying out the experiments will be trained in the synthesis of   molecules of mesoscopic dimensions, and the experimental and theoretical   characterization of their electronic properties.  With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the   Advanced Materials Program support the educational and research   activities of Dr. Andrzej Rajca of the Chemistry Department at the   University of Nebraska.   Dr. Rajca will focus his research efforts on   developing synthetic routes to relatively large molecules, referred to as   mesoscopic molecules.   These multi-dimensional molecules serve as   scaffolds for a relatively large number of sites possessing an unpaired   electron, and are key intermediates in the development of organic   magnets.   Dr. Rajca will correlate the magnetic properties of these   mesoscopic molecules with theoretical analyses to achieve organic   materials that exhibit room temperature magnetic properties.   Dr.   Rajca's educational activities involve training graduate and postdoctoral   students in the synthetic methodology needed to achieve molecules of   mesoscopic dimensions, and their experimental and theoretical   characterization.",
