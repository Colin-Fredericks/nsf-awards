 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enhance the stability, reliability  and efficiency of a new computational tool, the self-  correcting geometry (SECODG) method for combined assignment  of NMR spectra and 3D structure calculation.  The SECODG  method implemented in the DIAMOD/NOAH software package  dramatically reduces the time to generate protein structures  from NMR data.  Unlike previous distance geometry methods,  which were designed for consistent data sets, the method can  generate accurate structures from sets of constraints that  contain errors.  This project will further improve this  method to be applicable for larger proteins.       Several tests have demonstrated that the present method  can deal with real data and is significantly faster than  manual interactive spectral interpretation methods.  The  first test was to compare the results of automatic structure  calculation from NOESY spectra that had been analyzed by  earlier manual methods for 6 proteins ranging in size from  40 to 135 amino acids.  The automated method assigned 70-80%  of the NOESY cross peaks and the three-dimensional  structures were of similar quality.  In a second test,  previously uninterpreted NOESY and TOCSY spectra were used  by NOAH/DIAMOD to automatically calculate a 3D structure  bundle for an isoform of crambin.  Slight modifications and  some manual assistance were required so that the program  could deal with a significant number of missing chemical  shifts.  Based on this practical experience, the method will  be improved by optimizing the error-tolerant target  function, incorporating sensitivity tests for constraints,  including line shape information in the peak assignment  method and interfacing the program suite with programs for  automated sequential assignment from other groups to develop  a completely automatic computational package for direct  interpretation of NMR spectra.       This program package will be a powerful computational  tool to speed up macromolecular structure determination from  NMR da ta.  Experimentally determined three-dimensional  structures are the basis for designing new drugs and  proteins with improved or new functions.  In combination  with energy minimization and Monte Carlo simulations, it  will help in designing proteins with a desired structure and  new functional properties.",
