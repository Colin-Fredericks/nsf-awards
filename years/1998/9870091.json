Thomas Beale    Abstract     The purpose of the proposed work is to analyze the errors in  numerical methods for the time-dependent motion of water waves,  to design improved methods, and to verify the reliability of the  proposed methods with error estimates, convergence proofs, and  computational tests.  The methods of interest are called boundary  integral methods.  They have been widely used in ocean engineering  as well as in applied mathematics.  The motion of the water surface  is tracked by markers representing material particles which are moved  according to a velocity field computed from quantities on the surface.    The velocity is expressed in terms of singular integrals, since the  governing equations are formulated through potential theory.  The  evolution has the character of nonlinear, nonlocal wave motion on  the boundary.  Numerical instabilities have long been observed in  such methods, but analysis of the two-dimensional case has shown  that they can be ruled out by proper design.  The first goal of the  proposed research is to develop stable, convergent numerical methods  for the simulation of exact, time-dependent, three-dimensional water  wave motion which is periodic in the horizontal directions.  Thus the  full nonlinear motion will be dealt with, but interactions with solid  objects will be neglected.  The method of calculation of the singular  integrals is a primary issue, one which may have relevance to other  problems.  A second goal is to deal with the errors from edges where  a solid object meets the water surface.    Practical predictions of the motion of fluids and solids  are often made by numerical solution of the equations  which express the basic physical laws of the motion.  Methods of the type studied here have been used in  ocean engineering in order to predict the motion of  large water waves, the interaction of water waves with  ships or stationary objects, and the force exerted by  a wave on a wall or object.  Calculations of these probl ems  and others have encountered numerical instabilities; that is,  because of the numerical approximation, small scales may  grow in a way unrelated to the physical problem.  Mathematical analysis can be used to understand such  errors and to design improved methods.  Previous  work for two-dimensional waves (those not varying in  the third direction) has identified the sources of errors  for this special case.  The purpose of the present  work is to carry out such analysis in more  difficult and realistic cases where the sources of  errors are likely to be more serious.  It is hoped that  improvements in the numerical methods could contribute  to reliable predictions of water wave motion.",
