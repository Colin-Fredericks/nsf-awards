 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726597  Alivisatos    This FRG/GOALI project is multidisciplinary, involving elements  of Chemistry, Physics, Engineering and Materials Science.  Professors A. Paul Alivisatos and James R. Heath at UCB and UCLA,  respectively, are collaborating with R. Stanley Williams at  Hewlett-Packard Laboratories. The aim of the project is to lay  the groundwork for the demonstration and the development of  nanocrystal(NC) and nanocrystal array(NCA) based devices by first  developing techniques for synthesis of NC-based thin films  appropriate for device applications, and by understanding and  optimizing the properties of NC/x interfaces. A variety of  potential applications, ranging from phosphors to photovoltaics  to electronic switching and storage devices, are envisioned for  these materials. The approach involves two aspects. The first is  the development of techniques for integrating  nanocrystals and  nanocrystal assemblies into technologically relevant  environments. The second is the development of a physical picture  of how the integrated systems operate. Chemical techniques for  fabricating nanocrystal integrated systems and examining their  structural characteristics will be developed. Their optical  properties will be interrogated with time and frequency resolved  spectroscopies. Temperature dependent electron transport,  photovoltaic, and capacitance measurements through integrated NC  and NCA systems will be carried out using contacts produced by  electron-beam lithography. Particular effort will be spent on  controlling and characterizing the interfaces in these various  systems. The project is co-supported by four NSF programs, and  the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities).  %%%  This project addresses forefront research issues in an  interdisciplinary area of science and engineering having high  technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic  knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of  materials and devices, and will provide improved understanding   and a basis for designing and producing improved materials and  structures for devices of the future.  An important feature of  the program is the integration of research and education through  the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically  significant area.  ***",
