 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this three-year project is to create a model program that targets students with  disabilities from middle school through graduate school to increase the number studying  science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET).  The project will promote  educational opportunities for SMET middle school, high school, and university students with  physical disabilities through various approaches.  To achieve both academic and professional  success, these individuals will require the removal of architectural, technological, and  societal barriers that presently exist.  This project has the following objectives:  To increase  the proportion of the middle school students with physical disabilities throughout Arizona  who will pursue SMET subjects for college preparation when they become high school  students.       To increase the proportion of the high school students with physical disabilities who will     pursue SMET subjects when they become college students.     To increase the proportion of the college undergraduate students with physical disabilities     who will pursue SMET subjects when they become graduate students to establish a     mentoring and role model system between SMET middle and high school students,     college students, and SMET professionals in industry and in education, all with physical     disabilities.      To educate school teachers and college faculty--particularly international faculty and     teaching assistants--peers, co-workers, and parents, resulting in the elimination of     stereotyping and the encouragement of self-esteem among students with disabilities.     To assess existing SMET laboratories at the University of Arizona (UA) with a view to     transforming them into barrier free environments allowing full access to all equipment     contained therein.    Their approach consists of eight interrelated components:  1.  Middle/High School Student Outreach.  This component is designed to increase the  interest in SMET fields by middle and high school s tudents with disabilities.  It is  accomplished through mentoring by current UA SMET students with disabilities and faculty,  who travel to schools throughout the state meeting with students.    2.  Middle/High School Counselor/Teacher Training Workshops.  UA will host workshops  for school counselors and teachers focusing on strategies to encourage students with  disabilities to pursue a career in a SMET field.  The two -hour workshops will be conducted  by UA SMET faculty and UA students who are physically disabled.    3.  Encouragement grants.  We will award 15 grants, of $ 1,500 each, through a competitive  process to science/math teachers who attended the workshops for middle/high school teachers  and counselors.  These grants will encourage the design of projects to promote continued  study in SMET among students with physical disabilities.    4.  Summer Institute.  This is a five-week long summer institute held at UA for 15 middle  school students with physical disabilities.  Topics will be drawn from Biology, Chemistry,  Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, and Physics.    5.  Mentoring Undergraduates.  At UA, SMET graduate students with physical disabilities  will mentor SMET undergraduates with physical disabilities.    6.  Industry Outreach.  We will establish contacts and match professionals with physical  disabilities in industry and education with middle school, high school, undergraduate, and  graduate students with disabilities.    7.  Lab Facilities Survey. Assessments of existing UA SMET laboratory facilities will be  performed and changes needed to make each laboratory barrier free will be specified.    8.  Faculty Development Workshops.  Workshops for UA faculty and Graduate Teaching  Assistants will be held on disability awareness and alternative teaching methods.",
