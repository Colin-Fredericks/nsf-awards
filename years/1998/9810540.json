 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810540  Mileham   This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will develop a bioreceptive film to endotoxin and demonstrate its response by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  Airborne endotoxin has been identified as a major health hazard in many agricultural  and industrial settings.  Exposure to airborne endotoxin is related to organic dust toxic syndrome, chronic bronchitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, mucousal membrane irritation, and reduced lung capacity.  An endotoxin sensor that incorporates a highly selective bioreceptive film with a highly sensitive microsensor could provide the high selectivity and sensitivity needed for  in-situ detection.  This will require the selective capture of airborne endotoxin by use of a specific non-covalent reaction, such as ionic or hydrophobic binding. The Phase II work will measure airborne endotoxin with  an acoustic microsensor, or other sensor platform, in a prototype system.  The proposed technique is a significant technological innovation, since a method for rapid, on-site detection of airborne endotoxin has not been developed.          A biosensor to detect airborne endotoxin will have commercial applications to protect human health in many areas including livestock confinement and processing facilities (swine, poultry, dairy), produce storage and processing facilities, cotton processing facilities, waste management  facilities, and air quality monitoring of office buildings.  Since endotoxin also represents a threat to the health of livestock, particularly swine and poultry, the animal/veterinary sciences market is also expected to be significant.",
