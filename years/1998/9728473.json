 "awd_abstract_narration": "Genetic studies can reveal biological mechanisms that underlie behavior.  Particular success has come from using the fruitfly, Drosophila, as a model system with a well-studied genome.  Several mutant strains have been isolated that affect the olfactory system.  A recent discovery has been of the mutant called 'dare', because these flies are 'defective in avoidance of repellents.'  It is now known that the mutant gene is in an enzyme involved in a crucial step in converting cholesterol to certain steroid hormones.  This project uses molecular genetic techniques to examine how the olfactory behavioral deficits might result from defective developmental changes, since insect metamorphosis depends on a class of compounds called ecdysteroids, or whether there is a more direct effect of ecdysteroid hormones on olfactory function.  Manipulation of the gene itself, and study of spatial and temporal expression of the dare gene will show how the involvement of this gene in hormone biosynthesis may affect adult olfactory function.\r\n   Results will be important beyond olfactory sensory science, to include developmental and neuroendocrinological understanding of the interplay of genes during development, and the role of hormones in nervous system function and behavior.\r\n",
