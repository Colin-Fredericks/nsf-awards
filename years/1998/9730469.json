It is based upon engineering design projects previously developed and tested.  \"Design-under-constraint\" challenges, in which students creatively optimize the functioning of existing devices and processes, are alternatives to traditional and discovery-based experiments.  The challenges have been found to significantly change students' science process skills and change their preconceptions.  The course addresses the physical science content standards of the science standards through challenges in the construction of batteries, bridges, electromagnets, solar heating and a gravity car.  Each challenge begins with student construction of a standard device.  The students are challenged to optimize the performance of a variable that has a large range.  The construction takes little time and the outcome is tested publicly.  Students are asked to predict results of trials and explain the outcomes.  Teachers are involved in the development and testing of the materials.  The materials are distributed commercially.",
