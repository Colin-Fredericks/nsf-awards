 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1961, the National Academy of Science (NAS) created a   committee, that eventually evolved to become the Committee on   Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPUP). COSEPUP was   intended to assist the NAS President and Council in their roles   of advising the government at the highest levels on policy   matters related to U.S. science and technology. The NSF has   supported COSEPUP from its onset. Formally, COSEPUP is charged   with the responsibility  to deliberate on initiatives for new   studies in the area of science and technology policy, taking   especially into account the concerns and requests of the   President s Science Advisor, the Director of the NSF, the   Chairman of the National Science Board, and the chairmen of key   science and technology-related committees of the Congress .   COSEPUP undertakes major independent studies of national issues   in U.S. science and technology policy. In recent years, for   example, it has conducted prominent studies on NSF s Science and   Technology Centers, graduate education in science and   engineering, policy goals for science and technology, and   recruitment and retention of Presidential appointees. In   addition, it has developed a number of guidance manuals on   science and engineering for students and faculty on responsible   conduct of research, careers in science and engineering, and   mentoring of students in science and engineering. COSEPUP also   hosts workshops and convocations to encourage dialogue on key   science and technology policy issues such as the recent   Convocation on Doctoral Science and Engineering Education which   was cosponsored by many disciplinary societies and university   organizations.",
