One  critically involved neurochemical is the biogenic amine serotonin  (5-HT), which modulates affect and arousal in vertebrates and  invertebrates alike. In a simple and accessible model system, 5-HT  stimulates readiness to feed acting in the feeding motor network  to enhance specific aspects of neuron excitability. Evidence  suggests that 5-HT stimulates production of nitric oxide (NO), a  critical modulator of neural activity in many animals. This  proposal outlines plans to elucidate the role and mechanisms of  action of 5-HT in regulating the enzyme that makes NO, and thereby  hunger/satiation state. These studies combine behavioral and  electrical measures with analysis of 5-HT and NO-related chemical  compounds in single cells. These studies approach the basic  organization of the feedback loops regulating nutritional  homeostasis in all motile animals and can lead to a fuller  understanding of mechanisms of hunger/satiation. They relate  directly to health issues of weight-control in anorexia and  obesity. Knowledge of these factors is likely to be significant to  the development of autonomous robots capable of making least-  probable-error decisions in a noisy environment, and to the  evolution of artificial intelligence for whose optimal function  motivation-based processes can provide the critical regulation of  goal related activity, just as they do in real intelligence  systems.",
