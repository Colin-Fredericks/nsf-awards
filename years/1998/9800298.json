 "awd_abstract_narration": "RASEM (Regional Alliance of Science, Engineering and Mathematics) for students with  disabilities is an alliance of 21 two- and four-year universities or community colleges in New  Mexico, West Texas, and Oklahoma.  Affiliate partners include the New Mexico Department  of Education, Region 19 Special Education in El Paso, Las Cruces Public Schools, Los Alamos  National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico Commission for the Blind, and  the New Mexico Department of Vocational Rehabilitation.  Broad in scope, RASEM has initiated  multiple projects to alleviate the lack of representation in SMET by students with disabilities in  the RASEM geographic area.    RASEM projects with elementary, secondary, and college components reach out to students with  disabilities of all ages.  Typical outreach projects include Netsurf at New Mexico State  University (NMSU) which excites middle and high school students with Web page computer  experiences; the Children's College at UNM/Los Alamos which touches 5th and 6th graders with  hands-on science experiences; and the Din  Community College which brings two weeks of  science fun to middle school Navajo students.  Teacher workshops conducted by Region 19  reinforce inclusion and promote bridging of high school students into college through cooperation  between special and general education teachers.  MAVIS, a project in the NMSU Math  Department, is working to be able to quickly and effectively translate classroom and other math  documents into Nemeth braille.  Teacher mini-grants have allowed teachers throughout the three-  state region to bring enthusiasm for math and science to their students with disabilities through  creative school activities and field trips.  The projects mentioned are not inclusive but give a  flavor of the intent and impact of RASEM.    In the two plus years of its existence, RASEM has made itself known throughout our region.   Comments from students, teachers and others have assured us that RASEM has made a critical  dif ference.  RASEM has sown the seeds of science excitement in the Southwest and the crop is  now being cultivated.  Further support from NSF and the community at large will assure that  the RASEM efforts will come to fruition.",
