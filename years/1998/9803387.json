The        principal investigator is Dr. Jian Ma at Amherst College. The         research project  delineates specific studies to develop a set of        experimental and modeling tools to characterize porous media. The        project consists of a series of adsorption-desorption isohterm and        dynamic measurements on a variety of porous materials that have        different intrinsic pore geometries and network structures. The        measurements are complemented by computer modeling.               Porous materials are ubiquitous and have diverse applications in        chemical processes. Despite extensive efforts, a comprehensive        understanding of the correlation between pore structure and adsorption        behavior has been lacking, due to the complexity of porous materials.        Given the significant advancement in statistical mechanics and the        tremendous improvement in computing power in the last decade, it is        timely to develop a package of experimental/modeling tools to        characterize porous solids. Such fundamental understanding will help        improve our ability to design new adsorbents, catalysts, membranes        etc., and will impact  the knowledge base in environmental processes.",
