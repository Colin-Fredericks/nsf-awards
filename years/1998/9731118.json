The investigators, Donald Zobel of Oregon State University,  Corvallis, OR and Pramod K. Jha of Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu,  Nepal will address fundamental questions in plant biology concerning  Himalayan tree species.  The primary goals are-- 1) to determine the role  of water relations in governing leaf development and leaf senescence of  trees in the central Himalaya, and 2) examine possible mechanisms by  which Himalayan trees generate sufficient turgor to expand leaves during  the dry season.    Scope:  This project will be a major boost for water relations research in  Nepal.  In addition to training of young Nepalese scientists and providing  essential equipment to conduct botany research at Tribhuvan University,  this project will develop an important regional link with botanists at  Kumaun University, India who have collaborated with the US PI on the  same topic.  While both Indian and Nepalese groups have made substantial  contributions to Himalayan ecology, there has been little coordination of  effort and expertise.  For US science, this project will produce a large  volume of currently unavailable data on water relations, vegetation, and  ecosystem processes in Himalayan forests and will improve analysis and  prediction at the scale of the biosphere.     ***",
