 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mathematical investigations to be conducted under the present \r\naward, which relate to theoretical and computational aspects of Partial \r\nDifferential Equations (PDE), constitute a natural continuation of Dr. Bruno's\r\nrecent efforts on PDE problems in materials science, plasma physics \r\nand electromagnetism.  The proposed work in computational electromagnetism \r\ninvolves generalization of high-order scattering solvers introduced recently \r\nto a variety of complex three-dimensional systems arising in applications -- \r\nincluding deformed or eroded bodies, rough surfaces and oceans as well as \r\ngeneral surfaces and heterogeneous bodies in three dimensional space.\r\nFurther generalizations of related complex-analytic approaches to theoretical \r\nand computational aspects of plasma physics are also envisioned. \r\nIn the area of materials science, on the other hand, the work to be \r\ncarried out relates mainly to problems of elasticity in metallic alloys, \r\nceramics and other systems whose behavior is determined by an underlying \r\nmicroscopic structure. Specifically, Dr. Bruno will seek methods to compute \r\nthe effects of microscopic inhomogeneous deformations and other microscopic \r\nmisfits on a macroscopic body. These methods will then be used to study \r\nphenomena such as shape memory effect in polycrystals, thermal shatter in \r\npolycrystalline ceramics, hardening in magneto/electro-rheological fluids, \r\nmicrofracture at grain boundaries, etc.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical research that will performed with this award has applications \r\nthat include radar, sonar, remote sensing, clutter removal in remote sensing \r\napplications, amongst others in the area of electromagnetism, as well \r\nas design of modern materials, toughened ceramics, smart structures,\r\nactuators and sensors in the area of materials science.  The novel approaches \r\nthat will be studied, developed and applied have been successfully\r\ntested in a variety of configurations. They have already lead to theoretical \r\nadvances and computational capabilities well beyond those available previously \r\nin the general areas of electromagnetic scattering and materials science and\r\nwill now be extended to more complicated situations and a wider class of materials\r\nand media.  This work is to be pursued in collaboration with colleagues and \r\npostdoctoral associates in academia and industry in addition to graduate students. \r\nThe students' participation will be designed to provide a sound general \r\neducation in applied mathematics, including substantial expertise in design of \r\nstate-of-the-art simulation capabilities.  Students will be involved in concrete \r\napplications in fields related to those mentioned above, and, in addition, \r\nby direct interaction with scientists from industry or national labs. \r\nDr. Bruno will prepare researchers for careers in a wide range of areas of \r\napplied mathematics, ranging from the more theoretical to the engineering-oriented, \r\nand will provide them with a solid theoretical background, with a talent for \r\nsimulation, and with a strong commitment to applications in science and engineering.\r\n\r\n",
