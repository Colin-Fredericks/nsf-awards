 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803498  Karpeshina    The principal investigator and her colleague Joyce McLaughlin will   collaborate to solve inverse problems for holographic image data using   Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory.  The goal is to use selected   level sets of mode shapes of vibrating systems as data for the inverse   problem. With these level sets as data, formulas will be established.  The   formulas will then be used to determine physical properties of the system,   such as density or stiffness.  The results will be based on perturbation   results for the natural frequencies and the mode shapes.  The difficulty in   establishing these results arises from the fact that a small divisor problem   and a sequence of Eikonal equations must be solved simultaneously.  A   consequence of the resultant mathematical structure will be that the   perturbed quantities can be strongly different from the unperturbed   quantities.  McLaughlin's graduate student will concentrate on developing   formulas to use the data and on numerical implementation of those   formulas.    The goal with this work is to consider membrane like materials, such as a   thin slice of biological tissue.  Excite this membrane with an oscillating   force and suppose the frequency of oscillation is a natural frequency, that   is, a frequency where the membrane gives a large response. Illuminating   the vibrating surface with two lasers we see a dark and light line pattern.    Each line is a level set of the vibrating surface.  Now assume that the   membrane is nonhomogeneous; it could be more stiff or less stiff in some   places.   In the biological example, increased stiffness can indicate the   presence of rapidly dividing cells.  In a mechanical example, decreased   stiffness can indicate deterioration of the material.  The goal is to   determine the stiffness variations without altering the membrane, that is, to   find a nondestructive test for the stiffness variations.  Our data is the dark   and light line pattern. The problem is difficult be cause the stiffness   variations can have (but not always) a very large perturbative effect on the   pattern.  The mathematics will establish when the perturbation is large,   when it is not, and what formulas will yield the stiffness variations from   this particular data set.",
