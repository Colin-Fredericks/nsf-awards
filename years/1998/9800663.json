 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800663  Kapitulnik    This  experimental  two  investigator  research  project  is  concerned    with    detailed    understanding    of     2-D  superconductivity. Four research topics are as follows:  (a)  The   nature  of  the  thermodynamic  transition  near  Hc2,  including   the   validity  of  the  Lowest   Landau   Level  approximation   (b)  The  length  scales   associated   with  disorder,  and,  specifically,  comparison  of  the   length  associated with crossover of the dynamics with the  disorder  length  extracted from dc critical current measurements  (c)  The  superconductor-insulator transition, with  emphasis  on  possible    quantum   tunneling   of   vortices    in    the  superconducting  phase  and possible  effects  of  screening  (from  a groundplane) on the nature of the transition,  and,  (d)  The effect of bias current on the vortex system in  2-D  superconductors.  A substantial portion  of  the  work  will  involve  multilayers of MoGe alloys. This system has  proven  to  be an excellent model system in the investigation of 3-D  to  2-D  crossover effects in superconductivity. This highly  interdisciplinary research will involve graduate student and  postdoctoral researchers who will receive excellent training  beneficial  to their future careers in industry,  government  or academia.  %%%  This experimental two investigator basic research project  focuses on the special features that occur as superconductor  samples approach the limit of being two-dimensional. A two-  dimensional sample is one that is so thin that no motion of  carriers or electric current occurs in the direction  perpendicular to the plane of the sample. The project will  probe these properties in samples which are \"superlattices\"  similar in nature to a deck of cards, where each card is a  superconducting layer and a thin insulating layer is placed  between each conducting layer. In this work the two types of  layer will typically be alloys of Molybdenum and Germanium,  which form an alloy syst em such that Ge-rich alloys are  insulating and other alloy compositions can be metallic or  superconducting. This system is chosen as a \"model system\"  in which to carefully study effects that occur in materials  of potential for applications, such as cuprate  superconductors. The effects can be more reliably studied in  the model system than in the cuprates. Thus the results of  the basic study will lead to greater understanding of  cuprate superconductivity, and may lead to new applications  for these materials. This highly interdisciplinary research  will involve graduate student and postdoctoral researchers  who will receive excellent training beneficial to their  future careers in industry, government or academia.  ***",
