 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hyperbolic systems of conservation laws arise in many problems where the\r\nconservation of physical quantities such a mass, momentum, and energy are\r\nmodeled. These equations must typically be solved by approximate numerical\r\nmethods.  Discontinuities in the data and/or solution (e.g. shock waves)\r\ncause difficulties in developing accurate and stable methods. \r\n\r\nThis proposal concerns the development of high-resolution methods and their\r\nimplementation as software that can be widely used in solving problems\r\nthat arise in many different fields.  The P.I. has been actively\r\ninvolved in developing the CLAWPACK and AMRCLAW software for\r\nmulti-dimensional hyperbolic systems.  This software is freely\r\navailable and allows students and researchers studying a wide range of\r\nphenomena to use the technology of high-resolution methods and adaptive\r\nmesh refinement.  This software will be further developed and used to\r\nexplore a number of particular applications in science and\r\nengineering.  One application concerns computing acoustic or elastic\r\nwaves in heterogeneous media.  Such problems often arise in geophysics\r\nand materials science, for example.  Another application is to\r\nnumerical relativity, where there is interest in simulating\r\ngravitational waves that may soon be detectable by astronomers.\r\nThis can be accomplished by using a hyperbolic formulation of the Einstein\r\nequations.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
