 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Prof. Charles Winter at Wayne State University is supported   by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the Chemistry   Division. The research will focus on new precursors and processes for   tantalum nitride and related thin film materials. New low temperature   routes to binary and ternary transition metal nitrides of tantalum,   niobium, zirconium and hafnium will be developed with particular emphasis   on tantalum nitride thin films.  Specific objectives are: (1) synthesis   and characterization of tantalum complexes with a range of   nitrogen-containing ligands such as alkyl hydrazines,   1,3-diaryltriazines, pyrazoles, 1,2,4-triazoles and tetrazoles as single   source precursors for nitrides; (2)examination of chemical vapor   deposition reactions of the nitrogen ligands and tantalum (V) source   compounds as low temperature routes to nitride films; (3) development of   ternary tantalum-silicon nitrides by addition of volatile silicon   sources; and, (4) extension of the tantalum technology to other early   transition metal nitrides.  Nitride films will be characterized by x-ray   diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron   microscopy and Rutherford back-scattering.  Nitride thin films are recognized for a wide range of important   properties including hardness, chemical resistance, electrical   conductivity and desirable optical properties. Currently, nitride films   are made by high temperature sputtering. The early transition metal   nitrides studied in this research  will be prepared by low temperature   chemical vapor deposition and will impact the development of barrier   materials for microelectronic  applications, particularly between silicon   and copper substrates in integrated circuits. The synthetic chemistry of   single source precursors will also lead to new early transition metal   complexes of fundamental interest to structural inorganic chemistry.",
