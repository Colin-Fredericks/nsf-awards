However, parents may have conflicts of interest  over how much parental care each should provide to their  young.  One source of conflict arises when males are not the  genetic fathers (sires) of the young for which they are  caring.  Such cases occur often in birds because females of  many species will mate with males other than their social  partner. Should males decrease their parental effort when  they are raising offspring that are not their own, and if  so, how much?  This pilot study will allow Whittingham to  pursue this question in a new and exciting model system  (house wrens), and to develop new molecular methods of  paternity analysis that are necessary for the expansion of  her research. This project also will provide research  experience and training in modern genetic techniques for  undergraduate and graduate students.      Recent theory suggest that males may adjust their parental  effort in relation to their paternity (the number of young  sired) under some conditions, but not others.  House wrens  provide a model system to examine the factors that influence  why parents may or may not cooperate to raise young.  These  factors include the ability of males to assess their  paternity and the availability of mating opportunities with  other females.  This project will result in a better  understanding of the basic principles underlying parental  decision-making.  In addition it provides integrated  training in both field and genetic methods for young  scientists.",
