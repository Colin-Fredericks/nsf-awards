 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for 1998.  This  fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain  additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue innovative and imaginative research into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular, cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is adaptation of bacteria  to acidic and alkaline environments.  This research examines  the adaptive responses of laboratory popultions of  Eschericia coli to changes in environmental pH.  The  evolution of fitness and metabolic efficiency is being  followed over 100 generations in acidic, alkaline, variable,  and control environments to address a number of specific  questions of general interest to evolutionary biologists and  to lay the groundwork for understanding the physiological  mechanisms of adaptation.",
