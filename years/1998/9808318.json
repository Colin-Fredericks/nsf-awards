 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nDBI 9808318; Gilson, Michael; University of Maryland\r\n\r\nMolecular recognition, the noncovalent binding of specific molecules to each other, is \r\nfundamental to biology. Examples include antibody-antigen recognition and the binding \r\nof hormones to their receptors. Data on what molecules bind each other and how tightly \r\nthey bind is currently published almost exclusively in journals. This sharply limits the \r\namount of information that may be published and makes even simple queries impossible.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to develop the first public, web-accessible database with information on \r\nmolecular recognition. The initial release will be modest in scope, but will be carefully \r\nplanned and designed to support rapid future expansion. The database will:\r\n\r\nContain measured binding affinities for proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and other \r\nnatural and synthetic molecules; \r\n\r\nallow deposition of experimental details of the binding measurements;\r\n\r\ninclude structural information from the Protein Data Bank and links to structures in the \r\nCambridge Structural Database; \r\n\r\nallow for a range of queries including SQL, sequence, and chemical-substructure \r\nsearches;\r\n\r\nprovide analysis tools for correlating structure with thermodynamics.\r\n\r\nbe subject to continuing evaluation by users, depositors, and a scientific advisory board.\r\n\r\nWorkshops involving prospective users and depositors will guide the development of the \r\ndata dictionary and the user interface The implementation will be facilitated by extensive \r\nprevious work in biomolecular informatics by the proposers. Thus, the data dictionary will \r\nbe developed as an extension of the mmCIF dictionary an internationally accepted format \r\nfor biomolecular structure. A relational data management system will be used for most \r\nqueries. The Property Object Model developed by one of the proposers will also be used to \r\nsupport property-oriented queries such as those involving 3-D substructure searches. The \r\ndatabase will be accessed primarily via the WWW; mirror sites on both coasts will be used \r\nto shorten response times and to provide backup service. The project will undergo \r\ncontinuing evaluation via several mechanisms, including a Scientific Advisory Board that \r\nwill meet publicly to review progress and provide guidance.\r\n\r\nThis cross-disciplinary project will impact molecular biology, structural biology, \r\nbioinformatics, and chemistry. The database will advance knowledge of the functions of \r\nbiomolecules, of the relationships between molecular structure and binding, and of the \r\nphysical chemistry of molecular recognition. It will also lead to new and improved \r\nmethods of designing molecules that bind targeted receptors. Such molecules will be \r\nuseful as novel biological effecters and will also be used in a range of applications \r\nincluding assays, sensors, and chemical separations.\r\n",
