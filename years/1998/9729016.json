 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a computerization effort that will capture  data for $140,000 of the 200,000 vascular plant specimens in  the C.E. Bessey Herbarium (herbarium acronym: NEB) of the  University of Nebraska State Museum (UNSM). In detail, this  project will comprise data capture and barcoding of the  vascular plant specimens from the United States and Canada,  beginning with the 13 angiosperm families that are most  numerous in this collection and in the northern Great Plains  and continuing until all of the North American vascular  plants are entered.  The herbarium project will also provide  a model for all the collections of the UNSM as the Museum  strives to convert its records to an interoperable database  that will be central to research, collection management,  service, exhibits, and education.    The database will conform to current standards for the  discipline and follow future developments available from the  IUBS Commission of Taxonomic Databases (TDWG) and the US  Organization for Biodiversity Information through their  respective web sites. This effort, which is fully  coordinated with those at the R. L. McGregor Herbarium  (herbarium acronym: KANU) of the University of Kansas  Natural History Museum (KUNHM), will result in a plant  database for the central and northern Great Plains that is  both regionally and historically complete. The NEB database  will follow the KANU protocol in using the botany module of  Zoe, a museum-specific and flexible data model developed by  Julian Humphries in Microsoft's relational database Access.    Computerization of data for the remaining vascular plant  specimens (60,000 sheets), the non-vascular plant specimens  (80,000 packets), and the paleobotanical specimens (10,000  fossils)will be the focus of efforts after the completion of  this project.  The other long-term goals of this proposed  project are (1)georeferencing the collection records for  compatibility with GIS databases;(2) insuring  interoperability with other units of the UNSM and oth er  natural history collections,  especially KUNHM; and (3) developing a parallel taxon-based  database to facilitate educational and public use of this  specimen-based database.  Because these long term goals are  best accomplished with regional efforts, the procedures to  be followed and the database structure are based on those of  the KANU Collections Information Management System (CIMS) so  that it will be easier for both institutions to coordinate  future developments to optimize the research, educational,  and outreach uses of each museum's database.",
