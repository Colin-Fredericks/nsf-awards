 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal No.:  9721370  PI:    Winter  University: SD School of  Mines and Technology      ABSTRACT      This REU site has several goals: 1) to provide eight undergraduates of Chemical Engineering or allied fields, with unique and exciting research opportunities in the area of molecular level surface modification; 2) to enhance the students' critical thinking skills and communication skills (including written, oral, listening, and audio/visual presentations); 3) to increase the students' interest in graduate studies (with a target of 25% of the participants pursuing graduate degrees) by igniting that spark of interest through hands on experiences in a research laboratory working in their field of interest; 4) to introduce the students to the 'beyond the classroom' experience in a research setting; and 5) to enhance the students' ability to think independently.  The students will gain hands on experience utilizing state of the art surface characterization instrumentation and experimental facilities while participating in meaningful research activities.  Equally important, the undergraduate researchers will enjoy a close mentoring relationship with the faculty mentors.  Through this program students will gain significant research experience and develop critical thinking skills, communication skills, and instrumentation skills, and will also be exposed to professional ethics and other activities to promote life-long learning.  At least 50% of the students will be recruited from Tribal, four-year, and community colleges and universities from the four surrounding EPSCOR states, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Wyoming where research opportunities have been historically lacking.  The recruitment of Native Americans is a particular focus of this REU Site, building upon opportunities that have been developed in recent years by the project's Principal Investigator.  In addition other underrepresented minorities, women, and disabled will be encouraged to participate.",
