 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry   program supports research in the laboratories of Professor Jean'ne   Shreeve at the University of Idaho.  Shreeve has proposed to develop a   new class of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl electrophilic transfer agents   based upon simple inorganic molecules.  The proposal clearly outlines a   variety of synthetic routes for the preparation of these reagents.    Although a variety of perfluoroalkyl transfer agents are known, these   reagents often require the use of tedious synthetic methodologies or   possess a limited scope of applicability. The new reagents to be   developed are expected to offer the advantages of being applicable to the   derivatization of a variety of template molecules and being stable in the   presence of nucleophiles and under photolytic conditions.  Additional   studies will include the nucleophilic transfer of per- and   poly-fluoroalkyl groups from the corresponding per- and   poly-fluoroalkylated silanes.  The incorporation of fluorine or fluorine-containing groups into   molecules has a marked effect upon the chemical and physical properties   of the parent molecule.  These changes result in increased lipophilicity   and improved hydrolytic and thermal stability.  As a result, the demand   for such compounds by the pharmaceutical, medical and polymer industries   continues to grow.  The reagents developed in this program are expected   to result in the more efficacious and economical production of   fluorine-containing compounds.",
