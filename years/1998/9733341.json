 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733341  Keller    Proposed experimental work is aimed at synthesizing solid-state  metal-organic framework structures that are topologically  similar to silicate minerals such as quartz and/or zeolites, and  are expected to exhibit properties characteristic of the  structures after which they are modeled, viz.,  chirality and  non-linear optical activity, or microporocity, respectively.  Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance  spectroscopy and mass spectrometry will be used to study the  evolution of solution species into extended solids.  Preliminary  results suggest that non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen  bonding can often determine the final structure.  Due to the  multidisciplinary approach involving, for example, inorganic and  organic synthesis, X-ray crystallography, and materials  characterization, research and education will be integrated into  a unique educational experience well-suited to the instruction  of both graduate and undergraduate students, who comprise  collectively, the scientists of the next century.  In addition,  significant enhancement of the more general undergraduate  science education experiences will be realized  through the  incorporation of technology, history, and \"real-life\" examples.  %%%  A basic theme of this integrated research and education program  is the design and preparation of solid materials in which atoms  and molecules are arranged in particular ways.  For example, the  construction of scaffold-like materials that will contain  cavities capable of absorbing specific guest molecules or ions  (like a molecular sponge)  may find important uses in  environmental remediation or remote chemical sensing.  ***",
