 "awd_abstract_narration": "Strevett  9733969  A quantitative understanding of microbial migration in  geological formations is critical to predict the  dissemination of microbes in the environment and to evaluate  the efficacy of microbially mediated in situ pollutant  degradation. The key event that retards the movement of  micoorganisms in the saturated zone is their interaction  with the matrix surfaces, which may result in adhesion. This  interaction is determined by the surface thermodynamics of  the microorganism and the matrix.    This research is designed to measure thermodynamic  properties of cell surfaces for selected subsurface  bacterial genera at different physiological states, electron  donor/acceptor ratios and carbon/nitrogen ratios. The  bacteria selected for this study include Escherichia coli,  Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus  casei and Staphylococcus aureus. It is the goal of this  research to provide a comprehensive and accurate  quantification of the dependence of surface thermodynamics  on bacterial physiological state, electron donor/acceptor  ratio and carbon/nitrogen ratio. A mechanistically-based  model will be developed for microbial transport; the model  will account for micro scale hydrodynamics, individual  surface thermodynamic interactions between cell surface and  the grains, including their dependence on physiological  state of the microorganism, and Brownian diffusion. The  resulting model will provide a tool for evaluating and  predicting microbial transport in porous geological  formations with greater certainty than is currently  possible.    The objectives of the educational plan are to: 1) increase  opportunities for physically impaired students in  engineering and science and 2) provide a forum to bring  research into the classroom and teaching into the  laboratory. Targeted recruitment  and retention strategies  at the undergraduate and graduate levels will create  visibility for engineering and science disciplines to  physically impaired students throu gh guest lectures and  summer research scholarships. A support system for these  students will include mentoring programs, financial support  and appropriate laboratory facilities. The second objective  will be met through  multidisciplinary laboratory oriented  courses to provide an opportunity for cooperative learning  through the incorporation of fundamental principles, applied  science and real-world problem-solving.  ***",
