Ritz vectors have been used extensively in the areas of model reduction, component mode synthesis, eigensystem computation, and transient response prediction.\r\n\r\nThe experimental determination of Ritz properties has long eluded the test engineer.  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award will provide a validated theory and methodology to extract Ritz properties from measured dynamic test data and a methodology for utilization of these properties in structural health monitoring of large scale structures.  The developed theory will address both the traditional dynamic test where input forces are measured and the practical case of ambient data analysis for situations when forces cannot be measured.\r\n\r\nUpon completion of the research, the field of structural engineering will have the ability to be able to utilize experimental Ritz properties in all applications which currently utilize experimental modal parameters.  Thus, the many advantages of Ritz properties observed in the analytical and numerical aspects of structural engineering will be enabled in structural applications which to date currently utilize experimental modal properties.  This includes, but is not limited to, applications ranging from transient response prediction, model reduction, optimal design, experimental determination of analytical models for high-performance control design, force reconstruction, test-analysis correlation, model validation and verification, and structural health monitoring.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
