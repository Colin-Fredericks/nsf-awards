For the past 40 years, numerous investigators  have exploited the large size of this neuron and have used it in studies of  the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie such important neuronal  functions as spontaneous burst generation, synaptic and hormonal modulation  of burst generation, synthesis and cellular processing of neuropeptides,  modulation of the strength of synaptic connections between neurons, and the  effects of aging of neuronal function. Neuron R 15 has thus become one of  the most widely studied neurons in the animal kingdom and as such is an  exemplar of spontaneously bursting cells. Nevertheless, there is nothing  known about how it is active in the intact animal. This study will  determine the physiological and behavioral conditions under which R15, as  well as the neurons that modulate its activity, are active in the intact,  freely behaving animal. This information will serve as a key to  interpreting the vast literature that has been amassed concerning R15's  cellular properties over the years. In addition, the data from the intact  animal concerning R15's physiological firing patterns will be used to  design experiments that determine how the synaptic input to RI5 modulates  its bursting properties.  These experiments will combine recording from  identified neurons in intact, behaving animals, with detailed analyses in  the isolated nervous system of the biophysical mechanisms by which bursting  of R15 is modulated. By using R15 as a canonical example of a bursting  neuron, we expect to add significantly to our fundamental understanding of  the role of spontaneous burstors in the function of neural circuits. An  important feature of this study will be a pilot project that will be part  of a NSF-sponsored undergraduate course in neuroethology at the Institute  of Neurobiology in Puerto-Rico. In addition to providing the first   comparative data for this well studied neuron, our project will establish a  collaborative liaison between Columbia University and the faculty and  trainees of the Institute in Puerto Rico that will extend into to the  future as an ongoing relationship. It will expose students from this  predominately minority institution to a broader range of neuroscience  research than they would otherwise experience.",
