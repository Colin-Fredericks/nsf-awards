 "awd_abstract_narration": "Java and Web technology have become very important for the development of new distributed applications and emerging electronic commerce systems.  Likewise, Java is expected to play an increasingly important role in the broad area of high-performance computing; including engineering and scientific computing, simulations, parallel and distributed computing, data-intensive applications, and other applications that combine communication and computing.  This workshop will focus on high-performance network computing.  The workshop is aimed at getting a broad perspective of community interests and views, as well as more technical discussions.  The goal is to provide feedback to users and language developers on what is required to successfully deploy Java in scientific and high-performance computing environments.",
