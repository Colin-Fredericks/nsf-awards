 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800255  Craig  Composite caps consisting of a geomembrane and compacted  clay layer are often used for closure of landfills and for  isolation of contaminated soil and waste because they are  very effective at minimizing percolation.  However,  composite caps are expensive.  As a result, interest has  developed in less costly and equally effective alternative  caps constructed almost entirely with earthen materials.  The objective of the proposed study is to investigate  fundamental factors affecting the behavior of a new  alternative earthen cap called a \"dry barrier,\" a special  type of earthen cover where airflow is used to remove  intruding water.  This design permits the use of thinner  layers while still preventing percolation, even during the  most stressful periods, such as snowmelt and heavy winter  rainfalls.  As a result, thinner layers are required and the  cost of the cap is lower.    Designing dry barriers requires an understanding of the \"in  situ evaporation\" process and flow of air laden with water  vapor in porous media.  Moreover, models need to be  developed for use in design.  This study addresses these  issues through experimental work and development of computer  models.   Experiments will be conducted to characterize the  \"in situ evaporation process\" as a function of soil type,  water content, air stream velocity, and humidity of the air  stream.  Models will be developed based on the experimental  work and verified using large-scale laboratory tests and a  field experiment.  Results of this study will demonstrate  the benefits of using dry barriers and provide analytical  tools and data for their design.  ***",
