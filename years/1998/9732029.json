The proposal will support a workshop to address  the impact of scientific research on the perennially ice-  covered lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. The  Environmental Officer, Joyce Jatko, was consulted as to the  relevance of this workshop; she endorsed its funding.    This invitational workshop will bring together about 35  experts from not only the polar limnology community but from  the broader aquatic community. The workshop addresses  important issues, which have been the focus of question or  concern by the scientific community, program staff at NSF,  the US non-governmental community and the international  Antarctic community. The invited participant list is  appropriately balanced by scientific discipline and includes  the key international scientists. Program staff discussed  the lack of gender balance in the proposed list of  participants with the PIs, who have assured staff that a  more appropriate balance will be achieved. The results of  the workshop will be made available as a report, to be  widely distributed. The report will be useful not only to  scientists, but to managers of Antarctic programs who must  ensure that activities conducted in Antarctica are reviewed  to meet the intent of the Protocol on Environmental  Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.  9732029  DORAN  The perennially ice-covered lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys  in southern Victoria Land, Antarctica, have been the object  of study since their discovery by Robert Falcon Scott in  1903. These dry valley lakes are unique on Earth, and there  is great interest within the scientific community to  preserve their pristine nature to the maximum extent  possible. This award will support an invitational workshop  which will bring together about thirty-five scientists with  expe rtise in aquatic environments. The purpose of the  workshop is to assess the impact of past and current  research activities in and around the dry valley lakes. The  group will make recommendations on the establishment of  acceptable levels of impact as well as on approaches to  management of future research activities in an  environmentally responsible manner. Given the uniqueness and  scientifically valuable nature of these lakes, workshop  participants will be chosen from the pool of Antarctic and  Arctic scientists as well as from investigators in the  broader aquatic sciences community. Workshop participants  will address the potential impacts of research activities on  the Antarctic lakes, including ice-hole melting, SCUBA  diving, remotely-operated and autonomously-operated  underwater vehicles, the use of chemical tracers, repetitive  water sampling, waster removal and sediment coring. The  impact of shore-based and glacier melt stream research  activities on the dry valley lakes will also be explored.  This serious approach to one aspect of the issue of human  impact to the Earth's environment should provide critical  information to help guide and direct future scientific  activities.",
