 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three major science education issues are educational technology, problem-based learning, and teaching integrated science. Change is difficult because of the present structure of single discipline-based teaching. This project is changing the core curriculum to one which uses educational technology to teach integrated science by tying courses from different disciplines together via computer simulations and problem-solving pedagogy. Early in their education students begin to see that the sciences have commonalties such as the scientific method, quantifiable and verifiable data, the use of statistics and probabilities, and critical thinking.  Computer simulations do not replace but extend the laboratory experience, whether in geology, biology, or physics. By integrating disciplines and having students work in teams on simulated problems as an extension of the lab experience, our project revitalizes the science curriculum by transcending traditional disciplinary boundaries and incorporating educational technologies.\r\nWe are incorporating integrated science-based computer simulations into classrooms in a problem-solving format. Student teams attempt to solve complex and important problems, such as global warming or deforestation whose solutions require knowledge and skills drawn from many different scientific fields.\r\n\r\n",
