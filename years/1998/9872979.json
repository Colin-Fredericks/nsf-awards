 "awd_abstract_narration": "Silk\r\n9872979\r\n     In the past decade cosmology has undergone a renaissance,\r\ntransforming from a data-starved science to a data-driven one.\r\nThe COBE satellite and subsequent observations of the Cosmic\r\nMicrowave Background (CMB) have begun to give us a detailed\r\npicture of the early Universe; telescopes have found galaxies at\r\ndistances corresponding to the Universe at one-tenth of its\r\npresent age; large-scale redshift surveys have begun to map out\r\nthe structure of the nearby Universe.  However, the size of these\r\ndatasets threatens to leave cosmology data-swamped.  Realizing our\r\nscientific goals depends on meeting the qualitatively new\r\ncomputational challenges set by the quantitatively new data.  The\r\nissues cosmologists face in the analysis, synthesis and\r\npresentation of the data --- including data compression and\r\ntransmission, mass storage, data mining, parallel algorithms and\r\nscaling, inverse problems and regularization methods, and complex\r\ndata visualization --- are also at the forefront of current\r\nresearch in Computer Science and Statistics.  The investigators\r\nand their colleagues form a focused collaboration between\r\nastrophysicists, statisticians and computer scientists to develop\r\ncomputational tools, techniques and technologies to cope with the\r\nnew challenges posed by these datasets.  The needs of Cosmology\r\nprovide a practical spur to new developments in Computer Science\r\nand Statistics, enabling and informing new research both within\r\nastrophysics and more widely in other data-intensive disciplines.\r\nResearch is organized along four interlocking paths.  First, there\r\nmust be appropriate tools to analyze the individual datasets.\r\nNext are the synthesis and simulation of the datasets to\r\nformulate a coherent picture of the evolution of structure in the\r\nUniverse.  Finally, there must be access to the data and the\r\nproducts of the analysis, both to members of the collaboration\r\nand to the outside community.\r\n     Cosmology is the quest for the understanding of the Universe\r\non the largest scales, and of the events that unfolded in the\r\nfirst moments after the Big Bang.  Light that now makes up the\r\nCosmic Microwave Background (or CMB) last interacted with matter\r\nin the Universe when it was about one hundred thousand years old\r\n(a small fraction of its age today of fifteen billion years);\r\nobserving the CMB allows cosmologists to map out the Universe at\r\nthese very early times.  Somewhat closer to home, observing the\r\ndistribution of galaxies lets us see the present state of the\r\nUniverse.  Only ten years ago, the amount of data involved in\r\nthese studies was tiny.  Advances in telescope and detector\r\ntechnology has allowed a manyfold increase in these data; this\r\nvast expansion pushes the limits of our computational ability to\r\nanalyze it.  The investigators and their colleagues, from\r\nastrophysics, computer science, and statistics, develop tools to\r\nanalyze and synthesize this vast amount of data.  This allows them\r\nto form a coherent and complete picture of the evolution of the\r\nUniverse from the earliest times to the present day and ---\r\nperhaps most importantly --- far into the future.\r\n\r\n",
