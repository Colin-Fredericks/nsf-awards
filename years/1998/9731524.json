This award is for a planning meeting to determine the feasibility and viability of Ohio State University becoming a research site of the multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Aseptic Processing and Packaging Studies.  North Carolina State University and the University of California-Davis are the Center's current research sites.    The Ohio State University research site proposes to expand the current Center's research agenda with the following projects:     1.  Validating Sterilization Efficiency of Aseptic Packaging Systems   2.  Modeling of Pulsed-Electric Field Processes   3.  PEF Bactericidal Effect Visualized by High Speed Microscopic Imaging  4.  Decontamination of Food-Contact Surfaces by Ozone and Potential Application in           Aseptic Fillers  5.  Microbial Control of Fluid Foods with Microfiltration and Combinations of         Microfiltration with other Non-Thermal Processing Methods  6.  An Improved Safe Cheddar Cheese from Raw Milk  7.  Process Development of Single Step Microbial and Colloidal Stabilization for        Fermented Beverages    The Principal Investigator and his colleagues are internationally recognized experts in their fields and are well qualified to run their planning meetings.",
