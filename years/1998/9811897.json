 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  objectives  of  this project are to (1) develop  a  conceptual  design for a single-circle neutron diffractometer/reflectometer for  structural   studies  of  membrane  and  other  partially   ordered  interfacial  systems to be operated at Center for Neutron  Research  at   the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  (2)  determine  the cost of the construction of the diffractometer,  and  (3)  develop  a  plan  for the construction and  operation  of  the  diffractometer through a multi-agency funding mechanism. A Planning  Group comprised of experts in neutron diffraction and reflectometry  and  neutron instrumentation has been assembled to accomplish these  objectives.  The  funds  requested will  be  used  to  support  the  Planning  Group's  activities in the  pursuit  of  the  objectives.  Neutron  diffraction has unique capabilities for structural studies  of  diverse  biological and physical systems. There is presently  a  world-wide  shortage of neutron facilities, especially for  studies  of  membrane  and  other  interfacial systems.  The  only  membrane  diffractometer  in  the  United States  is  located  at  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory's  High Flux Beam Reactor  (HFBR),  which  was  recently  shut down for an indefinite period of time. Even  if  the  HFBR  restarts in the next several years, there is  a  need  for  a  second  diffractometer  in  order to meet  the  rising  demand  for  neutron instruments as well as to assure an uninterrupted supply of  neutrons  for membrane structural studies. The proposed  instrument  at  NIST will be designed to have significantly better capabilities  than   existing   instruments  and  will  be  the  first   membrane  diffractometer that uses a cold-neutron source.",
