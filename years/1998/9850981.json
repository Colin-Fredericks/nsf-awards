 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this grant, a Mathematics Education Center is being established.  The Center will consist of a computer enhanced classroom, an activity area, a material storage area, and a curriculum development area.  The Center will be used to improve the preparation of both pre-service and in-service teachers and serve as a model for Centers at other universities. Pre-service teachers will learn mathematics in ways consistent with the California Mathematics Framework and with recommendations of groups such as the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and The National Research Council. In-service teachers will have access to the Center through activities organized by the Central Coast Mathematics Project and will be able to upgrade their mathematical knowledge and acquire and construct appropriate learning experiences for their students.    The classroom area, which will be equipped with a computer and appropriate display devices to allow rapid and accurate dissemination of information, will be used for lecture, discussion, and testing. The activity area will be equipped with six networked computers for student use and tables for small group hands-on experiences and discussions. The curriculum development area will house two computers, one which will be available to instructors for lesson preparation and to Senior Project students, and the second computer will be a server for the network, allowing for the dissemination materials to teachers  through a World Wide Web site.",
