 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE INFOCOM Conference Computer Communications will be held in New York, New York, during March 21-25,1999. This preeminent technical conference is the primary venue for presenting new research results in the area of computer communications, and is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field. Attending conferences such as INFOCOM is of paramount importance for the development of graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and faculty members. Participants have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of others performing leading-edge research in the field. This proposal requests funding to aid approximate twelve gradute students, post-docs, and junior faculty in the United States in attending this premiere conference.",
