 "awd_abstract_narration": "Standards-based reform curricula are making serious inroads in the high school classroom. These curricula are truly different in significant ways. The content, pedagogy, technology, and assessment of these new programs bear little resemblance to those of only a few short years ago.  Currently, colleges and universities are graduating and certifying students to teach mathematics at the secondary level who are not prepared to deal with the new texts and courses. This guarantees that even new teachers from undergraduate and graduate programs have to be retrained if their schools adopt one of the new reformed curricula.    This project is developing, field-testing, and publishing a text for a modeling course which is intended both for majors and for future secondary school teachers of mathematics which mirrors and models courses that future teachers will experience in the high school classroom.  The course emphasizes both how to mathematize the problem and how to select the mathematics to use.  It also makes frequent use of technology, group and inquiry based learning, and alternative assessments.",
