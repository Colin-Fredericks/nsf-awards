In the Novikov-Borel\r\nportion of the project, he will be attempting to replace geometric\r\nconditions (which have allowed the proof of these conjectures in a\r\nnumber of cases) by more algebraic and homotopy theoretic conditions\r\nconcerning the fundamental group.  The methods here include the\r\nPedersen-Weibel``bounded K-theory,'' and a  G-theoretic version that\r\nstudies non-free modules over the group rings in question.  If this\r\nis sufficiently successful, it could lead to the solution of Borel's\r\nconjecture that two closed manifolds whose universal cover is Euclidean\r\nn-space are in fact homeomorphic.  In the algebraic K-theory of fields\r\nportion, the investigator has developed a new version of the\r\nLichtenbaum-Quillen conjectures, which appears to have a chance of\r\nidentifying the K-theory of fields ``on the nose'' (rather than in\r\nsufficiently high dimensions) and which depends directly on\r\nthe representation theory of the Galois group rather than on the group\r\nitself.  One hopes that this will give new arithmetic applications of\r\nK-theory.\r\n     Work on this project will be directed toward two important\r\nproblems.  The first revolves around the study of manifolds, spaces\r\n(such as spheres, tori, etc.) in which every point has a neighborhood\r\nthat resembles ordinary Euclidean space.  One notion of equivalence\r\nfor such manifolds is homotopy equivalence, a relatively weak\r\ncondition.  For instance, a circle and an annulus are homotopy\r\nequivalent, since one direction of the annulus can be compressed to\r\nobtain a circle.  The other notion is homeomorphism, which is a very\r\nstrong condition, requiring that there be an explicit way to identify\r\nthe points of one manifold with those of the other so that each point\r\nof one corresponds to exactly one in the other.  The latter is\r\ntypically very hard to verify, while homotopy equivalence is\r\nrelatively easy to verify.  The conjecture of Borel asserts that for a\r\nlarge class of manifolds (those whose universal cover is ordinary\r\nEuclidean space) homotopy equivalence implies homeomorphism.  The\r\ninvestigator is approaching this conjecture via algebraic methods,\r\ninvolving algebraic invariants of the manifolds in question.  The\r\nsecond problem studies the so-called ``algebraic K-theory'' of fields\r\n(algebraic objects in which one has addition, multiplication, and\r\ndivision, like the rational or the real numbers).  It proposes a new\r\nconjecture for a description of this K-theory, one which is stronger\r\nthan the earlier Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjectures.  In this project, the\r\ninvestigator will be developing methods for verifying his conjecture\r\nin many cases.  The hope is that studying this conjecture will give\r\nnew applications to arithmetic for this topological invariant.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
