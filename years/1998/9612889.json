 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  ATM 9612889  Shaw, Glen   University of Alaska  Title: University of Alaska's Participation in INDOEX (Indian Ocean Experiment)     The Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) is an international field experiment with  participation from France, Germany, India, the Netherlands, and the United States.   The main effort under the U.S. component focuses on assessing the role of sulfates  and other continental aerosols in global radiative forcing and is being supported  jointly by the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.  In  addition, complementary studies involving investigations of a variety of related  chemical and radiative processes will be undertaken by scientists from other federal  agencies and other international partners.  The composite observing system consists of  a wide range of platforms, from ships to aircraft, as well as surface-based and balloon  measuring systems, and satellite data.  The main part of the three year effort will be a  four-month intensive field phase which begins January 1999.    The ultimate goal of this program is to obtain a better understanding of the decadal  and longer time scale climate forcing.  The equatorial Indian Ocean during the  northeast winter monsoon season provides a unique natural laboratory for this  experiment.  The experimental area is probably the only place in the world where an  air mass which has been modified by intense sources of continental aerosols,  anthropogenic trace species, and their reaction products (e.g., sulfates and ozone)  from the northern hemisphere comes into contact with the pristine air of the southern  hemisphere, which has been transported via cross equatorial monsoonal flow, at the  Intertropical Convergence Zone.   The juxtaposition of these two very distinct air  masses will allow a thorough examination of both the direct and indirect effects of the  aerosols on the radiative properties of the atmosphere.    Dr. Shaw's role in INDOEX is to measure the concentration and supersaturation  spect rum of Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) aboard the Indian research vessel  ORV Sagar Kanya in the spring, 1998 INDOEX science cruise.  The purpose is to  test the hypothesis that aerosols transported from the Indian Subcontinent affect the  number distribution and therefore the albedo of clouds in the Indian Ocean.",
