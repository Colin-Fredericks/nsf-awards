 "awd_abstract_narration": "9730036  West    Cells construct extracellular barriers (e.g., walls) to separate cells from each other or from the external environment.  A common structural theme of such extracellular barriers is that they consist of a network of fibrillar components and an amorphous component. The goal of this project is to better understand the mechanism of spore coat formation in the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, a eukaryote which diverged from the evolutionary tree around the parting of plants and animals.  An underlying assumption is that knowledge of how the Dictyostelium spore coat is assembled by the cell will be relevant, at least in terms of general principles, to cell wall biosynthesis in other organisms, such as bacteria, plants, and other fungi. Dictyostelium is an advantageous system for studying the formation of cellulosic barriers, for a variety of reasons:  coat formation is readily manipulable in the laboratory, since the spore coat forms over a short period of time in a strictly developmentally-regulated fashion; biochemically useful quantities of material can be readily isolated; the organism is genetically tractable, and most of the coat protein genes have already been cloned; and, since sporulation is non-essential for the life cycle (in the laboratory setting), strains can be engineered with coat genes can that are mutated and replaced.      The Dictyostelium spore coat contains cellulose fibrils, a galuran polysaccharide, and nine major proteins.  Dr. West has demonstrated that one of these proteins, SP85, which is known from earlier work to be part of a precoat protein complex, is capable of binding cellulose.   SP85 is abundant, is present at the start of coat assembly, is uniquely localized in the inner / middle layers of the coat along with cellulose, is encoded by the pspB gene, and appears to have a modular structure.  Expression of SP85 and protein domains of SP85 in E. coli showed that cellulose-binding is a property of the C-terminal half of the protein.  Dr. West hypot hesizes that SP85 helps to organize the cellulose and protein components of the coat by a cross-linking mechanism.  Studies of modular cellulose-binding proteins in cellulolytic systems, and of proteins in other \"walls\" such as that of the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas, the spore coat of the bacterium B. subtilis, and animal basement membranes, suggest that biochemical and genetic approaches will be informative for analyzing this supramolecular complex.  The first aim of the project is to block expression of SP85 in vivo by gene disruption.  In a complementary approach, the N- and C-terminal domains will be overexpressed in an attempt to create a dominant negative effect based on the hypothesized cross-linking activity.  Analysis of coat phenotype in these mutants will show whether SP85 is involved in organizing other coat molecules as anticipated from the in vitro binding studies.  If there is evidence for redundantly encoded functions, disruptions will be carried out in a background of other coat gene deletion mutants.  The second aim is to determine the binding specificities of SP85 N- and C- terminal domains through biochemical studies.  To facilitate proper tertiary folding and glycosylation, and to avoid isolating SP85 from a complex, SP85 will be expressed by growing Dictyostelium cells which do not express other spore coat proteins.  The third aim will be to use epitope tagging to localize the SP85 domains in vivo, to see if they correlate with the known physical distributions of the putative binding targets identified in the second aim.",
