One transformation, termed nitrification, is a bacterial process in which ammonium is converted to nitrate.  Nitrification is important because the end product, nitrate, can cause nutrient pollution in lakes and streams leading to excessive growth of aquatic plants.  High concentrations of nitrate in drinking water also have been linked to several human health problems.  Our preliminary experiments suggest that the quantity of organic carbon dissolved in water may control nitrification rates.  We will conduct several experiments using stream and lake sediments, the site of most nitrification, to investigate the influence of organic carbon on nitrification rates.  Our basic hypothesis is that increasing quantity and quality of organic carbon will reduce nitrification because other bacteria will outcompete nitrifying bacteria for ammonium.",
