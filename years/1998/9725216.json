 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. E. James Davis, and a postdoc from the University of   Washington in a collaboration with Gustav Schweiger and his group at the Department of   Laser Applications Engineering and Measurement Systems at the Ruhr University in   Bochum, Germany.  Both groups are working on chemical reactions in aerosols which are   associated with atmospheric pollution and ozone depletion.  Professor Davis has unique   facilities for aerosol studies featuring the coupling of electrodynamic balances with Raman   spectroscopy.  Capabilities already include the ability to trap particles over a very wide   size range (500-m down to atomic dimensions), which includes respirable molecules.  Dr.   Schweiger's laboratory is well positioned to improve the Raman measurements using laser   diodes and state-of-the-art detectors.  Joining the complementary facilities and expertise of   the two groups will benefit both sides of the collaboration and could lead to new, compact   instruments for chemical analysis of aerosol particles in the workplace, in the atmosphere,   and in the laboratory.",
