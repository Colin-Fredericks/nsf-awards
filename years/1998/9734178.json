The grant involves teaching  and research on the application of condensed matter physics  to problems in molecular and cell biology.    In the past fifty years biology has largely become based on  the physical science of organic molecules.  This  understanding has largely been the domain of (bio)chemistry.  However, with the advent of new tools that allow us to  manipulate large protein, RNA and DNA molecules, biochemists  and biologists are being faced with a new class of problems  related to the physical chemistry of huge macromolecules.  There has been tremendous progress in our understanding of  the statistical physics of large molecules in the past two  decades.  However, even the basic ideas from polymer science  are largely unknown to biologists, and even to most  biochemists.  Further, while in principle useful, much of  polymer statistical mechanics is ill-adapted for application  to biopolymers.  Most of polymer physics is aimed at  homopolymers or large-block copolymers subject to relatively  weak physical interactions on the scale of kT; by contrast  biopolymers are almost always heteropolymers whose function  is defined by their sequence, and their functions often  involve interruption of chemical bonds characterized by eV  energies.    This research will attempt to fill the gap between polymer  science and molecular biology using a two-pronged teaching  and research approach.  In the classroom, a cross-  disciplinary course will be developed aimed at  undergraduates in both physics and biology.  This course  will be integrated with a laboratory which will provide  hands-on experience with measurements of motion and forces  at the sub-cellular level.  Lab projects will include  analysis of microtubule dynami c instability, study of  elastic response of vesicles, study of cell and organelle  motility in cell cultures, and physical properties of single  DNA molecules; they will all involve quantitative analysis  of video microscopy data.  This will introduce physics  students to exciting research possibilities which are  developing in the field of molecular biophysics, and at the  same time can provide some basic background in polymer  physics to biology students.    The research program complements the course development by  focusing on theoretical descriptions of test tube  experiments on biomolecules, and the extension of those  descriptions to activity of biomolecules in living cells.  The main interest is on the interaction of DNA molecules  with one another, and with enzymes which modify DNA  structure.  The long term goal is a theoretical  understanding of the enzyme systems which regulate the  structure and topology of prokaryote and eukaryote  chromosomes.  The main question is how do cells duplicate,  recombine and segregate their centimeter-long genomic DNA's  without fatal entanglements or breakages.  %%%  This is a CAREER award integrating research and education  which is jointly funded by the Divisions of Materials  Research, Physics, Molecular and Cellular Biology and the  Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities.
