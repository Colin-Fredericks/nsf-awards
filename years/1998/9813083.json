 "awd_abstract_narration": "9813083  Franchek  This research project deals with the development of  nonlinear controller design methodology for regulating  sytems and its application to the power management of  vehicles.  The nonlinear controllers are comprised of  continuous nonlinear differential equations involving power  type nonlinearities.  The required nonlinearities and  structure of the controller are not preconceived by the  designer but emerge during the controller design process.  The execution of the controller design is based on the  following key steps: (i) enforcement of the time-domain  tolerances via frequency-domain amplitude inequalities,  (ii) development of acceptable design regions in the gain-  phase plane, (iii) identification of the nonlinear  controller structure as determined by the design regions,  and (iv) design of the nonlinear controller using classical  loop shaping tools (tools used by practicing engineers) and  quasilinearization techniques (sinusoidal input describing  functions).  To experimentally verify the design technology,  the power management of hybrid vehicles will be performed.  This not only serves as technology transfer, but also  ensures that key implementation issues have been fully  addressed.  ***",
