 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continuation of the Federal Statistics Fellowship Program is jointly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Bureau of the Census (Census), the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).  The program fosters collaborative and interdisciplinary research efforts that stimulate the development and advancement of methodology and social science research relevant to issues on which Federal statistical agencies seek to provide information.  This is accomplished by bringing academic researchers to work with statisticians and social scientists in the three Federal statistical agencies for up to one year.  Candidates for Fellows submit proposals for their research in a competitive application process.  Review Boards composed of prominent scientists appointed by the American Statistical Association (ASA), in consultation with Census, BLS, and NCES, review the proposals and select the Fellows.  ASA manages the publicity and outreach of the program to the academic community and the solicitation of Fellowship proposals, convenes the Review Boards, and administers the Fellowship Program, obtaining from each agency periodic progress reports on its Fellows.  NSF support gives national visibility and scientific credibility to the program within the academic community, which stimulates Fellowship proposals of high quality.  NSF support also strengthens the links between academia and the Federal statistical agencies.",
