 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9801120  Gerrard  In an era of decreasing funding for school construction and increasing student enrollment, school district administrators and concerned individuals are faced with many complex and sensitive decisions.  In general terms, the School District Planning Problem (SDPP) may be defined as how to manipulate school district site capacities and attendance boundaries to optimally manage school district resources over the long term.  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is focused on the research, design, and prototype development of Group Spatial Decision Support System (GSDSS) that will assist public school district officials and concerned individuals in the task of identifying, evaluating, and implementing effective solutions to the School District Planning Problem (SDPP).  The system will enable decision-makers to build models of school district enrollment with user-defined objectives and constraints, simulate facility capacity alternatives, optimize school boundary configurations, and facilitate negotiation and consensus building in the politically-charged school planning environment.  The system will facilitate the development of alternative long-term, cost-effective, and minimally disruptive strategies for school district planning that are sensitive to political reality as well as to the traditional fiscal and educational goals of district management.  The proposed system will contain several innovative optimization models and fast, efficient solution procedures, as well as a map-based graphical use interface and built-in group-based consensus-building techniques.   The development and commercialization of the proposed GSDSS can provide significant benefits not only to local school districts and communities, but also to the national education agenda as a whole resulting in a legacy of more effective educational systems nationwide.  The proposed GSDSS for school district management has excellent prospects for commercial application.  Assuming that the potenti al market includes school districts that serve more than 2,500 students, then there were approximately 3,800 districts in the market in l99S.  Such districts represented only 26 percent of all districts in the U.S., but they contained more than 80 percent of all enrolled students.  ***",
