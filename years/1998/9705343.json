Both one-  and  two-dimensional  systems  will  be  investigated, with the latter structures  used  primarily  to  develop the necessary chemistry for the  principal  goal  of  fabricating highly ordered and electrically addressable  one-dimensional  arrays of metal nanoclusters.   The  effects  of  polydispersity, structural disorder and trapped  charge  will  be  investigated,  and the long term goal of incorporating  molecular  level  contacts, such as gate electrodes, directly  to  molecular  scaffold structures using branched, helical polypeptides will  be  addresed.  %%%  This  project  involves a well integrated education and  research  effort aimed at using biomolecules to organize metal nanoclusters  and includes as a goal the creation of a room temperature Coulomb  blockade  device  as  a  possible  replacement  for  CMOS  memory  devices.   It  involves  a group of 2 graduate  students,  and  a  synthetic chemist and a physicist as PIs, both of whom appear  to  work  well  together  and have excellent established  outstanding  track  records in their various fields of expertise. The  project  will  provide students with interdisciplinary research experience  and  training  in  synthetic chemistry and  in  condensed  matter  physics areas such as transport measurements.  The students  will  also be working within the Institute of Molecular Biology at  the  Howard  Hughes  Medical  Institute to characterize  the   cluster  arrays using AFM and STM.  ***",
