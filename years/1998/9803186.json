 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe first two objectives of the proposal are to investigate the asymptotic \r\nstabilization and the approximation of infinite dimensional linear systems. \r\nWhen infinite dimensional systems are being stabilized it is usually \r\nattempted to find a state feedback such that the closed loop system is \r\nexponentially stable. The PI has shown recently that there is a class of \r\nsystems for which no feedback can be found such that the closed-loop \r\nsystem is exponentially stable. But a state feedback can be found such that \r\nthe closed loop system is asymptotically stable. It is proposed to continue \r\nthis investigation to obtain a clear understanding of the systems that can be \r\nasymptotically stabilized. The second objective of the proposed work \r\ndeals with the approximation of infinite dimensional systems using \r\nbalanced realizations. Progress on both objectives depends on improving \r\nthe understanding of infinite dimensional par-balanced systems. In \r\nparticular it is  expected that significant progress will be made in the \r\ninvestigation of so-called definitizable par-balanced systems. These \r\nsystems are symmetric in an indefinite inner product space and the main \r\noperator is definitizable. The third objective is to implement system \r\nidentification algorithms in various areas of applications. \r\n\r\nThese algorithms will make use of balanced parameterizations, which \r\nwere developed by the PI because of their potential superiority over \r\nconventional parameterizations.  Fundamental engineering problems are \r\nthe stabilization of unstable processes and the approximate description of \r\ncomplex dynamics by less complex mathematical models which \r\nnevertheless capture the important aspects of the full process. Such \r\napproximate models are often needed since they are amenable to \r\ncomputations and current engineering design methods. A significant part \r\nof the proposal is devoted to solving problems that have been identified in \r\nthe course of a collaboration with molecular biologists who are working \r\non biotechnological problems such as the investigation of protein-protein \r\ninteractions. Experimentation by surface plasmon resonance biosensors \r\nand NMR spectroscopy lead to complex modeling and data analysis \r\nproblems. Earlier theoretical results by the PI will be used to develop \r\ncomputational tools to improve on currently employed methodologies. An \r\ninteresting aspect of this proposal is that the three topics can be \r\ninvestigated using mathematical tools which are known as balanced \r\nrealizations.\r\n",
