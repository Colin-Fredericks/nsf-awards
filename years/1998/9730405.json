New liquid crystalline materials, new  realizations of familiar phases, and even entirely new  liquid crystalline phases are continually being discovered.  In this grant theoretical research will be carried out on  two general aspects of the physics of liquid crystals:  chirality and layered structures.    Chirality of the mesogens is reflected in a rich variety of  equilibrium phases that include the cholesteric phase, the  blue phases, ferroelectric smectic-C* phase, and the A and C  twisted grain boundary phases. This research seeks to  elucidate the relationship between the structural chirality  of these phases and chirality at a microscopic level. Other  problems that will be studied that are related to chirality  include: chiral structures in columnar phases, chiral  pathways from the nematic to smectic-A phase, and phase  transitions to the twisted grain boundary C phase.    A major part of the reseach will be devoted to the study of  2D smectic lattices that form from DNA segments that are  intercalated between lipid bilayers.  Coulomb forces lead to  interactions between lattices in adjacent layers. These  structures are important in gene-therapy research.  A major  focus of the proposed research will be to study the  statistical and structural properties of these complexes.  Models for these phases that interpolate between one-  dimensional smectic and two-dimensional columnar phases and  show promise of predicting new equilibrium phases  characterized by orientational but not positional  correlations between 2D DNA lattices will be explored.  Phases exhibited by free standing smectic films will also be  studied.  %%%  Liquid crystals are materials that possess properties, such  as the ability to flow, associated with liquids, and  properties, such as optical anisotropy, as sociated with  crystalline solids.  New liquid crystalline materials, new  realizations of familiar phases, and even entirely new  liquid crystalline phases are continually being discovered.  Lubensky will continue his theoretical inquiry, in close  connection with experiments, into traditional and novel new  liquid crystalline materials.  A central theme of this  research involves the investigation of many of the rich  variety of phases that occur in these materials and how  fundamental symmetries, such as whether or not a molecule  can be superimposed on its mirror image, and properties at  the molecular level, influence macroscopic properties of  observed phases. Of particular interest are novel phases  involving DNA segments that play a major role in gene-  therapy research and how a phase responds to an externally  applied electric field. This research will also contribute  to the training of the next generation of experts in these  technologically promising materials.  ***",
