 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project's primary objective is to rigorously test deductions derived from an existing formal model using established datasets supplemented with historical information.  The investigator will use the New York Times Index and Time Magazine's Almanac of the 20th Century to gather news stories on the conflictual behavior of major powers undergoing power transitions from the mid-19th century to the present.  The stories' text will then be transformed to numberical data, using a combination of hand coding and the KEDS content analysis software.  The resulting data will then be used to test existing deductions concerning conflict behavior near power transitions.  Completion of this project will achieve two purposes.  First, it will allow for a rigorous test of deductions from a formal model of the dynamic power-conflict relationship.  That model integrates two traditionally competing theories of war--power transition and balance of power--by examining the conditions under which each applies and by developing a more general theory of conflict behavior.  The deductions are decidedly distinct from those generated by either traditional theory alone.  Second, it will produce a useful dataset for other international conflict scholars.  Pre-WWI conflict data is an untapped resource.  Researchers interested in other theories of conflict, e.g. the democartic peace, arms races, and escalation dynamics, will also benefit from this collection effort.  The information gathered could potentially lay the foundation for a more exhaustive events dataset for the 19th and early 20th centuries.  This would be a very positive step toward extending the rich tradition of events data into the more distant past.  This award will help further the investigator's career objective of making a significant contribution to the field of international relations.  This will help her attain a tenurable record in a field where there are very few women and even fewer tenured women.",
