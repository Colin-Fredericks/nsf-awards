 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical  Abstract  Proposal Number:  9808809 PIs:  Strassmann and  Queller  The theory of kin selection, which has been  supported by numerous studies, predicts that  there will be conflicts within social insect  colonies, yet they display extraordinary degrees  of cooperation.  An important possible  explanation is that if workers have a collective  interest, they may use their greater numbers to  win conflicts and suppress other parties, in  particular the queen.  Strassmann and Queller  will test this theory in stingless bees, a  large, tropical group closely related to honey  bees. Specifically, they will study conflict  over male production. Using DNA microsatellite  markers to precisely \"genetically fingerprint\"  individuals, they will determine who produces  the males (queen or workers) and whether this  result indicates that workers do reproduce  directly or if worker reproduction is  suppressed. They will also perform observations  to test theoretical predictions about the degree  of behavioral conflict such as overt fighting  that occurs in colonies, and contrast the  results with similar research done on honey  bees.  This research is expected to reveal much about  the expression and resolution of genetic  conflicts within social groups.  This is a topic  of importance not only for social insects, but  also for all other social organisms.  It also  bears on the coherence of other levels of  biological organization, such as multicellular  animals and the eukaryotic cells.  Finally, the  research will also increase basic knowledge of  an important group of tropical pollinators.",
