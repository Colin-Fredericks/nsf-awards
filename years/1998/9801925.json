This proposal consists of various segments  addressing GLOBE Program needs: support for existing  protocols, development of new protocols, and scientific  research with GLOBE data.  This proposal will the support  and development of support the current set of GLOBE soil  moisture protocols and learning activities.  Soil moisture data collected by GLOBE students represents a  unique and valuable resource to Earth scientists.  The GLOBE  student data have the potential to become the first readily  accesible, long-term, and consistent record of near-surface  soil moisture available on a global basis.  This soil  moisture data can be used to validate satellite microwave  derived soil moisture estimates and to validate this  component in GCM and mesoscale models.  The prospect for  direct validation of microwave data is limited by the  current launch schedule, but there is much that can be done  comparing these observations to seasonal patterns in forward  models of microwave soil response.  The area of weather and  climate model initialization, updating, and validation holds  more short-term promise, since the current parametrization  of soil moisture is crude.  Improving the representation of  land-surface hydrology is a major focus of this research.
