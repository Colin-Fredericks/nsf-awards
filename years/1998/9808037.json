 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will research new tools for improved data  structures and management of a major biological database in an  effort to standardize nomenclature, conceptual information and  semantic content, all key problems of community databases. The  prototype system developed earlier will lead to a fully  evolved, distributed system during this phase. The Universal  Virus Database (ICTVdB), an advanced, biological database  maintained for the International Committee on the Taxonomy of  Viruses (ICTV), serves as the prototype. An international team  will collaborate to develop and test software for functional  integration and web-based access to two widely used, stand-  alone special purpose software tools that have been  independently developed to handle taxonomic data. The tools to  be refined and integrated for ICTVdB are DELTA (Description  Language for Taxonomy) and Micro-IS (Microbial Information  System). Integration will preserve the unique features of  each, while providing the widest capabilities for disparate  requirements of various user groups, through a conversion  program that automatically translates DELTA formatted data to  Micro-IS format. DELTA, with its supporting suite of  applications, facilitates both the building oftaxonomic  descriptions in natural language and the identification of  unknown biological entities by matching with known entities.  Micro-IS is designed for the storage, management, and analysis  of biological data via an object oriented database engine. The  resultant tools will be applicable to any biological database  that seeks to make the most effective use of information from  a multitude of levels. The ultimate goal of this project is to  provide software tools with common standards to be used as  Windows 95/NT desktop and/or web-based applications. These  will convert ICTVdB from a reference resource to a research  tool for studies of phylogeny and evolutionary relationships.  The tools will also enhance access to a well-curated community  database in v irology for client use and facilitate routine  submission of emerging data. All of the products of this  research project will be available to investigators in other  fields for existing applications and further enhancements.
