 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grandinetti is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   to study non-crystalline silicate glasses using NMR spectroscopy.  The   primary objectives of this project are (1) to apply two-dimensional   solid-state NMR methodologies in the measurement of structural   distributions in silicate glasses, and (2) to develop oxygen-17   solid-state NMR as a probe of oxygen coordination number and geometry in   silicate materials.  The increased understanding of the structure of   network modified silicate glasses that will emerge from this work is   expected to help refine potential functions used for molecular dynamics   simulations of silicates, to assist in confirming structural   thermodynamic models of silicate glasses and melts, to improve   understanding of ionic transport, and to increase the utility of   oxygen-17 NMR as a probe of related systems such as ceramics, catalysts,   and biopolymers.  The characteristics of non-crystalline materials can be varied by   adjusting their compositions, an advantage in the design and preparation   of materials with controllable properties.  The structure/property   relationships in non-crystalline materials, however, need to be   understood better in order to facilitate design strategies for materials   with predictable features.  The combined experimental and computational   study of glassy materials in this project will enhance the knowledge base   for materials development, and impact as well on fields such as inorganic   geochemistry and waste containment glass technology.",
