For examples, they showed up in the\r\nindex theory of loop space; in the computation of Donaldson and\r\nSeiberg-Witten invariants; in the counting problems of rational curves\r\nin mirror symmetry.  They have also appeared in mathematical physics\r\nand in the construction of topological invariants of 3-manifolds.  The\r\ninvestigator considers it very important to study these new phenomena\r\nsystematically and to find further applications of modular forms and\r\nmodular invariance in geometry and topology.  Modular invariance\r\nshould be the key to the understanding of the geometry and topology of\r\ninfinite dimensional manifolds, such as loop spaces.  The investigator\r\nhopes to combine modular invariance and many classical techniques in\r\ngeometry and topology to solve several problems in geometry and\r\ntopology related to modular forms.\r\n     Modular invariance, which is called the symmetry of nature by Edward\r\nWitten (I.A.S.), quite often arises from mathematical physics, in\r\nparticular, from string theory.  It is interesting to notice that the\r\nmost beautiful mathematical objects in string theory always have the\r\nproperty of modular invariance.  While modular invariance already has\r\nsome very interesting applications in geometry and topology, a deep\r\nand geometric understanding may tell us that modular invariance is\r\nalso the symmetry between mathematics and physics.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
