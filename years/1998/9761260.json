 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project has the following objectives:  (1) To genetically manipulate C. Flavigena to synthesize increased amounts of the KUSP1 polyglucan and (2) investigate the feasibility of new applications of the polymer. C. Flavigena is a gram positive bacterium; hence its useful beta-1,3-polyglucan product should not be contaminated with lipopolysaccharide endotoxins.  The polymer is insoluble at neutral pH and soluble in mildly alkaline solutions; hence its gellation is easily controlled.  Modern molecular biological techniques will be employed to develop a KUSP1 `over-producing` strain.  In parallel we will examine the applicability of KUSP1-based gel systems for electrophoretic applications.  The successful completion of this study will result in a ready supply of this polymer at an attractive cost for the commercial applications listed:  a) Enhanced oil recovery via `in situ gellation` of the polymers in reservoirs, b) Encapsulation of medicines for `controlled release`, c) Encapsulation of agricultural chemicals, and d) Gelling agent/thickener/stabilizer in food products.  This award is supported by the Small Business Innovation Research Program and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).",
