Ten students are recruited nationally each year for the program.  Women, minorities, persons with disabilities, and students from colleges where research opportunities are limited are encouraged to apply.    The potential areas of research for the students include: observational and theoretical cosmology, extragalactic and galactic astronomy, interstellar medium and star formation, laboratory astrophysics, supernovae and supernovae remnants, and planetary science.   The program activities include trips to nearby observatories, taking part in informal scientific talks, and attending a colloquium series.  The students write a research paper and present the results of their projects at an Intern  Symposium at the end of the summer.  The students will have an opportunity to use optical and radio telescopes at the Oak Ridge Observatory in Massachusetts and  to visit Haystack Radio Observatory,  a major research facility in Massachusetts not too far from Cambridge.  There will  be opportunities for selected students to present a paper on the results of their research at a professional society meeting.    The program begins in mid-June and runs until mid-August each year.   The applicants must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents and enrolled in a degree program leading to a bachelor's degree.  The application deadline is February 15th.  The information about the program, including application information, is available at the SAO Summer Intern Program Web site: http://hea-www.harvard.edu/REU/REU.html.  ***",
