 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870313  Michael R. Culbertson : Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) refers to the accelerated rate of decay that occurs when translation of an mRNA containing a nonsense mutation is prematurely terminated. mRNAs that prematurely terminate are called nonsense mRNAs. NMD serves two important purposes in eukaryotic organisms ranging from yeast to humans. It provides a mechanism of RNA surveillance to ensure that translation produces full length protein products, and it down-regulates the accumulation of some naturally-occurring pre-mRNAs and mRNAs by targeting them for rapid destruction. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the NMD pathway overrides the global default pathway for mRNA decay, which is normally dependent on the rate of mRNA deadenylation at the 3' end.   Deadenylation independent decay is achieved through the action of three proteins encoded by the UPF1, UPF2, and UPF3 genes. Upf1p is an ATP-dependent nucleic acid helicase that most likely acts in a late step in the NMD pathway possibly by altering mRNA topology to favor decapping and decay.  Upf1p unwinds both RNA and DNA substrates indiscriminately in vitro, suggesting that other factors may be required in order to selectively unwind only nonsense mRNAs in vivo. The investigator has proposed that Upf2p and Upf3p may function in this capacity and may act earlier in the NMD pathway than Upf1p. All three of the Upf proteins associate with polyribosomes, but a significant fraction of each protein is also detected in a form that is dissociated from polyribosomes. Upf1p and Upf3p exhibit a markedly different cellular distribution. Upf1p localizes exclusively to the cytoplasm whereas Upf3p localizes both to the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Upf3p contains sequence elements that direct nuclear import and export. By analyzing mutations in a nuclear export sequence element (NES) in Upf3p, genetic evidence was obtained suggesting that the export of Upf3p from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is required for a functional NMD pathway. The overall objective of this research  is to further confirm this finding and to find out why Upf3p, which is believed to perform its sole function in the cytoplasm, should enter and exit the nucleus as a prerequisite for its ability to function in the cytoplasmic NMD pathway. The specific aims of the research are to understand the roles of nuclear import, export, and nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of Upf3p and the role of nuclear pore proteins and exportins in NMD.  The information generated could reveal how substrate recognition by the Upf1p helicase can be achieved through a cross-compartmental mechanism.    The structures of proteins that catalyze steps in metabolism and that orchestrate growth and development are specified by the genetic code in DNA. Quality control mechanisms exist at several levels to ensure that all proteins are produced exactly according to genetic instructions. The genetic code is translated into protein structural information through an intermediary called messenger RNA (mRNA), which contains a transcript of the information in the gene. A quality control mechanism called RNA surveillance has recently been discovered that ensures that all mRNAs produce full length, functional proteins. RNA surveillance is accomplished by a mechanism that causes the rapid destruction of mRNAs that have mistakes in them that prevent their coding of full length proteins.",
