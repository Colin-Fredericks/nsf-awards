 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on identifying, characterizing and examining the   reactivity of organic molecules that occur in interstellar space.      Species known, or likely to exist in interstellar space will be generated   in low temperature matrices in the laboratory and characterized by a   variety of spectroscopy techniques.   Laboratory results will be   correlated with radioastronomical searches to identify new species in   interstellar clouds, and the carriers of diffuse interstellar bands.     The research will introduce graduate and postdoctoral students to   low-temperature matrix-isolation techniques, spectroscopic   characterization of the isolated species, and a unique interdisciplinary   application of these techniques.  With this Renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   supports the research of Professor Robert McMahon of the Department of   Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin.   Professor McMahon's research   will address questions regarding the nature and chemistry of the   reactive, organic fragments known, or postulated to exist in interstellar   space.   Intermediates thought to be present in interstellar space will   be prepared in the laboratory, spectroscopically fingerprinted, and the   spectral data compared with radioastronomical data to establish their   presence in interstellar clouds and diffuse interstellar bands, and to   identify other species present.    Professor McMahon's educational   activities will include the training of graduate and postdoctoral   students.",
