 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported in the   Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focuses on the use of new   technology developed by Professor Liu and her students at Wayne State   University to very precisely modify surfaces incorporating self-assembled   monolayers.  Modification methods are being developed to allow the study   of biorecognition processes and to use their specificity to develop new   types of chemical sensors on very small (sub-micrometer) scales.  This   CAREER research project also involves the introduction of new surface   chemistry courses and laboratories into the graduate and undergraduate   curricula.  Participation in a novel `Smart Sensor and Intelligent   Devices`course by Professor Liu and her students will enhance the   possible outcomes of this sort of interdisciplinary research.   The integration of advanced materials processing methods and the   expanding field of molecular biology has broadranging implications.    Professor Liu and her students at Wayne State University have developed   microfabrication methodologies which hold great promise for the assembly   of devices which allow for the study of biorecognition processes which   can be further utilized for the creation of sensor devices of extremely   high specificity.  The outcome of such research can be envisioned to   extend to a new generation of environmental and biological monitors.    Professor Liu extends the interdisciplinary nature of sensor development   program to the graduate and undergraduate curricula to introduce her   students to new ways of thinking about chemical research.",
