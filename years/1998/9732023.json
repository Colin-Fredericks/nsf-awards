Williams of the Department  of Physics of Wake Forest University describes a research program  for the characterization of materials based on far-field optical  microscopy.  The goal is atomic scale identification and  characterization of local and extended defects in inorganic  materials.  Specific phenomena which will be observed and studied  by this technique include local diffusion of adsorbates in  zeolites, single molecule imaging of fluorescent dyes in organic  host matrices, Cesium 3+ clustering at interfaces of fluoride  hosts, 3D mapping GaN/AlN films, and characterization of  desorption -induced defects in ionic and semiconducting systems.  The proposed work involves new, high-risk, high-payoff research.  %%%  This proposal by Professor Richard T.
