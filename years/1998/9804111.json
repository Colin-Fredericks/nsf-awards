 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804111  This research project attempts to develop new ways to analyze and  test the integration aspects of software components, particularly  for object-oriented software. As more software is developed using  object-based designs and object-oriented languages, the problems  of integrating the components become more crucial to the success  of the software. This research project addresses these  integration problems through software couplings, which are the  paths through which software components communicate. The project  applies coupling in four related directions. (1) Develop  practical, effective, formalizable, automatable techniques for  testing connections between components during software  integration. (2) Extend and refine traditional coupling metric  definitions to handle language features of modern languages. Use  couplings to develop precise measurements, and develop complete  algorithms for measuring complexity based on couplings. (3)  Develop algorithms for using couplings to compute how much a  proposed change will affect the rest of the system. This change  impact analysis is used for planning, cost estimation, and  decision making. (4) Finally, use couplings to determine the  amount of regression testing that needs to be done after a  maintenance change is made.***",
