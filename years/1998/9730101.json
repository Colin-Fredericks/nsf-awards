 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research undertakes a series of seven experiments designed to test theoretically derived predictions hypothesized to explain the causes and correlates of the Own Race Bias.  The ORB, the tendency for people to be better at identifying members of their own racial group in comparison to members of other groups, has been demonstrated empirically for years, but remains unexplained.  The first four studies examine the impact of variables hypothesized to underlie the ORB.  Specifically, perceived typicality, familiarity, and memorability may interact with race and perceptual expertise to determine facial recognition accuracy.  In addition, the role of racial attitudes, cognitive strategies people use to search their memories, and their eye scanning patterns will be examined.  The other three studies investigate whether and ORB exists for descriptions of faces, whether incentive motivation to remember influences accuracy, and the ORB exists not only for photographs, but for lineups.  In each case, research participants will be shown photographs or videotaped stimuli and later asked to identify previously seen individuals who have been embedded within new distractor stimuli.  Participants are self-identified African Americans, of mixed racial ancestry, or white non-Hispanics.  Stimuli are African American or white.  Dependent variables common to each of the studies are hit rate, false alarms, and A' signal detection measures.  Data will be analyzed via MANOVA. This work will not only have direct theoretical relevance to social and cognitive psychological theories, but applicability at the practical level as well.  For example, the occurrence of an own-race bias to responses in lineup situations has direct relevance for what should or should not be testified to by expert witnesses in court cases.  %%%  This research undertakes a series of seven experiments designed to test theoretically derived predictions hypothesized to explain the causes and correlates of the Own Race Bias.
