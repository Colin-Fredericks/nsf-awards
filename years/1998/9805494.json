 "awd_abstract_narration": "Othmer  9805494       The principal investigator and his colleagues formulate and  analyze mathematical models for the motion of individual,  non-interacting cells and for the collective motion of cellular  aggregates in which cells interact strongly.  They use the  cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum as the model system  because it exemplifies both the free-ranging movement of  individual cells and the collective motion of aggregates, and  because it is widely used as a model experimental system for the  study of cell movement.  There is a large body of experimental  data on this system, and several labs have agreed to share their  new data as it becomes available.  Three complementary  subprojects are pursued in parallel.  The first is to investigate  an individual cell-based model that incorporates internal  structure and active force generation and allows the  investigators to evaluate various theoretical proposals for  individual cell movement.  The second involves the formulation of  a higher-level, cell-based model used for analyzing the  collective motion of many cells, and the third employs a  continuum approach in which the cellular system is modeled as a  viscoelastic fluid with contributions to the stress tensor from  both the intracellular stress and the viscoelastic interactions  between cells.  Current information on the movement is used in  the formulation of the models, and the ongoing interaction with  experimental groups provides feedback on the validity of the  models and enables the investigators to suggest experiments to  test the models.  However, what is learned on cell and tissue  movement not only is applicable to Dictyostelium discoideum, but  also can be used in several other contexts, including embryonic  development, wound healing, and the immune system.       Cell and tissue movement plays a vital role throughout the  lifespan of many organisms.  Bacteria and other single-cell  organisms find food and avoid repellents by swimming in favorable  directions,  and cells such as macrophages in the human immune  system must detect sites of infection and move toward them in  order to ingest bacteria and cellular debris.  At the tissue  level, the coordinated movement of aggregates of cells plays a  critical part in such diverse processes as early embryonic  development and wound healing.  Thus it is important to develop a  better understanding of cell movement and its control, both in  the low-density regime where cells move individually, and at  tissue-level densities where cells interact strongly and move  collectively.  Mathematical modeling can play an important role in  understanding these processes by testing hypotheses that are  difficult to test experimentally with current technology.  A  better understanding of how cells and tissues move will lead, for  example, to a better understanding of the formation and control  of bacterial biofilms, which are deleterious in contexts such as  medical transplants, but valuable in contexts such as pollution  control and drug production.",
