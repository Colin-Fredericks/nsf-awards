Fantone    This is a proposal requesting support for student travel for 1998 Integrated Photonics Research Topical Meeting to be held in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, March 30-April 3, 1998.    The subject matter to be addressed in the scope of this conference embraces research in important research areas that are growing rapidly as photonics and integrated optics play a major role in optical communications.  Integrated photonics promises to enhance the functionality of the optical components, to improve components reliability and to reduce the cost of manufacturing.  The funds granted to support this conference will be used for travel of graduate students with highest priority given to students who are presenting papers at the conference as first authors..  This is appropriate utilization of NSF funds, since the experience obtained in attending conferences are often invaluable to the graduate students in educational terms, in establishing professional contacts and in job searching.    I recommend an award to be made for the sum of $2,000 for this conference.",
