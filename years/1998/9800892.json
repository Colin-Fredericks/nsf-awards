 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cox-Foster  IBN-9800892      Insect hosts and their parasites are valuable study systems, research from  which contributes to invertebrate physiology, basic ecology and evolution,  and pest management alternatives. Certain groups of parasitic wasps attack  specific caterpillar hosts. They are protected from the normal host immune  response by polydnaviruses, whose mode of action is not well understood  physiologically or evolutionarily. This study hypothesizes that  polydnavirus mechanisms are different among wasp groups, and that points of  divergence can be identified by comparing results of biological assays for  interspecific protection with physiological assays of host response to  polydnavirus. The proposed project will allow comparison of physiological  responses to virus from other parasitic wasps of differing relatedness, and  ask if the mechanism we previously described in one group is the same or  different. Additionally, work allowing direct comparison of viral DNA will  be initiated. Results from the proposed project will provide important  contributions to: 1.) understanding the immune physiology of  polydnavirus-mediated host/parasite relationships, and 2.) determining the  impact of divergent polydnavirus evolution on wasp success and long-term  evolution. The results of the proposed study are also relevant to  biological control since physiological parameters used may be useful  predictors of host range.",
