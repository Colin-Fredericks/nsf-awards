 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project focuses on the controversies surrounding William Herschel's observations on double stars, nebulae, and the planets.  Herschel  parted company with contemporary astronomers by attending to the appearance of celestial objects rather than to measuring their positions.  As most eighteenth-century astronomers were equipped with small aperture refractors, rather than the large reflectors Herschel employed, many were unable to resolve the objects Herschel reported.  The unconventional nature of Herschel's instrumentation and observing practices made it difficult for other observers to evaluate his claims.  Were the stars he observed really double, or was their `doubleness` an artifact of his telescopes?  Herschel sought to make his catalogue of double stars the test of the `goodness` of the telescope, but as the doubleness of many of these stars was itself in dispute, the debate over the meaning of resolution continued well into the nineteenth century.  One way in which Herschel sought to convince other astronomers of the reality of his findings was to make reflecting telescopes for them, much as Galileo had done in the seventeenth century.  While Herschel's commercial telescope venture is commonly treated as distinct from his `more important astronomical endeavors, this dissertation research project will argue on the contrary that the business is a crucial and unexplored dimension of his astronomy.  By making telescopes for others, Herschel helped to ensure the acceptance and diffusion of his cosmological speculations.                                                    \u00c1\u00c1\u2524\u00c1\u2524 ?\u2551\u2551?\u255d\u00a5\u2510>\u2563\u00a5` \u00c2?\u255d \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u2563>\u2514\u00c1\u00a2\u00a5\u2563\u00c0/\u00a5?\u255d \u00a5? \u00a2\u00a5\u00c1\u2551 \u2524?\u2534> \u00c2\u255d?_ \u00a9\u00c1\u255d \u00c2\u2510%% \u00a5\u2563_\u00c1 /\u2524_\u2563>\u2563\u00a2\u00a5\u255d/\u00a5\u2563\u2514\u00c1 \u2524\u2510\u00a5\u2563\u00c1\u00a2 />\u2524 \u2524\u00c1\u2524\u2563\u2502/\u00a5\u00c1 \u00a9\u00c1\u255d\u00a2\u00c1%\u00c2 \u00a5? \u255d\u00c1\u00a2\u00c1/\u255d\u2502\u00a9 />\u2524 \u00a5\u00c1/\u2502\u00a9\u2563>\u00c0   \u00bf> ?\u255d\u2524\u00c1\u255d \u00a5? _/,\u00c1 \u00a5\u00a9\u00a2 \u00a5\u255d/>\u00a2\u2563\u00a5\u2563?>  />\u2524 \u2510%\u00a5\u2563_/\u00a5\u00c1% ` \u00a5? \u2593\u00c1 \u2502?_\u2551\u00c1\u00a5\u2563\u00a5\u2563\u2514\u00c1 \u2563> / \u00a5\u2563\u00c0\u00a9\u00a5 \u00d5?\u2593 _/\u255d,\u00c1\u00a5  \u00a2\u00a9\u00c1 \u2534\u2563%% >\u00c1\u00c1\u2524 \u00a5? \u2563>\u00a5\u00c1>\u00a2\u2563\u00c2` \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u255d/\u00a5\u00c1 /\u00a5 \u2534\u00a9\u2563\u2502\u00a9 \u00a2\u00a9\u00c1 \u2502?>\u2524\u2510\u2502\u00a5\u00a2 \u255d\u00c1\u00a2\u00c1/\u255d\u2502\u00a9   \u00bc\u00a9\u00c1 /\u2534/\u255d\u2524 \u2534\u2563%% \u2551\u255d?\u2514\u2563\u2524\u00c1 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 ?\u2551\u2551?\u255d\u00a5\u2510>\u2563\u00a5` \u00c2?\u255d \u00d5\u2510\u00a2\u00a5 \u00a2\u2510\u2502\u00a9 / \u2593??\u00a2\u00a5               { U",
