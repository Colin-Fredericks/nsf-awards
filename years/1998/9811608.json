The PI, Dr. Roozbeh Kangari, Professor  and Director, Building Construction Program, Georgia  Institute of Technology, was a long-term research visitor to  Japan in 1989-90 in the Japan-U.S. Fellowship Program that  preceded the CGP Fellowship Program which was established in  1992.    Fourteen participants representing a range of ages,  subsequent research experience, duration of the CGP  Fellowship, science/engineering disciplines, and regional  distribution will be invited to participate in the workshop.  One graduate student who is knowledgeable about the program  also will participate and assist Dr. Kangari.  The workshop  will be held at the National Science Foundation in  Arlington, Virginia, May 7 and 8, 1998.    This workshop represents the first formal evaluation of the  CGP Program and should be beneficial in strengthening the  program in the future and in attracting a larger number of  qualified applicants.  Support is provided by the Japan  Foundation Center for Global Partnership.  ***",
