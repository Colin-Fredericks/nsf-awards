 "awd_abstract_narration": "9871539  Ross    This grant is an interdisciplinary collaboration on the  synthesis and magnetic characterization of two-dimensional  arrays of 50 nm and smaller magnetic particles, known as  `nanomagnets.'  In this size regime, particles of  ferromagnetic metals such as cobalt or nickel exhibit single-  domain behavior, and mechanisms for magnetization reversal  are observed that do not occur in larger particles.  These  periodic nanomagnet arrays are used in fundamental studies  of magnetic interactions and switching.  They are also  examined as functional nanostructures for data storage, in  which the magnetization state of each particle represents a  single data bit.  The goals of the research are:  i) to  establish a synthesis method for periodic nanoparticle  arrays with particle sizes in the 10 - 50 nm range, covering  areas of several square centimeters; ii) to investigate  magnetic interactions, switching and anisotropy as a  function of the particle microstructure, anisotropy, and  geometry of the array; and iii) to design and test particle  arrays for data storage applications in which each particle  stores a binary bit.  Using interferometric lithography,  structures of 100 - 200 nm period have been made with areas  of over 80 sq. cm and the aim is to extend the period down  to 50 nm.  To extend the scope of the investigation soft x-  ray nanolithography will be employed to make large-area non-  periodic structures, such as patterns with circular  geometry.  Fabrication of large-area arrays allows  characterization by vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) and  torque magnetometry (TM), as well as by magnetic-force  microscopy (MFM).  Samples with a range of geometries are  used to investigate inter-particle interactions using VSM  techniques, and time-or temperature-dependent magnetic  behavior.  The results are related to a micromagnetic model  for switching in arrays of nanomagnets.  To integrate these  nanomagnet arrays into a data storage system, reading and  writing schemes will b e investigated.  This award is a  selection under the NSF 98-20 initiative on Functional  Nanocrystalline Materials.  %%%  The work uses interferometric lithography to fabricate large-  area nanomagnet arrays.  After exposure of a photoresist  using interferometric lithography to form a template,  magnets of up to 500 nm in height are made by  electrodeposition.  This method is ideally suited to making  large-area periodic nanostructures quickly and economically.  In comparison, other methods for making particles on this  size scale are limited to very small areas or to high cost.  This fabrication method gives wide latitude to the range of  structures and geometries that can be created: square,  oblique or hexagonal arrays of cylindrical, disk shape, or  elliptical particles, with a range of interparticle spacings  with controllable saturation magnetization and controllable  direction and magnitude of the magnetic anisotropy.  ***",
