 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD 98-01630    Williams    Dayton Public Schools is a midsize urban school district in Ohio which serves a student population that  is nearly 68% African American.  In spite of focused attention to science and mathematics achievement  over the past six years, the district s African American students continue to underperform their peers  on state tests of science and mathematics proficiency.  In addition, they have low rates of participation  in advanced courses in science and mathematics and their failure rates are higher than those of other  district students.     In this application the district proposes a Science and Mathematics Systemic Reform Program which  will bring together the resources of diverse school and community partners to carry out an innovative  plan that will result in measurable improvements in the science and mathematics performance of  minority students, increasing their potential for successful participation in postsecondary study in  science, engineering, and mathematical fields.  In previous collaborative efforts with its local partners,  the school district has established a solid foundation from which to launch a comprehensive reform of  science and mathematics education.  Initiatives undertaken during the past six years have focused  primarily on:  revision of the K-12 science and mathematics education curriculum; inservice training to  improve teachers' content knowledge and teaching skills in science and mathematics; and the upgrading  of science laboratories and equipment.  In addition, substantial progress has been made in the  application of technology and the use of community resources in the reshaping of science and  mathematics education within district schools.    The proposed project addresses the remaining barriers that contribute to the continuing  disproportionality of student achievement and impeded the progress of all district students in  mathematics and science learning.  It will consist of multiple components, including:    o  comprehensive staff de velopment for all elementary faculty and all secondary science and     mathematics teachers    o  administrative leadership development to support the assessment, supervision, and instructional     delivery of science and mathematics education    o  implementation of a coaching system utilizing specially trained science and mathematics specialists     as on-site resource support for the achievement of teaching excellence    o  development of videotape models of exemplary science and mathematics instruction for use as     professional development tools    o  establishment of improved methods of evaluating student achievement in science and mathematics     and accessing this data more frequently for closer monitoring of educational outcomes    o  a restructuring of middle and high schools into collaborative learning communities which operate as     teams and promote the use of research as a base for improving science and mathematics teaching    o  the infusion of technology to enhance both the instruction and the instructional management of     science and mathematics education    o  enhanced student academic support and enrichment programs in science and mathematics and     efforts to increase parental involvement in science and mathematics learning support    o  systematic attention to policy issues that will promote equity and excellence in science and     mathematics for all students in the district.",
