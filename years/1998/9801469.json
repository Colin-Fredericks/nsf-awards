 "awd_abstract_narration": "9801469  Chao    It has been predicted that evolution by natural selection should proceed by small steps because advantageous mutations of small effect should be more common than advantageous mutations of large effect.  The theoretical justification for this prediction is credited to Fisher, who theorized that mutations of large effect are more rare because they are more likely to have deleterious side  effects.     This study provides the first experimental test of Fisher's model by following the evolution of laboratory populations of an RNA virus that harbors a deleterious mutation.  Frozen samples from the populations will be saved at set time intervals, and evolution in the populations will be reconstructed by measuring the fitness (relative growth rate) of the frozen viruses.  Preliminary results show that the viruses recover from the deleterious mutation by evolving higher fitness through natural selection.  They also show the fitness increase can be by many mutations of small effect, as predicted by Fisher.  This study examines in more detail the properties of those small mutations.  In particular, the interaction between the original deleterious mutation and the small mutations is considered by examining whether the small mutations, in the absence of the original deleterious mutation, may be themselves deleterious.  The demonstration that the small mutations are deleterious when alone is an important result because it shows that two deleterious mutations can interact to become advantageous. Such interaction provides the initial step for the potential evolution of new viral species.",
