 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for the development of a week-long faculty workshop which is intended to assist mechanical, electrical and computer engineering faculty in the development of project-based, collaborative learning exercises. The goal is to present a workshop in which faculty will actually participate in a \"hands-on\" project in order to assist them in developing a understanding of how fundamental topics in the engineering curriculum can be applied in engineering practice - to make a distinction between \"academic problem solving\" and \"engineering decision making\". The workshop will group faculty in small \"design-build\" teams, provide them with a \"statement of opportunity\", a schedule, computing, fabrication and material resources and \"technical\" support. Each faculty team will define, design, fabricate and demonstrate an autonomous, computercontrolled electro-mechanical system. The purpose of the project is to provide these faculty with the opportunity to apply their own discipline expertise to team-based decision making in the product development process . This experience can then be used by participating faculty in developing similar experiences for their own curriculum. Part of the workshop will include the topics of establishing specific project goals, identifying deliverables, such as written or oral reports and prototypes, appropriating resources and developing effective project schedules. The unique feature of this two-year project is that in these workshops the faculty will actually be engaged in the \"team-based\" product and process development process, so they can then carry their own experience, not those from a book or lecture, back to their classroom.",
