 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to build a collaborative  structure involving personnel from Boeing's Mathematical and  Engineering Analysis Division (John Betts and Daniel Pierce) and  NCSU's Applied Mathematics program (Carl Meyer, Stephen Campbell,  Ilse Ipsen, Carl Kelley and four graduate students) to  investigate problems of mutual interest which arise in  the design and development of modern aircraft.    Modern manufacturing techniques attempt to utilize sophisticated  automatic assembly machines to reliably construct a product while  reducing production cost and time.  The problem of modeling  the  motion of complex dynamical systems such as robot arms,  multi-axis milling machines and automated assembly tools is a  central issue in the effort toward manufacturing modernization.   Complex differential-algebraic equations (DAE's) are often at the  heart of these problems, and the goal is to use these DAE's to  simulate system performance, thereby avoiding ad hoc process  design approaches and circumventing the need to build physical  mockups.  Notwithstanding recent advances, computer simulations  in these areas are not always performed using the DAE's because  state-of-the-art solution technology for DAE's is not robust and  reliable enough for everyday use.  Instead, engineers convert the  problems to initial value differential equation problems and  treat algebraic constraints using heuristics.  As a result of  this ad hoc process, each problem requires special treatment  which not only translates into increased costs, but extends  product-to-market times.  The net result is a degradation in both  industrial and national competitive advantages.    This joint academic-industrial research project focuses on some  immediate problems requiring advanced and robust DAE solvers.  Specific applications include Boeing's current tool planning  project which is aimed at optimizing the path of a trim tool in  the production of airplane parts, the solution of an inverse  problem that uses measured d ata to determine actual air  pressures, and the trajectory planning problem required for  Boeing's high speed civil transport project. Common to each  application are DAE models which require advances in DAE solution  technology before more sophisticated production engineering  computing tools can be developed.    The joint research effort will be facilitated through regular  short visits by members of each team to the other team's site,  and it will be further strengthened by installing NCSU graduate  students in Boeing's Mathematics and Engineering Analysis  division.    Boeing will allocate a substantial amount of salary support from  their research budget to allow members of their team to engage in  this collaborative effort.  Boeing will provide facility support  in the way of office space, computing hardware and software,  library resources, etc., while NCSU team members visit Bellevue.   NCSU will reciprocate when Boeing personnel visit Raleigh.    Boeing will provide funds to help support NCSU graduate students  working on the project commensurate with their level of  involvement.  These funds will provide salary and living expenses  for students while at Boeing.  While at NCSU, the graduate  students would be supported by traditional research  assistantships through this grant.    It is anticipated that the regular visits the PIs make to the  other team's site would be short (on the order of two to three  weeks per visit), but flexibility for longer visits exists.  The  NCSU students would stay at Boeing for longer periods so as to  become fully integrated in the applications and research.   Students could be at Boeing from anywhere between a few weeks to  several months, depending on project needs and individual  circumstances.    Boeing will also grant a license for use of their nonlinear  optimization software for the use of the team of principal  investigators at North Carolina State University.      It is currently estimated that developing a complete solution to  the optimization  of the path of tool trim problem could result in  a substantial cost reduction of all Boeing machined tools and  parts.  It would also allow Boeing to achieve its targeted  manufacturing rates while stabilizing employment oscillations and  improve the quality of its manufactured parts.  the savings are  expected to be substantial by the year 2000 when it is hoped that  a sizable percentage of the machining tools at Boeing will be  using these methods.  In the years to follow, the cost savings  are expected to be truly dramatic.  Moreover, this is a  fundamental industrial need, used in manufacturing everything  from components of your car's continuous velocity joint, the mold  for your computer's cabinet, to the booster rockets on the Space  Shuttle.  The advances made on the machine path problem would  have a very wide ranging impact.        This GOALI project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
