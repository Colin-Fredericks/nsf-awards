 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804053  Expressing programs as the composition of mix-and-match parts  that communicate via aggregate data structures (lists, trees,  arrays, etc.) is a well-known modularity technique that  simplifies the construction, modification, and verification of  software systems. Unfortunately, programmers often eschew this  technique to avoid the time and space costs of creating,  manipulating, and disposing of intermediate aggregates.  Deforestation is an optimization that reduces these costs  by automatically eliminating some of these aggregates.  With  existing deforestation mechanisms, (1) it is difficult to predict  which aggregates will be eliminated, and thus difficult to reason  about the time and space requirements of the optimized program,  and (2) only simple aggregates and/or producer/consumer  topologies can be handled. The goal of this project is to design  a predictable deforestation technique that addresses these  limitations via a type system that distinguishes between real  aggregates present at run-time and virtual aggregates eliminated  at compile-time. The type system will (1) indicate that  deforestation is possible (or warn the programmer when it  is not); (2) permit the programmer to reason confidently about  the time and space requirements of the optimized program; and (3)  handle a wide range of aggregates and producer/consumer  topologies. Predictable deforestation will be implemented in a  compiler for the ML programming language.***",
