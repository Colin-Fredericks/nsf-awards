The dates for the meetings of both the IUPAP  Executive Council and General Assembly are March 16-21,  1999.  In 1996, the 23rd General Assembly accepted this  invitation and a National Organizing Committee (NOC) was  appointed by the NAS under the auspices of the USLC.  Financial and administrative responsibility has been  conferred on The American Physical Society (APS).  The GA  governs the affairs of IUPAP and meets once every three  years, the last having been held in Sweden in 1996.  The  U.S. has hosted the IUPAP GA in 1987, in Washington, DC.  The organizational and business work of the GA consists of  selection of officers, reports from the 22 disciplinary  commissions and affiliated commissions, officers and  committees, and action on proposed resolutions on policy  matters.  By associating the GA with the APS centenary,  additional fora, round tables and scientific sessions will  be provided for the delegates.  This will contribute to the  scientific vitality of the meeting and permit the  participants to interact with a much larger group of  colleagues than would normally be the case.  This meeting  will promote improved cooperation in physics research in the  U.S. and abroad, and will benefit the U.S. program.  ***",
