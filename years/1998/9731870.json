The subject of the study is the  relationship between early syntactic and vocabulary  development.  Previous studies have approached the problem  from the point of language production, with mixed results.  The new method they will apply, comprehension method of  preferential looking, to assess young children's grammatical  knowledge.  The project will establish the new method in  Australia leading to more accurate assessments of linguistic  knowledge in children acquiring English around the world.  The Australian investigator, Edith Bavin, is internationally  known and respected for her linguistic research.  She has  recently turned her attention to the acquisition of  knowledge, particularly native languages of Australia.  Thus  this collaboration also holds the possibility of  increased  insight on the main problem based on knowledge of  acquisition of languages other than English. This is a new  partnership which promises to lead to increased cooperation  in linguistics between the United States and Australia.",
