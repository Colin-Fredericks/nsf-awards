 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diller proposes to study the iteration of rational maps on complex projective space, focusing primarily on birational maps of the projective plane. Chaotic sets for such maps tend to occur as the support of certain positive closed currents, thus pluripotential theory is a natural tool to use in understanding the dynamics of birational maps.  Diller plans to take this insight a step further, by understanding a birational map entirely in terms of its action on appropriately chosen positive currents.  For instance, he proposes to replace the projective plane by a dynamically defined quotient of the space of non-constant analytic disks as the natural domain of a birational map.  The hope is that since the refined domain will not have points which are indeterminate for the map, it will be a more natural setting for constructing and understanding the dynamically significant currents.   A dynamical system is any process that evolves in time-for instance, the weather or information traffic on the internet.   It is often both very useful and very difficult to understand the behavior of such systems.  The problems and solutions concerning such systems are often mathematical and can be reduced to sets of equations which can then be analyzed theoretically by hand or experimentally by computer simulation.  This work will contribute to the further understanding of still more complicated and ever more realistic systems.",
