 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626542  Marshall         While much has been learned over the last decade concerning the  electrification of thunderstorms, quite a bit is still unknown.  There are several  competing theories concerning the mechanism by which charge centers develop, but  research is still ongoing to determine which of these are valid and under what  conditions.        Under this award the Principal Investigator will pursue two research  objectives: (1) investigate how electric charge inside thunderstorms evolves during  the life of the storm; and (2) investigate whether most of this charge is carried on  precipitation-sized particles.          To accomplish these objectives, the Principal Investigator will participate, in   conjunction with other researchers, in two observational efforts   one in New  Mexico and one in Oklahoma.  Beneath thunderstorms, the Principal Investigator  will launch balloon-borne instruments that will measure the electric field bulk charge  and the charge on individual precipitation particles.  To meet objective (1), a series  of balloons will be launched about ten minutes apart into each storm to be studied.   The locations of the main charges in the storm can be inferred from the electric field  measurements made with each balloon launch and with other supporting  instrumentation from aircraft.          To meet objective (2), the findings from the precipitation particle charge  instrument will be compared to the bulk charge inferred from the electric field  measurements.          Both of these experiments will provide information on how thunderstorms  acquire large amounts of electric charge.  By providing information about the  evolution and distribution of charge in thunderstorms, this research will advance the  current understanding of how these dangerous and damaging thunderstorms become  electrically charged.  ***",
