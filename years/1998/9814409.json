 "awd_abstract_narration": "9814409 Russo The objective of this research is to examine the early experience with the ISO 14001 environmental management standards.  These standards, finalized in 1996, are intended to support a voluntary program under which corporations and other organizations may adopt a set of process-oriented practices for environmental management.  Two questions will be addressed by this research.  First, what are the determinants of ISO registry?  In an industry populated by many competitors, what factors predict whether and when facilities will seek registry?  Second, has ISO registry influenced subsequent environmental performance?  Many corporations, wary of the cost and energy that must be invested in ISO 14001 registration, and regulators, since successful voluntary regulation can be fore effective than direct involvement by public bodies, would like to see the system's benefits demonstrated.  Viewing these research questions as empirical issues is valuable on its own.  But the field of organization theory points to several variables that can be expected to play roles in explaining antecedents and outcomes of ISO 14001 registration.  A set of preliminary hypotheses based on theories of how organizations respond to external stimuli are sketched out and applied to the ISO 14001 movement.  This study will concentrate on the American electronics industry, where considerable ISO 14001 activity has taken place.  Different methodologies will be used to test each of the research questions posed.  The study of the determinants of ISO registration will employ event history methods, which are well-suited to the analysis of discrete events occurring across time.  The study of the environmental effects of registration will employ multiple regression analysis using a number of control variables.  Once in place, the data base assembled under this research program will be updated periodically.  In this way, a complete source of information can be made available for analysis and dissemination in academic, professional and pedagogical outlets.  This grant is made pursuant to the joint NSF/Lucent Technologies Industrial Ecology Research Fellowships Program 1998.",
