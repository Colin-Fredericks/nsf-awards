 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to design an efficient VLSI  implementation for certain algebraic geometry codes, to fabricate  a chip, and to identify applications where these codes would be  competitive.  The codes to be considered are Hermitian codes and  other codes similar in structure.  The advantage of these codes  is that, for a given symbol size, they are longer than Reed-  Solomon codes and can therefore take better advantage of the law  of large numbers to give much greater error correction  capability.  A number of decoding algorithms for these codes  exist, including those developed by the co-PIs.  We will combine  the best elements of these algorithms into an explicit  computational algorithm that is well suited to VLSI  implementation.  The goal is to produce a chip that uses parallel  processing, regular and simple structures, simple logic, and a  minimal number of iterations.  We will verify the logic design  using a VHDL simulation.  We will also identify systems where  these codes would be appropriate and test the performance of the  decoder in channel simulations appropriate to those applications.",
