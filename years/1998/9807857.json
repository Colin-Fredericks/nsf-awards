The conference topics are arranged around five  themes:  1) neuronal cell fate and differentiation, 2) neuronal  survival and neurotrophic factors, 3) axonal guidance and path  finding, 4) synapse development and plasticity, and 5) signal  transduction in the nervous system.  Participants will be from the  US and Asian countries including China, Japan, Singapore, and  Taiwan.  The conference is planned as the first of a series  jointly run by the Gordon Research Conferences (GRC) in the US and  the Xiangsan Science Conferences (XSC) in China.  It will combine  the scientific excellence of the GRC and the strength of XSC in  organizing conferences in Asia.  It will provide a unique  opportunity for scientists from the US and Asia to communicate  scientific findings and to explore new areas of international  collaborations.  The meeting will provide unique opportunities for  junior Asian neuroscientists to interact with leading  neurobiologists in the world, and could have major impact on Asia-  US scientific exchanges.",
