 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enable computational scientists to temporally and spatially manage, navigate, and document large, multi-dimensional datasets using advanced virtual reality (VR) technologies.  \r\n\r\nThe primary objectives are to:\r\n\r\n Research and develop a spatially and temporally-based VR software Application Manager, coupled with a generalized navigation and interactive recording applications programming interface (API), for use with CAVE, ImmersaDesk, and Infinity Wall applications\r\n\r\n Enable scientists to mange, navigate, and document interactive VR explorations in realtime and then re-render the simulation data at higher resolution in non-real time; this will provide researchers with a better understanding of their science, as well as provide video-based educational materials\r\n\r\n Disseminate information to the national scientific community using educational materials developed with these advanced VR technologies\r\n\r\nScience and engineering researchers attempt to solve complex problems by first probing the data to discover underlying principles, and then documenting the results so they can be reproduced by the research community.  Three-dimensional VR displays provide a far more powerful interface for data exploration that the two-dimensional workstation screen.  The importance of real-time VR navigational recording and playback is twofold: (1) it provides and efficient mechanism to store navigational data for subsequent renderings of full-resolution simulations; and (2) it supports asynchronous collaboration among networked VR remote sites.\r\n\r\nThis project software will also link to network communication libraries to enable CAVE-to-CAVE recording mechanisms-the key to supporting asynchronous collaboration.  Funds are sought to support graduate students and summer faculty research.\r\n",
