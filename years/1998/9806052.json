The project concentrates on elucidation of two major  features of progressive failure of overconsolidated clays:  material properties and failure mechanism.  The primary  objectives are to develop diagnostic failure analysis that  will enable systematization of major laboratory and in situ  soil strength tests by ranking them according to their  degree of susceptibility in instabilities and localization;  and to closely observe and investigate the mechanisms of  plane strain deformation of overconsolidated clays.  Subsequent numerical simulations will explore whether the  plane strain experiments can be successfully used for the  extraction of constitutive properties.  The classification  of the laboratory testes will utilize the notions of  homogeneously deforming samples as opposed to boundary value  problems.  It will improve the method of selection of soil  strength parameters for design purposes.  The project will  further the career of the PI by extensively in her  publications, thus enabling her to develop a balanced  combination of theoretical and experimental expertise in her  field.  ***",
