 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726767  Happer    This award supports a three year collaborative research  project between Professor William Happer of Princeton  University and Professor Tsutomu Yabuzaki of Kyoto  University in Japan.  The researchers will be undertaking  studies relating to new applications for laser optical  pumping of high density, low temperature gases.  The  objectives of the research are:  (1) to undertake a complete  detailed characterization of optical pumping in low  temperature cells, coated with superfluid He. and (2) to  develop an experiment to measure the electric dipole moment  (EDM) of atomic Cs in a superfluid He coated cell.     This project brings together the efforts of two  laboratories that have complementary expertise, research  capabilities and equipment.  The collaboration will unite  the experimental and theoretical expertise in laser optical  pumping and spin exchange at Princeton with the cryogenic  techniques developed at Kyoto University.  The Japanese  collaborator is a world leader in the manipulation of alkali  metal vapors in cryogenic cells.  The research should  provide insight into the validity of current theoretical  models of optical pumping and possibly help ameliorate some  of the disagreements between theory and experiments that  currently exist.  Through the exchange of ideas and  technology, this project will broaden our base of basic  knowledge and promote international understanding and  cooperation.",
