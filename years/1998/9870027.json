Kalton    Abstract:    The aim of  this proposal is  to study a  number of problems related to the notion of an extension of one Banach space by another,  and  the  relationships  between  extensions   and unconditional  structure.   It  is  proposed  to attempt to resolve the conjecture that if every minimal extension of  a Banach space is  trivial then the space has finite cotype, and  to  attempt  a  classification  of those spaces so that every extension by a Hilbert  space is trivial. Both  these problems can be reformulated  in other terms and  would have considerable  significance  independent  of  the  theory  of extensions.  The proposer will also work on the fundamental problem in the theory of unconditional structure of  whether every  complemented   subspace  of   a  Banach   space  with unconditional basis also has an unconditional basis.    The theory of extensions can be considered in the following terms.  Suppose we are given a centrally symmetric solid  in three or more dimensions and we are allowed only to  compute its  cross-section  by  a  slice  in some directions and the shadow cast  by the  body in  the perpendicular  directions. This  allows  us  to  compute  certain information about the solid, but  not to reconstruct it  completely.  The aim of this project  is to obtain more  complete information about the body under certain additional conditions. It turns  out that many questions of importance in mathematical analysis and applications, although not  expressed in this form, can be visualized as problems of this nature, perhaps  involving infinite dimensions. An unconditional basis in a particular class of  functions  is  a collection of relatively simple functions with which we can approximate every member of  the class;  such  approximations  are  very  important  for many practical  situations,    for  example   in  engineering applications. One of the aims of this project is to decide general conditions under w hich  a basis can be constructed. There is interaction between the theory of extensions and of unconditional bases which this project will explore further.",
