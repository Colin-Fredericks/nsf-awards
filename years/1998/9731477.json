 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the design and analysis of dynamic computer  processes.  Past research in theoretical computer science has  focused mainly on static computation problems, where the input is  known before the start of the computation and the goal is to  minimize the number of steps till termination with a correct  output.  Many important processes in today's computing are  dynamic processes, whereby input is continuously injected to the  system, and the algorithms is measured by its long term, steady  state, performance.  Examples of dynamic processes include  communication protocols, memory management tools, and time  sharing policies.  The goal of this project are: (1) To develop  new tools for analyzing the performance of dynamic processes, in  particular through modeling the dynamic process as an infinite  stochastic processes.  (2) Use the insight obtained from the  above analysis to obtain provably better algorithm for  fundamental dynamic processes such as (a) dynamic data  structures, (b) communication protocols, and (c) resource sharing  protocols.  (3) Validate the analysis though simulations to  develop algorithms of both practical and theoretical interest.",
