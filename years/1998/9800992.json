 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interconnect is rapidly becoming one of the most important  factors in influencing the behavior of integrated circuits.  This project addresses the problem of developing next-  generation computer-aided design tools to handle these  problems. The objective of this work is to apply recent  advances in fast simulation of interconnect to solve  optimization problems in interconnect design. Specifically,  problems related to the design of supply busses, clock  networks and signal nets are being investigated.  In case of  supply nets, structured mesh topologies that provide a good  tradeoff between performance and ease of analysis are being  considered.  In case of signal nets, the problem of building  optimal rectilinear Seiner trees under an environment of  resistive, capacitive and inductive effects are being  studied, with consideration to the interactions with  detailed routing.  In addition to delay, the work  incorporates considerations of signal integrity and  manufacturability during the optimization.",
