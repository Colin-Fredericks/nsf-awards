 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Lakeland Community College Bioscience Technology Program, developed in response to the growing demand for bioscience technicians in the region, is the only associate degree biotechnology program in northern Ohio. The program is being developed in a joint effort by scientists in the biotechnology industry, and researcher/educators in academic institutions. The curriculum provides students with the fundamental scientific knowledge and practical experience necessary to function as competent bioscience technicians.   The laboratory improvement project impacts bioscience majors, science majors and non-majors, as well as health science students.  It achieves the following: 1. Provides state-of-the-art equipment to train and retrain bioscience technicians; 2. Establishes a summer institute for college and high school faculty; 3. Effects systemic changes in high school and college science curricula; 4. Conducts biotechnology workshops for high school students; and 5. Develops a Biotechnology Tech Prep Program.  Programs and laboratory exercises developed within this project are being made available to the scientific community through internet access and public discussion.",
