 "awd_abstract_narration": "974122  Dilcher    This Americas Program dissertation enhancement grant will  fund Mr. Carlos Jaramillo, under the direction of Dr. David  Dilcher, University of Florida, on a study of the  palynostratigraphy and sequence stratigraphy of four Andean  provinces in the western, northeastern, central and eastern  Colombian Andes.  The study will include a detailed  taxonomic survey of pollen/spores and comparison with living  taxa.  It is anticipated that the research will provide data  for recognizing flora constituents in the region during the  Paleogene , as well as  refine the existent biostratigraphic  resolution.  The main goal is to identify patterns of  palynologic responses relative to sea-level and base-level  changes, and distinguish them from evolutionary changes.  The use of palynology (pollen/spores) palynofacies are  proven and adequate techniques to make geological and  vegetational reconstructions. The research will provide an  integrated overview of the geological and  vegetational  development during this period,  and will provide a critical  link in the knowledge of the Paleogene history of northern  South America.    The Paleogene encompasses major evolutionary progress,  especially within the angiosperms, and major changes in  global circulation and climatic changes, sea-level  fluctuations and tectonism.  However,  its history in  northwestern South America remains largely unknown due to  the scarcity of detailed geologic research.  An adequate  understanding of important large-scale events, such as the  Andes uplift process and its relation to the high species  diversity in the area, has been hindered by this lack of  information.  Furthermore,  some of the most important  hydrocarbon reservoirs in the region are located in  Paleogene and Eocene continental rocks, in zones with high  structural complexities.  A better understanding of the  paleogene stratigraphy and biostratigraphy will enhance the  successful exploration of these reservoirs.  ***",
