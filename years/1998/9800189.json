 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the development, validation and refinement of a methodology for electromechanical system diagnosability modeling and evaluation.  The work focuses on two objectives:  1) the development of analytical modeling methods and metrics for the prediction, during conceptual and embodiment design, of life cycle costs associated with the isolation of faults; and 2) the development of methods to decrease, for existing systems, the costs associated with fault isolation through optimized maintenance procedures.  The utility of these methods as design tools will be validated and refined by application, concurrent with the design process, to a selected complex electromechanical system.       If successful, the results of this research will be methods for the prediction of life cycle costs associated with fault isolation and for the generation of optimum maintenance procedures.  Validation on a complex commercial product during the actual design process will assure the industrial relevancy, applicability and accuracy of the methodology.  Although validated on a specific system, the methodology will be applicable to most electromechanical systems, with the greatest potential benefit for systems with higher degrees of complexity.  For complex systems, fault isolation costs can be a significant part of total life cycle costs, and the application of the results of this research could significantly reduce these costs through increased system maintainability.",
