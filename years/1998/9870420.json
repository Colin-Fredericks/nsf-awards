 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports ongoing research in the area of   numerical modeling of basic and applied problems that arise  in the physics of liquid crystals.  The work is interdisciplinary   in nature, involving collaborations with physicists in the Liquid   Crystal Institute at Kent State University as well as with   computer scientists and applied and computational mathematicians   at Kent, Purdue University, and the Courant Institute.  The   emphases of the work will be in three project areas: (1) numerical   modeling of equilibrium orientational properties of confined   liquid crystal materials, (2) developing and utilizing modern CS  problem-solving environments (for rapid prototyping of such numerical   codes and packages), and (3) numerical modeling of the interaction   between a laser beam and the liquid-crystal medium through which it   is propagating (to investigate and validate modeling and asymptotic   analyses performed on such a system by a group at Courant).    Liquid Crystals are materials capable of existing in states   (call \"mesophases\") in between solids and liquids.  They enjoy   properties of both.  They are fluid; yet their molecules tend   to orient themselves in certain preferred ways (depending on   inter-molecular forces, geometry, conditions at boundaries,   external applied electric or magnetic fields, and the like).  They have significant commercial importance because of applications   in the display industry.  Modern liquid crystal devices (with   microscopic geometry and interfering neighboring effects) now   require considerable two- and three-dimensional numerical modeling   for analysis and design.  The proposed work will contribute  to the advancement of the general state of the art for this type   of scientific computing while numerically modeling specific   systems of current interest.",
