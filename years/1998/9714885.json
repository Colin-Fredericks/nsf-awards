Under this Program, the National Science  Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Office of Naval  Research are jointly evaluating and supporting research of high priority to the  USWRP.  One of the primary goals of the USWRP is to perform the research  necessary to improve track and intensity forecasts of hurricanes.        The goal of this research effort is to improve understanding of the role of air-  sea interactions in modifying the near-surface wind structure of tropical cyclones.   Of particular importance is to understand the role of these interactions as tropical  cyclones pass over warm oceanic features that surround the United States Eastern  Seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico states.          Specific research objectives are: (a) Determine locations and heat content of  warm core oceanic eddies;  (b) Examine the forcing of warm ocean features on  enhanced surface stresses, fluxes and waves in the APBL and the role of the OPBL  feedback on the APBL; and (c) Quantify the roles of mixing and horizontal  advection of SST and salinity gradients including the mass, heat and salt budgets in  the OPBL.        Research approach involves an ocean monitoring program based on satellite  remote sensing to detect warm, mesoscale oceanic features during the summer  months. These features will be monitored using the analyzed sea-surface height  anomalies derived from the NASA TOPEX and Geosat Follow On missions to  determine their locations relative to the forecast storm track.  Sea surface  temperatures will be monitored from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer.        Additionally, as part of the NOAA Hurricane Research Division experimental  field program, a coupled atmospheric and oceanic ob servational program will be  conducted from an NOAA aircraft.  Observations will include measurement of upper  ocean current, temperature and density structure using airborne expendable profilers.   Concurrent observations of the turbulent fluxes of momentum, heat and moisture in  the APBL during these oceanographic deployments; and remote-sensing of surface  winds and stresses using the Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer and airborne  C-Band Scatterometer, and possibly 2-dimensional directional wave spectra from the  NASA Scanning Radar Altimeter will be acquired during reconnaissance and  research missions.          Successful completion of this research will lead to a better understanding of  the role of warm upper oceanic features on surface wind variations.  This may lead  to improved boundary layer parameterizations and improved hurricane intensity  forecasts.  ***",
