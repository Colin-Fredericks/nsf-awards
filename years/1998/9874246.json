 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed study will 1)assess the extent to which USI projects have been able to effect the system of NSF drivers and whether causal relationships among the drivers can be identified in measurable terms, 2) examine impacts of curriuculum reform in elementary and secondary schools, and 3) investigate the interdependet roles of leadership, local resources, policies at all levels, and stakeholders involvement in efforts to improve student achievement in mathematics and science.  Four USI cities (Chicago, Miami, Memphis, and El Paso will be compared, both district-wide and in a sample of early and late cohort elementary and secondary schools.  The research design proposed is a multiple method strategy consisting of three investigations:\r\n1) Mathematics and Science Attainment study -- developing a structural equation model of the hypothesized causal relationship among the latent varibles (Drivers)\r\n2) Study of the Enacted Mathematics and Science Curriuculum -- using the Measures of constructivist curricula have been implemented\r\n3) Policy Study - conducting a policy analysis that will examine coordination and alignment in state and national educationalpolicies affecting districts and schools.",
