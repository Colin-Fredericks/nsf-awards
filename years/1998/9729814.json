The objective of the proposed research projects is to investigate control and coordination of an underwater vehicle-manipulator system. An inertial sensor, water speed sensor, and digital compass are integrated to provide accurate estimates of vehicle motions.  A novel nonlinear feedback control algorithm is developed to compensate for vehicle-manipulator dynamic interactions.  Because of the uncertain nature of undersea environments and lack of hydrodynamic modeling data, it is crucial to validate theoretical algorithms by physical experiments.  The proposed instrumentation makes it possible to conduct physical experiments using the proposed half-dry half-wet approach.  The experiments not only validate the control algorithm proposed in this research, but also establish an entirely new, cost-effective underwater experimentation procedure.  The integrated sensor system (replacing the water speed sensor by wheel encoders) is also applied to an all-terrain land vehicle for wheel slip estimation and for improved traction control.",
