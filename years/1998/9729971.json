 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multivariate problems appear in many diverse applications;  yet they are often intractable in the worst case setting. A  significant part of the research will concentrate on the  study of multivariate problems in the average case setting.  In particular, the study of the reduction in complexity by  switching from the worst case to the average case setting  will be one of the central foci. This will enrich  understanding of the average case complexity of important  multivariate problems and will provide new algorithms that  solve worst case intractable problems with small expected  cost and small expected error. Related to the average case  analysis are path integrals. The research will provide  complexity bounds for his important problem and should  reveal new algorithms that are more efficient than Monte  Carlo methods (that are commonly used) for some path  integrals. One of the approaches in studying path integrals  is through the analysis of multivariate weighted integration  and approximation over unbounded domains. A part of the  research will deal with the complexity of such problems. In  addition to theoretical results, the research will result in  efficient software for such problems as multivariate  integration/approximation, weighted  integration/approximation, and path integrals.",
