 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Proposal: DMS-9804833  Principal Investigators:  Ian Anderson and Mark Fels    Formal differential geometry is the study of localized deformation  invariants defined on the solution space of a given differential  relation.  These deformation invariants arise as cohomology classes in  various invariant variational bicomplexes defined on the jet spaces of  the given differential relation.  The objectives of this research  proposal are to develop new methods for the computation of these  localized deformation invariants, to study the properties of these  invariants through the use of jet bundle techniques, and to develop  new applications of formal geometry in global analysis, integrable  systems and mathematical physics.  Three avenues of research are  proposed.  The first project will explore the relationships between  the variational bicomplex for two differential equations which are  related by one of the various integration or reduction methods, some  of which date back to Lie and Vessiot.  The second project is based  upon two new extensions of the inverse problem of the calculus of  variations.  One extension is directed towards the existence and  classification of Hamiltonian structures; the other extension seeks to  characterize integral invariants arising in global analysis such as  the Kazdan-Warner integrals which obstruct the solution to the  prescribed curvature problem.  The third project is motivated by the  role that the variational bicomplex plays in the general theory of  characteristic classes and seeks to generalize this role to general  pseudo-group actions on fiber bundles using the method of moving  frames and differential invariant theory.    The prevalent theme of the proposed work is symmetry.  By the symmetry  of an object one means the group of motions in space which leave the  object unchanged.  The symmetry of a cube includes discrete rotations  by 90 degrees about each one of its 3 axis.  The symmetry group of a  sphere includes the continuous rotations t hrough any angle about any  axis through the center of the sphere.  In problems in applied  mathematics, differential geometry and mathematical physics, one is  interested in the symmetries which leave the governing (differential)  equations unchanged.  Such symmetries are extremely important in  studying both the analytical and qualitative features of the governing  equations.  Indeed, almost all known exact solutions of important  non-linear equations (such as the Einstein, Yang-Mills, or harmonic  map equations) have a high degree of symmetry and can be obtained by  symmetry methods.  Nevertheless, there are many theoretical and  practical issues yet to be studied.  In particular, theoretical  techniques which have previously been computationally inaccessible can  now be investigated using powerful symbolic mathematics computer  programs.",
