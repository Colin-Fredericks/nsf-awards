The  research will employ the facilities at the Microkelvin Laboratory  at  the  University  of Florida, and the National  High  Magnetic  Field  Laboratory at the University of Florida and Florida  State  University.  The  research focuses on magnetic and  thermodynamic  properties of solid Helium-3, an isotope of Helium. Solid Helium-  3  exhibits  novel and complex magnetic phases as a  function  of  magnetic  field  and temperature. The transition from  the  high-  field  phase  to the paramagnetic phase of anti-ferromagnetically  ordered  body-centered-cubic Helium-3  will  be  investigated  at  magnetic fields and temperatures previously unavailable. A second  investigation will use the technique of cascade magnetization  to  study  ferromagnetic ordering of the hexagonal-close-packed phase  at  temperatures in the microKelvin range. A third  project  will  study the magnetism of droplets of frozen Helium-3 in a matrix of  Helium-4,  the  other  and more common isotope  of  Helium.  Here  surface effects influence the magnetic properties of the Helium-3  in  ways that are not understood. The research provides excellent  training  of  graduate students and post-doctoral  associates  in  cutting-edge research in the properties of matter at extremes  of  (low) temperature and ultra-high magnetic fields. This background  prepares  the  students  for careers in  a  range  of  employment  opportunities, from basic research to technological areas.  %%%  This  is an experimental project in low temperature physics.  The  research will employ the facilities at the Microkelvin Laboratory  at  the  University  of Florida, and the National  High  Magnetic  Field  Laboratory at the University of Florida and Florida  State  University.   The   research  focuses   on   the   magnetic   and  thermodynamic properties of magnetically ordered solid  Helium-3,  an isotope of Helium. Solid Helium-3 is a model magnetic mat erial  that  exhibits complex magnetic phases as a function of  magnetic  field and temperature. It is novel in that these phases are found  only at ultra-low temperatures and at ultra-high magnetic fields.  The  research therefore demands unique instrumentation  available  only at a few laboratories in the world, including the University  of  Florida  and  Florida State University. The experiments  will  investigate  the magnetic properties of Helium-3 at  temperatures  within  a few millionths of absolute zero, and at magnetic fields  that  are  a  billion times the strength of the earth's  magnetic  field.  The results are of fundamental interest but are  relevant  to  all  fields of magnetism where magnetic properties vary  with  temperature  or  magnetic field. The research provides  excellent  training  of  graduate students and post-doctoral  associates  in  cutting-edge research in the properties of matter at extremes  of  (low) temperature and ultra-high magnetic fields. This background  prepares  the  students  for careers in  a  range  of  employment  opportunities, from basic research to technological areas.  ***",
