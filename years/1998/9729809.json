Each of these projects involves the development of large simulators and the use of compute-intensive simulations that require powerful dedicated processors, large RAM capacity, and large I/O capacity. Research in ILP processing involves developing decentralized execution models and studying them by detailed, parallel simulators. Research in automatic benchmark generation involves developing techniques to automatically generate multiprocessor benchmark programs from concise algorithm specifications, which aids in identifying the top-performing algorithm on an individual system basis. Research on finite element computations deals with predicting wave propagation from large structures by developing and implementing high-order space-time finite element methods and appropriate data structures for simulating them on multiprocessors.   Research on nonlinear controllers involves the development of improved nonlinear dynamic models for active magnetic bearing, and their validation via dynamic simulation on multiprocessors. Research on nonlinear vibrations focuses on using multiprocessors to develop models and computationally intensive techniques to solve the equilibrium and linearized vibration of complex, nonlinear, fluid-structure systems used in textiles and high performance underwater cable structures applications.",
