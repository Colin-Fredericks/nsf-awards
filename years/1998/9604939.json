 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested for the further development and upgrading  of the Electron-Spin Echo Spectrometer that was constructed under  NSF grant B1R-9224431 in 1993-1995. The main directions of ESE  instrumentation development are:         1. Increasing the sensitivity to weak modulation by       implementation of a /2 increment phase cycle with a       quadrature detection scheme and by several other improvements       described hereafter.       2.  Extension  of  the frequency range of  the  existing  ESE       spectrometer  down to 2 GHz, to give a unique  wideband  2-18       GHz ESE spectrometer.       3. Implementation of a broadband pulsed ENDOR spectrometer.         This research equipment will be employed in several different  research projects including: general development of pulsed ESR  spectroscopy focused on detection of the extremely weak Electron  Spin-Echo Envelope Modulation (ESEEM) with special emphasis on its  Pulse-Adjustable variant; investigation of the structures of model  heme complexes and heme proteins; investigation of the structure  of the molybdenum and heme centers of sulfite oxidase (SO) and  model molybdenum (V) complexes; studies of cytochromes P450 and b5  from insects and the effects of point mutations on their heme  centers; characterization of coordination compounds of large ring  systems and determination of their molecular recognition  properties.         The wide range of biological research problems addressed in  this proposal clearly demonstrates the comprehensive capabilities  of this state-of-the-art spectrometer that combine broad-banded  ESE and pulsed-ENDOR in a single flexible system. The diverse  capabilities and high sensitivity of the proposed instrument will  enable the surroundings of metal centers in biological systems to  be mapped out in unprecedented detail. No presently available  commercial instrument provides all of the unique features proposed  here. The new generation of commercial instruments that are soon  to be marketed will c ontain some of these features but will cost  two to three times as much.",
