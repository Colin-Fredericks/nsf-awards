 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this conference is to develop a clearer understanding of cognitive processes that may be unique to the human species. During the past several decades, researchers investigating the cognitive abilities of animals (especially monkeys and apes) have focused on identifying the similarities between humans and other species. Indeed, one widely held view is that this research has definitively shown that there is nothing qualitatively different about human cognition. Nevertheless, there is an emerging body of research suggesting that humans have evolved specializations in several intellectual spheres, including those related to (1) language, (2) self-awareness, (3) understanding the beliefs, desires, and other mental states of other individuals, and (4) understanding the abstract causal principles that govern the movement and interactions of inanimate objects. In humans, these abilities emerge within the first few years of life, and profoundly affect our ability to acquire and use cultural ideas, symbols, and objects, and our ability to function in society.  The conference will bring together researchers and students from a variety of different academic backgrounds with a common interest in human cognitive specializations.  It will provide a unique opportunity to assess the current state of theory and research in this field, and help develop an agenda for future research leading to a deeper understanding of the distinctively human characteristics of the human mind.",
