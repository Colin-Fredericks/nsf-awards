 "awd_abstract_narration": "With over 265,000 specimens representing 6,239  species, the collection of the Division of  Amphibians and Reptiles at the Field Museum is one  of the five largest herpetological collections in  the United States.  By every measure the collection  is world class and heavily used.    Even greater usage is expected as the Division's  massive online herpetological database is improved.  Within the database, however, are some long-  standing problems which are now critical to resolve  in order to maximize its accuracy and usefulness to  both current users as well as the expanded  community expected to utilize online access.  Failure to correct these problems will have  deleterious effects as the errors in the database  are unnecessarily propagated in research, and in  professional and lay publications.    Since 1993 an attempt has been made to edit  portions of the database in response to incoming  requests for information or specimens.  However  this labor-intensive process is incompatible with  the high levels of normal collection activities  which occupy virtually all available staff time.  This piecemeal approach has resulted in  unacceptable delays in responding to some requests,  and it has taken time from other essential  collection curation tasks, thereby creating other  problems.  Furthermore, such an approach is  impossible to implement with open access to online  users. Only a comprehensive approach to resolving  the current problems in the collections and the  database can assure that online users will have  complete,correct, current information about the  collection.    In order to verify, edit, and inventory the  collection database this two-phase project will  implement:    1) A careful, complete verification of the  agreement between the locality data in the database  records, the original collector/donor-supplied  records, and the original catalogs, followed by the  correction of any discrepancies.    2) A comprehensive collection inventory to assure  the matching of the contents  of containers, their  labels or inventory lists, and the information in  the database; and, to assure agreement information  in  the database records and on data tags attached to  the specimens.",
