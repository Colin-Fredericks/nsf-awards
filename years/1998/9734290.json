 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop fast and accurate numerical algorithms  for linear algebra problems arising in engineering computations.  One class of such problems concerns matrices with displacement  structure.  This is a general algebraic concept and includes the  well-known classes of Toeplitz, Hankel, Vandermonde and Cauchy  matrices.  In practice there is the need for solving rapidly and  accurately, both exactly-determined and over-determined linear  systems involving such matrices.  Furthermore, in some  applications like inverse scattering for geophysical problems,  there is also the need for the rapid factorization of such  matrices.  Another related class of problems arises in adaptive  filtering applications, where there is a need to solve rapidly  and accurately a sequence of structured linear problems that are  related by low-rank changes.  In a different vein, the  computation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of symmetric  pencils is another important problem.  It frequently arises in  finite-element analysis of engineering structures and associated  model-reduction problems.  New models and fast algorithms for the  analysis of linear algebra problems with large bounded  uncertainties will also be developed.",
