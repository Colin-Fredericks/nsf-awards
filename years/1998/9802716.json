 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802716  Begley  This award provides support to purchase a nano-indentation  system which has the new feature of being in an environment  chamber allowing tests to be made from -50 C to  100 C on technologically important materials.  This  instrument allows a wide variety of tests, including  submicron-sized hardness tests, micro-scratch tests, the  determination of damping properties via force-displacement  measurements during cyclic indentation and constant load  creep tests.    The instrument will be heavily used by Institute of  Materials Science members in several materials projects:  (i) the measurement of individual layer properties in  conventional and nanocrystalline thermal barrier coatings  and nanocrystalline wear resistant materials, to provide  both mechanical properties for modeling and the  understanding of properties-microstructure-processing  relationships coatings, (ii) the mapping of highly localized  property changes due to aluminum depletion which leads to  phase and stochiometry changes, (iii) the measurement of  thin polymer properties at slightly elevated temperatures,  (iv) the measurement of thin film properties in electronic  devices at ambient and moderately elevated temperatures, (v)  characterizing of mechanical property variations in systems  experiencing interdiffusion between layers.    Finally, the instrument will be used for advancing the  understanding of properties revealed in experiments on the  very fine scale of nano-indentation.  It has been shown that  the deformation characteristics (and hence, inferred  mechanical properties) are influenced by length scales  presumed to be governed by the characteristics of the  microstructure.  The interpretation of mechanical properties  determined via indentation tests can not be separated from  the fundamental problem of length-scale-dependent behavior.  This work will extend current research in size-dependent  indentation and collaborate with experts in processing,  metallography and electron microscopy regarding  sample  preparation and characterization.  Additionally, open issues  remain on how to develop inelastic material properties from  indentation tests, particularly those that are time-and  temperature-dependent.  These issues will be addressed in  detail in on-going and future research programs.  %%%  ***",
