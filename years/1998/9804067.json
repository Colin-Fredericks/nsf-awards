 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804067  Managing the process of developing and maintaining software has  become the focus of organizations that need to deliver reliable  software in a cost-effective manner. To this end, two orthogonal  directions have been pursued: industry has developed standards,  while academic research efforts have focussed on formal models.  The goal of this research is to integrate these two approaches  through data analysis and measurement. In this project, new  techniques are devised for combining process data analysis with  process models, including analysis of concurrent behavior,  attribute relations, and real-time performance of processes. In  addition, an existing framework for process data analysis is  extended to provide support for these new methods, and tools are  constructed embodying these new techniques. Evaluation of the new  methods is undertaken by applying them to industrial, real-world  data, in conjunction with industrial collaboration. Providing  these techniques will empower those who develop software to  maintain truly optimizing processes---the rigorous framework of a  formal model allows the data analysis to measure the process in  an unambiguous manner, thus feeding back clear and insightful  information to the process. In addition to this practical impact,  this project will enhance and extend the  scientific knowledge of the process of developing reliable  software systems.***",
