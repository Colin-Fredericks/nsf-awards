The aim of the research is to explore the effects of  differences in social experience on the development of vocal  communication through studies of song learning in birds.  Three objectives are outlined. First, the influence of adult  social models on juvenile learners will be examined by  manipulating the nature of adult stimulation.  Measures of  the effects of social influence include vocal growth in the  young, use of signals, and competence as adults.  Second,  female perceptual preferences for vocal signals will be  studied to explore modifiability in receivers.  Measures  include responsiveness to vocal playback and discrimination  of potential mates.  Neural studies of the avian forebrain  are included to relate brain organization to vocal  comprehension in females and to social competence in males.    The results of the work should advance knowledge of the  effects of early social environments on vocal and perceptual  learning, learning that is fundamental to an individual's  success.  This topic has broad implications for many  species, including humans, as avian vocal learning is one of  the premier models for identifying potential mechanisms of  language learning.  Of special significance is the  possibility of identifying previously ignored sources of  instruction including visual stimulation.  The coordinated  studies of brain and behavior also set the stage for  measuring how behavioral experiences affect brain growth  itself.",
