 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines how the values of American Indian students, along with their perceptions of societal, family and peer norms, relate to their success in scientific and technological training.  Scientific and technological education achievement and skill attainment is poorer among American Indians (Native Americans) than among other groups in U.S. society.  This project will provide further information about the influences that contribute to this problem, in order to help to promote increased involvement of Indian people in science and technology in ways that can improve their lives and communities and allow the larger society to benefit from their contributions. The project consists of two studies of norms and values that influence the educational performance of American Indian students.  One experimental study with college students tests the effect of priming ethnic identity on attitudes toward technology and science.   Comparison of the primed and unprimed groups will provide causal evidence of the effects of Indian identity on manifest ability, knowledge and attitudes towards science and technology.  The other study is a survey of high school students of ethnic attitudes to technology and science and their effects on choices in education.  This study will examine how different patterns of values and family and peer norms affect course selection and achievement.  Results will be published in the academic literature and shared with American Indian organizations, including the American Indian Science and Engineering Society.",
