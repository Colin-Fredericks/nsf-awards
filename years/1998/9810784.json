 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Fridman        This is an award under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research activity.  It is a study of the fundamental physics and chemistry of transition types of arc discharges, sometimes called sliding arcs, gliding arcs, or glidarcs, concentrating on the transition between equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions in the arc.  In the study, the transition zone is defined in space and time, the plasma properties at the beginning of the transition are determined as well as those of the newly formed nonequilibrium plasma.  These properties include the discharge geometry, parameters of the electrical circuit and local parameters such as plasma temperatures and electric field values.  These studies are used to evaluate hypotheses on the mechanisms of ionization and the equilibrium-nonequilibrium transition.  The study includes high-speed video imaging synchronized with electrical measurements of current and voltage waveforms.    Gliding arc technology is thought to have great potential in environmental control and materials processing, and a great deal of applied research is underway.  However, the fundamental physics and chemistry of this recently discovered phenomenon has not been studied systematically.",
