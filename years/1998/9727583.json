These conferences  will be held at various universities in the northwestern United States  and southwestern Canada.  Among institutions currently active are the  University of British Columbia, University of California-Berkeley,  University of Nevada-Reno, University of Oregon, University of Puget  Sound, University of Washington, Boise State University, Oregon State  University, and Portland State University.  Typically there will be half  a dozen principal speakers on topics ranging widely over geometry and  topology, both algebraic and geometric, the majority from outside these  institutions, and more than fifty participants altogether, roughly  half of them faculty and half of them graduate students, as well as  an occasional undergraduate student.  Participation by younger  mathematicians, by women, and by underrepresented minorities is encouraged,  the first two with notable success.  Other sources of financial support  include the host institutions in each case and, in the case of the  conferences held in Canada, Canadian sources, which entirely supplant  the National Science Foundation.  ***",
