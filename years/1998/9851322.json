 "awd_abstract_narration": "Western Oregon University seeks the acquisition of a small-scale automated DNA sequencing apparatus with which to expand its curriculum in molecular biology for biology majors, undergraduate research, and secondary school science educators. The uses of this piece of equipment include the following: (1) DNA sequence analysis and computational biology will be incorporated into existing laboratory courses for microbiology and molecular biology; (2) special summer workshops and continuing education research experiences for secondary science teachers will be developed in molecular biology that employ recombinant DNA technology and DNA sequence analysis; (3) DNA sequence analysis is an integral part of the research in three laboratories which provide research experiences to undergraduates, honors students, and secondary science educators; and (4) data generated by DNA sequence analysis encourages students, both general laboratory participants and students participating in research, to utilize computer networks, thus connecting them with the larger framework of genome research, molecular databases, and the scientific community at large.",
