 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the use of an ICP-MS system. The determination of trace levels of toxic metals is a critical issue in the fields of environmental, analytical, and clinical chemistry. Therefore, introduction of ICP-MS in the environmental and analytical chemistry curricula is essential in order to keep our students abreast of the latest developments in metal ions analysis. Students benefiting from this project are those taking senior level environmental chemistry courses required for our B.S. Environmental Chemistry degree, and those taking instrumental analysis courses required for all Chemistry majors. In addition, the system is available for directed undergraduate research in environmental chemistry and geological sciences.  Four new experiments had previously been designed and tested using the ICP-MS of a commercial environmental laboratory. These experiments are being introduced into the undergraduate environmental and analytical chemistry curricula in order to enhance the two curricula and to provide students with hands on experience in the use and application of ICP-MS. Students analyze a variety of samples including ground and drinking water, urban particulate matters, human hair, and other clinical samples. When appropriate they follow E.P.A. approved methodologies and protocols to carry out their analyses. The theory, principle, and hardware of ICP-MS are discussed in the analytical chemistry lecture course. This project facilitates the learning of a technique which can be used as a powerful analytical tool for scientific inquiries in environmental and biological chemistry as well as in geology.",
