 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of methodology for the   construction of a variety of C-X bonds: C-C, C-N and C-O.   The majority   of the effort will be be spent developing methods for catalytic   asymmetric activation of alkenes for attack by non-metal bound, external   nucleophiles.  To this end, the synthesis  of a variety of novel planar   chiral Pd(II) catalysts will be carried out.  The reactions targeted for   catalysis include allylic imidate rearrangements, Cope and Claisen   rearrangements, allylic ester rearrangements and cyclizations to form   chiral nitrogen and oxygen containing heterocycles.  A second aspect of   the research focuses on the asymmetric Heck reaction.  The objective of   all of the investigations is to develop practical catalytic methods   through systematic studies that will provide fundamental insight that   will enable future rational development of new asymmetric catalyst   architectures.  With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular   Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Larry E. Overman of   the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine.    Professor Overman will focus his work on developing new catalytic   asymmetric transformations of inexpensive alkenes to valuable enantiopure   products.  The development of this type of methodology is of great   importance to the pharmaceutical industry.",
