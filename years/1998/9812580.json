The Wind and Seismic Effects panel promotes exchanges  of technology for reducing damages caused by strong winds,  earthquakes, and storm surge and tsunamis.  Through the panel,  U.S. and Japanese researchers jointly develop and share seismic  and high-wind measurement records and technical data, and  information on the performance, design, and construction of  lifelines, buildings, and other constructed facilities.  The  heart of the panel is its 12 task committees.  Their activities  continue to grow in strength and have made significant  contributions toward advancing the missions of federal agencies  in design and construction practices.  A new task committee on  Seismic Information Systems was created at the Panel's 29th Joint  Meeting in May, 1997.  ***",
