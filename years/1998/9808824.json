 "awd_abstract_narration": "The New York Botanical Garden Herbarium, a National  Systematics Research Resource Center, is the country's  largest repository of plant and fungal specimens. It is  a vast, actively managed, and intensively used  collection of 6,000,000 specimens  representing all  plant and fungal groups and is worldwide in scope.  Because of the size and richness of the collection, the  NYBG Herbarium serves as a primary source of research  materials for botanical studies throughout the world.  Virtually all major taxonomic revisions of plants of  the Americas and parts of the Old World include  examination of specimens deposited in the NYBG  Herbarium.    The NYBG Herbarium regularly sends more specimens on  loan than any other herbarium in the world.  An average  of 46,529 specimens (643 loans) were sent out in each  of the last five years.  Of these 27.5% were sent for  study by students and 72.5% for study by professional  researchers; 68.4% were specimens of vascular plants  and 31.6% were of non-vascular plants. During the same  period, 1124 visiting researchers from 62 foreign  countries and 42 states of the U.S.A spent 10,529 days  using the collection.  In addition to providing loans  and on-site services, NYBG provides data about its  specimens via the internet.  The NYBG Herbarium  collections, of all groups of plants and fungi, are an  essential resource to professional and student  researchers throughout the world.    This project will include assistance for 1) sending  specimens on loan to researchers at other institutions  and refiling them upon their return, 2) facilitating  studies of specimens at NYBG by visiting researchers,  3) fulfilling reasonable requests from academic users  for data or samples from specimens housed at NYBG,and  4) requesting and receiving loans of specimens from  other herbaria for study by researchers visiting NYBG.",
