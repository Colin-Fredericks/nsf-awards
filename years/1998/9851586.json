 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project integrates GIS/GPS technology across the curriculum of the Fox Valley Technical College (FVTC) Natural Resources Technician associate degree program. As a unique program in Wisconsin's two-year technical college system, FVTC educates over 200 students annually from throughout the State to work as technicians in areas such as soil conservation, environmental protection, wildlife management, and forestry preservation. Without GIS/GPS laboratory equipment, the Natural Resources program is at a continuous improvement stalemate - all meaningful curriculum development responding to occupational skill demand involves GIS/GPS technology. The most serious indicator of need is the fact that job placement of graduates has been negatively impacted due to lack of contemporary technology skills.     Project objectives focus upon staff development for the six program instructors to learn GIS/GPS technology for the development of laboratory learning activities in program courses including: Soil Conservation, Outdoor Recreation, Common Topics, and Surveying. Laboratory activities will include authentic data collection and analysis projects that provide environmental information for use by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and other land use and conservation agencies.     Professional authenticity and relevancy of the curriculum will be evaluated by practitioners in a variety of natural resource occupations. The integrated curriculum will be shared with interested associate degree educators in collaboration with GIS/GPS vendors and related conferences. A Science Teacher Institute for K-12 teachers will enable GIS/GPS projects to be developed for elementary and secondary students.",
