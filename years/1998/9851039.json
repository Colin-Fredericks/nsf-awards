 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop and implement a remotely accessible laboratory for the Dynamical Systems course in the second semester of the sophomore year of the new engineering curriculum at Stevens Institute of Technology. This course on dynamical systems will provide an educational experience which is integrated and taught concurrently with the courses Design 4 (focusing on the design of dynamic systems), Applied Science 4 (providing the mathematical foundations for the analysis of dynamical systems), and Electronics and Instrumentation. The proposed laboratory implementation is based on the utilization of smart laboratory devices and the exploitation of the existing computing and networking infrastructure of the Stevens Institute of Technology through the world wide web. All preparatory instructional materials for the laboratory experiments, as well as testing and self-assessment tools for the students will be provided in electronic form on the internet. After fully implementing this internet-based, remote-access, interactive approach to laboratory instruction in the Dynamical Systems course of the undergraduate engineering curriculum with experimental setups from diverse areas of mechanical and electrical engineering, the extension of this approach is planned for other applications of dynamical systems in civil and chemical engineering and to other educational areas as well. The proposed laboratory facility is aimed at achieving a set of general curricular objectives and developing specific knowledge and skill sets in the students that are desired by industry. A major criterion for the assessment of the success of the project will be the ability of the students to demonstrate the use of competencies in the Senior Design Courses.",
