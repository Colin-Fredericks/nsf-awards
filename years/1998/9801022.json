The Mhc is shared among all vertebrates, with many alleles maintained in populations due to balancing selection.  Selection is thought to be due directly to exposure to disease organisms, since the Mhc functions in the immune system.      The potential for increased exposure to disease is assumed to be a major cost to the development of complex social systems in mammals, and this study is designed to test this assumption by examining the levels of Mhc variability in two related species of burrowing rodent (Ctenomys) that differ in their level of social interactions.  In one, individuals of both sexes maintain separate burrow systems and only contact one another briefly for mating; in the other, colonies of individuals co-inhabit a common underground tunnel system and share common nests.      The investigators will characterize the degree of genetic variation in two Mhc loci in study populations of both species near Bariloche, in southern Argentina, populations that are also being studied intensively for ecological, behavioral, and other attributes.  This study thus aims to test a major question in evolutionary biology (constraints on the evolution of sociality in mammals).  Simultaneously, the study has potential value to basic public health and disease studies in other mammals, such as humans.",
