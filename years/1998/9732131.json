 "awd_abstract_narration": "Visualizing microtubules and other cytoskeletal structures  in most types of living cells has been a difficult problem.  A new type of microscopy, called modulated polarization  microscopy, which can routinely image individual  microtubules and other cytoskeletal structures as well as  vesicle movements along cytoskeletal tracks will be  developed. Modulated polarization microscopy images  cytoskeletal structures based on their birefringence but  takes advantage of the fact that birefringence is sensitive  to polarization angle. When birefringent structures are  illuminated with plane polarized light of varying angle and  viewed between crossed polarizers they oscillate in  intensity. This behavior is not seen with structures that  are not birefringent and provides a means for separating  weakly birefringent elements from the cytoplasmic  background.    A prototype instrument has been built using Faraday rotators  to modulate the plane of polarized light presented to the  specimen. Images obtained using this microscope demonstrate  its potential for imaging the cytoskeleton.    An advanced version of the moldulated polarization  microscope with greatly improved sensitivity, contrast,  image quality, and resolution will be built.  Improvements  in the new microscope will be based on analysis of problems  with the original prototype.",
