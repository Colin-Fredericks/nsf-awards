The exhibit uses the history of AAAS as a prism to examine the history of American science, communicating in a clear and engaging manner both the highlights of that history and the role played by the AAAS.  The exhibit will first be presented at the AAAS annual meeting in Philadelphia, in February 1998, then will be installed in the public space of the organization's headquarters in Washington, D.C.  The exhibit will be open to the public through the celebration of the AAAS's Founders' Day (in September 1998), and perhaps longer.  School groups, people from the Washington science and policy communities, members of the media, and the broader public will be encouraged to visit through a publicity campaign that will include notices and articles in the newspapers and on television and radio.",
