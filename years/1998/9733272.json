Dyke    The focus of this CAREER research project is to develop  innovative and implementable techniques for mitigating the  devasting consequences of severe seismic events.  In  particular, the work will concentrate on the implementation  of supplemental damping devices.  Semi-active devices are  considered here because they address most of the concerns  brought forth about structural control, and are expected to  advance the near-term acceptance of  this technology.  Specifically, magnetorheological (MR) dampers are new semi-  active devices that are particularly suitable for civil  engineering applications.  They offer mechanical simplicity,  low power requirements, environmental robustness, and  demonstrated potential for developing forces sufficient for  full-scale applications at a reasonable cost, and can be  viewed as fail-safe in that they become passive dampers  should control hardware malfunction.    A number of important issues pertinent to practical  implementation will be examined.  Ultimately, guidelines  which can be used by design engineers to employ these  devices in new construction and retrofit applications will  be developed.  The control of both linear and nonlinear  structures, and the use of single and multiple control  devices will be considered,  The performance of the MR  damper will be compared to the active and passive systems  for a wide array of excitation types and amplitudes.  Analytical and experimental investigations will be carried  out in parallel, using the facilities available in the  earthquake engineering laboratory at Washington University  which has recently funded the construction of this  experimental facility.    The primary objective of the educational program to provide  students the Department of Civil Engineering with an  understanding that structures are dynamic systems, and for  the implications of this in their analysis and design,  At  the undergraduate level, an experimental facility will be  provided in which students can study  the response of  structures to dynamic loads, incorporating, \"hands-on\"  experiments into the cirrocumuli to introduce basic concepts  in structural dynamics and providing opportunities will be  created for students to participate in research projects in  the laboratory.  At the graduate level, a new course in  experimental methods for dynamic testing will be developed  to enable providing students to participate in state-of-the-  art research and integrating experiments into the advanced  structural dynamics course.  Throughout the program, n-line  exercises will be developed to assist students innprparing  for the laboratories.  The educational and research components of the project are  designed to complement and enhance each other.  The  laboratory facilities, and experiments developed therein  will provide the necessary tools to facilitate the  cirrocumuli development.  This integrated approach will  provide students with an understanding of the dynamic nature  of structures through illustrative experiments and state-of-  the-art research projects.  Furthermore, students at all  levels will be introduced to this emerging technology.",
