 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an investigation of combinatorial optimization problems  involving multiple objectives.  Such problems arise in a variety  of application areas including communication networks, very large  scale integrated systems, facility location and management of  hazardous materials.  For many such problems, even optimizing one  objective is often computationally intractable. Motivated by the  practical importance of these problems, the focus of this  research is on developing efficient algorithms that produce  solutions which are near-optimal with respect to all the  objectives.  The major goals of the proposed research include  identifying classes of multiobjective optimization problems from  various application areas, developing efficient approximation  algorithms for the problems and evaluating their performance  through analysis/experimentation, developing a software library  of multiobjective approximation algorithms that can be used by  researchers and practitioners, and obtaining insights into the  intrinsic difficulties encountered in developing approximation  algorithms for multiobjective problems.  Both graduate and  undergraduate students will be encouraged to participate in this  work.  The results obtained will be incorporated into seminar  courses suitable for graduate and advanced undergraduate  students. A number of practical situations require a careful  analysis of constraints and objectives. For example, a business  organization may want to upgrade the communication network  interconnecting its branches so that information can be exchanged  among the branches at a faster rate. Often, only a limited budget  is available for the upgrade. It is of interest to the  organization to obtain the best possible upgrade whose cost is  within the available budget.  Such situations involving  constraints and objectives arise in a number of contexts  including determining appropriate locations for facilities (such  as hospitals, fire stations, etc.) and management of  hazardous  materials. Ma thematically, the problems arising in these contexts  can be expressed as optimization problems involving multiple  objectives. However, computing the best solutions to such  problems is often infeasible.  The focus of this research is on  developing procedures that can quickly compute solutions which  are close to the best solutions with respect to all the  objectives.  The research will investigate problems from a number  of application areas. One of the goals of this research is to  develop a library of software procedures that can be used by both  practitioners and researchers.",
