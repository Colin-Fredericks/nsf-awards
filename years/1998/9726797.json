 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726797  Crews    This award supports the participation of American scientists  in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Bioorganic Marine Chemistry, to  be held in Santa Cruz, California from December 14-18, l998.  The co-organizers are Professors Phillip Crews of the  University of California at Santa Cruz and Takenori Kusumi  of Tokushima University in Japan.  The seminar will address  a broad range of topics including: (a) chemodiversity of  marine macroorganisms; (b) marine-derived microorganisms as  a resource for unusual metabolites (c) new materials as a  focus for marine biotechnology; (d) interactions between  species mediated by secondary metabolites; (e)  pharmacological tools from marine sources; and (f)  mechanisms of marine biosynthesis.    Marine bioorganic chemistry continues to be regarded as an  exciting area of research, watched closely by scientists  from many disciplines in both chemistry and biology.  Interest in marine bioorganic technology is also escalating  in both the academic and industrial domain worldwide.  A  majority of the major labs, as well as the new investigators  in this field, are  concentrated in the U.S. and Japan.  Frequently, the ideas and techniques developed by academic  and industrial research groups in these two countries are  extremely influential. In addition, younger scientists will  be included in the seminar.  The exchange of ideas and data  with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S.  participants to advance their own work, and will set the  stage for future collaborative projects.  ***",
