 "awd_abstract_narration": "Duncan James   This grant funds a project to explore the relationship between mutual fund managerial compensation on the one hand, and asset market price bubbles and instability on the other. As such, this research has potentially important implications for financial market oversight.  Earlier research by the PIs has shown that compensation schemes modeled on those occurring in the mutual fund industry lead to price bubbles, even in an environment where price bubbles have previously been found not to form. If this result carries over to the field, then it suggests that risky assets attract too much money (and safe assets too little); if so, then a potentially severe macroeconomic shock could result from this misallocation of investment capital.  The current project takes the next logical steps in investigating whether James and Isaac's results are likely to transfer to a field situation. To this end we conduct additional experiments; new treatments allow us to add further degrees of realism to our laboratory environment, so as to enhance comparability with field markets.  Examples include the introduction of  compensation contracts calibrated to various estimates of field contracts, and expansion of the scope of decisions so that unsuccessful traders may exit.  Results will inform discussion on the form of mutual fund managerial compensation.",
