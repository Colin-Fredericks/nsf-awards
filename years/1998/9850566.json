 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional undergraduate Physics courses have been criticized for producing poor results in learning and understanding. Traditional pedagogy produces student learning characterized by memorization of vocabulary and problem solving algorithms rather than long-lasting conceptual understanding and higher order problem solving, critical thinking, and scientific inquiry skills. The goal of this project is to restructure the first semester of the general physics course by developing a laboratory/discussion facility that provides an active learning environment using technology to both facilitate integrated laboratory/computer simulation experiences for students and motivate constructive student discourse. Successful restructuring of this course and development of this lab facility will lay the foundation for change in the second semester of the course and serve as a model for all lower-division labs. Active learning methods combined with microcomputer-based laboratories (MBLs) are used to improve student learning and long term retention and conceptual understanding. In addition to adopting the best practice in MBL instruction, the facility enables us to seamlessly integrate data acquisition and analysis, simulations, computer-facilitated student discourse, on-line testing, and classroom management in a \"studio\" or discussion/lab setting. The technology will also allow us to utilize the growing availability of Web-based instructional materials.",
