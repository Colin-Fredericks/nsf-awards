 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inouye  9814509         There is growing evidence that the global climate is changing, and a  matching concern for the consequences this will have for natural  ecosystems.  Predicted changes in temperature and precipitation are likely  to influence the frequency of frost damage to plants, and frost kills of  plants or plant parts such as flower buds and leaves may become either more  or less common.  Frost damage can impact both the plants and animals such  as herbivores, seed predators and pollinators that depend on them.  For  example, there have been local extinctions of butterflies as a consequence  of frost killing plants the caterpillars eat.  If the plant recover quickly  from this damage by replacement from a seed bank, regrowth of damaged  leaves, or simply flowering again the next year the long-term consequence  of frost damage can be beneficial for the plants if it results in the less  of associated herbivores or seed predators.       This grant will support research on the consequences of frost for a  long-lived perennial sunflower.  Since 1974 frost has killed some or all  sunflower buds every 2-6 years.  The seed predators (tephritid flies) that  lay eggs in the buds are greatly affected by the loss of flower heads, and  when their populations are reduced after a frost, the plants are able to  produce many more seeds and seedlings until the fly populations build back  up.  Thus, a decrease in the frequency of frost might actually be  detrimental to the plants because seed predator populations would never be  reduced.",
