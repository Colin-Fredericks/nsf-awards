 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funds to purchase a hot press, autoclave, and vacuum bag system for the fabrication of composite coupons for undergraduate course laboratories and student projects. Funding is also being requested for the purchase of an acoustic emission instrument that will give students the ability to evaluate the properties of composite components and to monitor the integrity of composite structures. Additionally, funds are requested for the purchase of a freezer that will be used for long term storage of composite materials prior to fabrication. The principal purpose for all of this equipment is to develop hands-on laboratory experiences for students in the mechanics courses laboratories that will develop the physical intuition in students that is necessary to effectively utilize composite materials in engineering applications and to provide students the opportunity to integrate composite materials into freshman, course, and capstone design projects. This project is proposed as a model for the incorporation of composite materials throughout an undergraduate curriculum with minimal impact on the curriculum. The project use course lectures, laboratory experiences, and design projects to develop the students understanding of this class of materials This project gradually introduces students to composite materials starting in the freshman year and continues through to the senior capstone project. This equipment allows the Union College Engineering Division's strategy of reinforcing lecture material on a phenomenon with quality laboratory experiences and design projects to be extended to composite materials. This equipment will also provide undergraduate students with more research opportunities on the Union College campus.",
