A broad spectrum of approximately 20 experts from academia, industry and   government have been invited to make presentations in the workshop.  An   additional 30 researchers will participate in the workshop's discussion and   breakout sessions.  The workshop will deliver a report to the National Science   Foundation (NSF), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and   to the Council for Chemical Research (CCR).    This is a workshop being co-organized and co-funded by NSF and NIST under the   Council for Chemical Research Vision 2020 Committee's aegis.  The purpose is to:    1. Survey the current state of the art in academic research and industrial   practice in the areas of process measurements and process control;    2. Identify major impediments to further progress in the field and the adoption   of these methods by industry; and    3. Determine highly promising new directions for methodological development and   application areas.",
