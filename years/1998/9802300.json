The  research focuses on two fundamental aspects of conducting  conjugated polymers.  First, theoretical guidelines will be  developed in order to answer the question: Is there a  minimum bandgap in this family of novel materials? Despite  worldwide efforts to attain a bandgap of 0.5eV or less in  conjugated polymers, very few examples of bandgaps exist  that are significantly below 1 eV.  While attaining a small  bandgap in a conducting polymer will probably lead to  interesting applications, this problem presents a profound  challenge in its own right which is of broad interest.  The  design of new materials with the desired small bandgap will  be possible only through systematic determination of the  factors influencing the structure and electronic properties  of electroactive polymers including the contributions of  heteroatoms and side groups, the effects of topology  (ladders, rings, etc), the influence of coplanarity and  other conformational degrees of freedom.    This leads to the second aspect.  The effects of interchain  interactions are notoriously difficult to treat  theoretically.  In this research a fundamental aspect of  this problem will be attacked in a novel fashion: the  experimental vibrational spectra will be used to obtain the  value of interring torsion that would be too sensitive to  calculate purely theoretically, but cannot be obtained from  experiment.  Accurate modeling of IR and Raman spectra,  including intensities, as a function of interring coupling,  will allow the determination of critical structural data,  such as interring bond distances and torsion.    Currently, there is a lack of a unified approach in the  theoretical modeling of the structure, vibrational spectra  and electronic structures of conducting polymers.  This  project will provide a versatile testing ground for the  critical evaluation of various non-local densit y functionals  and their applications to organic polymeric materials.  Applications include the main types of conjugated polymers.  %%%  This is a theoretical research grant which is funded jointly  by the Divisions of Materials Research and Chemistry.
