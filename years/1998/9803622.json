Examples are multiple regression and multivariate data sets, and time series.  Diagnostics involves identifying cases that depart from some baseline  (usually Gaussian) model.  This general framework covers finding outliers as a part of data analysis, and is also the basis for statistical process control (SPC) methodologies.  One thread of the present project extends the PI's previous work in outlier identification, particularly in situations where the outliers are numerous or badly placed.  It has recently become apparent that methods that work well on text-book-sized problems are useless in data sets with even a few thousand cases in a few dozen dimensions.  As such data sets are increasingly common, this has reopened a major emphasis of the present project -- the whole question of workable approaches for finding outlying cases in large data sets.  A somewhat distinct problem is detection of persistent changes in time-ordered scalar and multivariate data.  This is the problem addressed by change-point, exponentially weighted moving average, and cumulative sum methodologies.  The program of work includes a major effort in this area also.  The union of the two problem areas leads to the design of statistical process control methodologies that are resistant to isolated outliers.\r\n\r\nIn large data bases it is impossible to verify the correctness or internal consistency of the entries using current methodology.  Methods that work well on small data sets are computationally unthinkable in data sets up in the megabyte and beyond range leaving the quality of information in data bases hostage to undetected errors.  This project is developing methods to identify \"outliers\" --- atypical entries in large data bases --- with an acceptable, though still large, amount of computational effort.  More processor power alone will not solve the problem, but more powerful processors combined with the improved algorithms developed in this program of work may do so.  The problem is inherently amenable to distributed processing --- previous work showed how outlier identification could be speeded up by using an array of central processors.  Another thread of the work is cumulative sum (cusum) charting, a tool in the statistical process control (SPC) family.  The classic Shewhart Xbar and R control charts are incapable of detecting small but persistent shifts.  Such shifts are found and diagnosed rapidly with cusums.  Used in conjunction with Shewhart charts, cusums can diagnose manufacturing problems, leading to substantial quality improvement.  Cusums are also effective in many other monitoring situations, from online medical monitoring to detecting plumes of pollution in air or water.  Groundwater monitoring around a landfill, for example, aims at exactly this problem of detecting an increased level of pollutants against a highly variable background.  Cusums are already recognized as a powerful tool to use in the detection and diagnosis of leakages, and their extension to handle non-detect chemical data is important in extending their applicability to pollutants like heavy metals that are harmful at low concentrations.\r\n",
