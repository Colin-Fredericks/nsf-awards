 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726524  Grossman    This award supports the participation of American scientists  and engineers in a U.S.-Japan seminar on the effects of  environmental conditions on CO2 fixation and the  photosynthetic apparatus, to be held in Pacific Grove,  California in November, 1998.  The co-organizers are Dr.  Arthur Grossman of the Carnegie Institution of Washington  and Professor Tatsuo Omata of Nagoya University in Japan.  The emphasis of the seminar will be on the ways in which  photosynthetic organisms cope with their environment and  will include researchers from different disciplines; some of  these disciplines emphasize a reductionist approach while  others view acclimation processes at the more global scale.  The former gains strength by helping to provide detailed  mechanistic information that can help us predict the  consequences of change, while the latter can often identify  major large scale problems and give the reductionists a  perspective on the problem.  A binational dialogue among the  researchers of different disciplines will help identify  important areas for further analysis and lead to  collaborative efforts to meet the challenge of coping with  changing environmental conditions.    Developing a more detailed understanding of this broad area  of research will help in understanding factors that limit  plant growth and productivity in given environments.  Additionally, it might enable us to extend the range of  environments in which specific plants can survive and might  also provide new insights into the ways in which long-term  changes in the atmosphere of the earth (gas composition,  incident light intensity and quality and temperature) will  affect the growth and photosynthetic activity of plants.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this  field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own  work, and will set the stage for future collaborative  projects.  Seminar organizers have made a special effort to  involve younger researchers, postdoctoral resea rchers and  graduate students.  Proceedings of the meeting are expected  to be made available by the organizers.  ***",
