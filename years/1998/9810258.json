 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project expands the current Women in Science and  Engineering (WISE) program, which focuses primarily on the first  year, into a four-year experience, to be known as the WISE  College.        Important academic and social components are introduced to  create an entity with which the women will identify during their  four years at Stony Brook and beyond.  Goals are to institute  advanced math and computer training and an ongoing in-depth  research experience; to introduce newly-developed courses that   give insight into the cultural milieu in which science operates  and scientists work; to sustain and deepen the sense of belonging  to a community of active women scientists; and to facilitate  movement from college to graduate or professional school in SME.   Methods for achieving these goals include:  the introduction of  advanced math/computer requirements; the implementation of  specially-created courses on the Social Dimensions of Science,  Connections in Science; and Problem Solving; the development and  implementation of a Mentoring seminar and enhanced mentoring  opportunities for the women; and a two-year intensive research  requirement, accompanied by a senior seminar on Professional  Development and professionally-oriented activities such as  presentations at conferences, a major paper, and grant-writing  activities.  By providing a structured and supportive environment  for four years, and instituting elements designed to enhance the  women's academic and professional development, WISE College will  address national and local needs to recruit and especially to  retain qualified women in SME and to increase the number of women  pursuing careers that require training in science, math or  technology.",
