 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of this project is to introduce laser light scattering theory and technology into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at the University of Northern Iowa. Funds wil purchase a laser light scattering system built around Wyatt Technology's miniDAWN triple-angle light scattering detector. Laser light scattering theory will be presented in the lecture part of our physical chemistry course while application and hands-on experience will be presented in the laboratory. In addition to physical chemistry, laboratory experience in this technology will be made available to students enrolled in our biochemistry laboratories and in our undergraduate research program. Laser light scattering techniques are very useful for characterization of synthetic and biological polymers and laser light scattering instruments are recognized as detectors of choice during gel permeation high performance liquid chromatography (GPC-HPLC) because in addition to detecting the polymer, laser light scattering detectors can provide important structural information about the polymer in question. Indeed, light scattering detectors are the only HPLC detectors that are suitable for determining absolute molecular weight. The use of laser light scattering instruments is relatively common in industrial settings where polymers are manufactured studied and sold. Unfortunately, light scattering theory and practice is rarely addressed in undergraduate chemistry programs. In the past, laser light scattering instruments were difficult to use and data acquisition and analysis was tedious and complex. Relatively recent advances in instrument design as well as in data handling have, in large part, solved these problems. We believe that it is now time to introduce laser light scattering theory and techniques into the undergraduate curriculum. We also believe that our program may have a substantial impact on other undergraduate chemistry programs, especially those interested in strengthening their curriculum in the areas of p hysical chemistry, polymer chemistry and materials science.",
