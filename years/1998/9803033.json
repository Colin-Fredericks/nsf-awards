 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9803033  Redi  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project from Boston Communications Networks, Inc. will develop and demonstrate a complete stack of energy-efficient protocols to foster widespread deployment of radio frequency (RF) network devices.  Energy consumption has been identified as the limiting factor in the progress toward a new generation of various mobile devices (such as radio frequency and infrared identification device (RFID) tags, Smart Cards, portable/hand-helds).  Their extremely small size and the need for their deployment in the billions of units, lead to extremely rigid cost constraints that cannot be met without energy minimization.  Boston Communications Networks' protocol stack (consisting of two-way access, location management, and error control/transport layers) builds on Phase I results which quantitatively demonstrated an order-of-magnitude improvement over existing solutions.  Due to the generic nature of the proposed communications protocol-stack solutions and the planned cooperation with leading industries and standardization bodies, this work has the potential to serve as an enabling technology that will allow, through cost reduction, the development of a heterogeneous mix of widely-deployable, new generations of light-weight, personal identification/communication devices.  Because Boston Communications Networks is at the forefront with a working energy-efficient protocol, this project proffers an opportunity to set the standards for energy-efficient protocols where none currently exist.  It is estimated that the RFID tag market alone will total $17 billion by the end of 1997  IEEE Review .  Since virtually all hand-held devices need to conserve energy, a software product that minimizes energy becomes critical for the entire gamut of portable computing and communications devices.  ***",
