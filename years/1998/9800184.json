 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports theoretical studies related to catalysis by Dr. Michael B. Hall of the Chemistry Department, Texas A&M University.  Systems related to four fundamental steps in catalysis will be investigated: oxidative-addition, substitution, migratory-insertion, and atom transfer.  Detailed kinetics of the early stages of C-H bond activation by a rhodium carbonyl complex will be studied.   The nature and energy of the transition states connecting two proposed solvated intermediates will be determined.  Other studies will concentrate on dirhodium catalyzed cyclizations and ruthenium catalyzed alkyne and alkene dimerizations.  Transformations between non-classical dihydrogen complexes and classical hydrides will be modeled.   Oxygen transfer and insertion will be examined in a model system that mimics molybdenum enzymes.  Calculational results will be compared with known experimental results.  Non-local density functional theory (DFT) and multiconfiguration self-consistent field (MCSCF) methods, especially generalized molecular orbital method (GMO2),  will be used for full-gradient geometry optimization of stable molecules, reaction intermediates, and transition states.  The GMO2 method is well-suited to transition metals.  Higher level methods will be used to determine critical points on potential energy surfaces.\r\n\r\nDetailed mechanisms for catalysis of many important industrial reactions are not known.  In this study, theoretical calculations of the electronic states of molecules and their reaction pathways will be used to develop models for reactivity that will be compared to experimental results.  This could aid in the development of improved catalysts.\r\n",
