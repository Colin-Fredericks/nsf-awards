Greater understanding of how growth  conditions affect film structure (phase, strain, grain size, and  inhomogeneity) and dielectric and FE properties is sought. New  information will be acquired on film thickness/FE behavior,  interfacial bonding, film orientation, FE fluctuations and phase  transitions, stability of the perovskite phase, and order-  disorder behavior relationships to phase transition dynamics.  Studies of size effects on optical and electrical properties of  perovskite-type ferroelectric (FE) thin films and  nano-crystalline materials, such as PbTiO3, BaTiO3, Pb(Zr,Ti)03,  (Ba,Sr)TiO3, (Pb,Ba)TiO3, (Pb,La)TiO3 are planned. Properties of  these materials are strongly dependent on microstructure and  grain size; hence FE nano-crystalline materials with different  grain sizes will be prepared using Sol-Gel and conventional  ceramic processing techniques. Grain size variation will also be  studied by annealing samples at different temperatures and time  durations. Deposition/growth of FE thin films with different  thicknesses and substrates will be carried out using sol-gel, RF  Sputtering, and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) techniques.  Characterization will include several microscopies--XRD, XPS,  SEM/TEM, EDX, and AFM, along with laser Raman confocal microprobe  and FTIR microspectroscopy. Dielectric, hysteresis,  piezoelectric, pyroelectric, electro-optic, and differential  thermal measurements on films will be carried out to  quantitatively assess opto-electronic and related physical  properties.  %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  materials science having high potential technological relevance.  The materials to be studied possess large dielectric,  pyroelectric, piezoelectric, and nonlinear optical coefficients  that can be usefully exploited in opto-electronic and  microe lectronic technologies (e.g., memories, smart microsensors  and actuators, multi-layer capacitors, and electro-optical  modulators). The research will contribute basic materials science  knowledge at a fundamental level; the new knowledge and  understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute  to improving the performance and stability of advanced devices  and circuits by providing a firm basis for designing and  producing improved materials, and materials combinations. An  important feature of the program is the integration of research  and education through the training of graduate and undergraduate  students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.  ***",
