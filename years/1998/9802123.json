 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802123  Ernst    The conference will explore what an individual institution does to change from   its present approach to engineering education to the new engineering education.    One that seeks to develop students as emerging professionals with the   motivation, capability, and knowledge base for life-long learning; one that   helps students see the whole world and sense the coupling among seemingly   disparate fields; one that incorporates a diversity of backgrounds and   approaches; and one that enhances student capability to build connections   between the world of learning and the world beyond.    The conference will, of necessity, include a brief discussion of how one   describes, in broad terms, the New Engineering Education.  Most of the   conference sessions will examine what changes the engineering school makes to   realize the new paradigm for engineering education:    * How does a college determine its own version of the new paradigm?  * What are some enabling steps for a college in the process of change?  * Who are the key players and what might the critical mass of such a group be?  * ABE Engineering Criteria 2000: Do the new criteria help or hinder change?  * How can the college use assessment processes to guide the change process as   well as to determine how well the steps taken have achieved the results   expected?  * What lessons can we learn from institutions who have made these kinds of   changes, the paradigm shifters?    An important part of the conference will be presentations by those involved as   paradigm shifters in engineering education to share what they did/how they did   it as well as what they should have done and how they should have done it.",
