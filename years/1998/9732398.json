 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the past several decades, the United States and Japan have been sharing information and technologies on ways to mitigate the effects of earthquakes on a variety of facilities.  One group of facilities which has received considerable attention in recent years has been lifelines.  Both governments recognize the importance of these systems after earthquakes and also acknowledge their extreme vulnerability to earthquakes.  As a result, researchers have been encouraged to identify new and better approaches for seismic evaluation, design and construction.  Special attention has been given to existing lifeline facilities.  This project is to organize and hold the Seventh U.S.-Japan Workshop on Earthquake Disaster Prevention for Lifeline Systems.  In continuing the previous tradition of alternating the location of the workshop site, this seventh workshop will beheld in Seattle, Washington in November of 1997.  This workshop is significant that will enable researchers to present detailed study findings from the January 17, 1994 Northridge, and January 17, 1995, Kobe earthquakes.  This project is an activity under the amspices of U.S.-Japan Natural Resources (UJNR) Program.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) costs share 50% of funds required for this workshop.",
