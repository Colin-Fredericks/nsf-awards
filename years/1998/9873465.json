 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research advances the mapping of human brain function and the development of computational models of brain structures involved in human cognition. Brain imaging, utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), allows task and process related tracking of brain activity. Cognitive modeling allows the prediction of human behavior in complex intellectual tasks. This project will bring together researchers who represent distinct and successful cognitive modeling architectures with researchers who are at the forefront of fMRI imaging, in an effort to relate cognitive function to human cortical dynamics.\r\n\r\nA set of complex tasks will be identified which involve various aspects of learning, problem solving, and language, and for which models exist in one or more architectures. Brain imaging studies will be conducted with people performing all of these tasks. The complex tasks will include: rule learning, strategy learning, memory retrieval, problem solving, and language processing. To provide further constraints, the same people will also be imaged as they perform simpler \"pure function\" tasks. Models will be developed in the various cognitive architectures that address both the brain imaging data and the behavioral data from these tasks.\r\n\r\nThe mapping and computational understanding of human brain function can have  important implications for education, artificial intelligence, and treatment of mental disorders. Understanding the brain structures involved in higher level cognition and how they interact will provide a better foundation for optimizing human performance and duplicating those functions in computers. An understanding of the neural basis of complex cognition has the potential for making brain research enhance education in the critical areas of skill acquisition and learning. It will also assist in the diagnosis and correction of brain dysfunction such as dyslexia and learning disabilities.\r\n",
