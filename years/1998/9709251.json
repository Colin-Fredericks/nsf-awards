The objective is to study the  processes that produce the saturated wave spectrum in the stratosphere and  mesosphere from long periods to the shortest buoyancy waves.  One of the radars is  a mesosphere-stratosphere-troposphere radar and the other is called JULIA a  subsystem of the large 50 MHz Jicamarca incoherent scatter radar.  JULIA will be  operated continuously for an entire month to measure stratospheric winds.  The  larger Jicamarca system will operate for a five-day campaign within the month to  measure winds over a wider range of heights.  Preliminary evidence from recent  experimental campaigns at Jicamarca suggest the presence of isolated wave packets.   The new experiments will allow the investigators to assess the contribution of these  isolated wave packs to the overall wave spectrum.  Other recent experiments suggest  that inertia-gravity waves with periods of 1-3 days may transport much of the  momentum that drives the quasi-biennial oscillation in the tropical stratosphere.  The  24-hour coverage of the JULIA radar will allow more comprehensive analysis of the  low-frequency waves and a more accurate determination of their intrinsic wave  parameters to provide guidance for large-scale models of the middle atmosphere.   This is a joint effort involving the University of Illinois and Northwest Research  Associates.  The University of Illinois investigators will be responsible for  experiment planning and data acquisition and analysis, while Northwest Research  Associates will be responsible for modeling the implications on middle atmospheric  dynamics.",
