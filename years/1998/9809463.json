University of Colorado  Title: The International Ice Core Data Cooperative    Ice-core drilling over the past few decades have yielded an  unprecedented volume of high-quality data from sites around the  globe.  Yet, data access and consistency of data quality in ice  cores remains a hindrance to the widespread application of these  important data to crucial questions in paleoenvironmental research.   The International Ice Core Data Cooperative (IICDC) was established  as the main contact point for the submission of ice core data to  the World Data Centers.  It has been successful in obtaining ice  core data sets and making them available to the community and has  helped to establish positive precedents for data management and  archival, including a particular effort to properly credit original  investigators for their work.  This award supports further  improvement in the availability of ice-core data to the scientific  community.  The project will place particular emphasis on  completing older deep ice core data sets and on obtaining a  comprehensive collection of shallow core, snow pit and  meteorological data, and on ensuring ease of use through  standardization of formats.  A major goal is to establish a  relational database that allows for comparison of ice core data on  common timescales.",
