 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9731502  S. Hudson/Case Western    Rubber modification to improve the impact behavior of polymeric materials is ubiquitous, yet high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) is unique in it s efficient use of rubber modifier.  Such performance derives from the unique phase-invented morphology of the HIPS modifier particles, whose effective volume is several times the actual volume of rubbery material.  Recent experiments in our laboratory demonstrate that this desirable morphology can be achieved also by blending, if the minor (rubbery) component strongly solubilizes an interfacially active block copolymer.    Reactive melt processing of polymers is rapidly becoming an important industrial process, because of its efficient preparation of interfacial agents at the site where they function, thus obviating the difficulty involved in transporting them to the interface.  The proposed research combines the concepts of reactive melt processing and phase-invented blend morphology to develop a novel and efficient approach to mechanical property modification of polymers.  The solubilization of the copolymer will be varied systematically to determine the optimal blend formulation and processing.  The morphology, mechanical properties (tensile and impact), and deformation mechanisms of these novel, melt-processable, reactive polymer blends will be tested.  The proposed work aims to establish a scientific understanding using model blend systems containing polyamides.  A versatile and simple chemistry has been selected, so that this new strategy may then be extended to a variety of other polymers that now suffer from inefficient modification procedures.    The proposed activity also benefits graduate, undergraduate and high school teacher training and education.  Collaboration with industrial contacts supports this and related projects within PI's laboratory.  ***",
