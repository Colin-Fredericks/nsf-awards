 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727077  SMITH  The annual expansion and contraction of ice cover in the  Southern Ocean is the largest seasonal process in the World  Ocean. This seasonal variability in ice cover creates  extensive fluctuations in primary production, which heavily  impacts pelagic and benthic communities. This research will  initiate a long time-series study of the water column and  sea floor using long-term, autonomous monitoring and  sampling systems developed for use in the Antarctic. The  study will be located in Post Foster, Deception Island,  which supports a pelagic and benthic fauna representative of  the Antarctic coastal zone and experiences seasonal ice  cover. A bottom-moored, upward-looking acoustic instrument  will be deployed on the sea floor for a period of one year  to monitor the vertical distribution, abundance and biomass  of acoustically-detectable macrozooplankton and micronekton  in the water column. Collections will be made over this  period using a newly-developed vertically-profiling pump  sampling. Simultaneously, a time-lapse camera system will be  moored on the sea floor to monitor the spatial distribution,  sizes and movements of the epibenthic megafauna component of  the benthic community. The instrumentation development will  allow the research project to focus on the effect of the  seasonal sea ice cycle on the distribution, abundance and  biomass of the macrozooplankton and micronekton in the water  column. Similar questions on the distribution, abundance,  size and movements of the epibenthic megafauna will be  addressed. Results from this study will provide a valuable  data base for the evaluation of the pelagic and benthic  community responses to seasonal variability in the Southern  Ocean.",
