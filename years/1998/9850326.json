 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project COMPACT will develop, test, and disseminate a new type of application-oriented, integrated curriculum software for introductory physics. This material will be designed to address a wide audience including:  (1) two-year college students enrolled in science, technology and engineering programs,  (2) non-science majors seeking scientific and technology literacy in anticipation of workplace demands, and  (3) high school students taking physics--in particular those in Tech Prep or vocational education programs.     The software will have a multilevel structure and flexible format to accommodate students with poor backgrounds in science and mathematics, those with some knowledge of algebra and geometry, as well as advanced students.  The project materials, developed from our existing prototypes, employ a \"learning situation-focused\" approach rather than a conventional domain-centered approach to involve students of various backgrounds and abilities in learning physics, science and technology. The goal is to engage students in exploring learning situations associated with their career goals. Each lesson will start with an exploration phase where students will see a real world example of applied physics. They will then enter a theory phase where they will be presented with the underlying physics concepts and laws related to the example. The learning cycle will be completed with an \"application\" phase where they will learn a systematic, expert-like approach to solving scientific and technical problems.    The initial software packages will focus on three broad career-oriented themes. It will include eight interconnected components:  (1) Simulation, Virtual Experimentation,  (2) Problem Solving Tutor,  and (3) Assessment Tool, etc., as well as collection of problems, tests, and questions.  Teachers can modify and expand an open-ended collection of problems, solution plans, tests, queries, and leading questions using their own experience or incorporating diverse curriculum resources, including tho se available on the Web.",
