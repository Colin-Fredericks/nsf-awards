 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robert Wood is funded by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program to continue his experimental research in thermodynamic   measurements of aqueous solutions at high temperatures.  Wood will   measure the electrical conductance of aqueous solutions of a variety of   salts at temperatures from 300 to 425 C and pressures up to 28 MPa.     Systems to be studied include Sodium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Magnesium   Chloride, Hydrochloric Acid and Sodium Hydroxide.  The measurements will   yield accurate values of the association constants for the formation of   ion pairs.  Additional studies at higher temperatures and pressures will   be performed in collaboration with scientists at Oak Ridge National Labs.    The results of the measurements for Sodium Sulfate, Magnesium Chloride   and Calcium Chloride together with heat capacities and volumes measured   by V. Majer in France will be used to construct models for these salt   solutions near the critical point of water.  Model classical Hamiltonians   for the forces between the atomic sites in the molecules will also be   developed to make predictions, using molecular dynamics, in regions where   experiments are not possible.  High temperature aqueous solutions play an important role in a wide   variety     of industrial and natural processes.  Examples of these   processes are mineral transport, deposition and alteration, hydrocarbon   formation, migration and accumulation, electric power boiler corrosion,   and hydrothermal reservoir utilization.  There is also interest in using   supercritical water as a reaction medium for oxidative degradation of   hazardous waste, conversion of coal to gasoline, and as a reaction medium   for organic synthesis to replace conventional organic solvents.  Wood's   research will help to provide a basic understanding of ionic solutions at   high temperatures and pressures which is fundamentally important to the   efficient development of industrial uses of supercritical wate",
