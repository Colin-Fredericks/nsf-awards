 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to continue our work on the theory of low energy  nucleon-antinucleon annihilation.  A theory of annihilation  must begin with a theory of the nucleon with its conserved  quantum number, lead through the annihilation process and  end with an account of the many final states with the  corresponding many channels of mesons. The theory must have  its roots in the fundamental theory of the strong  interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).  The low energy  domain of annihilation is a particularly challenging one for  QCD and before our work there was no scheme that could  even begin to give a full account of annihilation.  We have  previously provided a remarkably good account of the final  states of annihilation, including all the many channels,  beginning with the classical (that is non-quantum) limit of  QCD represented by the Skyrme model. More recently we have  shown that the nucleon-antinucleon interaction can be  described using that same Skyrme model. We now propose to  put these initial state and final state pictures of  annihilation together and create a theory of annihilation  from start to finish. We propose a number of routes to this  goal. Our success thus far suggest that these approaches  will succeed, leading not just to a theory of annihilation  based in QCD but also to new insight into this complex  but  fundamental process.",
