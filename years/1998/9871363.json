 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the acquisition of equipment to upgrade a  cross-disciplinary research program in Molecular Systematic  and Evolution (the MSE group) at the Academy of Natural  Sciences of Philadelphia. These acquisitions will enhance  existing research efforts in molecular systematics and  population studies at the Academy, facilitate development of  the research programs of the group's six molecular  systematists and under pin the MSE group 's efforts in  systematics-related training, which is itself focused on a  student pool drawn from local universities. The MSE's newer  members increase the diversity of the taxonomic expertise at  the Academy; their laboratories will emphasize the  programmatic rather than taxonomic orientation of the MSE  group. The same basic research methods are used by all members  of the group, and the equipment will maximize research  productivity of the shared laboratories. Scientists and  students from the Academy and neighboring universities  participating in on-going joint programs with the Academy will  further contribute to this maximization of the use of the  facilities.    The centerpiece of the acquisitions in an automated DNA  sequencer with its auxiliary support tools: remote alarm  system for an ultra-cold freezer, automated thermocyclers and  imaging equipment. In order to provide a central site for  storage and manipulation of DNA sequence data, funding will  also establish a computer network for the MSE group; this  network will be integrated within the Academy' s existing  network of servers and provide seamless access among MSE  members and to Interact services.    The enhanced MSE facilities will significantly improve current  educational opportunities for students from area universities,  and in particular those from Drexel University, which trains  significant populations of minority and urban students. The  Academy is currently developing a formal program with Drexel  for biodiversity studies and will soon be implementing and NSF-  funded REU  Site award that will see further training of  students. The Academy offers Jessup and McHenry Fellowships  for graduate study that currently and in the near future will  see recipients using the MSE facilities. Also MSE members are  already supervising graduate students in systematics. The MSE  group, then, is and will be actively involved in a diversity  of training programs using undergraduate and graduate students  recruited for research programs and area faculty, all of whom  will be provided with hands-on research in collections-  oriented molecular systematics. The MSE group will act as a  team to train students and other users of the facility in the  theory and practice of modern molecular systematics.",
