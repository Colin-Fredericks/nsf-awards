In this project we study  problems in nonlinear parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential   equations and interacting particle systems, with  common underlying theme the presence and interrelation of multiple scales. We  address the following topics: (a) interacting particle systems with multiple scales, giving rise to discrete velocity models at a mesocopic level, and to hyperbolic conservation laws or nonlinear diffusions, at a macroscopic one, (b) existence and stability of periodic and solitary waves for hyperbolic conservation laws in the presence of relaxation mechanisms, (c) relaxation models and related numerical  schemes for front propagation problems, and (d) Monte-Carlo methods and random effects in the macroscopic limit of Ising models to geometric evolutions.  In addition to the analytical aspects of the project, one of the  objectives in (c) is the development of new  computational tools, through  relaxation models, for interface tracking applications; furthermore in (d), numerical experiments based on stochastic Ising models are employed, in an attempt to understand  from a microscopic point of view the effect of random perturbations on  interfacial evolutions.      B.Non-technical description of the project.    Phenomena involving multiple, interacting scales are widespread in areas as diverse as material science, chemical engineering, biology, atmospheric and environmental sciences,   communication networks and economics.  A typical example is the derivation of macroscopic properties of a material, for instance conductivity, from  its microscopic-molecular   or even atomic-structure. The challenges these problems present to scientists and engineers are formidable at many  levels: in experiments, modelling, mathematical analysis of models, construction of effective algorithms, simulation and verification of the models. The inherent  mathematical complexity of multiscale problems and our limited  understanding of their  nature so far, require a  methodical and detailed analysis both of the actual problems, as well as of   (carefully) simplified ones, that  illustrate in a clearer way a particular aspect of the phenomenon under study. The proposed research addresses mainly the mathematical analysis of some paradigms in multiscale processes and  touches upon the development of new computational tools, suggested by the mathematical theory. The motivation of the work   stems from phase transitions problems in material science, chemical engineering applications such as adsorption processes and  water waves and gas dynamics.",
