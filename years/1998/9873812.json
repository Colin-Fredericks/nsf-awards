Occidental is dedicated to becoming a national model that represents a multicultural liberal arts college. The College has developed and implemented successful activities that incorporate research into the educational experience for a diverse student body in an urban setting.  Interdisciplinary models first pioneered in the sciences are being transferred across the curriculum and ideas about using new technology for research are infused into science from other areas of the curriculum.  \r\n\r\nThe institution views research as an opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of the many facets comprising an academic discipline.  In research the student's emphasis shifts beyond knowing factors to constructing their understanding by critical thinking, effective writing, presentation of material, and discovery of new conceptual relations in collaboration with their mentors.  Providing these outcomes for all students in all disciplines is a long-term goal.\r\n\r\nOccidental College is being awarded  $500,000 to advance institutional goals of integrating research and education, document and disseminate information of its exemplary activities, and expand the integration of research and education by conducting outreach activities over the coming three years.  An example of the College's efforts to expand the educational activities across institutional boundaries is the incorporation of models derived from the research activities to the K-12 schools in the Los Angeles area.  An 85-foot oceanographic research vessel, the RV Vantuna, represents an example of a unique activity that integrates research and education.  The Vantuna provides an excellent opportunity to involve Occidental and Southern California high school and community college students in interdisciplinary marine research.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
