 "awd_abstract_narration": "9805848  Mousseau    The PI will investigate amorphous materials, such as eSi:H  and silica glass, using a MonteCarlo technique developed by  the PI. The activation-relaxation technique (ART) was  designed to overcome large energetic barriers that naturally  occur in calculations of the structure and longtime dynamics  of amorphous materials. Objectives of the research include:  the identification of microscopic structural relaxation  mechanisms in amorphous silicon and silica glass, the  exploration of whether a wide range of amorphous structures  can be obtained in simulations using ART, to classify the  type of structural relaxation mechanisms that can take place  in good quality networks of amorphous silicon, to identify  (using this classification) candidates associated with the  creation of defect centers responsible for the  Staebler-Wronski effect in e Si:H, and to further develop  the ART.  %%%  This research by a bright young investigator is aimed at a  better understanding of amorphous materials, in particular  silica glass and amorphous silicon doped with hydrogen. The  arrangement of atoms of both of these materials is affected  by illumination with light. The PI will investigate this  effect using a promising new computational algorithm that he  has developed. This new technique overcomes a central  difficulty of more commonly used methods to study amorphous  materials. The PI's research also involves further  development of computational methods for calculating atomic  arrangements and rearrangements in amorphous materials.  ***",
