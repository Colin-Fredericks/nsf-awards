The  helical  resonator allows measurements in the frequency range 100 MHz  to  3  GHz.  Measurements  of  both sample-induced  frequency  shifts  and  quality  factor changes will yield information about the dielectric  response and conductivity of semiconductor samples as a function of  dopant  levels near the MIT. The primary objectives of the  project  are  (1)  to  clarify  the nature of localization  and  interaction  corrections  the  complex dielectric response  of  barely  metallic  samples  in  order  to compare with theory, (2) to  search  for  an  unusual  frequency  dependence  of  conductivity  at  the  critical  concentration,  as temperature is lowered, and (3)  to  extend  the  microwave  measurements  to frequencies  well  above  3  GHz  using  conventional  network  analyzers and resonant  microwave  cavities.  Addition  research  will  involve a  study  of  the  electron  spin  resonance  (ESR)  linewidths of antimony doped  Si.  All  of  these  measurements bear on the general problem of conductivity in  highly  correlated  electron systems. The results will  be  relevant  to  a  number   of   related  scientific  areas  including   the   high-Tc  superconductivity problem. The project exposes graduate students to  fundamental  physics  and  provides experience  with  a  number  of  electrical  measurement techniques. Students  associated  with  the  project are prepared for a range of career opportunities.  %%%  Silicon, as the most important electronic material today, has  been  extensively  studied  for  more than four  decades.  Heavily  doped  silicon exhibits an insulator-to-metal transition as the doping  of  donors  or acceptors is increased above a critical density. Although  static  transport  and thermal properties of this phase  transition  have  been extensively studied there is still no generally accepted  understanding  of  this  unusual phase  transition  which  features  disorder,  electron-electron  interactions,  and  strong   electron  correlation.  Although  some infrared data exists  there  has  been  insufficient study of the dynamical properties of metallic  samples  as  a  function  of  frequency, doping and  temperature.  Microwave  studies  will be undertaken with a novel slow wave device  (helical  resonator),   along  with  conventional  microwave  cavities.   The  scientific  objectives are to understand the dynamical conductivity  and  dielectric  response  functions  of  both  the  localized  and  itinerant  electrons  present  in barely  metallic  samples.  These  microwave  studies  afford an excellent area for  the  training  of  graduate  students. This work may also impact our understanding  of  high temperature superconductivity.  ***",
