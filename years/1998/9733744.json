 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solomon Bililign of North Carolina A&T University is supported by the   Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in his studies on the effects of   electronic alignment in laser-induced metal-hydrogen (M-H2) and   metal-methane (M-CH4) reactions.  Specifically, he will investigate how   the electronic structure and electronic orbital alignment of a metal atom   affects the structure and chemical reactivity of M-H2 and M-CH4   complexes.  Far wing absorption spectroscopy will be extended to study   the continuum or scattering state of a transient bimolecular collision   complex and investigate depolarization, chemical quenching, and reaction   in LiH2, ZnH2 and ZnCH4 complexes.  The ultimate goal of these studies is   to gain new understanding and detailed knowledge about the physical and   chemical binding of some metals with hydrocarbons.  The educational   activities associated with this CAREER award include outreach programs to   schools in the community, links to industry, short term projects for   undergraduates and course development related to the research project   both at the undergraduate and graduate levels.    The interactions of hydrogen or carbon-hydrogen bonds with metal atom   sites is of great interest and importance to areas such as homogeneous or   heterogeneous catalysis and organometallic chemistry.  C-H bond   activation by metal atoms is one of the most important and basic   reactions in chemistry and may lead to more efficient and less costly   catalytic reactions.  Despite this importance, we do not yet have a   complete understanding of some of the simplest metal-atom-hydrocarbon   reactions.  These detailed studies will bring new understanding and   detailed knowledge about the physical and chemical binding of metals with   hydrocarbons.  In addition, this research program at a historically black   university will provide a very basic research infrastructure for the   training and education of underrepresented members of society and should   prove to be very effective in attracting African Americans and other   underrepresented groups to advanced research in science.",
