However, there are a number of examples in which elongating ribosomes are induced to shift into a new translational reading frame.  The study of these 'programmed ribosomal frameshifts' is important both because of the critical role that they play in the morphogenesis of a number of clinically significant viruses, and because of how they can be used to illuminate the underlying molecular mechanisms that are involved in regulating the fidelity of protein synthesis.  The mechanism of programmed ribosomal frameshifting in the -1 (3') direction is well conserved between mammalian cells and yeast.  Thus, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with its powerful molecular genetics, the ability to perform biochemical analysis, and the availability of the sequence of  the whole genome has been the organism of choice to characterize the mechanism of programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting.  The investigators have utilized the endogenous yeast L-A and M1 'killer' virus system as a model system to this end.  Recent studies have led them to focus on the peptidyl-transfer step of translational elongation as playing a critical role in determining the efficiency of programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting.  RPL3 encodes ribosomal protein L3, a protein that functions at the ribosome's peptidyl-transferase center, and they have characterized two alleles of RPL3 that promote altered frameshifting efficiencies and inhibit virus propagation.  Two different classes of rpl3 mutants are being characterized: an allele first identified more than 20 years ago called mak8-2, and a plasmid-borne gene fragment that encodes the N-terminal \u255d of the wild-type L3 protein (100 amino acids) that is called L3D.  The investigators have shown that both of these alleles promote increased programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift efficiencies and foster rapid loss of the M1 dsRNA satellite virus.  Thus, the primary objective of this project is to investigate the role of ribosomal protein L3 in programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting.  Specifically, the mutant rpl3 alleles will be characterized at the genetic and molecular levels, with an eye toward defining the molecular mechanism underlying the observed effects of mutant rpl3 alleles on programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting.\r\nMany viruses utilize a molecular mechanism called \"programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting\" for the production of specialized viral proteins.  The investigators have previously demonstrated that interfering with the host cellular machinery that directs this process interferes with the ability of these viruses to replicate and infect new cells.  The investigator's research has led them to focus on one specific step in the protein synthetic program as playing a critical role in programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting.  Specifically, they have found that cells having mutations in a cellular gene called RPL3 have altered programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting and cannot propagate a virus that depends on this mechanism.  Their current research focuses on characterizing a series of RPL3 mutants at the genetic and molecular levels.  These mutants will help define the mechanism of -1 ribosomal frameshifting and may identify potential new targets for antiviral agents. \r\n",
