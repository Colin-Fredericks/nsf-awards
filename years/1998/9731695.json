 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731695  Klinkhammer  This award supports participation of Oregon State University  (OSU) researchers in an expedition of the German oceanographic  research vessel POLARSTERN to the Antarctic Ocean (POLARSTERN  cruise ANT-XV/2).  Previous OSU researchers supported by the US  Antarctic Program identified several areas of hydrothermal  venting in the Bransfield Strait.  This discovery has important  implications to the biogeography of vent animals, the geological  evolution of ore deposits, and the chemical and heat budgets of  the Earth.  The previous work sampled water and particles from  above the vent sites at a reconnaissance level.  Subsequent  chemical analyses of these samples provided insight into the  chemistry of fluids emanating from vents on the sea floor.  The  POLARSTERN cruise affords a unique opportunity to build on these  discoveries in the Bransfield Strait, foster future international  work in the Bransfield area, extend research on hydrothermal  activity to other parts of the Antarctic Peninsula region, and  develop a working relationship with a strong international group.  In particular, the POLARSTERN expedition provides the opportunity  for: 1) additional sampling of water and suspended particulate  matter in the water column over the Bransfield hydrothermal sites   this sampling would be aided by German photographic  reconnaissance; 2) reconnaissance, to determine the broader  geographical extent of hydrothermal activity, would be extended  to the Scotia Arc and trench areas following the general theme of  the German program which is fluid expulsion from the Scotia-  Bransfield system; and 3) the use of unique tools available on  the POLARSTERN such as a camera sled and grab bottom sampler.  This work will make it possible to better define the location of  hydrothermal vents and to begin to quantify the amount of water  being expelled by this hydrothermal activity.  If vents can be  precisely located, the bottom photography holds the promise of  revealing possible biologic al communities associated with these  submarine hot springs.",
