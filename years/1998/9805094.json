 "awd_abstract_narration": "With increasing size and the rate at which their configuration change, mobility management in ad-hoc networks is expected to be one of the basic challenges in the design of this breed of networks. The basic shortcoming of the traditional HLR/VLR based mobility management schemes stems from two problems: nodes that serve as HLRs may be frequently unreachable (due to the intermittent wireless connectivity in such networks) and the association of a mobile with a particular HLR requires dissemination of this information to all  the network nodes, presence of which in the network may frequently change.    In the proposed scheme, a subset of nodes in the network dynamically assumes the function of the \"Mobility Reporting Centers\" (MRCs). The \"location\" of a mobile is reported to a set (quorum) of the MRCs. To locate a mobile, a set (quorum), possibly different from the reported-to one, is queried. As any two quorums intersect, the querying operation is ensured to produce the location of the mobile. As the quorums may overlap in multiple MRCs, loss of connectivity with a limited number of MRCs may have no effect on the ability of the scheme to locate a mobile. Finally, due to the \"network-wide known\" scheme for quorum creation, there is no need to disseminate the information of association of a mobile with a particular MRC - any reported-to and queried-from two quorums will produce the sought answer.     In the proposed one-year feasibility study, we will tackle the following topics:  (i) study of the complexity and associated overhead of the quorum-based mobility management scheme' (ii) quorum construction strategies that ensure high degree of reliability with limited network load and uniform MRCs' processing load; (iii) reduction of the probability of erroneous operations and/or inconsistent querying results during the reconfiguration periods;",
