Lake-effect weather  events, where cold air masses are rapidly modified over the Great Lakes, are  excellent natural laboratories for studying these exchanges. The Lake-Induced  Convection Experiment (Lake-ICE) is a multiple-Principal Investigator project which  seeks to use this natural laboratory to determine how boundary layer growth  processes are controlled by mesoscale boundary layer convective structures and how  the modified boundary layer effects the production of precipitation and the larger  scale meteorological conditions.         In this research effort, the Principal Investigator will study the four  dimensional characteristics of the evolution of the boundary layer near the upwind  shore of Lake Michigan. To accomplish this, the Principal Investigator will deploy  and operate a  Volume Imaging Lidar (VIL) on the west shore of Lake Michigan  during the Lake-ICE project.  The lidar will observe the growing convective  boundary layer over the lake as cold air passes over the warm water.  These  observations will complement airborne and ground-based radar measurements  planned for mid-Lake area and the eastern shore and will be coordinated with other  research meteorological measurements.  During a typical data session, the VIL will  repetitively scan a three-dimensional volume extending to 21 km downwind.  These  images of aerosol backscatter will record the growth of convection as the air moves  downwind.          Specifically, the lidar data will be analyzed to provide: 1) the depth of the  boundary layer as a function of distance downwind, 2) the wind speed and direction  as a function of downwind distance and altitude, 3) the dimensions and aspect  rations of the convective plumes, 4) the spatial organization of the convective cells  in the convective field, 5) the decorrelation time for convective structures, 6) the  d ownwind distance and altitude of first cloud formation.        The primary application of the lidar data will be to evaluate numerical  models of the boundary layer over the lake.  In addition, the Principal Investigators  will evaluate the ability of a large eddy simulation to derive an explicit description  of the convective field.          Successful completion of this research will increase fundamental  understanding of the evolution of the lake boundary layer which is crucial to  understanding and forecasting the very disruptive lake-effect snow events.  ***",
