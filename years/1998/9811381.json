Such approximations constitute  the natural generalization of Hartree-Fock theories to  systems with strong interactions and large electronic  fluctuations, including the cuprate high-temperature  superconductors.  The research proposed concentrates on (a)  the extension of the one-body self-consistent field approach  to models with arbitrary space-and time-dependent  interactions, and (b) the development of a computationally  efficient technique for solving the parquet problem in low-  dimensional systems.  These projects are made possible by  using a novel representation for two-body scattering  vertices.  %%%  This theoretical research project involves developing  computational techniques to deal with electronic systems,  such as the high temperature superconductors, where the  electrons interact strongly.  In cases such as these,  conventional theoretical and computational techniques fail  to provide accurate results.  If successful, the project  will have wide application.  ***",
