The University of Chicago is a co-organizer of the event in collaboration with Shanghai Power Hospital, Chinese Burn Association, and the U. S. Electric Power Research Institute.\r\n\r\nMedical and safety professionals, as well as industry representatives from China and neighboring countries are to attend the conference and share their experiences in the areas of electrical injury epidemiology and pathophysiology, advances in diagnosis and treatment, psychosocial rehabilitation, and industrial electrical safety practices.  A number of world authorities in this field are scheduled as invited speakers.\r\n\r\nThe conference offers a great learning experience for young investigators in the multidisciplinary field of electrical trauma.  The travelers will be able both to learn from the leading experts and present their first research to an international peer group.  The active participation of young investigators in this conference is expected to contribute to the future success of international cooperation in science, medicine, and industrial and environmental safety. The conference proceedings are to be published in the Annuals of the New York Academy of Sciences. \r\n\r\n",
