 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727659    Starmer    The species of yeast that live in decaying stem or fruit tissues of cactus are distinctly different. Even though the two communities are found side-by-side, they rarely share common species. This grant will use this biological situation as an experimental system to examine the reasons for membership in biological communities and their overall diversity. Factors that will be studied include: 1) dispersal, the role of drosophilid vectors that distribute the yeasts from habitat to habitat; 2) species interactions, the role of killer toxins produced by some of the yeasts; and  3) their interactions, the role of trade-offs between colonization and competitive ability. Interactions between dispersal and interactions will be investigated in depth to test the hypothesis that increasing the colonization ability of highly competitive organisms has a greater influence on community membership than increasing the colonization ability of poorer competitors.  The work will be done by using experimental microcosms in a laboratory. These investigations should contribute to an understanding of the factors influencing microbial diversity and provide knowledge on what maintains distinct community types in the natural world. The study relates directly to concerns in applied biology about the maintenance of biological diversity in general and about the practical use of microorganisms for biological control.",
