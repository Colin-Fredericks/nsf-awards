 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726635  Babcock    This award supports the participation of American scientists  and engineers in a U.S.-Japan seminar on proton-coupled  electron transfer, to be held in Kona, Hawaii,  November 11-  15, 1998.  The co-organizers are Professor Gerald Babcock of  Michigan State University and Professor Teizo Kitagawa of  the Okazaki National Research Institute in Japan.  Recent  rapid  advances have been made in this area.  The x-ray  crystal structures of the bacterial reaction center, the  cytochrome oxidase and the cytochrome bc1 complex have been  solved.  Important structural work has come from studies  using resonance raman infrared and electron paramagnetic  resonance spectroscopy.  In addition models for proton  coupling to electron transfer and pathways for proton  transfer into the electron transfer site have been presented  and tested by kinetic measurements, site directed  mutagenesis, theoretical calculations and other methods.  Discussions will focus on these models.    This  area of research has important applications in  photosynthesis and respiration; oxygen evolution in  photosystem II and oxygen reduction in cytochrome c oxidase,  quinone reduction in bacterial reaction centers and quinone  reactions in the cytochrome bc1 complex.  The exchange of  ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will  enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will  set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Seminar  organizers have made a special effort to involve a mix of  researchers, including postdoctoral researchers and graduate  students.  Proceedings of the meeting are expected to be  made available by the organizers.  ***",
