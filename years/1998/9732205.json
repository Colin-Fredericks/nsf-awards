 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the design and analysis of  asymptotically efficient algorithms for finite matrix groups.    While three decades of work in computational group theory have  resulted in a thorough understanding, both theoretical and  practical, of many algorithmic aspects of permutation groups,  virtually no efficient algorithms have been designed until  recently in the potentially more important domain of matrix  groups. This latter area, however, is currently experiencing  explosive growth.    This research focuses on theoretical aspects and polynomial time  algorithms.  Past experience shows that this approach has the  potential of yielding important insights which may lead to  efficient implementations.  Indeed, algorithms inspired by the  polynomial-time paradigm have made their way into the widely used  group theory package GAP.    The main objective is to map out the normal structure of a matrix  group given by a list of generators. Components of this project  include a number of problems to be handled in the more general  context of \"black-box groups\" (the group operations are performed  by a \"black box\"). A key ingredient is the black-box recognition  of finite simple groups. Another component consists in \"getting  past\" a simple top quotient.    The methods include the statistical analysis of number theoretic  properties of the orders of elements in finite simple groups  (based on the classification of finite simple groups).  One of  the main obstacles seems to require the study of modular  representations of simple groups. Combinatorial methods seem to  be called for in the analysis of random sampling heuristics which  are required for most existing matrix group algorithms.",
