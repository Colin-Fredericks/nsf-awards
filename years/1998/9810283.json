 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810283  Hogen-Esch    At low degrees af polymerization (DP< 30) the pendent phenyl  groups of macrocyclic polystyrene are known to organize in  parallel fashion leading to increased absorptivity  (hyperchromicity) and strongly (six times) enhanced excimer  fluorescence.  The synthesis is proposed (by anionic  polymerization followed by high dilution coupling) of analogous  macrocyclic vinyl polymers such as macrocyclic  polyvinylnaphthalene containing single photochemical acceptors  such anthracene or pyrene.  Such polymers are expected to be  capable of strongly enhanced absorptivity and efficient Foster  transfer to the photochemical acceptor.  The enhanced  absorptivity and luminescence of the above macrocycles will be  applied to the synthesis of macrocyclic photon harvesting  antenna type polymers containing a peripherally positioned  acceptor chromophore the orientation of which with respect to  the parallel set of pendent donors, is systematically optimized  to allow highly efficient donor- donor and donor- acceptor  coupling.  Thus the key issue that will receive attention will  be the optimization of donor-donor and donor-acceptor  orientation with respect to the quantum yield of conversion of  incident light.       The donors and acceptor combinations will be those that  have been well studied in other types of antenna polymers  such as linear- random or block copolymers of donor and  acceptors, or photozymes, dendrimers incorporating donor -  acceptor combinations etc., so that comparisons with a  variety of alternative structures are possible.  The acceptors to be included into the PS macrocycles through  incorporation into the coupling agent will include naphthalenes  incorporated through the 1,2- 2,3- or 2,6- positions.  Acceptors  in the proposed polyvinylnaphthalenes will include anthracenes,  pyrenes and similar chromophores the incorporation of which also  will be subject to a systematic change in orientation with regard  to the donor chromophores.       The extent of donor-do nor energy migration and donor-  acceptor singlet transfer in the macrocycles and in the  macrocyclic antenna polymers will be studied by steady state  and time resolved luminescence measurements at ambient  temperatures and in low temperature glasses using both  circularly- and plane-polarized light.  %%%  These polymers are of potential interest in efficient light  emitting- and in optical power limiting devices and in  upconversion lasing of photovoltaics.  The possible similarity  to chrorophyll assemblies is striking and will be explored.  ***",
