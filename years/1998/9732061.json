 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics at Iowa State University is hosting  a summer NSF-REU program which has scientific computing as it's  theme.  Scientific computing has become a powerful and essential  tool in conducting research in science and engineering.  The goal  of this program is to expose a small group of undergraduates to  research in an application area which uses scientific computing.   The program will be conducted for eight weeks during the summer  months.  To be eligible for participation in the program the  applicant must be a citizen or permanent resident of the United  States.  The participants should have at least the equivalent of  two years of calculus and come computing background.    Each participant will be involved in an ongoing research project  which will include at least one faculty mentor, a graduate  student and two to three participants.  The research topics that  are proposed cover a wide range of aspects of scientific  computing such as modeling, grid generation, numerical  simulations, and visualization of simulations.  The projects will  give the participants an introduction to applications areas such  as computational biology, fluid dynamics, porous media flow,  modeling of chemical reactions, and superconductivity.  In  addition to the research project, participants will attend  workshops on the computational tools that will be needed to  complete their project as well as some topics in mathematics that  are not usually covered at the undergraduate level.  At the end  of the eight week period the students will write a paper which  will appear in the Department's preprint series and the students  will also give a multi-media presentation on their research  project.",
