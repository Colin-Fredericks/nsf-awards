 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 98-09878 SHEA.  \"Neurons\" (the cells of the brain) transmit  electrical and chemical signals that allow us to think, feel and  move.  Neurons connect to each other by long extensions of their  bodies termed \"axons\".  These axons function essentially like  telephone wires, allowing neurons to transmit their signals to  each other.   Neurons are unlike other cells in the body in that  they are never replaced.  Once a neuron dies, its functions are  therefore lost forever.  Accordingly, excessive loss of neurons,  or disconnection of their axons, can lead to human disorders such  as Lou Gerhig's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease or mental  retardation.   Importantly, the axons are supported internally by  a scaffold comprised of many proteins.  These proteins  interconnect like building blocks, a form a skeleton (the  \"cytoskeleton\") within the axon itself.  This cytoskeleton  maintains the shape of the axon like girders can hold up a  building.  Unlike the static girders of a building, however, the  cytoskeleton of the axon must continually be repaired and  maintained with new building blocks. This process places a  considerable burden on neurons.  Our studies address how neurons  manage to maintain this scaffold for a person's lifetime, and will  identify particular aspects of this process that are prone to  errors that may lead to disconnection of neurons.",
