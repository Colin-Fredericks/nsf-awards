 "awd_abstract_narration": "Turgay Uzer is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research on Rydberg State Dynamics in Atoms and Molecules.    Uzer will study the dynamics of Rydberg states in atoms and molecules using classical and quantum approaches.  He will study the formation of very high molecular Rydberg states as related to zero-electron-kinetic-energy (ZEKE) spectroscopy and the synthesis of nonspreading wavepackets in atoms.   The research will rely heavily on the progress he has recently made in the theory of atomic and molecular Rydberg states perturbed by external fields - especially in problems involving Coriolis forces.\r\n\r\nZEKE spectroscopy has matured into a very high resolution spectroscopy for the study of short lived intermediates in chemical reactions.  It has even yielded the first direct spectroscopic data on elusive transition states of chemical reactions.  It also provides measurement to a very high degree of accuracy and at a resolution three orders of magnitude better than other major techniques such as photoelectron spectroscopy.  Uzer's research will shed new light on the interpretation and potential applications of this powerful spectroscopic technique.\r\n",
