 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deoller  9728409    Hydrogen  sulfide, a common constituent of  several  natural  and  man-made  aquatic habitats, is both a potent  toxin  of  aerobic  cellular respiration and an electron-rich  molecule  used  by  some  bacteria as an energy source.   In  ciliated  gills  from Geukensia demissa, a marine mussel from sulfide  rich  sediments, sulfide oxidation supports  cellular  work,  indicating  for  the first time that in an  intact  metazoan  tissue,  mitochondria  switch  from  carbon  catabolism   to  sulfide  oxidation for energy production.  In this  project,  using  excised  intact G. demissa gills  and  isolated  gill  mitochondria,   three  central  questions   concerning   the  transition from carbon catabolism to sulfide oxidation  will  be  addressed:  what is the nature of this transition;  what  factors  regulate  it; and, since sulfide  exposure  history  influences capacity for sulfide oxidation, what mechanism(s)  underlies this alternation in capacity?  The results of this  work  will help rigorously address a long-standing question,  namely  how  do  organisms adapt to sulfide  exposure?   The  findings  may  indicate  that energy budgets  of  ecosystems  containing sulfide habitats need reconsideration if  sulfide  oxidation   can  result  in  carbon  sparing  in  metazoans.  Assessment  of  mitochondrial function using innovative  and  state-of-the-art  techniques will further our  understanding  of   this   possibly  widespread  adaptation  to   seemingly  in hospitable environments.",
