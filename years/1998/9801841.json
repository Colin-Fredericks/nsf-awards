It is focused on  two  topics. First is the study of nonequilibrium transport using  massive  reservoirs to cool the conduction electrons  and  tunnel  junctions  to probe their non-equilibrium distribution  function.  The  second  topic novel behavior associated with  the  proximity  effect  in  hybrid  samples with both normal and  superconducting  metals.  The work in one aspect is concerned with the fundamental  nature  of the electronic Fermi lquid in disordered metals.  This  research program is interdisciplinary in nature and has typically  involved  several  undergraduate and  graduate  students  in  its  activities.  These involvements are beneficial in the preparation  of  students  for  further  study and for  careers  in  industry,  government laboratories or academia.  %%%  This  experimental research project is concerned with  the  wave-  like nature of electrons in extremely small samples of metal. The  size  of the samples of interest is on the scale of micro-meters,  or  roughly the same size scale as active elements in some modern  computer  chips.  The electric charge carrying  current  in  such  small  samples move in ways governed by quantum mechanics.  These  motions  are different than the motions of familiar objects  like  tennis  balls,  and  the  differences are  important  to  further  advance   the   performance   of   computer   chips   and   other  microelectronic devices. This experimental work is carried out in  metal samples of controlled disorder and also involves the use of  an  applied  magnetic  field.  Modern  electron-beam  lithography  techniques  are  employed  in part of  the  work.  This  research  program is interdisciplinary in nature and has typically involved  several  undergraduate and graduate students in  its  activities.  These  involvements are be neficial in the preparation of students  for  further  study  and  for  careers  in  industry,  government  laboratories or academia.  ***",
