 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fluorescence spectroscopy is currently being used at the forefront of chemical research. Unfortunately, this technique has not received proportional exposure in the typical undergraduate chemistry curriculum. The primary objectives of this proposal are to increase the applicability of fluorescence in the curriculum, and prepare chemistry students to deal with more sophisticated chemical problems and techniques that are representative of current technology. In the process of addressing these issues. students will also be more prepared to participate in undergraduate research, and the probability that their research results will be publishable under current standards will increase.  A series of novel. fluorescence-based, laboratory experiments will be developed that will highlight fluorescence as a contemporary research method in environmental., analytical, physical and biochemistry courses. These laboratory exercises will gradually increase in complexity as students progress through the chemistry curriculum. The increasing complexity of fluorescence experiments implemented over a four year curriculum will force students to retain material from previous courses. Several of the experiments proposed are to: probe cyclodextrin host-guest complexation. follow the curing of epoxy, elucidate polymer dynamics, measure enzyme kinetics of aldehyde dehydrogenase in human saliva, and detect 0, by fabricating a fiber-optic sensor after repeatedly using an analytical technique over several years. students will be able to meet challenges that are not possible if they only have one or two chances to use it. Students will be provided with a means to master this techniques, rather than just be introduced to it. By spiraling fluorescence throughout the curriculum, students will be better prepared for undergraduate research. industrial positions, and graduate school.",
