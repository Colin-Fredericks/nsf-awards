The units reflect apply a design and technology approach to real-world activities. The units are intended to increase the scientific and technological literacy, capability, and responsibility of all students.     The \"TechEdge Topics\" for grades K-2 and 3-5 are based upon subject matter that is both interesting to young learners and relevant to business and industrial settings in such areas as transportation, food, safety and security, health, utilities, and industries. Each unit for grades K-2 is comprised of a \"Guided Portfolio,\" a \"Big Book, and a \"Teacher's Guide.\" Units developed for grades 3-5 each include a \"Guided Portfolio,\" a \"Technology Education Topic Book,\" and a \"Teacher's Guide.\"     The project taps the potential of business, industry, and engineering communities to assist curriculum developers and educators in developing and disseminating integrated science, mathematics, and technology materials. TIES Magazine and the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce will lead in distribution of the materials after field-testing and revision.",
