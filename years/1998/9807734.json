 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the isolation of bromoperoxidases from   marine organisms and the development of methodology for the use of the   bromoperoxidases as environmentally benign bromination reagents.  Marine   algae, sponges and bacteria will be screened for bromoperoxidases using   techniques developed previously for Plocamium cartilagineum and Portieria   hornemanni.  The efficacy of the bromoperoxidase as bromination agents   will be tested using phenol, methyl salicylate, p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol,   geraniol and linalool.  The halogenation of alkenes, alkene cyclization,   chiral epoxidation and the bromination of heteraromatics, cyclopropanes   and alkynes will also be carried out.  Undergraduate students will take   part in all phases of the work.  With this Research in Undergraduate   Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry   Program is supporting the research efforts of Professors Roy K. Okuda and   Patricia L. Grillione of the Department of Chemistry at San Jose State   University.  The focus of the work will be to develop synthetic methods   for the use of bromoperoxidases as chemoenzymatic reagents for the   environmentally friendly bromination of organic compounds.  The work will   be carried out  with the involvement of undergraduate students",
