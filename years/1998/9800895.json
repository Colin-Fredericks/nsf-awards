 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9800895  Pearson     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop and test nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) based process control devices for asphalt-aggregate mixes.  The Phase I research demonstrated how hardware improvements, including a shim system for a Halbach dipole magnet, makes laboratory and on-line instrumentation possible.  The laboratory unit will be able to measure asphalt physical properties in neat asphalt in mixes over a wide range of temperatures.  The on-line unit will lead to asphalt process control in a hot mix plant and at paving sites.  An in situ device will be designed and tested on in-place pavement.  Previous work by the firm demonstrated how asphalt physical properties change when mixed with aggregate and how these changes can be measured with nmr to determine what is defined as \"free asphalt\" in a mix.  This free asphalt probably has an important impact on pavement physical and use properties.  This could eventually lead to the development of instrumentation that can measure the amount and physical properties of asphalt in pavements without removing a sample from the pavement.    Commercial applications for this technology exist in asphalt laboratories, hot mix plants and in-place pavements.  Applications also exist in food processing.  ***",
