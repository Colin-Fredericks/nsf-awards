 "awd_abstract_narration": "Runtime systems are critical to the implementation of parallel programming languages and libraries.  They provide the core functionality of a particular programming model and the glue between the model and the underlying hardware and operation system.  As such, runtime systems have a large impact on the performance and portability of parallel programming systems.  Despite the importance of runtime systems, there are few forums in which practitioners can exchange their ideas, and these are typically forums showcasing peripheral areas, such as languages, operating systems, and parallel computing.  This Workshop on Runtime Systems for Parallel Programming (RTSPP) will provide a forum for bringing together runtime system designers from various backgrounds to discuss the state-of-the-art in designing and implementing runtime systems for parallel programming.  Rather than focusing on languages or compilers, the focus of RTSPP is squarely on runtime system design and evaluation.",
