The principal        investigator is Dr. William Green at the Massachusetts Institute of        Technology.  New technology is developed to remove sulfur compounds        from gasoline and fuel oils. Traditionally, sulfur removal is done        through catalytic technologies using hydrodesulfurization catalysts.        The alternate route studied here involves the selective binding of        these compounds to functionalized magnetic particles. These functional        moieties attached to the magnetic particles are either polymers and/or        surfactants adsorbed onto the particle surface. Various schemes for        the selective extraction of the sulfur compounds onto the particles        are considered. The final objective is incorporation of the sulfur        compounds into the adsorbed layers of the particles. The particles are        then removed through a magnetic field gradient, regenerated and cycled        back.               This technology of sulfur removal could be extremely cost effective        since it does not involve high temperature reaction or multiphase        extraction. The application of such technology could result in a        paradigm shift for the petroleum and fuel processing industries.",
