 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of a subsurface biosphere on Earth has recently captured the imagination of researchers and the public worldwide. Evidence for a hot subsurface biosphere associated with deep sea hydrothermal vents includes submersible observations of flocculent microbial material emerging from recent eruption sites and the detection of hyperthermophiles in diffuse (cool) hydrothermal fluids, microorganisms that must have originated in deeper (hotter) realms of the subsurface given their thermal growth requirements. Active sulfide structures or black smokers on the seafloor, releasing high temperature fluids that have presumably flushed through such subsurface habitats, provide an opportunity to test for the upper thermal boundaries of the subsurface biosphere on Earth and, by extrapolation, elsewhere in the Universe. This proposal is to complete the development and submersible testing phase of a novel in situ titanium device, called the LAREDO sampler, that can be deployed in the focused flow of a black simoker for insitu microbial experimentation at high temperature in the absence of decompression effects. The same or successive models can also provide for in situ tests of the thermal stability of organic compounds under hydrostatic pressure or of other abiotic processes critical to assessing the possibility that life may have originated in the subseafloor. A (future) streamlined version of the sampler, deployable deep within a hot oil well or a legacy hole of the Ocean Drilling Program, could be used to extend the geographic testing range to terrestrial and non vent sites. The recent explosion of interest in the subsurface biosphere, in life in extreme environments, and in the new field of astrobiology, suggests that the time is ripe to proceed with development of effective, if high risk, deep sea experimental tools that can provide novel information not obtainable in laboratory simulations.",
