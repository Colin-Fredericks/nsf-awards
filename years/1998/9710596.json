In hp-cloud methods, the solution of the governing differential equations is obtained without resorting to a finite element/volume mesh or finite difference cells -- the approach removes the burden of mesh generation.  High-quality local approximations are built around a 'sprinkle' of nodal points (such local supports being termed as 'clouds'), and can be h-adapted (by simply inserting more nodal points) or locally enriched i.e. p-adapted by stacking-up more degrees-of-freedom at a chosen node.  The proposed hp-clouds technology is an original generalization of the moving least squares approximation methods used in various existing meshless implementations (such as the Element-Free-Galerkin-Method).  Current research shows that hp-clouds is computationally efficient, is easy to adapt to the geometry, evolving and directional solution features, and possesses high potential for parallel computations.  Since no mesh connectivity is required, this method offers immense flexibility in design optimization processes when changes to geometric shapes and addition/removal of components are frequent.    A successful completion of the proposed project will result in pre-commercial technology and software which will be ready for immediate application in computer-aided-engineering (CAE) design and analysis tools.  These tools will find immediate application across a wide range of manufacturing industries, including automotive, casting, molding and extrusion, food and chemical., turbo-machinery, and others.    ***",
