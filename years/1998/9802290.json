 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802290  Garoff    This is small group research proposal involving in two physicists and  an  engineer. The project will investigate phenomena occurring in the  microscopic region near the three-phase contact line where a solid, a  wetting  liquid  and  the  vapor phase meet.  In  complex  or  multi-  component  fluids,  it  is  qualitatively  known  that  the  relative  concentration  and self-assembly of the components near  the  contact  line  and  in the thin film differ from those in the bulk or  on  the  interface  far  from  the  contact  line.  However,  there  is  scant  quantitative  information  about what is going  on.  Using  ultrahigh  vacuum,   optical,   x-ray,  neutron  and  atomic  force   microscopy  techniques  the  researchers will investigate the unique  microscopic  structures  of  these films and self-assemblies, and probe  how  they  control  macroscopic  wetting phenomena. The project  will  integrate  studies  of high temperature, metallic systems with studies  of  room  temperature,  aqueous and organic systems. The research will  improve  the  understanding of how fluids behave in confined environments  and  will  generally improve our knowledge of how fluids wet and flow over  surfaces.  The  multidisciplinary character of the  project  provides  excellent training for graduate students, preparing them for  careers  in  a range of technical areas. The research is fundamental, but  its  application  to  technology  in many  areas,  such  as  printing  and  mechanics, is immediate and of high importance.  %%%  This is small group research proposal involving in two physicists and  an engineer. The research is focused on how a fluid wets and flows on  a  surface.  This  is  a  complex problem  which  is  of  fundamental  importance. It also has great technical importance in areas  such  as  lubrication,  detergents, etc. The research group will use  ultrahigh  vacuum,   optical,   x-ray,  neutron  and  atomic  force   microscopy  techniques  the  researchers wi ll investigate the unique  microscopic  structures  of  these films and self assemblies, and probe  how  they  control  macroscopic  wetting phenomena.
