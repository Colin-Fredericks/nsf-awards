 "awd_abstract_narration": "EVANS  9801287     The physiology of individual plants is influenced by climate and weather  on multiple spatial and temporal scales. How widely distributed species  respond to variation in climate throughout their range and to temporal  variation over multiple time scales is not well understood. Lack of  knowledge on this subject prevents agriculturists from understanding how  crops respond to different growing conditions, resource managers from  making correct use and conservation decisions and researchers from learning  how ecosystems ultimately respond to climate change. The PIs research  focuses on assessing physiological changes associated with interannual  differences in weather, seasonal climatic shifts and spatial climatic  trends throughout the range of Fremont cottonwood. This species is the  primary component of forests which parallel valley rivers throughout the  arid western U.S. The PIs chose this species because of its importance as  the only tree species throughout much of the lowland western U.S. The PIs  are employing a variety of methods including direct measurement of  instantaneous physiological parameters such as water status and  photosynthesis as well as long term, integrated measurements such as carbon  isotope analysis. The PIs current data suggests a close correspondence  between climate and physiology for our study species.",
