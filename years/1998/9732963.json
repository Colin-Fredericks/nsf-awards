In particular,  the principal investigator will study chiral molecular  systems, both in the dilute limit by studying single chiral  polymers, such as DNA, as well as in the semi-dilute limit  where they form chiral liquid crystals.  In the dilute limit  a generalization of the exact mapping between self-avoiding  random walks and the n-component Ising model, as n  approaches zero, can be used to study chiral random walks.  Just as the theory of a single self-avoiding walk can be  used to study a semi-dilute melt of polymers, this extension  can be used to study a semi-dilute melt of topologically  linked polymers.  The plan is to pursue this in connection  with a number of experiments and to augment analytical  theory with comparison to numerics.    In the more concentrated regime, chiral polymers can form  liquid crystalline phases such as the polymer cholesteric  phase and the columnar hexagonal phase.  Often, the chiral  interactions are frustrated by the liquid crystalline  packing of the molecules.  Recent experiments on DNA appear  to find a frustrated phase in which chirality is absent  although theory suggests there is no frustration.  An  extensive analysis of the effect of the crystalline or  liquid-crystalline order on the chiral interaction will be  pursued as a possible explanation of the weaker than  expected chirality in the observed phase.    Integrated with the research program, a course will be  developed aimed at first-year students on the subject of  chiral symmetry in nature.  Through both historic and  scientific exposition the instructor will describe chirality  as a way of introducing the idea of symmetry.  Since  chirality is a central notion in much of science and  engineering, the course will thread through history touching  on the use and discovery of chirality in different contexts.  This discourse will include Pasteur's discovery of  chirality,  the structure of proteins and DNA as well as the  discovery of parity violation in elementary particle  physics.  Lectures will be supplemented with simple  demonstrations, such as rotation of the polarization of  light in corn syrup and quartz.  Finally, a discussion of  left-right asymmetry in the Universe, i.e., baryon  asymmetry, will be presented.  %%%  This is a CAREER award which integrates research and  education.  In this particular case, theoretical research  will be conducted on the chiral molecular systems.  Chirality is the property of systems in nature which  distinguishes between left and right symmetry.  Chiral  polymers, such as DNA, will be studied as well as more  concentrated solutions which form chiral liquid crystal  phases.
