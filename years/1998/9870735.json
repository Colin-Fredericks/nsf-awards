This Congress, held once every four or five years, is the only international forum devoted exclusively to research on social insects.  The planned symposium, entitled \"Tribal Phylogeny of the Corbiculate bees: An Evaluation of Diverse Data Sets\", will focus on the phylogeny of this important group of insects, which includes the honey bees and stingless bees with their elaborate social behavior, and the social bumble bees and mostly solitary orchid bees.  For both practical and theoretical reasons this group is receiving intensive phylogenetic and behavioral study.  Presentations by scientists from different parts of the world, featuring recent advances in the use of molecular data, the development of new morphological character sets and advanced approaches to combining diverse data sets will enhance further research progress and foster international collaboration.  In conjunction with the symposium, a workshop will be devoted to discussion of future critical research areas, and to the coordination of an effort to establish a WWW relational database of phylogenetic information on the corbiculate bees.  Preliminary investigation of TreeBASE, the first database developed to store and retrieve published phylogenetic trees and their underlying data matrices, indicates that it is the best, and only, database available to date for storing and accessing phylogenetic knowledge.  Because of the great expense associated with travel to Australia, support is requested to ensure that the invited speakers and workshop leaders are able to participate in this important meeting.",
