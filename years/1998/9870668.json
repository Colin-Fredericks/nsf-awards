 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870668  Mark       This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training  (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a broadly-  based graduate training program in geographic information  science, an emerging area of research that lies at the  intersection of the cognitive, computational and social  sciences.  The program will be a joint effort of 19 faculty  and of 6 non-academic mentors who will supervise students  during internships in the private and public sector.  Participating faculty come from 7 departments and the school  of library and information science.  The collaborative  research foci of participants range from basic studies the  ontogeny of human conceptions of geographic space to applied  research in practical applications such as delivery of  governmental services and environmental modeling.  NSF support  will provide stipends for 18 graduate students each year, and  for related costs of student research training.  Students will  register in and satisfy the coursework requirements of any one  of 7 existing departmental Ph.D. programs, but will have IGERT-  specific requirements for 4 courses and must choose from a  restricted set of elective courses.  Of these required and  elective courses, five are to be created specifically for the  IGERT program.  As part of their training, students will  complete an internship at a major software company or at the  Buffalo police department.       IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program whose goal is to sponsor  the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate  programs that will train a diverse group of new scientists and  engineers to be well-prepared for varied careers in the  private and public sectors.  IGERT provides an opportunity for  the development of new, well-focused multidisciplinary  programs that bridge traditional organizational barriers,  uniting faculty from several departments or institutions to  establish a highly-interactive collaborative environment for  both training and research.  In its first year, the p rogram  will provide support to 17 institutions for new or nascent  programs that collectively span all areas of science,  engineering and mathematics eligible for support by the NSF.",
