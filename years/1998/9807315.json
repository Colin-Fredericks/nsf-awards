 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fox  9807315    In many organisms, a female's environment provides a reliable indicator of  the environmental conditions that her progeny will encounter.  In such  cases, maternal effects may evolve as mechanisms for trans-generational  phenotypic plasticity, whereby, in response to a predictive environmental  cue (such high or low host density, short or long photoperiod), a mother can change the type of eggs that she makes, or can program a developmental  switch in her offspring, producing offspring prepared for the environmental  conditions predicted by the cue.  These maternal effects often have a  genetic basis, and appear to be adaptive in many organisms.  Yet little is  understood about the evolutionary genetics of maternal effects or the nature  and consequences of selection on maternal effects, such that the potential  for them to respond to natural selection remains largely speculative.  This  proposal describes a series of experiments designed to test hypotheses that  explain the evolution of egg size, egg number, and egg size plasticity (an  apparently adaptive maternal effect) in a seed beetle, Stator limbatus.  Specifically, this research will (1) quantify the sources of this phenotypic  variation (genetic, maternal, paternal, and environmental) in egg size and  egg size plasticity within populations of S. limbatus; (2) test the  hypothesis that selection for improved survivorship when larvae develop on  seeds of Cercidium floridum (blue paloverde) results in the evolution of  larger egg size; (3) test the hypothesis that selection for increased  fecundity results in the evolution of smaller egg size; (4) test the  hypothesis that the evolution of egg size plasticity is constrained by the  genetic correlation between the size of eggs laid in response to Acacia  greggii (catclaw acacia) and the size of eggs laid on C. floridum; (5) test  the hypothesis that the genetic correlation across hosts evolves in response  to selection on egg size and egg size plasticity.    Maternal effe cts are ubiquitous in nature; they are important in generating  many of the phenotypic patterns and population dynamics that we observe, and  are often important components of population responses to natural selection.  In fact, evolutionary responses to selection may be manifest through  maternal effects, such that maternal effects may provide mechanisms for  adapting to variable environments. However, the evolutionary dynamics of  maternal effects, and characters influenced by maternal effects, have been  little explored.  In lab and field experiments, selection can be  demonstrated to favor or oppose the evolution of maternal effects.  However,  demonstrating selection favoring the evolution of a maternal effect is not  sufficient evidence to demonstrate that a maternal effect has evolved as an  adaptation. The same rigorous techniques applied to studies of behavior,  morphology, and life history need now be applied to the study of maternal  effects to determine how pervasive adaptive maternal effects are in nature  and how often maternal effects evolve simply as consequences of the  evolution of parental and offspring characters.  The objectives of these  experiments are (a) to study the evolutionary genetics of an adaptive  maternal effect (egg size plasticity in the seed beetle, Stator limbatus),  using rigorous quantitative genetic experimental designs, and (b) to  simulate natural selection on the maternal effect as it is thought to occur  in nature to study the evolution of both the maternal effect and correlated  life history characters.",
