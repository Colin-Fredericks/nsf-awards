 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 98-08156  DONG      The goals of this research are 1) to study the molecular basis  of  interactions between the German cockroach sodium channel (the  protein molecule that forms pores in cell membranes which  selectively allow sodium ions to enter and leave the cell) and  pyrethroid insecticides, and 2) to examine the functional  properties and developmental and tissue-specific expression (that  is, which tissues have these) of alternatively spliced isoforms of  the German cockroach para gene (alternatively spliced isoforms are  different versions of a protein, just the way a car manufacturer  may have different models within a particular line of cars).  Pyrethroid insecticides affect the properties of voltage-dependent  sodium channels in the nervous system (that is the sodium channels  that are responsible for sustaining the nerve impulses through  which nerve cells communicate).  A class of so-called kdr  (knockdown resistance) mutations has been identified in several  insects.  kdr insects are resistant to knockdown (rapid paralysis)  and kill by pyrethroids and some sodium-channel site-2  neurotoxins. Recently para genes from kdr and genetically related  pyrethroid-susceptible German cockroach strains have been cloned  and sequenced (that is, their genetic code has been deciphered).  Sequence comparison reveals specific amino acid differences  between the Para proteins from kdr and those from susceptible  cockroach strains.  The first objective of this research is to  compare the sensitivities of wild-type (susceptible) and mutant  Para sodium channels to pyrethroids and site-2 neurotoxins to  confirm that the putative kdr mutations are indeed responsible for  cockroach knockdown resistance to pyrethroids. \"Alternative  splicing\" (in which certain parts of a molecule can be selected  from various options, much as parts of a car such as the engine or  the radio might be taken from a set of possible options) is a  common feature of sodium channel genes of both vertebrates and  invertebra tes.   The functional significance of alternatively  spliced variants, however, remains largely unknown.  Seven  alternatively spliced portions of the cockroach para gene have  been identified, three of which are unique among insects.  The  second objective of this research is to examine the functional  properties of unique para splice variants and to analyze their  developmental and tissue-specific expression patterns.  Results from this project will enable us to understand why insects  become resistant to insecticides as well as the biological  significance of alternatively spliced Para channel variants in  governing sodium channel properties.",
