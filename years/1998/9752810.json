 "awd_abstract_narration": "Teaching Teachers to Teach Engineering (T4E) is a one-week short course  offered during the summer at the United States Military Academy, West  Point. The goal of the T4E program is to raise the standard of teaching  excellence in undergraduate engineering programs nationwide by increasing  the number of engineering faculty who have studied and practiced sound,  proven teaching methods. The principal objectives of the short course are  ( 1) to provide a diverse group of 24 relatively inexperienced engineering  educators with an opportunity to make substantive improvements in both the  effectiveness and efficiency of their teaching, and (2) to provide six  additional senior faculty members or administrators to observe the course,  for the purpose of establishing similar programs at their own institutions.  The course strives to meet the needs of faculty from two-year and four-year  teaching and research institutions and to achieve appropriate representation  from groups that are typically underrepresented on engineering faculties--  women, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Native Americans, and  individuals with disabilities.    In a series of workshops, the short course addresses topics in organization and presentation of classes, establishing objectives, student learning styles, instructional technology, student-teacher relations, promotion and tenure, and success in academia. Working in small groups, participants will prepare and present practice classes and will be critiqued on their performance by the T4E faculty and their fellow participants. Through this experience, participants will build confidence and poise; they will significantly improve their ability to prepare classes efficiently; and they will develop the self-assessment skills necessary for continued long-term improvement after the short course. This highly focused, week-long immersion experience will provide a foundation on which participants ca build their own individual teaching styles, consistent with their own personalit ies and teaching environments. Following the workshop, participants are expected to interact with faculty at their own institutions to promote the cause of teaching excellence.    Teaching Teachers to Teach Engineering is expected to have an immediate, substantive impact on the teaching skills of participants because of its practical, student-centered approach and its emphasis on actual \"get-up-anddo-it\" teaching.  *",
