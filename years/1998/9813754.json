 "awd_abstract_narration": "U.S. scientists will interact with the International Council of Scientific Unions' (ICSU) four unions concerned with geosciencies -- the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG), the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS),  the International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA), and the International Union of Soil Science (ISSS).    These Unions consider all aspects of the earth system, including its interior, lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere, as well as solarterrestrial relations and analogous aspects of Earth's relationship with the Moon and other planets, and applied studies of the earth, inlcuding its mineral resources, natural hazards, and the environment.  U.S. National Committees (USNC's) at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) will:  lead U.S. preparations for meetings of the International Unions and for scientific conferences, symposia, and workshops organized by these Unions to identify research topics, issues, and programs of interest to their specific disciplines; identify and support U.S. scientists to participate in union activities; and arrange for payment of U.S. dues to the four unions.  The USNC's will also seek to improve exchange of information between the international geosciences unions and U.S. scientific community; identification of interdisciplinary scientific problems, both within the geosciences and involving the geosciences and other fields of science; and geosciences needs for a global observing system.  These Committees are expected to meet generally twice each year.\r\n",
