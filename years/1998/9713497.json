The  project objectives include fabrication of a set of networks  of varying dimensions and magnetic materials, quantitative  assessment of network microstructure and topology,  determination of the physical origin of the unusual magnetic  properties, and evaluation of the potential of network  materials as magnetic recording media.  Networks are  fabricated using simple sputter deposition onto the surface  of nanostructured substrates (nanochannel alumina), e-beam  lithography, and naturally phase separating systems.  Quantitative microstructural and topological  characterization are carried out in both the as-deposited  and annealed states using a combination of scanning electron  microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission  electron microscopy.  The nanostructural characteristics  (crystallite size, crystallographic texture, etc.) of the  networks are documented by transmission electron microscopy  and selected area electron diffraction.  Magnetic  characterization and correlation of magnetic properties with  network geometry and dimensions are at the core of this  proposal.  A multitechnique approach including temperature  dependent measurements, annealing studies, magnetic imaging,  and ferromagnetic resonance are used to develop an  understanding of network magnetic domain structures,  reversal mechanisms, and stability.  The unique topology of  the networks proposed here allows for detailed study of the  effects of transitioning from traditional continuous film  media (nanoscale in one dimension, the thickness) to media  comprised of discrete pillars, bars, and dots (nanoscale in  two or three dimensions).  This research project is  particularly strong in the areas of educational and human  resources development.  The program is multidisciplinary and  has strong fundamental and technological components.  Both  the graduate stude nt and post-doc budgeted for the project  employ aspects of solid state physics, metallurgy, thin film  science, magnetic characterization, materials processing,  microstructural characterization, and materials selection.  %%%  Nanostructured networks are a unique geometry which exhibit  unusual and potentially useful magnetic behavior associated  with their the small dimensions and novel topology.  A  nanostructured network is a contiguous topology which may be  pictured as a thin film with a high density of holes or  pores.  When the pore size, mean pore separation, and  network thickness approach nanoscale dimensions, strong  confinement effects on magnetic properties (such as  increases in coercivity of more than two orders of magnitude  over continuous films of equivalent thickness) are observed.  Networks are unique in that their dimensionality can be  continuously controlled at the nanometer scale by varying  the thickness, pore size, and porosity.  The properties of  magnetic networks are only beginning to be explored.",
