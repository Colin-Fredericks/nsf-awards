 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is producing a set of bioinformatics and genetics teaching materials suitable for advanced undergraduates in the life sciences and in information sciences. Distribution platforms for course materials include interactive World Wide Web pages capable of collecting user data.  Collected data and experience with courses serve as tools to recursively improve the materials until suitable for commercial distribution either through electronic interactive distance learning courses or as combined text/computer exercise materials.  The materials produced for the bioinformatics course component of this project are based upon materials developed for a course (Bioinformatics) at the University of Kentucky (http://www/uky.edu/Classes/BIO520/).  A text and accompanying online materials are being generated for this course. The other component of the project is development of appropriate modules from genomic and bioinformatic analyses for a junior level general genetics course (http://www.uky.edu/Classes/BIO404G/syllabus97.html).   The genetics material explores WHY as well as HOW to sequence a given segment of DNA.",
