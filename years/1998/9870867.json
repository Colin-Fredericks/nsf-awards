 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870867\r\nKnecht\r\nThe objective of this project is to plan, organize, and support a four-day international conference on ocean utilization during June or July 1999 in The Hague, Netherlands.  While the conference will be the sixth in the series of international conferences with a coastal ocean space utilization orientation that began in 1989, this meeting will be more sharply focused on specific themes and will be structured to encourage better linkage between topics, greater intellectual content, and more interdisciplinary discussion and analysis.  Working with the U.S. sponsors, several committees, and the host country (The Netherlands), the Principal Investigator will (1) develop an overall plan for the conference (including major themes, the program format, etc.); (2) work with the host country on conference logistics and related matters; (3) work with the U.S. sponsors to identify additional \"outside\" sponsors for the conference; (4) formulate a draft technical program; (5) invite speakers; (6) prepare first and second announcements of the conference; (7) assemble a compendium of extended abstracts of papers to be presented, as a part of the final program; (8) participate in and help oversee the conference itself; and (9) after the conference, make recommendations to the U.S. sponsors regarding any additional publications that might be appropriate given the results of the conference.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
