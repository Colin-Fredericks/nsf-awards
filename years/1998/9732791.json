 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research program consists of six thrusts: (1) Based on the theory of multiphase composite materials, a strain-softening constitutive model for the tangential stiffness tensor of an elastic material with families of random microcracks of different orientations is developed. (2) By considering the crack growth rate to be a function of the stress intensity factor, the model is then generalized to rate dependence and viscoelasticity (creep) in the matrix.  (3) The model is further extended for plastic yielding at the fronts of microcracks.  (4) A computational algorithm borrowing same advantageous features of the microplane model is formulated, and nonlocal characteristics with a material length are incorporated to capture fracture behavior and size effect.  Also (5) an alternative model based on the microplane model enhanced by a softening law based on application of composite material theory to the growth of random crack families is developed and compared to the first outlined basic model, Finally (6) the model is verified and calibrated by least-square fitting of extensive test data from uniaxial, biaxial and triaxial tests, fracture tests and size effect tests, and is implemented in a dynamic finite element program.  The model will also allow easy generalization to isotropic and anisotropic rocks.",
