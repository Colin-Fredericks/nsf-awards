 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is the first to look at factors determining male reproductive success in the Awash National Park (ANP) baboon hybrid zone.  The project integrates genetic and behavioral studies of a single group that has mixed ancestry from two types of baboons, anubis and hamadryas.  Hamadryas males herd females into one male units which they continuously maintain, whereas anubis males compete for and guard only estrous females.  Hybrid males exhibit intermediate behavior.  The short term reproductive success of different male reproductive strategies will be compared by examining the relationship of reproductive behavior and number of offspring sired.  Molecular genetic markers found in the nuclear genome will be used to assess genetic hybridity and for parental analysis.  Mitochondrial DNA sequence data will be collected for comparison with the nuclear markers.  Differential success of male reproductive strategies affects the dynamics of the hybrid zone, particularly since male migration appears to mediate gene flow.  In addition to male reproductive strategies and success, the project will also evaluate the effects of female ancestry and social structure on the success of one male units.  The knowledge gained by this study will elucidate the evolutionary forces acting in the ANP hybrid zone and, consequently, contribute to an understanding of the importance of social factors in the origin and maintenance of hybrid zones.",
