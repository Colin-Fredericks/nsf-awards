The research looks at very general games, as well as concrete situations such as games of common interest (e.g., partners in a firm) and financial markets. The common thread underlying all of our models is the subjective approach. Namely, agents' are endowed with a belief over the evolution of the economy which may not coincide with the truth.     In the first part we focus on a single, fully rational, agent. We study necessary and sufficient conditions for agents to learn, and the rate at which they learn. In the second part we extend the one agent model to a repeated game set-up. We study necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence to equilibrium (Nash equilibrium and its refinements.) We also show how fast equilibrium is obtained.     Another research direction, using this subjective framework, is the consequences of plausible restrictions on players' beliefs. Preliminary results suggest that in repeated coordination games, the unique efficient allocation is obtained if agents believe (possibly incorrectly) that they can influence their opponents behavior in a particular way (which we will refer to as ``positive influence.'')     The third part applies the techniques developed in the previous parts to financial markets. The novelty is that we do not impose any conditions on agents' beliefs. We show that the compatibility conditions exogenously imposed in the game theoretic set-up must be satisfied in financial markets, otherwise an arbitrage opportunity exists. From this we can conclude that if agents are subjectively optimizing and if markets clear then convergence to a rational expectations equilibrium (i.e., an ``objective'' equilibrium where agents' beliefs are correct) will eventually be obtained.     We also study the relation between forecast accuracy and wealth accumulation. In the literature it is shown that if savings ar e exogenous then agents making accurate forecasts may accumulate less wealth than agents with systematically incorrect beliefs. We show that, once savings are determined endogenously, agents who make inaccurate predictions are driven out of the market.     The last part departs from the fully rational approach. We study models of learning, which we refer to as semi-rational. The motivation for this part is to close the gap in the literature between rational learning and adaptive learning. We relax extreme assumptions implied by full rationality on the one hand and myopic ad-hoc models on the other hand.    ***",
