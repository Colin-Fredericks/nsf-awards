 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726027  Kohout    A systematic accounting of incomplete or conflicting information, constraints, and consequences has not been adequately addressed in the propulsion industry during engineering design and planning.  This impacts any affordable aeronautics propulsion system incorporating new technology or product development, the analysis of cost, and realistic and reliable cost /benefit analyses in the design phase, which for advanced jet propulsion systems involve determining the affordability of a design that has never before been manufactured, and making technical/business decisions based on incomplete, uncertain data.  In the case of incomplete information, commonly used parametric techniques provide limited assessment capabilities.  The use of probabilistic evaluations has improved the handling of certain types of uncertainty and has been applied recently in the aeronautics industry for the handling of likelihood.  However, its use is limited to cases where an adequate historical base exists upon which to base probabilistic studies A new methodology is needed to provide an effective assessment of advanced technology, as well as the uncertainty, i.e., confidence, in the solution, to enable the identification and prioritization of high payoff and high risk research and product development areas.  The link between advanced concepts and accrued benefit to the aeronautics propulsion industry is forged by the capability to perform realistic and appropriate cost/benefits assessments, at the component level, and up through the system level.  This new approach to supplement the parametric and probabilistic tools has focused on the application of fuzzy logic theory to the decision-making process.  The use of fuzzy attributes for cost models and affordability applications addresses the problem of the limited (or unavailable) data in the situation of materials with limited characterization data, processes with limited empirical data, and manufacturing processes with little or no manufacturing base.  T he use of verbal descriptors parallels the knowledge-gathering exercise and will provide the ability to assign different levels of accuracy, precision, or certainty to each element, such as cost, material input, or processing condition.",
