Because  of their low dimensionalities, clusters provide  insight  into  surface  effects, quantum size effects, thermal  relaxation  processes, and the molecular origins of structural and electronic  phase  transitions.  In this program, clusters  are  prepared  in  laser-based  sources and studied with molecular beam  techniques.  Magnetic  structure  is  probed  using  the  Stern-Gerlach   beam  deflection   method   and   effects  such   as   surface-enhanced  magnetization, surface and shape induced magnetic anisotropy, and  spin-canting  in local moment systems are studied.  This  program  also  searches  for additional magnetically ordered  clusters  of  normally  non-magnetic  elements and alloys.  Cluster  electronic  structure is studied by anion photodetachment spectroscopy.  This  work  looks  at the effects of cluster size, composition,  shape,  and  temperature  on (1) the modes of electron  accommodation  in  these  systems, (2) their structural and electronic  phases,  and  (3) their electronically excited states.  %%%  This  research  program  examines  the  magnetic  and  electronic  properties of material particles only slightly larger than  atoms  themselves,  as a way to bridge the gap in understanding  between  solids  and  molecules.  As electronic  components  and  magnetic  memory systems become smaller, they reach sizes at which they can  no  longer be treated simply as small versions of larger objects.  Instead,  these tiny devices must be viewed in part as  elaborate  molecular  systems,  with the complexities of quantum  mechanics,  thermal  fluctuations,  and  surface  structure  altering   their  behavior.  By  studying  magnetism in  clusters  of  atoms,  this  research  program  is learning how magnetism in  solids  develops  from molecular st ructure and is mapping out possibilities for the  ultimate  generation of magnetic storage media. In  its  work  on  electronic  and  spatial structure in clusters, this  program  is  exploring  the  world of insulators and metals  near  the  atomic  scale  and is examining their behaviors when they become so small  that nearly all their atoms are on their surfaces.  ***",
