 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal supports four students (two by NSF and two by  industrial sponsors) to integrate graduate research with  practical contributions to industrial problems.  The main  industrial partner is Nortel, but our colleagues in the  Semiconductor Research Corporation, Texas Instruments, and the  Center for Advanced Electronic Materials Processing at North  Carolina State University will also provide expertise and  laboratory access.  Thus, this program will build a bridge  between statistics and engineering, both on and off campus, for  conducting interdisciplinary research.  The students will gain  experience in formulating research problems, in identifying  statistical and engineering contributions, in exploring potential  basic statistical research areas, and in presenting (oral and  written) to scientists from different disciplines.  In this  proposal, the following new research will benefit both industrial  applications and academic basic research: (1) a flexible modeling  and estimation method for analyzing temporally or spatially  correlated non-normal discrete or continuous data, (2) a robust  estimation method in bilateral time series model, and (3) a  robust estimation procedure in nonlinear random coefficient model  for temporally correlated repeated measurements.  The properties  of the proposed statistical procedures will be evaluated through  finite sample simulation and asymptotic theory applied to  real-life examples from Nortel.  The experience from this program  will serve as a model to restructure our relationships with  companies at Research Triangle Park and Raleigh.    The students will spend 10 to 20 hours per week conducting  research at industrial sites, engineering laboratories and the  statistics department.  The trainees and their mentors will  present their work at appropriate conferences and publish  research relevant to projects in statistical and engineering  journals.      This GOALI project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activitie s (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
