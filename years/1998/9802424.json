Research on protein phosphatases is proceeding at a rapid  pace, revealing the fundamental importance and unexpected  complexity of these enzymes in the signal transduction pathways  that govern the fundamental aspects of cell physiology.  Within  the past two years, dozens of new phosphatases and phosphatase  regulatory subunits have been identified.  A major focus of the  current research is to understand the functions of this diverse  array of phosphatases and the multiplicity of ways they are  involved in signaling.  This conference will serve as a forum for  dissemination of the most recent information on the structure,  function and  regulation of this important class of regulatory molecules.  This  meeting will select participants from applicants including  scientists from industry as well as academia.  Participants will include senior scientists, postdoctoral fellows  and graduate students.  Some of the speakers will be selected from  investigators who have recently made important contributions and  from submitted abstracts.  Poster sessions are also included.  This meeting is valuable to scientists working in this field.  ***",
