 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870880  Pace     Hyperthermophilic organisms (growth optima > 80 C), at the upper temperature extremes for life, are a significantly underexplored pool of biota with substantial potential for biotechnology.  Little is known about the diversity of life at high temperatures because most studies have relied on pure-culture techniques for the identification of organisms, but only a minor fraction, < 1%, of naturally occurring microorganisms, is cultured using standard techniques.  Recently, however, molecular techniques, based on cloning and sequencing ribosomal RNA genes and not requiring culture for the identification of organisms in nature, have revealed an unexpected wealth of previously unknown, high-temperature microbes.  The overall goals of this program are to use these methods to further describe and to understand the organismal composition, structure and physiological basis of selected high-temperature ecosystems, and to use molecular tracers to cultivate particular types of organisms for further study.  Where cultivation is successful, growth-properties of specific organisms will test physiological hypotheses based on sequence and in situ information.  Numerous environmentally significant organisms that can be enriched for continued model studies in consortia or pure cultures are likely to be identified.  High-temperature environments to be addressed include selected, chemically diverse, Yellowstone and deep-sea hydrothermal vent-associated settings.",
