 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731701  Wu    The  proposed research is aimed at understanding fluid  flow  and  instabilities in freely suspended liquid films that behave like a  two-dimensional  (2D) fluid. Historically, 2D  hydrodynamics  has  been  a  subject of extensive theoretical investigation. However,  controlled laboratory experiments have been rare. This project is  an  effort  to narrow this gap. The research will probe different  aspects  of 2D flows, ranging from studies of individual vortices  to  an array of vortices that are strongly interacting. Universal  decay  laws  of  freely evolving turbulence as  well  as  inverse  energy  cascades  in force turbulence will be  investigated.  The  experiments  will  be carried out using laser  light  scattering,  laser  Doppler velocimetry, and real-space imaging. To complement  the  hydrodynamic  studies, new efforts  will  also  be  made  to  characterize  physical properties of the freely suspended  films.  This  includes the study of the film viscosity, its  relationship  to  the  structure of the films, and the dynamic coupling between  film  thickness and the flow field. The project involves training  of  graduate  and undergraduate students in novel  projects  with  state-of-the-art  research facilities. The project  director  has  also  been  active in outreach activities such a  development  of  large scale soap film demonstrations for science museums.  %%%  A freely suspended liquid film has many unique and fascinating  properties. With the film thickness being only 1/10,000 of its  other dimensions, the film behaves like a two-dimensional (2D0  fluid. For example, if a flow is created in the film, the  velocity is confined to the film plane with negligible velocity  variations perpendicular to it. The proposed research is aimed at  understanding fluid flow and turbulence in 2D. Historically, 2D  hydrodynamics has been dominated by theory and computer  simulations. However, the subject is relevant to many naturally  occurring phenomena such as ocean and  atmospheric turbulence,  formation of cyclones and anticyclones. This project involves the  development of novel techniques that allow preparation of robust  films and which allow turbulence in them to be monitored via  state-of-the art laser light scattering and video imaging. These  methods will reveal interactions between vortices and the  emergence of large coherent eddies in the sea of background  turbulence. Results from this research will be beneficial to  theoretical modeling of turbulence and in furthering  understanding of strongly non-linear dynamic systems. The project  involves training of graduate and undergraduate students in novel  projects with state-of-the-art research facilities. The project  director has also been active in outreach activities such a  development of large scale soap film demonstrations for science  museums.  ***",
