This  theme applies to both the research and the educational  components of the plan.  Concrete and portland cement-based  materials are the focus here, but many of the concepts and  techniques developed will be applicable to wood, rock,  composites, and other materials with a heterogeneous  microstructure.              The objective of the research is to quantify specific  microstructural damage and failure mechanisms in cement-  based materials through advanced experimentation and data  analysis.  In order for there to be significant advances in  our ability to model and predict failure mechanisms, we must  have a quantitative understanding of the physical  microstructural processes involved.  The research addresses  this need for quantitative microstructural property versus  performance data.              The overall objective of the educational work is to  update experimental mechanics and data analysis treatment in  the undergraduate and graduate civil engineering curriculum,  and to highlight the role of mechanics and materials in the  different civil engineering subdisciplines.  This objective  will be realized through the integration of new classroom  and laboratory modules into existing undergraduate and  graduate courses.  The cornerstone of the education program  will be an innovative freshman level construction materials  course in which the common themes of problem analysis and  design are introduced to new engineering students using  materials as the vehicle.  The laboratory component of this  course will be designed to reveal relationships between the  material's microstructure and performance properties.              The link between the research and education components  is the innovative use of the laboratory.  The ease of  numerical simulations has in varying degrees altered the use  of  experimental analysis in both education and research.  The goal of this workplan is therefore to emphasize the  importance to mechanics and materials of working in \"real\"  rather than \"virtual\"  laboratories.              As this work is multidisciplinary, collaborations with  experts in digital image processing, cement microstructure  and x-ray physics and planned.  ***",
