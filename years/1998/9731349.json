 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731349  Vasudevan    This research applies high resolution transmission electron  microscopy in a study of the massive transformation in TiAl-  based intermetallic alloys.  Two important issues are  addressed related to the mechanisms of massive  transformations in TiAl alloys: (1) the nature of the  massive -parent interphase interfacial structure, and (2)  the role of defect structures.  The study focuses on alloys  with aluminum contents between 46-47 at. %, which allows  retention of large areas of the massive-parent interfaces.  Orientation relationships that develop during nucleation and  the early stages of growth of the massive phase are studied  in samples whose reaction kinetics has been determined.  The  structures of the parent -massive phases and the types of  interfaces that between them are determined in samples  undergoing different undercoolings, reaction start  temperatures, and growth rates.  The state of coherency of  the interfaces is determined and from these studies  atomistic models of the structures of the massive-parent  interphase interfaces are developed.  The atomic structures  of defects (dislocations and stacking faults) are determined  as well, and their role in the growth of the massive product  assessed.  %%%  New alloys based on the TiAl compound are of great  importance for application in high temperature propulsion  systems because of their unique combination of properties.  Mechanical properties of these materials are controlled by  their microstructures, which is the focus of this research.  ***",
