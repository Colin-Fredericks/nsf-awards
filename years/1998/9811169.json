 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project contributes to understanding the ways in which cosmopolitan science interacts with local historical forms in the production of a new biomedical subjectivity. It traces the establishment of a network by a French genomics company for the collection, banking and analysis of DNA samples from mental patients in Argentine public hospitals.  The network is part of a joint venture with a major pharmaceutical company to map the susceptibility genes for schizophrenia, a disorder of unknown etiology and pathophysiology.  The goal of this project is to document the process whereby new forms of categorizing personhood emerge.  Three questions frame the research: How does contemporary genetic psychiatry relate to prior attempts to explain behavior in hereditary terms?  What challenges will be faced in the process of finding a pedigree of schizophrenic families?  What institutional links and technological innovations enable the venture to be carried forward?  During ten months of ethnographic research in Buenos Aires among psychiatrists, genetic scientists, health officials and legal authorities the investigator will analyze the local implications of this alliance between psychiatric science and multinational capital.  The method to be employed will be an interpretive analysis based on historical research, interviews, and participant-observation.",
