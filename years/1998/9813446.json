 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NorthWest Center for Emerging Technologies (NWCET) continues its work to be the leader in determining the needs of information technology (IT) employers and students.  Partnerships with leadership organizations representing corporations, professional societies, and educational institutions provide direction development and implementation of IT skill standards, IT curricula, instructional materials, and professional development of faculty.  The Center is establishing articulation agreements with four year colleges and with high schools and Tech Prep consortia to ensure seamless transitions for students.  The four major goals of the Center are to advance model partnerships linking business, education and government to promote IT education, to provide student pathways to new IT programs and new Advanced Technology degrees, to develop, test and disseminate IT curricula, curriculum products and teaching and learning resources, and to contribute to national leadership through dissemination of \"best practices\" in IT education.  The Center has established working relationships with the Gartner Group, Harcourt Brace, and Educational Development Center to disseminate materials and professional development workshops.  The American Electronics Association is validating the Skill Standards.",
