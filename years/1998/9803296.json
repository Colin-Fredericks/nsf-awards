 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research under this award is devoted to the study of solutions of nonlinear\r\npartial differential equations which model the propagation of waves such as \r\nlight waves and sound waves.  These phenomena do not have viscous effects \r\nwhich means that the differential equations are of hyperbolic type.  The mathematical\r\nanalysis provides new rigorous error estimates for exact solutions and \r\napproximate solutions that are valid in the limit of short wavelengths.  Particular \r\nemphasis is placed on problems of nonlinear optics.  Four main problem areas are \r\naddressed.  The first is the investigation of qualitative properties of three nonlinear\r\nmodels.  The basic question is whether these models predict singularity formation or not.\r\nIn the second area, reliable approximate solutions for nonlinear optics problems\r\nwill be constructed that are valid for larger amplitudes than previously possible.\r\nTo do so requires hypotheses for the nonlinear interaction terms which are verified\r\nin many practical models.  The third problem is to investigate the effects of strong\r\nnonlinearity at focal points.  The fourth problem area is to construct approximate \r\nsolutions with error estimates for equations that describe ultra short laser propagation.\r\n\r\nThe research that is supported by this award focuses on mathematical models for wave \r\npropagation phenomena, specifically on high frequency phenomena such as light waves and\r\nacoustic waves.  The results from this research can be used to validate current models \r\nfor such phenomena, predict new effects, and help in the design of new equipment.  \r\nMuch of this work is motivated by problems for ultra intense lasers and optical \r\nparametric oscillators where difficulties with modeling and design have been encountered.\r\nThe mathematical investigations will allow to predict situations in which optical devices\r\nbecome unstable or are damaged.\r\n\r\n",
