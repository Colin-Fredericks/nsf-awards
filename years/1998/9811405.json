 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation project will analyze changes in the Pacific Northwest salmon industry and the social conflicts and environmental risks associated with the rise of intensive commercial salmon aquaculture.  In scarcely two decades, the salmon industry has shifted from a regional enterprise based upon capture of wild Pacific salmon to a global industry shaped by aquacultural production of Atlantic salmon.  Aquaculture's ability to manipulate biophysical variables to propagate and grow salmon has produced high-value products with year-round availability and consistent commodity characteristics.  At the same time, intensive aquaculture has encountered objections from wild salmon producers and other coastal resource users.  The potential deployment of genetically engineering fish in salmon farming raises new questions about effects on ecosystems, human communities, and the public interest.  Using interviews, historical materials, industry data and documents, legal research, and examination of biological science materials, the researcher will investigate differences between the wild and farmed salmon sectors, trends in aquacultural biotechnologies, and risks associated with potential deployment of genetically engineered fish.",
