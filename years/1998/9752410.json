 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Research Council advocates active science learning, stating that \"Learning science is something students do, not something that is done to them.... Emphasizing active science learning means shifting emphasis away from teachers presenting information....\" The goal of this proposal is to publish a guidebook and video for teachers who wish to implement innovative  teaching methods to make science learning an active process in introductory geoscience, Earth systems, and geology courses.    The teacher's guide and video will be based on the method of peer learning developed for introductory physics by Dr. Eric Mazur at Harvard (Mazur, 1997). In essence, the teacher presents a small amount of information, then poses a challenging conceptual question for the students to answer. Students try to convince their peers that their own answers are correct, hence the phrase peer learning. In the process, students construct explanations and communicate their ideas to others, making the classroom science experience an active one, yet providing a sense of routine and structure that is meaningful and fun for students.    Teachers will be able to draw upon the extensive collection of class-tested, ready-to-use peer learning materials compiled in the teacher's guide. The video, produced with AudioVisual Instructional Services at Franklin and Marshall College, will consist of visual examples of how one can enact this peer learning approach. Because many of the concepts taught in the geosciences are so visually accessible, peer learning will is combined with in-class demonstrations. These demonstrations also will be shown in the video.",
