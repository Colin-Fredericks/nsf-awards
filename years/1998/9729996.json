 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729996  Brzezinski    In this project, researcher will test the utility of an  entirely new tracer for chemical oceanography.  Analytical  tools for measuring silicon isotope natural abundance in  biogenic silica from diatoms and dissolved silicic acid from  seawater have been developed and have been used to  demonstrate for the first time silicon isotope fractionation  by marine diatoms during opal biomineralization.  The extent  of fractionation is constant among species, and does not  vary measurably with temperature, suggesting a single  fractionation factor can be used to describe variations in  silicon isotopic ratios due to diatom growth in the sea.         We propose to obtain data sets I) to assess rigorously  the role of biological fractionation in controlling the  distribution of silicon isotopes in the sea and ii) to  evaluate silicon isotope natural abundance as a measure of  silica production in the surface ocean. The first goal will  achieved by analyzing samples of dissolved and particulate  silica gathered from a number of ocean basins.  Additional  samples will be obtained to define the isotopic signature of  the Si entering the sea through deep-sea hydrothermal vents  and rivers.  The resulting data will be combined with  numerical modeling to test the hypothesis that the interplay  among biological fractionation, the biological pump and  global thermohaline circulation governs the distribution of  Si isotopes in the sea.  The response of the isotopic  composition of dissolved and particulate silica production  in the surface water will be examined by comparing time  series of silica exported to depth.  The samples from  surface waters and sediment traps for the proposed  comparisons have been, or will be, collected through  existing research efforts allowing us to propose an  extensive study at low cost.  Success will provide a  powerful new tool for examining diatom activity in the  modern ocean and the ability to use variations in Si  isotopes in sediment cores to examine  changes in silica  production on geologic time scales.",
