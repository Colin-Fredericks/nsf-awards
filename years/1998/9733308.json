 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research component of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program  Award is addressing the problem of real-time correction of image degradation in  infrared and laser imaging systems used in satellite imaging, aerial surveillance  and reconnaissance, astronomical imaging, and target recognition.  The types of  degradation considered are due to the non-ideal characteristics of array sensors  and atmospheric turbulence.  The most limiting degradation in the performance of  array sensors arises from the spatial and temporal nonuniformities in the  sensors' responses.  This research employs a statistical real-time-correction  approach that avoids the need for costly calibration-based correction techniques  that require the camera to steer away from the target for the duration of the  calibration.  The model-based statistical approach undertaken for nonuniformity  correction is adapted to restore images degraded by atmospheric turbulence.  The  fundamental question of determining the optimal exposure time (or number of  frames) needed for a given system in the presence of quantum noise is also being  addressed.  The algorithms developed in this research will be implemented in real  systems through the investigator's collaborative efforts with the government and  industry.    The educational component of this research includes activities designed to  motivate and excite undergraduate engineering students and strengthen the  structure of the Dayton Area Graduate Studies Institute (DAGSI) Program that is  a vital component of the Dayton-Area higher education system.  These educational  activities include: (1) demonstrating the practical research findings to  undergraduate and graduate students by improving certain existing engineering  courses; (2) offering periodical seminars available to nine local higher-  education institutions and the DAGSI program through an interactive video  network; (3) enhancing the practical training of students through collaboration  with the local industry an d government laboratory; and, (4) actively involving  the research assistants in this research in undergraduate education.",
