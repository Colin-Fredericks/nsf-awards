 "awd_abstract_narration": "9806159  Foley  The focus of this POWRE proposal is to study a novel plant protein called Vein1 that has been shown to specifically bind nickel.  Low levels of many heavy metals are essential for plant growth while heavy metal toxicity is a pressing agricultural and environmental problem.  For example, excess nickel is a potent inhibitor of growth, development and various other metabolic processes in plants with the symptoms including retarded growth.  On the other hand nickel is also an essential micronutrient in plants and nickel deficiency can result in cell death at the tips of young leaves.  The mechanism by which nickel is metabolized and transported in the plant is poorly understood.  In addition to being able to bind nickel, Vein1 has interesting expression patterns.  Vein1 RNA is specifically expressed in the phloem but only in the aerial parts of the plant.  The phloem is part of the vascular system and plays a major role in transporting organic material and some mineral ions throughout the plant.  This proposal's aims are to generate polyclonal antibodies against Vein1 and use these antibodies to determine which phloem cell types express Vein1 and establish if Vein1 binds nickel within the plant.  These experiments will provide further insight into the function of this novel, phloem specific protein and it's role in nickel metabolism.  This project is well suited for a POWRE award because it will allow the PI to focus full time on a research project that will develop into an independent research program.",
