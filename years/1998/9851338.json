 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optical techniques and especially fiber optics are revolutionizing the telecommunications industry and are expected to make substantial advances in their application to process control and manufacturing, health monitoring of aerospace, military, and civil structures and medical science.  However, our graduating engineers are lacking in the concepts and application of optics and fiber optic technology. None of the present lab oriented courses such as Introduction to Manufacturing Mechanical Measurements, Thermo-fluid Science, Mechanical Vibrations and Mechanical Engineering Design I & II, touch on these important fields of study. Through this proposal, it is our endeavor to introduce such concepts in the class room and demonstrate their applications in the laboratories through a hands-on experience. It is further envisaged the students will use this knowledge in creating better and more innovative designs in their capstone design projects, which typically deal with product design, manufacturing, testing, sensing, and control.  With this proposal, we seek to procure the necessary equipment to help achieve the above mentioned goal of introducing optical techniques and fiber optic technology in a wide range of courses across the mechanical engineering curriculum.",
