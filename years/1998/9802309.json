 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator and her colleague Yulia Karpeshina will \r\ncollaborate to solve inverse problems for holographic image data using \r\nKolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory.  The goal is to use selected \r\nlevel sets of mode shapes of vibrating systems as data for the inverse \r\nproblem. With these level sets as data, formulas will be established.  The \r\nformulas will then be used to determine physical properties of the system, \r\nsuch as density or stiffness.  The results will be based on perturbation \r\nresults for the natural frequencies and the mode shapes.  The difficulty in \r\nestablishing these results arises from the fact that a small divisor problem \r\nand a sequence of Eikonal equations must be solved simultaneously.  A \r\nconsequence of the resultant mathematical structure will be that the \r\nperturbed quantities can be strongly different from the unperturbed \r\nquantities.  McLaughlin's graduate student will concentrate on developing \r\nformulas to use the data and on numerical implementation of those \r\nformulas.\r\n\r\nThe goal with this work is to consider membrane like materials, such as a \r\nthin slice of biological tissue.  Excite this membrane with an oscillating \r\nforce and suppose the frequency of oscillation is a natural frequency, that \r\nis, a frequency where the membrane gives a large response. Illuminating \r\nthe vibrating surface with two lasers we see a dark and light line pattern.  \r\nEach line is a level set of the vibrating surface.  Now assume that the \r\nmembrane is nonhomogeneous; it could be more stiff or less stiff in some \r\nplaces.  [In the biological example, increased stiffness can indicate the \r\npresence of rapidly dividing cells.  In a mechanical example, decreased \r\nstiffness can indicate deterioration of the material.] The goal is to \r\ndetermine the stiffness variations without altering the membrane, that is, to \r\nfind a nondestructive test for the stiffness variations.  Our data is the dark \r\nand light line pattern. The problem is difficult because the stiffness \r\nvariations can have (but not always) a very large perturbative effect on the \r\npattern.  The mathematics will establish when the perturbation is large, \r\nwhen it is not, and what formulas will yield the stiffness variations from \r\nthis particular data set.\r\n",
