 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes a workshop intended to enhance the knowledge of undergraduate faculty, in the area of computer software testing, with an emphasis on object-oriented software. The two-week program will be split across two summers with the first session held at Clemson University during the summer of 1998 and the second session to be held on the University of Alabama campus during the summer of 1999. This workshop will bring together 25 faculty members from across the United States who are interested in expanding the role of software testing in the undergraduate computer science courses. This workshop will provide an opportunity for the workshop participants to examine this issue in detail, working in cooperation with the workshop staff. Specifically, we will focus on:    1. A brief review of the fundamental concepts associated with object-oriented development,  2. an in-depth examination of the current \"state of the art\" with respect to testing software, including those aspects of object-oriented systems that require special attention, and  3. an examination of how this material can be integrated into the curriculum at each participant's own institution.  The workshop staff includes two faculty members from the University of Alabama and one from Clemson University selected for two reasons. First, all three are active in the area of testing object-oriented software. Second, this group brings a variety of perspectives to the workshop. Unlike workshops where one individual presents his/her viewpoint on a topic, this collaborative approach will ensure that a wide range of thoughts and opinions regarding testing are presented.",
