A large number of tools have been developed from this quest, in particular those arising from the Binary Black Holes collaboration.  However, in spite of the advancements in computer technology, numerical algorithms and understanding of Einstein's field equations, simulations of the last few orbits and the coalescence of black hole binary systems have not yet been achieved.  The primary objective of the group at Penn State will be to continue developing, and integrating into a complete solution to the collision and radiation problem, the missing components of this Black Hole Collision Puzzle, in close collaboration with the groups at Pittsburgh, Texas and Potsdam.  The effort at Penn State will mainly focus on two closely related areas:  i) apparent horizon boundary conditions and ii) gauge or coordinate conditions applied to 3+1 evolutions of spacetimes containing moving black holes.  Moving black hole, 3+1 evolutions have so far been performed taking advantage of isometry conditions, for the case of head-on collisions, or analytic lapse and shift conditions, for boosted single black holes systems.  A complete apparent horizon boundary condition to excise moving black hole singularities has not yet been fully implemented.  Similarly, up to this point, few studies have completely addressed the issue of constructing gauge conditions for 3D evolutions which control unbound unphysical growth of field variables, also known as grid stretching.  To investigate these two fundamental aspects of black hole evolutions, the following three problems will be considered:  i) boosted single black holes, ii) scattering of black holes and iii) single orbit and merger of binary systems.  These problems build upon complexity (moving single apparent horizon, gravitational radiation, multiple apparent horizons, corotating meshes, etc.); thus, they provide a natural step-by-step path to single out and solve specific aspects of black hole evolutions, directly relevant to the ultimate goal of generic inspiral black hole coalescences.\r\n\r\nSuccessful solutions to these problems will represent progress beyond that exclusively in the computational front.  Scattering of black holes and simulations of an orbit or coalescence of binary systems will yield valuable information regarding gravitational radiation and the nature of interacting singularities.  Furthermore, the relevance of this effort extends to more than its fundamental implications in connection with black hole collision simulations; equally important will be the continuity of previous studies and collaborative models, as well as the use of infrastructure developed by the Binary Black Holes Alliance.  Collaborations, in particular, will play a crucial role since work on important areas such as outer boundary conditions, initial data and parallelization will not be directly considered by the present effort.\r\n***\r\n",
