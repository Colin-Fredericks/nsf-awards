 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733502  Ram  Where do electrons go ? They emerge from the source and dive toward the drain.  Their path between drain and source is inferred from a detailed knowledge of the conductive terrain.  Manipulating the electron's path has been the goal of electrical engineering for over 100 years.  At the present time there is no practical technique for tracking the electron's journey through small circuits or devices.  This career plan is to develop a noninvasive current probe that is capable of monitoring the current distribution in electronic devices and circuits.    Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) can provide highly resolved images of the current path inside mesoscopic devices.  MFM's ability to sense magnetic field gradients over distances as small as 10 manometers can be used to sense the stray field surrounding a moving electron.  The potential for spatially resolving currents inside devices has not previously been available because of the limited (0.3 to 10 Jim) resolution of other field contrast microscopies.  Direct measurements of magnetic fields associated with interconnect lines and their associated inductances may provide insight into new circuit topologies.  An unprecedented look at the internal structure of the electron flow will enable the observation of theoretically predicted structures such as current vortices and electron shock waves.  Detailed images of current distributions would reveal such structures whereas previous external measurements of source and drain currents.could only infer their existence.    Seeing an electron's path involves representing the @ data in a visually engaging and meaningful way.  The graphical representation of such intangible, yet physical quantities brings together physics and aesthetics.  This interface can be a fruitful arena for the education of young scientists.  Building on the principal investigator's previous experience working together with art and science students on effective scientific visualization, this proposal develops a curriculum for  elementary school and college students.  ***",
