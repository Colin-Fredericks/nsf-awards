Disorder  in  this  context  includes  disorder   of   sequences  (when  several  monomer  species   are  polymerized together, with the sequence of monomers bearing  some  useful   information),  disorder  of  branches,  and  topological  disorder  that is related to knots, links, and entanglements.  In  experiment,   it  is  intended to explore the  phases  and  phase  transitions of various disordered polymers as controlled by  both  parameters such as temperature, choice of solvent, etc, and  also  by  the  preparation  conditions, which  control  the  degree  of  disorder. It is intended also to examine from the point  of  view  of  design:  (i)  other types of disordered  polymers,  including  branched  polymers,  knots,  and  ;  (ii)  realistic  degrees  of  compactness,  when density fluctuations are coupled  to  freezing  and  to design, providing for flower- or micelle-type structures;  (iii)  realistic  types  of  interactions,  including  long-range  Coulomb  interactions; and  (iv) states of  partial  equilibrium,  important  for folding kinetics. In work on gels, the first  goal  is  to observe the freezing phase transition in a polymer gel.  A  second goal in this area is to experimentally realize the idea of  sequence  design,  to allow the production  of  gels  capable  of  freezing into a state which exhibits at least certain elements of  the   desired   conformation.  This  combined   theoretical   and  experimental  study will shed light on basic physical  principles  behind  phase  transitions of disordered polymers and  gels,  and  will  be  of great potential importance for the physics of  these  fascinating  materials,  as  well as for  their  applications  in  biology, medicine, and technology.  %%%  This experimental and theor etical project is devoted to study  of  a  class of materials known as polymers, which are extremely long  molecules composed of repeating chemical units. The questions  of  interest relate to the degree of randomness or disorder in masses  of  such  material, and the conditions under which such material,  originally  in  a  liquid  state, can freeze  and  become  rigid.  Polymers  in  some  cases  can be thought  of  as  long  flexible  molecular  strings, which, when dissolved in  a  liquid  solvent,  resemble  cooked spaghetti in water. This work will include  many  other types of polymers, including those in which branches occur,  for  example.  One of the central questions in this  work  is  to  clarify  the  conditions, for example, temperature, the  type  of  solvent,  and  the type of polymer molecules,  which  lead  to  a  transition  from a liquid to a rigid solid.  A somewhat  similar,  but  irreversible,  freezing transition for example  occurs  when  epoxy glue hardens, but the phenomenon is to be examined in  this  project  in  a  very  fundamental and broad  manner,  leading  to  results  which  will be of predictive value for a wide  range  of  polymers and conditions. The utility of the results of this  work  may  include situations in biology and medicine, as  well  as  in  technology.  ***",
