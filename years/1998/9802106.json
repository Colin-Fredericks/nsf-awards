Marsden\r\n\r\nThis proposal intends to advance funamental research in reduction\r\ntheory for mechanical systems with symmetry in the following ways.\r\nFirst, the theory of reduction by stages for group extensions will be\r\ndeveloped in both the Hamiltonian (cotangent, symplectic and Poisson\r\ncontexts) and the Lagrangian (variational context) points of view.\r\nSecond, the geometry and dynamics of Lagrangian reduction, especially\r\nthe Lagrange-Poincare equations and the Lagrange-d'Alembert-Poincare\r\nequations will be investigated. In addition, the theory of geometric\r\nphases for systems reduced using invariants and Kahler structures as\r\nwell as the use of blowing up techniques in singular reduction, and\r\nmultisymplectic geometry will be advanced.\r\n\r\nThe engineering analysis of mechanical systems such as robotic\r\nlocomotion and control devices makes use of the proposers mathematical\r\ntechniques in geometric mechanics. This mathematical foundation will\r\nbe of increased importance as the sophistication of such engineering\r\nsystems get more complex and exhibit more exotic dynamical behaviors\r\nand require more delicate control strategies. The topics in this\r\nproposal are critical enabling tools for such research and have proven\r\nto be of great utility in a variety of systems such as satellite\r\nstabilization and underwater vehicle dynamics. They are also being put\r\nto fundamental use in numerical simulation packages for nonlinear\r\ndynamical systems in mechanics, including collision, fluid, and\r\nelastic systems as well as in satellite mission planning.\r\n",
