 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810587  Groger       This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project aims to develop electrodes modified with ligand-stabilized metal clusters (LSMC) for immunological and nucleic acid-dependent assays in order to improve the selectivity of capacitance-based methods of analysis. The observation of quantum tunneling in LSMC at room temperature and the feasibility of monitoring biologically produced sub-nanometer displacements with LSMC arrays suggests the very high sensitivity of this approach. The innovation of the proposed sensor system is the combination of LSMC with a frequency-dependent chip-based read-out to provide a silicon-based sensor having unparalleled sensitivity to endocrine disrupter molecules. The Phase I research objectives include the development of gold and silver ligand-stabilized metal clusters, deposition of LSMC membranes on electrode surfaces, acquisition of families of test data and optimization of a proof-of-concept prototype system. Recent evidence that xenobiotic materials can disrupt the endocrine systems of developing organisms has underscored the need to understand the mechanisms of interaction of these substances with biological systems. Capacitive biosensors have shown sufficient sensitivity for trace analysis of these endocrine disrupters in solution, in vitro and in vivo, but these biosensors can also respond to changes in the electrochemical characteristics of the sample, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the technique. In Phase II, test procedures will be automated and the sensor will be miniaturized for use in environmental analysis.        The Phase I program will result in a prototype biosensor based on ligand-stabilized metal clusters for monitoring environmental change. The sensor will find use in industrial and environmental process monitoring and in defense and biomedical applications.",
