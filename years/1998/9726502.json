 "awd_abstract_narration": "Howard  9726502            Ten years of research have demonstrated that the ground crickets, Allonemobius fasciatus and A. socius, are reproductively isolated by conspecific sperm precedence.  In other words, the two species produce few hybrids in nature because sperm from one species operates poorly in the reproductive tract of females from the other species.  This is one of the very few situations in which biologists have a clear understanding of the trait that reproductively isolates two closely related species.  The genetic control of this reproductive barrier will be assessed through a quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping study.  This is a relatively new technique that allows biologists to enumerate and locate the genes (or QTLs) that control a complex trait, such as conspecific sperm precedence.  The mapping populations will be large enough to detect QTLs that have even a small effect on conspecific sperm precedence.  Thus the study will allow a clear evaluation of the role of genes with large effects and the role of genes with small effects on the development of reproductive isolation.  Once QTLs have been identified, the effects of each will be examined on an individual basis.  Through carefully designed genetic crosses, single QTLs from A. fasciatus will be introduced into A. socius and vice-versa.  The crickets so   produced will allow a QTL to be studied in isolation from its usual genetic background, and thereby directly test the role of the QTL in controlling conspecific sperm precedence.   Finally, recent studies indicate that conspecific sperm precedence evolves quickly and may often be the first reproductive barrier to arise between diverging populations.  Therefore, it is important to understand how such a barrier influences zones of overlap between closely related species.  The effect of conspecific sperm precedence on zones of overlap will be analyzed through a genetic and demographic modeling approach.          Speciation, the process by which new species are formed and ther efore the process responsible for the diversity of life on earth, is relatively poorly understood by biologists.  This is a critical shortcoming in humanity's efforts to preserve species diversity, which cannot succeed unless new species continue to be generated.  Reaching an understanding of the genetic basis of reproductive barriers between closely related species has proven   particularly difficult.  The difficulty can be attributed to two factors: 1) the multi-faceted nature of reproductive isolation makes it hard to identify the traits that isolate two species, and 2) the tools necessary to dissect complex traits were not, until recently, available.  In the case of A. fasciatus and A. socius the first difficulty was overcome by ten years of painstaking research.  The second difficulty has been overcome by recent   advances in genetics that have led to the development of markers that can be mapped in virtually any organism.  Mapped markers allow the effects of different regions of the genome on a reproductive barrier to be monitored. Combining the current understanding of the Allonemobius system with these new developments in genetics will provide unprecedented insight into the genetics of reproductive barriers.  In particular, the proposed research will allow a determination of whether reproductive isolation between A. fasciatus and A. socius is controlled by a few genes of major effect or by many genes of small effect.  This distinction is at the center of a debate that has raged for more than a century and is critical for understanding whether spatial separation of populations is necessary for speciation and whether the time required for speciation is large or small.   Finally, the study of the genetic control of conspecific sperm precedence boils down to   the study of the genetic control of fertility problems.  Thus, the insights into infertility provided by this research will be relevant to many organisms, including humans.",
