That is, the corresponding  linear time evolutions cannot be effectively   compared at each fixed time to the initial data   using a single L-p space (Lebesgue space with exponent p)   when p is not equal to 2.  (When p = 2, there is often a conservation of   energy which provides just such an estimate.)         This obstacle is present in equations ranging from   classical field theory to the higher dimensional analogues of   hyperbolic systems dealt with in 1 space dimension by Glimm's method.   We propose to study two analytical methods developed to deal with  L-p ill-posedness in the context of nonlinear wave equations and   nonlinear Schrodinger equations.  The first is space-time estimates  for the corresponding linear problems.  We propose to study in collaboration   with T. Tao the endpoint  Strichartz estimates  for the Schrodinger and wave equation in   space dimensions 2 and 3, respectively.  This would be an extension of   previous work by Tao and the author.    We propose second to study generalized Sobolev estimates and the   method of conformal compactification.  We will be  looking, in   collaboration with C. Sogge and H. Smith, at the   specific problem of global in time existence for a   system of quasilinear wave equations  with small initial data   in the exterior of an obstacle.    Finally, we would like to bring these techniques to the question of   how the choice of gauge affects regularity of the solution in the   context of the hyperbolic Yang-Mills equations.     The physics behind many interesting systems currently   being investigated (for example, fluid flow or the   LIGO gravitational wave detectors) leads scientists to  a number of very difficult questions in nonlinear mathematics.   When we consider the nonlinear partial differential  equations arising in fluid mechanics and general  relativity, some   natural questions are \"how big is a solution at long times\" or even   \"does a solution exist for all times\". We have only very incomplete   answers to these questions.   The present proposal aims to further understand promising techniques   in nonlinear hyperbolic pde which might eventually be brought to   physical systems.  For example, the question above   regarding endpoint Strichartz estimates may shed light  on the decay properties of waves.  The obstacle problem mentioned   above is a toy model for the stability of the Schwarzschild space   in general relativity.",
