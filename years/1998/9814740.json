Dr. Gorbman has been retired for 12 years, and yet continues to keep as active as that experienced mentor that young researchers are happy to find.  Over a span of 25 years, he advised 50 postdoctoral associates (13 of them women) and 16 Ph.D.s (9 women).  Most of these women have made significant contributions to the field of research and are considered to be role models.  Dr. Gorbman founded and meticulously edited the Journal of Comparative Endocrinology for 32 years.  He included in the editorial board both women and minorities.\r\n",
