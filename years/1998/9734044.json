 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many scientific and engineering numerical optimization  problems are both computationally expensive and difficult to  solve for analytical reasons.  Not surprisingly, for such  problems there are also significant issues in the  integration of the software that describes the system being  optimized.  These difficulties are often intertwined.  The research that will be done will look at  analytical and algorithmic issues that arise in  the solution of such difficult numerical  optimization problems.  Specifically, the work  will evolve along two complementary lines: the  further development and analysis of pattern  search methods for nonlinear optimization, and  the design and analysis of techniques for using  approximation models to optimize systems defined  by computationally expensive functions. Both  these lines of research include a strong effort  in software development and experimentation.  Practical experience working on numerical  optimization problems from science and  engineering reveals issues and  techniques that are not covered well in the  current computer science curriculum and yet  would serve students well in any  multidisciplinary computational setting.  The  course development will draw upon existing  knowledge and software tools in computer science  and computational mathematics to design new  courses---practicums, in effect---that will  teach students more about how to understand,  maintain, enhance, and optimize existing  scientific software.  The emphasis will be on systematic analysis and  testing with an eye toward performance  programming.  Fundamental to this approach is  the belief that students should be taught how to  experiment in a systematic, scientific fashion  to analyze and reason about extant, complex  computer programs.",
