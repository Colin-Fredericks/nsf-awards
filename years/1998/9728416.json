 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biochemical molecules called neurotransmitters carry signals  between nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain.  These  neurotransmitters bind to specific molecules that act as receptors  on the cell membranes of target neurons.  One class of these  receptor molecules is called G-protein coupled receptors, because  they are linked to a class of particular proteins.  When a  neurotransmitter signal persists for minutes, the response of the  target cell diminishes.  One of the mechanisms for this  desensitization is the uncoupling of the receptor molecule from  its G-protein.  Recently it has been found that during stimulation  for many minutes by opiate peptide transmitters such as enkephalin  and endorphin, a large fraction of the opiate receptor molecules  leave the surface of the cell membrane to enter the cell in a  process called internalization.  This project uses particular  labeling techniques, biochemistry and microscopy to test the novel  idea that these internalized receptor molecules become associated  with the nucleus inside the cell, and may play a role in gene  expression initiated by opiates.     Results will be important for understanding at the molecular  level of how neurotransmitters may be linked to genetic modulation  of longer-term responses, and so will be potentially important for  behavioral as well as cellular neuroscience.",
