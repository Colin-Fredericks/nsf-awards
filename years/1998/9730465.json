 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wallace  Visualization is becoming an increasingly important part of modeling as a result of the integration of computer graphics into modeling software.  In addition, technological advances are making it possible for rapidly growing numbers of the general population to become modelers, for example, by using spreadsheet software.  The proposed research is based upon our previous experimental work, our theory of the role of visualization in modeling, and the literature on visualization and cognitive science.  We have selected as the target of our visualization a component that is central to the modeling process and to our understanding of it: the heuristics sued in constructing models.  In order to assess our theory, we intend to build visualization systems for two different types of modeling tasks, one in a physical domain, and the other in an abstract domain.  The first experiment will be conducted in the physical domain of groundwater modeling with the Where Next heuristics visualization system.  The second experiment will be conducted in the physical abstract domain of machine learning as applied to consumer credit.  As part of our experimentation, we will construct a `modeler's assistant` for each of the problem domains.  The contributions of the research are to better understand the process of modeling and the role of visualization in this process, and to integrate visualization techniques into the process of modeling in order to capitalize upon advances in computer graphics technology.                                                     \u2563\u00a2 \u2524\u00c1\u00a2\u2563\u00c0>\u00c1\u2524 \u00a5? \u2593\u00c1 _\u2510%\u00a5\u2563 \u2524\u2563\u00a2\u2502\u2563\u2551%\u2563>/\u255d` \u2563> >/\u00a5\u2510\u255d\u00c1   &/\u255d\u00a5\u2563\u2502\u2563\u2551/>\u00a5\u00a2 \u2534\u2563%% \u2502?_\u00c1 \u00c2\u255d?_ / \u2534\u2563\u2524\u00c1 \u255d/>\u00c0\u00c1 ?\u00c2 /\u2502/\u2524\u00c1_\u2563\u2502 /\u255d\u00c1/\u00a2 \u2563>\u2502%\u2510\u2524\u2563>\u00c0 \u00c1\u2502?>?_\u2563\u2502\u00a2  \u2551?%\u2563\u00a5\u2563\u2502/% \u00a2\u2502\u2563\u00c1>\u2502\u00c1  />\u00a5\u00a9\u255d?\u2551?%?\u00c0`  /\u2524_\u2563>\u2563\u00a2\u00a5\u255d/\u00a5\u2563\u2514\u00c1 \u00a2\u2502\u2563\u00c1>\u2502\u00c1 />\u2524 %/\u2534   \u00bf> /\u2524\u2524\u2563\u00a5\u2563?>  \u2551\u255d/\u2502\u00a5\u2563\u00a5\u2563?>\u00c1\u255d\u00a2 \u00c2\u255d?_ \u2593?\u00a5\u00a9 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u00f3/>/\u2524\u2563/> />\u2524 \u00a1 \u00bd  \u00c0?\u2514\u00c1\u255d>_\u00c1>\u00a5\u00a2 \u2534\u2563%% \u2593\u00c1 \u2563>\u2514?%\u2514\u00c1\u2524 /\u00a2 \u2551\u255d\u00c1\u00a2\u00c1>\u00a5\u00c1\u255d\u00a2  \u2502?__\u00c1>\u00a5/\u00a5?\u255d\u00a2 />\u2524 \u2524\u2563\u00a2\u2502\u2510\u00a2\u00a2/>\u00a5\u00a2",
