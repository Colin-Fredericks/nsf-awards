 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 9728453  LLOYD     The long range goal of this research is to gain insight into  mechanisms underlying the modulation of synaptic transmission,  that is modifications in the way one nerve cell (neuron) in the  nervous system communicates with another, through release of  chemical signaling molecules. It is now clear that many neurons  contain more than one transmitter and it is important to determine  how multiple transmitters released from the terminals (endings) of  single neurons interact on presynaptic and postsynaptic targets.  Specifically, neuropeptide transmitters (polypeptides serving as  transmitters) appear to commonly coexist along with conventional  transmitters (such as acetyl choline). The relatively simple  nervous system of Aplysia (the \"sea hare,\" a marine mollusc) has a  number of advantages that make it particularly useful as a model  system for these studies. One goal of this grant is to explore the  manner in which neuropeptides that are released from motor neurons  (neurons innervating muscle) interact to modulate the  effectiveness of other transmitters released from the same neuron.  A second goal is to investigate the effects of a \"biogenic amine\",  serotonin, released from purely modulatory neurons which have  neuromuscular terminals. The neuropeptides and serotonin have been  shown to be potent modulators of neuromuscular transmission. These  studies have implications for vertebrate skeletal neuromuscular  junctions where peptide cotransmitters have also been found.  Understanding fundamental neural processes such as the modulation  of synaptic transmission at these neuromuscular synapses could  provide a more general understanding of synapses which release  multiple transmitters as well as have relevance to disorders of  movement.",
