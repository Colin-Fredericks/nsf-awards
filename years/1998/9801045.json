The two main series of conjectures which together would give a proof of the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture in general, have been formulated and applied to prove by elementary means the non-trivial Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture for homogenizations of simplicial polytopes.  These conjectures are the PSM conjectures and the IC conjectures.  The PSM conjectures describe analogues of principal series modules from Lie theory in terms of data related to shellings of the weight poset.  The IC conjectures assert that certain spaces arising naturally in the representation theory have properties closely analogous to those of the intersection cohomology spaces of complex projective varieties.  The main object of this research is to prove the PSM and IC conjectures in general.\r\n\r\nRepresentation theory of Lie algebras and Lie groups, initially developed at the turn of the century, studies the structure of symmetries and their realizations.  This theory encompasses many areas in mathematics and has fundamental applications to theoretical physics.  In the past twenty years, the study of representation theory of a special class of affine Lie algebras and Lie groups led to many new unexpected discoveries in mathematics and theoretical physics, as well as to a synthesis of many established areas in both disciplines.  In particular, it yielded a pure mathematical description of a simplest quantum field theory -- a prototype theory of fundamental interactions.  It is expected that representation theory of new classes of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups might substantially deepen our understanding of mathematics and theoretical physics during the next decade.\r\n\t\r\n",
