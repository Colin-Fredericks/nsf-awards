 "awd_abstract_narration": "9808335  GOY   One feature of the brain that sets it apart from  all other organs is its ability to process, store, and retrieve  large amounts of information.  In order to do this, it maintains a  set of intercellular connections (synapses) that allow individual  brain cells (neurons) to communicate with each other.  Neurons  must initially establish their synaptic connections as the brain  is forming during embryogenesis. Subsequently, synapses are  modified throughout life as the brain takes in and stores new  information, and they are reorganized in response to accidental  damage, for example after a stroke or a head injury, as functional  capacities are at least partially restored in the brain.  The way  in which neurons generate synaptic connections during development,  regulate their strength during adult life, and rewire them after  an injury are among the most-studied and least-understood  mechanisms in the field of neuroscience.      Recently, it has become apparent that a specific kind of  intracellular signaling molecule, called cyclic GMP, helps neurons  regulate the strength of synaptic connections -- both in the  immature brain, when the survival or elimination of specific  synapses is specified, and in the mature brain, when learning and  memory require changes in synaptic efficacy.  This leads to an  obvious question:  if cyclic GMP controls synaptic strength, then  what controls cyclic GMP?  Dr. Goy's laboratory studies mechanisms  that regulate cyclic GMP metabolism in a simple nervous system,  the ventral nerve cord of the lobster, Homarus americanus.  This  neuronal network (an interconnected chain of 15 ganglia, each  containing from thousands to tens of thousands of neurons)  provides many opportunities to study the way that mechanisms  controlling cyclic GMP metabolism can produce specific changes in  synaptic organization.       Results from this project will generate and test specific  hypotheses about how cyclic GMP controls synaptogenesis and  synaptic reorganization  in a simple animal.  In turn, this will  lead to testable hypotheses about synapse formation in general.",
