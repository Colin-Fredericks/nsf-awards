 "awd_abstract_narration": "Located in an area where manufacturing employment is on the increase, Westark College, in concert with area manufacturers, realizes the critical need for a well educated workforce. This project is developing and delivering manufacturing instruction at the bachelor's degree level that is founded in the contextual application of mathematics, science and technology principles and which builds on the associate degree program already in place at Westark.  Collaboration with local public high schools is providing a pipeline for sharing project innovations with high school faculty.  A pilot program, the Ford Academy of Manufacturing Sciences (FAMS), will provide high school students a foundation from which to enter the manufacturing technology program.  The result is a seamless 2+2+2 program which has strong industrial backing in the community and which is a national model.     Strong collaboration between Westark and the business community have resulted in numerous training and education activities that are the foundation from which to develop a program in manufacturing. Ongoing efforts have created significant interest among the manufacturers, public schools, and legislators for this program.     This unique program is developing curriculum based upon manufacturer identified competencies, and focuses on learning rather than teaching. Both high school graduates and current manufacturing employees are target audiences.  Breaking traditional paradigms of educational structure and delivery and contextually basing in manufacturing is causing great interest among potential students.    This proposal supports the development of learning modules that are both self-paced and team-based, maintaining a focus on the outcome competencies, rather than seat time. Pre-assessment tools for proper placement and the awarding of advanced credit upon demonstrated competency are components of this proposal. Small clusters of employer-identified competencies will be delivered as self-paced learning modules that include aut henticating activities allowing students to experience the manufacturing applications. Also supported is an advanced manufacturing laboratory in which many of the authenticating activities are taking place.",
