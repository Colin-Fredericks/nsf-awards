 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Lin          The project is to study nuclear C*-algebras by studying   their homomorphisms, isomorphic types and their invariants,   and by studying extensions of C*-algebras. Continuous maps   between topological spaces are of fundamental importance in   topology. As their noncommutative counterparts, homomorphisms   are of fundamental importance in the theory of C*-algebras.   One part of the project is to determine when two   homomorphisms from one unital separable nuclear C*-algebra  to another C*-algebra are (stably) approximately unitarily   equivalent. It is always in  the  center of the theory of   C*-algebras to determine when two C*-algebras are isomorphic   and to describe their invariants. Another part of the project   is to classify (simple) nuclear separable C*-algebras   via their K-theory. These two parts are closely related and both   involve the general theory of C*-algebras, KK-theory, the   theory of automorphisms, the C*-algebra extension theory, the   group representations  as well as  algebraic topology.        Many important and significant problems in engineering, the  physical sciences, and social sciences require the knowledge   of linear algebras (or matrix algebras) to solve them.  Many problems in linear algebras, in particular asymptotic and   approximation problems in linear algebras are best described    in infinite dimensional linear algebras. The study of C*-algebras   is the study of infinite dimensional linear algebras. However  the   applications of C*-algebras range from linear algebras, operator   theory, group representations, dynamic systems, to model quantum   field theory and quantum statistical mechanics. For the development   of the theory of C*-algebras as well as for the purpose of   applications to other areas, it is primarily important to have a   better understanding of the structure of C*-algebras. It is the   ambitious goal of this project to determine the structure of   C*-algebras with fewest possible data.",
