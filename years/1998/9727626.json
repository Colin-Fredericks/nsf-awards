 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727626  Thompson  Phloem is essential for the long distance transport of photoassimilates from the sites of synthesis or remobilization to the sites of use or storage.  Although phloem tissue has been well described anatomically and morphologically, many questions remain to be answered to link structural components of the translocating cells to their function.  Phloem protein (P-protein) filaments form an integral network in the cytoplasm of the translocating cells in many higher plants, yet their function is unresolved.  The long term goal of this project is to relate the structural features of P-proteins to phloem biology.  The PIs are utilizing the divergence between P-proteins in Cucurbita and Cucumis species to determine the functional significance of conserved features within these proteins.  These experiments will be the basis for a broad mutational analysis of these proteins in functional assays performed in transgenic plants.  Structural components that are required for phloem filament formation will also be assessed in vitro.  Experiments are being conducted to evaluate binding domains in the phloem filament protein and to determine the involvement of additional proteins, especially the role of chaperones, in filament formation.  These investigations will enhance our understanding of the biological activity of P-proteins and the mechanisms by which these proteins function.",
