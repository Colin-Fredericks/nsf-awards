PTF has hosted two U.S. National biennial conferences in Denver, 1994 and San Diego, 1996, but this will be the first event co-supported overseas.  The World Congress events are major highlights in the particle science and technology field, the two previous meetings were in 1986 and 1990 in Germany and Japan, respectively.    The World Congress meeting will focus on the development of novel particle formation processes, the application of new understanding of interparticle forces to processing behavior, the impact of new measuring methods, and the rapid advancement of simulation and modeling techniques.  The technical meeting will also be run in conjunction with an International Particle Technology Exhibition.  The World Congress on Particle Technology 1998 will attract over 600 participants and over 400 papers from the world's leading particle technologists.  ***",
