 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference award to Catherine Page at the University of Oregon is   made by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division and the   Solid State Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research in   support of the 6th-8th Materials Chemistry Workshops. The goals of the   Workshops are to provide a forum for discussion of ongoing and emerging   areas of research and education among scientists with varied backgrounds   and common materials chemistry interests and to promote dialog between   industry, government and academic scientists. The two and one-half day   workshops will be  held on the third weekend in October with up to thirty   participants selected by a competitively reviewed application process.   Specific Workshop sites will be determined by the Program Chairpersons   and are expected to be in Oregon, Minnesota and New Jersey.  The Materials Chemistry Workshops will provide a forum conducive to the   development of ideas, help bridge gaps among the materials chemistry   constituencies in academia, industry and government labs, lead to new   collaborations and define the frontiers of materials chemistry.",
