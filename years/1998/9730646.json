 "awd_abstract_narration": "9730646  Elgaaly    Brick and concrete block masonary infill walls are used  extensively in steel frame buildings.  They are often  considered as non-structural elements. Which has led to poor  performance of infilled frame structures when subjected to  strong lateral forces.  Observations of post-earthquake  damages indicate their vulnerability.  A retrofitting  technique that is easy to apply and that enhances the  strength and deformation characteristics of infill masonary  walls could potentially reduce the number of failures of  infilled frames under earthquake loading.    Existing retrofit techniques have several disadvantages such  as considerable increase in building weight, difficulties  for connection to existing buildings, and high construction  cost.  In this project, a new technique for retrofitting  infill hollow masonry walls utilizing external reinforcement  with Fiberglass Composite Laminates (FCL) is proposed.  It  had several advantages over the existing techniques.    A quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of FCL as a  retrofitting technique for steel frames infilled with hollow  concrete masonry walls will be conducted.  Characterization  of material properties of reinforced infill masonry walls  will be obtained and used for the analysis and design of  retrofitted infilled frames under seismic loads.  Further  testing and analytical studies will be conducted to examine  the interaction between the steel frame and the reinforced  infill wall.  Through this effort the effectiveness of FCL  will be demonstrated and its use as a retrofitting material  to enhance the seismic performance of existing infilled  frame buildings will be advanced.  ***",
