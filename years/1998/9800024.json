 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum computation is an important new area that has shaken the  foundations of computational complexity theory and algorithms.  This project investigates several aspects of this subject: Use of  \"negative probabilities\" to design efficient quantum algorithms  for random generation and approximate counting.  Further  exploration of the new Fourier transform relationship between the  `spins world\" and the \"subgraphs world\" to solve the Ising model  Gibbs sampling problem in the case that all interactions are  negative.  The study of further group theoretic properties of the  Fourier transform to design efficient quantum algorithms for  problems such as graph isomorphism.  In particular, this involves  studying the linear representations of non-commutative groups  such as the symmetric group.  The study of new error models for  quantum computers based on NMR experiments in quantum computation  currently underway at Berkeley.  The formulation of formal  criteria to demonstrate that the computation in these experiments  is inherently quantum mechanical.  The comparison of the class  BQP to classical complexity classes, including the polynomial  hierarchy, and most notably approximate counting.  The study of  the quantum analog of NP.  In addition this project studies  classical randomized algorithms for a fundamental algorithmic  task - clustering: A sequence of points is sampled from a  probability distribution in R, which may be any member of a  family of distributions which have several modes (regions of  concentrated probability).  Is there an efficient algorithm to  infer an accurate estimate of the distribution being sampled?  This formalizes a very general problem related to clustering.  Given a graph, partition its vertices into two sets such that the  ratio of the number of crossing edges to the number of vertices  in the smaller sets is with in a constant factor of the minimum.  The weighted version of this problem is the famous problem of  estimating the conductance of a graph to with in  a constant  factor.  It formulizes a clustering problem in a concrete  setting.",
