 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the extent to which judges' introduction to voir dire can increase the level of self disclosure of potential jurors (venirepersons) during voir dire.  The research has two major components.  The  first is an analysis of  voir dire transcripts of actual felony trials to determine systematically whether judges and attorneys emphasize a juror standard of being fair and impartial and less so on being honest and forthcoming during voir dire. The second component is a laboratory experiment to test the consequences of such presentations on self-disclosure and honesty during an interview modeled on voir dire procedures.  In this portion of the research, the emphasis on the standard of juror fairness an impartiality is compared to an alternative emphasis on a  standard of open an honest self-disclosure of attitudes and experiences whether or not the may be disqualifying.  Participants in this research are to be jury eligible community residents. Previous research has shown that potential jurors may not disclose important information during voir dire.  The experimental research herein being conducted will begin to explain why.  Further, a method that theoretically will increase the self-disclosure and honesty is being tested",
