 "awd_abstract_narration": "9871906  Hehr  Arkansas EPSCoR Cooperative Agreement  The Arkansas EPSCoR Cooperative Agreement will increase the ability  of researchers in Arkansas to compete for federal funding.  Based  on the state s research and development plan and on current and  potential faculty expertise, four scientific areas will be  supported.  These are:  mass spectrometry, molecular and cellular  biology, biotechnology, and computational sciences.  The University  of Arkansas (UAF) will develop a mass spectrometry laboratory that  will provide equipment and support for projects across many of the  science and engineering disciplines.  In order to help meet the  needs of molecular science and technology in Arkansas, UAF will  recruit six additional cellular and molecular biology faculty and  provide start-up money to enable these faculty to begin development  of their research programs. The Department of Molecular Genetics at  the University of Arkansas For Medical Science (UAMS) has recently  been created.  Space for the new department has been identified and  the state has funded faculty salaries.  To enhance teaching and  research, start-up funds will be provided to equip eight new NSF-  eligible faculty in this department.  Two supporting areas will  also be funded.  In addition, the UAMS is planning to build a  facility for shared university/private sector activities which will  enhance economic opportunities and build biotechnical business and  industry throughout the state. To help build a nationally  competitive program in Computation Sciences, equipment will be  purchased to support eleven tenure-track faculty and fellowships  will be initiated to attract high quality graduate students for  computation and other science departments. Currently NSF and state  funds are being used to build a high-bandwidth network and funds  will be sought to rebuild the campus backbone at both the UAF and  UAMS to accommodate better Internet access.",
