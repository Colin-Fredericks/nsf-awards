 "awd_abstract_narration": "Helen Leung is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   to use Fourier transform microwave (FTMW) spectroscopy to investigate   perturbations of electric field gradients around quadrupolar nuclei.    Preliminary indications that these perturbations can arise from van der   Waals bond formation will be explored by systematic spectroscopic   examination of N2O-containing complexes and imidazole-containing   complexes.  Spectroscopic constants derived from rotational spectra will   be systematically compared for a series of complexes, to improve the   understanding of intermolecular interactions involving quadrupolar   nuclei.  This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project   provides an introduction to modern physical chemistry research methods to   undergraduate chemistry majors.  Van der Waals molecules are held together by forces that are much smaller   than the chemical bonds that hold atoms together in a molecule.    Examination of the structure of weakly bound molecules in gas phase   complexes provides an opportunity to sort out the specific forces that   are at play in a controlled environment.  Weak van der Waals interactions   are important when molecules are in close proximity to one another, as is   the case in biological systems.  The research aspects of this RUI project   will serve as a meaningful educational vehicle to introduce the   scientific method to future scientists.",
