 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703864  Chen  The 6.8 magnitude earthquake that shook California's San  Fernando Valley on January 17th in 1994, did not cause the  collapse of any steel structures but connections,  confidently designed and constructed in the past with  traditional code simplifications and common site-welding  techniques, were discovered no to meet our expectations.    This project will study the performance of structures  depends on the performance of connections.  This will be  accomplished by analyzing the fracture strength and  toughness of the moment connection.  The load effect as  determined by a structure's global response, and its  performance as controlled by local material properties and  geometric configuration will be considered.  The interaction  and relative importance of horizontal and vertical seismic  forces will be evaluated.  The effect of composite action  (concrete floor-slab on steel girder) and panel zone  deformation will be included.  Locally, a detailed nonlinear  finite element model will provide the stress state  information needed to perform a fracture analysis.  The  fracture strength of the moment connection will consider the  effect of reduced toughness in the heat treated region; line  and semi-elliptic cracks will be used to simulate weld  flaws; stress intensity factors at these locations will  quantify the effect these weaknesses have on the ultimate  strength of the joint.    It has been recognized that the best means to describe the  strength performance of structural members, must now be  followed by a similar \"back to the basics\" approach to  connection design.  Fracture mechanics is proposed to  provide that foundation: empirical relationships based upon  theoretical analyses will be presented to estimate the  ultimate strength resistance of moment connections to  seismic loads and brittle fracture  ***",
