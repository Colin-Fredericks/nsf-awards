It is nationally and internationally known for its collections from Florida, North America, the Caribbean, and Latin America.  The vascular plant collection has over 216,000 specimins and over 250 types.  Taxonomists at the University of Florida are engages in a wide diversity of projects in Florida, North America, Central and South America, and the Caribbean.  The collection is used by entomologists and other zoologiests studying host plants, by ecologists, and by a wide range of systematic botanists.  The collection is currently overcrowded and lacks space for expansion.  The vascular plant collection is being moved into larger space and compactors are being installed.  This project will support the purchase of 102 new herbarium cases to use on the compactor and in adjacent room to help alleviate problems associated with over crowding, as well as to meet anticipated growth for the next decade.\r\n",
