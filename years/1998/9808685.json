The PI intends to continue a  coordinated study of the properties of doped Mott  insulators. Specifically it is intended to investigate the  properties of conducting stripe ordered, stripe liquid, and  stripe liquid crystalline phases, the mechanism of high  temperature superconductivity in these phases, an most  ambitiously, to study the consequences of topological doping  for the anomalous normal state of \"bad metals.\"  The PI  plans an approach that includes controlled approximate  solutions of microscopic models as well as developing more  phenomenological theory with the aim of understanding the  implications of experimental observations.  Specific plans  include: (1) studies of solvable electronic models which  exhibit stripe phases, (2) an investigation of the  consequences of fluctuations of the phase of the order  parameter on the properties of superconductors with low  superfluid densities, (3) studies to establish the  conditions for the stability of possible liquid crystalline  and isotropic liquid stripe phases, and to elucidate the  electronic properties of these phases.  %%%  This proposal involves new approaches to the study of  electronic properties of materials with strongly interacting  electrons; a challenging problem at the forefront of  condensed matter theory.  The role of  `striped phases' and  superconducting fluctuations in high temperature  superconductors are a focus of this work.  ***",
