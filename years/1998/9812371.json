 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support two planning workshops to  facilitate preparation of a Master Plan for the  University of Virginia Coastal Research Center (VCRC).  The goal of soliciting input from a variety of  scientists and field station managers is to make the  proposed field station a scientifically attractive place  for investigators from a broad range of academic  backgrounds as a way of enhancing understanding of  coastal systems.  The goal of these workshops would be  to plan the research/educational infrastructure that  will serve the needs of a diversity of scientists from a  variety of institutions with a common interest in  integrated interdisciplinary research.  Ultimately, the  product to be derived from the workshops is the Master  Plan for development of the site, including enhancement  of existing facilities and construction of new, needed  infrastructure.    The first workshop will be conducted at the VCRC to  solicit information about the needs of potential  users of the field station and advice from others with  experience in development of field stations. Specifics  that would be addressed at this workshop would include  both Phase I and later phases of the station  construction.  Workshop participants will be asked to  assess Phase I facilities with respect to the functional  aspects of accommodating the housing and laboratory  requirements of a variety of physical and biological  scientists.  Additionally, the participants would be  asked to provide insight into the type of field  instrumentation, data collection activities, data  management, and logistical support envisioned  for later phases of the VCRC development.    The objective of the second workshop will be to  prioritize the recommendations of the first workshop.  In addition to UVa coastal research scientists,  invitations to the second workshop would be extended  to non-UVa scientists who are actively seeking funding to  conduct work at the VCRC.",
