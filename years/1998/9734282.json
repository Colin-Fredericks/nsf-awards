 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of a system in which the   interactions of lipid A and derivatives with other molecules can be   directly observed and characterized.  The association properties of the   lipid A derivatives will be studied via microtitration calorimetry.  The   first lipid A binding molecule to be studied will be the peptide   antibiotic polymyxin B.  The focus of the educational activities is on   the preparation of short animations of organic reactions based on high   level semi-empirical and ab initio calculations.With this Faculty Early   Development (CAREER) award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry   Program is supporting the research and educational activities of Dr. Paul   B. Savage of the Department of Chemistry at Brigham Young University.     Professor Savage will focus his research efforts on developing a system   in which association of lipid A and derivatives with other molecules can   be directly measured and thermodynamically characterized.   Lipid A, a   primary component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria,   adversly affects the lives of hundreds of thousands of people each year   in the United States.   A primary focus of the educational activities is   to develop visual materials for undergraduate teaching.",
