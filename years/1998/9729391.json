 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729391  Oppenheimer    Forty-grade 5-12 life science and integrated science teachers per year for three years will be engaged in six-week summer experiences in the laboratories of working research scientists.  It is planned that the research experiences will be translated into classroom instructional practices as recommended by the National Research Council's National Science Education Standards.  TO this end an educator in the teacher preparation will assist teachers in bridging these two areas with the specific aim of improving science teaching and instruction.  The six-week research experiences will also include four enrichment activities on translation into best classroom instruction, teacher assessment of student work, bioethics, and recombinant DNA technology.  Two seminars will prepare the scientist mentors for their work with the teachers prior to the start of each summer program.  The scientists will make continued research experiences available during the academic year for teachers interested in continuing their research projects.  Extensive outreach efforts will target teachers from schools with 50-95% underrepresented.  Letters from principals have been received that pledge funds for supplies to implement student research projects in the classes of project teachers.  Nobel Laureate Francis Crick will work with the teachers motivating them to excel in the program.  A student research symposium will be held on or about June 1 of each year for students of the project teachers to present their research.  Students will also publish their research in the Journal of Student Research Abstracts and teachers will publish their work with their mentor scientists and present their work at meetings of professional societies.  The journal will be supported entirely by CSU, Northridge.  Curriculum expert, Dr. Norman Herr will assist all teachers in the transfer of their research experiences into a classroom research curriculum.  Classroom expert, Dr. Hakansson from UCLA and research expert Dr. Epel  from Stanford will direct evaluation.  Evaluation will include careful examination of teacher and student products, laboratory and classroom visitation and extensive use of case study modality.  The project will be institutionalized from day one of the program through a biology department course (Biology 699) that will permanently provide teachers with research experiences in the laboratories of research scientists at CSU, Northridge.  This project is intended to serve as a national model for the effective transfer of research experiences of teachers into best classroom student research training practices in the proper use of the scientific method and extensive peer review at every step of the research project.  The project is to also serve as a model for institutionalizing teacher research experiences through university courses.",
