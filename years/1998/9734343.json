 "awd_abstract_narration": "9734343  Naeem  This proposal outlines an integrated program of research, teaching, and training designed to promote cross-cutting and multidisciplinary approaches in basic biology and ecology. The research component fills an important gap in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning studies. The proposed work is a long-term, multi-trophic level investigation of the interaction between variation in trophic structure and plant diversity, and its impacts on fundamental ecosystem processes among plants, animals and microbes. The study system is the Cedar Creek Natural History Area LTER site. The educational component breaks traditional disciplinary boundaries by focusing on interfaces between biota and biogeochemistry, rather than the cell to ecosystem hierarchy. Training of students will occur by involving undergraduates in hands-on research opportunities. For students with some biological background and research experience, further training will include hypothesis testing, statistical approaches, ethics, and peer review. Collectively, this project will provide a foundation for a long-term academic career devoted to the development of pluralistic and synthetic approaches in ecological research and education.",
