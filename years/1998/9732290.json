 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Chemistry Division award provides continued support for a Research   Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in the Chemistry Department,   California State University, Fullerton, directed by Dr. A. M. (Scott)   Hewitt.  Ten students will participate in a 10-week summer program over   the next three years.  This program deliberately seeks out `late   bloomers` and representatives from groups that are traditionally   under-represented in chemistry research.  The students will be exposed to   a variety of research topics, trained in the use of scientific   instruments, guided in designing, completing, and interpreting   experiments, and encouraged to develop verbal and written communications   skills.  Each participant is assigned to a research focus group where the   students present their own work and hear about other department research   activities.  Other features of the program include a tour of local   chemical research facilities.  A five-part Science, Ethics, and the   Environment seminar series will expose the students to ethical issues   having to do with their research and that of others.  Research results   will be reported in a final talk, research poster session, and a   journal-style report.",
