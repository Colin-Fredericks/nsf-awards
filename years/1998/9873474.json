Such a project is possible because of significant experimental advances in our understanding of motor control systems in humans and other animals, and because of increased sophistication in our mathematical models of control learning.  These models will be used not only to analyze and predict natural phenomena in motor control, but also to derive effective adaptive controllers for artificial systems carrying out complex tasks.\r\nTo generate complex behaviors, natural and artificial systems must be organized hierarchically with multiple layers of abstraction.  The first research task will therefore be to identify appropriate levels of representation at which the physical system can be modclled and at which control actions can be defined.  For example, in describing an insect flying from A to B, possible levels might be 1) nerve signals and mechanical properties controlling the detailed shaping of each wingbcat 2) basic wingbeat cycle 3) 11 steering\" the cycle to direct flight 4) takeoff, navigation, landing.  Detailed motion, force, and/or airflow measurements will be made under a variety of experimental circumstances and tasks to establish the correspondence between formal models and physical systems.  These experiments will be carried out for a variety of organisms, possibly including flying in insects, running in cockroaches, and for running, diving, and throwing in humans.  These studies (and, in the case of insects, neurophysiological studies) will also establish the sensory inputs that are available at each level of the control system.\r\nGiven the general structure of the control system and the appropriate sensory inputs, the next step is to design learning algorithms capable of learning to perform the given task successfully.  The learning method to be used is reinforcement learning, a technique designed to adjust the control algorithm to optimize an objective function-that is, the long-term accumulated value of a specified reward signal.  The reward is supplied to the learning algorithm as part of the sensory input.  New reinforcement learning algorithms will be developed that operate using both local and global reward signals within a hierarchical control structure; furthermore, these algorithms will be proved to converge even using nonlinear representations of the overall objective function.  This research should shed light on the central question of whether this form of learning in animals and humans can be viewed as driven by optimization or by some other principle, such as the preservation of fixed interface characteristics among the various levels of the system.  Discovery of consistent reward functions in animals, especially humans, would have significant consequences for general theories of learning.\r\n\r\n",
