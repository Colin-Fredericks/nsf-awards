 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729805  Hallock    This  proposal  will support a component of the experimental  low  temperature    physics    program   at    the    University    of  Massachusetts/Amherst.  The objectives  are:  (1)  to  study  new  aspects  of  the He-3-He-4 mixture film system, (2) to  study  in  more  detail capillary condensation and avalanche phenomena  with  helium  in  porous materials, (3) to conduct studies with  helium  films  on patterned substrates in one and two dimensions, with  a  focus  on  two dimensional localization, and (4) to  bring  to  a  conclusion  our study of helium in the context of C60 substrates.  Experimental  methods  include quartz  crystal  resonance,  third  sound, and heat capacity studies of the thermal properties of He-  3/He-4   mixture   films;   and   high   resolution   capacitance  measurements  of capillary condensation and avalanche  events  in  porous materials. The work will lead to an improved understanding  of helium on hydrogen, including \"two transitions\" in the case of  mixture   films;  a  test  of  the  appropriateness   of   recent  theoretical work concerning avalanche events in magnetic  systems  for   the  description  of  similar  events  seen  in  hysteretic  capillary condensation, and an improved understanding of a method  for  determining  pore  distributions and draining  phenomena  in  porous  materials.  In addition to contributing  to  progress  in  understanding the behavior of helium films themselves,  the  work  will  have relevance to the wider community in the areas of Fermi  systems,  avalanche phenomena, capillary condensation,  and  non-  linear  phenomena.  The project provides excellent  training  for  graduate  students in a number of important techniques  that  are  used   in  technical  fields  as  well  as  fundamental  research  projects.  %%%  Helium  is  a remarkable substance with special liquid properties  when  cooled near the absolute zero of temperature. This proposed  grant  will  study various problems in condensed  m atter  physics  using the unique properties of liquid helium, particularly liquid  helium  films,  as the vehicle to facilitate the study.  In  some  cases  the  helium itself will be the subject of  the  study,  in  others,  helium will serve as a convenient fluid to  explore  the  phenomena of interest. In particular, the grant will allow  study  He-4  and  He-3/He-4  mixture  films  and  thereby  enhance   our  understanding  of  phase transitions on two dimensional  surfaces  and  on  weak  binding  substrates such  as  hydrogen.  Capillary  condensation  phenomena and avalanche events in porous  materials  will  be  studied to gain a deeper understanding  of  how  porous  materials  drain, an understanding that cannot be  reached  using  ordinary  liquids. Finally, studies of helium on  C60  substrates  will  be  concluded. The project provides excellent training  for  graduate  students in a number of important techniques  that  are  used   in  technical  fields  as  well  as  fundamental  research  projects.  ***",
