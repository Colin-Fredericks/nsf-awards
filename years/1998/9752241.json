 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project Beyond Formulas is developing holistic, interdisciplinary Workplace Application Modules as enhancements to existing mathematics curricular materials. By presenting students with challenging, work-based problems, these modules demonstrate the relevance of abstract concepts to the real-world, thereby helping students improve both their understanding of and attitude toward mathematics. In turn, by making mathematics real to students through meaningful examples and engaging activities, the project is increasing critical-thinking and intuitive abilities - beyond rote memorization of formulas - to help students more effectively solve problems and make decisions as future employees in a highly technological workplace.    Modules comprise five areas of study: algebra, statistics, trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus. Each module is exposing students to workplace-relevant scenarios and case studies that engage the students in abstract reasoning and the process of inquiry, provide overviews of industries on which case studies relate, and integrate mathematical theory within the industrial context. Module activities include cooperative learning; mathematical problem-solving; utilization of technology; use of data, measurement, models, and cause and effect diagrams; written assignments; and presentations.    Modules are being pilot-tested, evaluated and revised by College mathematics faculty from other two-year colleges and an external evaluator from Manatee Community College. Student attainment of learning objectives, improved performance, and changes in attitudes and perceptions are being used as indicators of project effectiveness. Qualitative evaluations by faculty are also being conducted. Developed materials and results are being disseminated locally, statewide and nationally to maximize project impact.",
