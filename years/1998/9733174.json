 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the elucidation of the calcium binding   properties and domain organization of calbindin D28K, a protein abundant   in specific nervous tissue and one of the larger EF-hand members,   containing six putative EF-hands.  The strategy involves the synthesis of   each EF-hand as a 33-residue peptide sequence, which can then be   characterized individually or in combinations with other EF-hands.   Methodology for the for connecting the EF-hands to provide fragments   comprising more than one EF-hand is also described.   The focus of the   educational activities involves the the education of students through   laboratory experience and through course and curriculum development in   organic chemistry.  With this Faculty Early Development (CAREER) award,   the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the   research and educational activities of Dr. Karin S. Akerfeldt of the   Department of Chemistry at Rutgers University, Camden.   Professor   Akerfeldt will focus her research efforts on protein structure-function   relationship studies using a synthetic approach that will delineate   calcium binding properties and domain organization of the EF-hand   proteins.  This class of proteins is present in eukaryotes and is   involved in a vast number of physiological processes.  Dr. Akerfeldt's   educational activities are involved with course and curriculum   development.",
