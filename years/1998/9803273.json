The data studied in this research violate   conventional assumptions, such as independence, homogeneity, among   others, which are otherwise adopted under more standard settings.   Six specific topics are presented; each corresponds to at least one   violation of conventional assumptions, and a messy data set may have   one or more of these types of violations. According to their origins   from two different motivating data sets, two of the six topics address   problems on group testing scheme (Dorfman, 1943) and its variants,   including issues on modeling false negatives and relaxing the   assumption of independence on individuals. The rest of the topics   investigate practical and theoretical issues related to modeling   batch correlated regression data and develop new models and methods   for heterogeneous observations. These developments will not only   solve the specific type of problems, but also stimulate new   researches to develop more general methodologies.    This research develops statistical methodologies, models, and related   theories to address issues arising from modeling and analysis of messy   data, which can be found in many disciplines of the sciences, including  life science, environmental science, social science, industry and   economics. A common feature of these messy data is that they   all violate some conventional model assumptions, which otherwise are   adopted under more standard settings. Accurate modeling of messy data   can eliminate irrelevant information and provide better understanding   of underlying mechanisms; ultimately benefiting prediction and decision   making. Although tremendous progress has been made in development of   both sophisticated statistical methodologies and elegant mathematical   theories in the past half century, many important problems in modeling   and analysis of messy data have yet to be tackled, both from practical   and theoretical viewpoints. This research investigates several such   problems. Although the models and methodologies are tailored to   specific problems in the Pharmaceutical industry and environmental   science, these developments will not only solve the specific type of   problems, but also stimulate new researches to develop more general   methodologies.",
