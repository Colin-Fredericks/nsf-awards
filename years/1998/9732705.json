 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is on developing efficient  combinatorial algorithms for key problems in Artificial  Intelligence and Optimization, as well as providing an improved  understanding of the inherent nature of these problems.  This  project involves three areas in particular:  machine learning, on-  line decision-making, and the study of algorithms for  computationally hard problems.  In the area of machine learning,  one main component of this work is the design of better  algorithms for learning  in large feature spaces.  This includes  questions of how to best combine a large number of low-quality  sources of advice that may be available (e.g., via the internet),  as well as a number of questions with close relations to  crytography.  In the area of on-line algorithms and on-line  decision making, this research will investigate new approaches  for the Weighted-Caching problem, as well as the potential for  using methods from machine learning (for instance, algorithms for  combining sources of advice) to produce improved solutions to a  number of problems in this area.  In the study of methods for  solving computationally hard problems, this project will continue  exploration of approximation algorithms, as well as a new  approach to general purpose planning based on representing  planning problems in a compact graph structure, and then bringing  in tools and ideas from graph algorithms.  This planning method  was first demonstrated in the Graphplan planner, and empirically  appears to be substantially faster than more traditional planning  algorithms in a wide variety of settings.",
