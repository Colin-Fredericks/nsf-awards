The Symposium  will  emphasize new  developments  in  low  temperature physics in the area of  quantum fluids and solids, including BoseEinstein  condensation (BEC), and will have sessions  devoted  to  instrumentation  and  techniques.  The  conference   will  bring together  practitioners  from the atomic physics  community,  who have  been working at ultralow temperatures  in order achieve BEC, and  traditional low temperature  physicists, who  use  liquid  or solid  helium  or  adiabatic demagnetization methods  to  achieve ultralow  temperatures. The NSF support will be used  to  provide  travel  funds for graduate students or younger faculty to  attend the Symposium.  %%%  This  awards provides partial support for a Symposium on  Quantum Fluids and Solids that will be held in Amherst, MA  on June  9-14, 1998  on  the  campus  of  the University of  Massachusetts.
