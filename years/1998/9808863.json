 "awd_abstract_narration": "Borgia  9808863    In many species, females choose their mates based on a  complex suite of characteristics. The function of multiple  elements in complex male courtship displays is not well  understood. Male satin bowerbirds have extremely complex  multifaceted displays involving decorated bowers, constructed  and maintained by the male, and courtship behaviors. Three  different studies are proposed to explore how the components  of male display affect mate choice by females. Low quality  bowers will be enhanced and female visitation patterns at  bowers will be monitored to test the hypothesis that females  match the quality of display traits important in initial  assessment of males with those used in later stages of  assessment. A study of signaling using female bowerbird will  help identify the function of and constraints on courtship  displays in female assessment of males. A test of the  immunocompetence hypothesis ( that suggests there is a trade-  off between a male's display competence and the competence of  his immune system due to on the physiological effects of high  testosterone levels) will assess the coastlines of male  display and how that may affect the ability of males of  different quality to produce effective multifaceted displays.  These experiments will help resolve the function of multiple  elements in male display, and illuminate the ways in which  females integrate these diverse elements in the process of  mate selection.    Mate choice is a fundamental process that affects social  interactions and the evolution of many characteristics. The  proposed research will allow important hypotheses about the  function of mate choice to be evaluated.",
