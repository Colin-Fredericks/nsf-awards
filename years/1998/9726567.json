Over  the last several decades it has become clear that these  environments, while generally productive, also undergo  considerable inter- and intra-annual variability.  Consequently, available prey resources for vertebrate  predators can be highly variable spatially and temporally.  This spatial and temporal variability of prey resources has  been measured empirically for the northern South Shetland  Islands region of the Antarctic Peninsula since the late  1980's. The Antarctic fur seal, a sub-polar migratory  otariid with a short lactation period, is an increasingly  dominant marine predator of the South Shetlands region. Its  life history is pattern is characterized by foraging trips  alternating with short visits to provision a single  offspring; this allows scientists to measure maternal  investment on the same temporal and spatial scale as  measurements of distribution and abundance of prey. This  project will quantify the foraging costs and maternal  investment associated with changes in strategies observed in  populations of South Shetland Ataractic fur seals. Energetic  costs and benefits of different foraging patterns with  simultaneous measurement of energy expenditure, food intake,  dive depth, dive duration, time of day, and dive frequency,  swim speed and foraging location will be accomplished using  state of the art techniques. These measurements will  coincide with small and large scale oceanographic surveys to  be conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration's Antarctic Marine Living Resources program,  which is also contributing to the support of this project.  The research will allow scientists to link biological  characteristics (prey composition, distribution and  abundance) and physical characteristics of the foraging  environment with foraging success, maternal investment and  reproductive success for a free-ranging marine ve rtebrate  predator.",
