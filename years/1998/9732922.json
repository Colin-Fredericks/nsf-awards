 "awd_abstract_narration": "For over thirty years, computational complexity theory has  provided the computer science community with a theoretical  backbone from which one can understand the power of computation.  Computational complexity has produced the tools that allows one  to understand what likely can and cannot be computed in a  reasonable amount of time and memory.  This research will  continue this tradition. While this research will look at a wide  range of problems in many different areas of computational  complexity it will focus on two interesting directions.  The project first looks at a new model of computation, quantum  computing.  Computer scientists have recently discovered the  powerful applications of the cancellation effect of quantum  physics.  Though these quantum computers do not yet exist, nice  theoretical models of these machines allow study of their  complexity.  The research will look at ways to apply the  cancellation effects in the well-studied area of counting  complexity to help the understanding of the complexity of quantum  computation. The research will also embark on a more ambitious  plan of attempting complexity class separation, one of the most  important and least successful directions in the area.  In  particular, the research will try to show languages in computable  in nondeterministic polynomial time, such as the famous traveling  salesman problem, cannot be computable in (logarithmic) amount of  space.  The research well use tools recently developed by the PI  of simulating space and time by alternation and applying Post's  program of looking at properties of these and other classes. By  understanding the relationship among complexity classes, one can  better understand the nature of computation and provide the  necessary directions one needs to solve problems on various  models of computation.  This research will help strengthen the  theoretical foundations from which computer science stands.",
