Despite their importance, only meager experimental data exists on bubble formation and interaction in magmas.  In order for gas to form bubbles in magmas and to escape to ore bodies, bubbles must nucleate, grow, and link up, to allow gas to migrate through the magma. This study will attempt to address this gap in our knowledge about the behavior of bubbles in magmas by experimentally examining nucleation and growth of bubbles in silicate melts using a wide range of gas compositions.  Some of the crucial questions that will be investigated are, what changes in magmatic conditions are needed to precipitate bubble nucleation and growth?, do bubbles nucleate heterogeneously or homogeneously?, what roles do different gas species, such as H2O, CO2, Cl, and S, play in degassing magmas?, and what volume percentage of bubbles is needed before bubbles can interact?  By addressing these questions, fundamental new insights will be gained on magma degassing and, thus, on process controlling volcanic eruptions and ore body formation, and on the influence of volcanic eruptions on the atmosphere.\r\n",
