 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program, involves an experimental and theoretical study  of the structure and properties of single crystal noble metal  electrodes and gold electrodes modified by self-assembled  monolayers.  Professor Fawcett and his students at the University  of California at Davis will use a variety of voltammetric methods  and impedance spectroscopy to characterize these electrode surfaces  immersed in various nonaqueous solvents.  The distribution of  potential over the double layer at these electrode/solution  interfaces and the effect of solvent on this property will be  determined.  In concert with this experimental thrust theoretical  work will be pursued to develop analytical expressions for these  double layer properties that can be easily used by  experimentalists.    The double layer properties of single crystal noble metal  electrodes and gold electrodes modified by self-assembled  monolayers in various nonaqueous solvents will be studied  experimentally and theoretically in this project.  Professor  Fawcett and his students at the University of California at Davis  will use a variety of electrochemical methods and impedance  spectroscopy in this work and analytical expressions that describe  the double layer at these electrode/solution interfaces that can be  easily used will be developed.  The results from this work will be  contribute to   understanding the effects of solvent on the  distribution of potential at these interfaces and this knowledge  has relevance to a variety of `green` technologies.",
