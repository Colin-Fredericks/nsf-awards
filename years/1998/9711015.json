 "awd_abstract_narration": "9711015  Collins  The seismic Design provisions of most building codes  existing account for the uncertainty in the ground motion by  defining a single \"design\" earthquake based on probability  of exceedance or return period.  A more rational approach to  structural design would be to establish performance criteria  for the structure corresponding to two (or more) levels of  earthquake excitation, express these criteria in  probabilistic terms, develop deterministic design-checking  equations based on the probabilistic criteria, and design  the structure using the deterministic design-checking  equations.    The objective of this research project is to further develop  and refine the performance-based design procedure so that it  will be applicable to more complex building configurations.  To this end, analytical studies will be performed to  investigate several issues including (1) investigating  alternate choices of the lateral force distribution used in  the static push-over analyses, (2) developing simple  techniques to account for torsional effects and three-  dimensional effects while preserving the probabilistic bases  of the deterministic design equations, (3) accounting for  the effects of nonstructural components on overall building  performance, and (4) considering alternate measures of  structural response to be used in formulating performance  criteria.  Although no experiments are planned, existing  experimental data will be used to supplement the analytical  results obtained during this investigation whenever  possible.",
