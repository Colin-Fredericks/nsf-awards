 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cognitive processes involved in virtually any kind of classification behavior (e.g., detecting alarms, identifying speech patterns, recognizing faces) can be subdivided into two kinds of mental operations: encoding (collecting information from the environment) and decision making (selecting a response to the environment).  Typically, the behavioral researcher can only observe the final output of the classification process (i.e., the observer's classification response), but is interested in identifying the origins of classification errors (i.e., poor information versus poor decision making).  A statistical analysis of some kind is therefore needed to separate the contributions of these two different stages to overall performance.  For the past several decades, the most popular analysis has come from a mathematical model known as signal detection theory.  Unfortunately, the validity of this particular analysis depends on some technical assumptions that are difficult to verify empirically.  Recently, I have developed and applied a new set of analyses that can be used for two-choice classification data (e.g., detection or discrimination of signals from noise) without relying on these technical assumptions.  The results of these new analyses suggest that signal detection theory's representation of the discrimination process is fundamentally flawed and that a new framework for classification is needed. The first set of studies involved in this research project will generalize these new methods to examine the structure of human classification processes in several other classification paradigms, including perceptual identification, recognition memory, and paired comparison.  The second set of studies is concerned with the reasons why human decision making processes are not optimal in the sense defined by signal detection theory and whether there are conditions under which these suboptimalities can be corrected.  The ability to understand and improve the decision making strategies of human observers should have important applications in a broad range of applied settings, including performance assessment and training, medical and clinical diagnosis, product quality monitoring, and air traffic control.",
