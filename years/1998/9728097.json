 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nerve cells, or neurons, have elongated branches called  neurites that sometimes reach long distances to make connections  with other parts of the brain.  Inside the cell are structures  called organelles that are important for transport of materials  from one place to another.  For transport within the cell,  important biochemicals often are packaged in small bubble-like  containers called vesicles.  The actual mechanisms of transport  are not fully understood, but some proteins are believed to act  like motors, transporting vesicles along 'tracks' of organelles  called microtubules.  This project investigates a recently  discovered neural protein called HAP1, which is associated with  microtubules and some kinds of vesicles.  Biochemical and  microscopic studies will examine how the HAP1 protein binds to  form a molecular complex with some of the motor proteins  associated with microtubule transport mechanisms.     Results from this work will be important in understanding  intracellular transport mechanisms, and so will be important  beyond neuroscience to cell biology in general, and to  developmental biology.",
