 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dear Joe,     Please find below our abstract for the NSF grant. We hope it is what  you had in mind.     Best wishes for the new year,       Corran and Roger        The proposed research concerns the theory of operator algebras and operator   spaces. Smith will concentrate on the theory of von Neumann algebras, and   continue his work on the Kadison-Ringrose conjecture on the cohomology groups   of type II_1 factors. He will also investigate the Haagerup invariant for   operator algebras, which addresses the difficult problem of distinguishing   between various von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras. Webster will continue his   investigation of local operator spaces, the quantized version of locally convex   vector spaces, concentrating on applications to subalgebras of smooth elements   of C*-algebras, and algebras of unbounded operators. He will also pursue   applications of the Krein-Milman theorem in operator convexity theory, with the   particular aim of shedding light on the problem of the existence of boundary   representations. In joint work the proposers will consider various   approximation properties of operator algebras and operator spaces and these   will be connected to both the Haagerup invariant and operator compactness of   matrix sets.    Operator theory and operator algebras are the infinite dimensional analogues of   finite matrix theory. They were first studied by von Neumann as a framework for   quantum mechanics. Subsequently they have had, and continue to have, important   applications to control theory, quantum groups, non-commutative geometry,   non-commutative probability and knot theory. The work in this proposal is most   closely related to mathematical physics and quantum mechanics. We will consider   algebras of unbounded operators which arise from the Heisenberg Uncertainty   Principle, as well as crossed product C*-algebras which model the time evolution  of quantum mechanical systems in physics. The techniques we use rely heavily on   the theory of operator spaces , a topic which has undergone considerable   development in the last ten years. These spaces provide a unifying framework for  the self-adjoint algebras of physics and the non-self-adjoint algebras of   control theory.",
