 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the investigation of theoretical methods, computer-integrated systems, and organizational processes to support Internet-based formation and management of supply-webs in the manufacturing industry.  Reference architectures for supply-web interactions and representation models for job announcements and supplier capabilities will be developed.  The research will investigate metrics, decision strategies and logic for rapid and effective bid construction, bid evaluation, and supplier selection.  Representation models and decision-making algorithms and protocols at both the supply-web level as well as the shopfloor level will be studied.  A highly-distributed computational testbed will be implemented for modeling, simulation, and analysis of shopfloor and supply-web interactions.  Proof-of-concept computer-aided decision-systems will be implemented by integrating the theoretical methods developed in this research with Internet technologies.  This research will be conducted in close collaboration with industry.  Current organizational structures and business processes for supply-web interaction will be studied, and new ones that are better suited to dynamic supply-web interactions and virtual enterprises will be developed.       If successful, the results of this research will lead to an improved understanding about efficient and effective representation models for describing customer job requirements and supplier capabilities via the Internet in a variety of manufacturing domains.  This will support ongoing efforts on standardization of representation data models.  The analytical models and computational experimental testbed to be developed in this research will help predict supply-web and shopfloor performance under various decision strategies.  The research will provide an understanding of how to seamlessly integrate decisions at both levels of system abstraction by using up-to-date shopfloor status information to support decision-making at the supply-web level.  The proof-of-concept decision-systems to be developed in this research will be useful to demonstrate the research results to industry and to promote technology transfer.  Our collaborative efforts with industry will provide insights regarding how organizational structures and business processes need to be reengineered in order to achieve the full benefits of Internet-aided supply-web interactions.",
