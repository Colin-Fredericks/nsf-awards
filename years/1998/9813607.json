 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9813607  This award supports a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to test a new method (Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy) for determining deuterium-hydrogen isotope ratios (e.g. D/H)  on polar ice core and snow pit samples.   These measurements are traditionally performed with a mass spectrometer in the laboratory.  The proposed work is exploratory since such an instrument has never been used before as a tool in ice core work and its utility for such measurements needs to be established through extensive experimentation.  If the results are positive, the benefits of using this instrument are that it is small and light weight and could be used in the field to obtain a preliminary idea of the seasonal variation in isotope concentration and no special sample preparation is necessary.  The objectives of this project will be to establish the limits of resolution of the FTIR method, to test for seasonal resolution on samples for which nitrate and electrical conductivity are already established and to perform a calibration test on core samples which have already been measured by mass spectrometry.  If successful, this instrument will benefit the upcoming International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition (ITASE) traverses which are to begin during the 1999/2000 antarctic field season.  ***",
