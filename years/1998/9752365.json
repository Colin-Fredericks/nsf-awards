 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within this project, five schools that have already been active on the web are developing, adapting, and testing curricular material using World Wide Web protocols. The effort has five main goals:  (1) Develop and test Internet accessible curriculum databases using web-based SQL database technology;  (2) Link diverse academic communities in a collaborative learning environment;  (3) Develop new teaching paradigms such as Physlets and Just-In-Time-Teaching; (4) Evaluate cognitive gains of media-rich and multimedia-focused curricular material; and (5) Lead curriculum development workshops for physics faculty at summer and winter meetings of the American Association of Physics Teachers and then organize more extensive national and regional workshops.   The project is adopting a common set of industrial strength commercial tools built around System Query Language, SQL, database servers. The curriculum database created will have sufficient generality to be easily replicated at other institutions.  As a result of this project students and instructors will be querying the database using HTML forms that are designed to meet school specific educational goals.  A formal assessment of students' cognitive gains is being undertaken.",
