 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to develop a \"lighting simulation laboratory\" to facilitate interactive, project-   oriented learning of principles of design, evaluation, and analysis of visual and qualitative  aspects of the built environment for undergraduate students of architecture and interior design. It  provides opportunities to apply advanced visual computing technologies iteratively and fluidly  for creative design. We propose to use Radiosity-based visualization techniques on high-end  desk-top computers to predict lighting performance in built spaces as a basis for design  decisions. Radiosity represents a fundamental advance in computer graphic technology because  it allows accurate simulations based on the physical characteristics of light and materials. The  proposed lighting simulation laboratory will augment the current facilities in our Architecture  Design and Visualization Laboratory (ADVisLab), funded in part by a prior ILI-IP grant from  NSF, by utilizing high-end desktop computers to facilitate visual engineering approaches to  design. The added capabilities brought by this laboratory setup will enable our undergraduate  students to do what they cannot do with other existing software programs or physical modeling  alternatives: to visualize their lighting designs scientificallv and accuratelv rather than illustrating  desired lighting effects intuitively without a sound photometric basis. This project will have a  direct and profound effect on the learning experiences of beginning undergraduate students in  the department by incorporating advanced technologies in introducing fundamental skills of  design representation and exploration (80 students per year) at the introductory level. It will also  have a broader curriculum-wide effect by enriching the learning experiences of upper-level  students by allowing them to achieve proficiency in the use advanced technologies through CAAD studios (30 students per year) and technology electives (about 60 students per year). This  facility will al so be used during summer semester by Miami University's undergraduate research  scholars, as well as area minority high school students. The equipment will include fifteen  networked high-end desktop computers with appropriate software and peripherals for lighting  simulation.",
