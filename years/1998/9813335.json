 "awd_abstract_narration": "Orive  9813335    Clonal reproduction, or the nonsexual production of new individuals, is widespread throughout both plant and animal species, including marine invertebrates such as corals.  Existing population genetics theory does not adequately address many important details of clonal life histories, including indeterminate growth and development; the existence of both clonal and sexual reproduction in the same species; the spread of somatic mutations; and the existence of multiple levels where natural selection can act.  The overall aim of this research program is to expand evolutionary genetic models to incorporate the unique life history characteristics of clonal organisms, allowing an examination of fundamental evolutionary issues, such as the origin and maintenance of genetic diversity and the rate at which new mutations arise and spread.    This research will involve the development of a basic model of mutation and selection in clonal organisms that incorporates the various aspects of their life histories. The model is unique in incorporating both a population genetics framework (where, for example, allele frequencies in the entire population are followed) and a demographic model (which incorporates details of the organism's particular life history); it may also be extended to populations that are structured in other ways.  Some of these extensions will require the use of computer simulation studies, especially in exploring the stochastic nature of the origin and spread of mutations within individuals and the effects of selection on individuals carrying these somatic mutations.  By expanding theory to include organisms outside of the those previously considered, this work will add considerably to the understanding of processes such as somatic mutation, selection at different levels of organization, and the origin and maintenance of genetic diversity.  This work will also provide a basis for considering topics such as the evolution of clonal life histories and the relative roles played by  forces governing this evolution.",
