 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the investigation of the chemistry of   homo-allylic type carbonium ions as precursors to vinylcyclopropanes,   alkenylidene cyclopropanes and oligcyclopropanes.  An iterative   application of the methodology will be used to prepare biologically   active natural products such as FR-900848 and U-106305, both of which   contain oligocyclopropane structural units.   Extensions of the   methodology to solid phase synthesis and combinatorial library generation   will also be carried out.  The focus of the educational activities will   be the development of laboratory experiments involving combinatorial   chemistry.   With this Faculty Early Development (CAREER) award, the   Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research   and educational activities of Dr. Richard E. Taylor of the Department of   Chemistry at the University of Notre Dame.   Professor Taylor will focus   his research efforts on developing methods for the synthesis of   cyclopropane containing structural units.  The methodology, applied in an   iterative fashion, will give access to structurally novel   oligocyclopropanes.  This class of compounds has been shown to have   interesting biological properties. In addition, application of the   chemistry to solid-phase synthesis and combinatorial library generation   of diversely functionalized oligocyclopropane structural units will be   investigated.  The educational activities will center around the   introduction of combinatorial chemistry into undergraduate courses",
