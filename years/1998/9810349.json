 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9810349  Nillni         Rat thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) produced in the  paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) was  first  shown  to  stimulate the biosynthesis and secretion  of  the  thyrotropin-stimulating  hormone  (TSH)  from  the  anterior  pituitary,  which in turn regulates thyroid function.   This  effect  showed  to  play a central role  in  regulating  the  pituitary-thyroid axis.  This hormone derives from a  larger  protein  precursor  (proTRH).  ProTRH  also  encodes   seven  intervening peptides with potential biological activity.  An  understanding of the biosynthesis and biochemical processing  of  proTRH  is critical to appreciating how, when and  where  regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT)  axis  takes  place  during physiologically appropriate enhancement  of  thyroid function.  ProTRH is widely expressed throughout  the  brain  and  spinal  cord, in  particular  the  PVN  and  ventrolateral medulla. In the last few years, our laboratory  has  made substantial contributions to understanding how TRH  is   synthesized,  by  demonstrating  the  way   proTRH   is  processed,  and by finding the proteolytic enzymes  involved  in this process.          In  spite of our knowledge of proTRH biosynthesis  and  processing,   little  is  known  about   the   physiological  regulation  of proTRH biosynthesis and processing,  and  the  neuronal  factors  involved  in  this  regulation.  TRH   is  integral   to   the  survival  of  most  animals   in   cold  environments  and  TRH  secretion  by  the  hypothalamus  is  increased  during  cold.  Moreover  the  noradrenergic  (NE)  system plays a crucial role in cold-induced augmentation  of  TRH  secretion.  TRH neurons in the PVN receive a  dense  NE  innervation.  However, the mechanisms whereby  cold  and  NE  enhance mature TRH production are unknown, but could be  due  to  enhancement of proTRH biosynthesis or processing.   Data  are  scant regarding the regulation of the enzymes  involved  in   this  activity  in  the  brain during  physiological  or  pharmacological situations where TRH and HPT  axis  activity  is  stimulated.  Therefore, in  these  studies  it  will  be  investigated  the role that the processing enzymes  play  in  the  processing  of proTRH.  It will be also  determine  the  generation of TRH during physiological activation of the HPT  axis. Cold represents a strong stimulus to the activation of  the  HPT  axis and represents a more chronic response  where  adaptive  changes in the processing of proTRH are necessary.  In  addition, the genesis of TRH will be examined  in  cold-  exposed  enzyme  deficient knockout mice.  Cold-induced  TRH  release  is  mediated  by activation of  brain  NE  systems.  Therefore,  it  will be examine in normal  and  cold-exposed  mice  and rats whether the activation of NE systems  mediate  these effects. There are virtually no data available on  the  regulation  of  prohormone processing in the  brain.   These  studies  will provide novel information on the physiological  and  environmental  regulation of proTRH processing  in  PVN  neurons regulating the HPT axis.",
