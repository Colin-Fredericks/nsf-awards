LIGO will be able to detect gravitational radiation from several types of sources if they are present in large enough numbers or with great enough intensity.  The detection problem is difficult because the signal from the gravitational radiation will be buried in the noise form the detector itself.  The signal must be extracted from the noise.  Instrumental artifacts that mimic sources of gravitational radiation signals, or otherwise interfere with the analysis must be characterized and removed from the complex data stream that will emanate from about 100 different instrument and diagnostic signals.  This research program includes the development, implementation and optimization of codes to search the data stream for different types of signals, and the development of diagnostic tools which will provide real time, instantaneous feedback about the operation of the instrument.\r\n\r\nMost existing techniques that could be used to search for different types of sources have never been tested on data from an interferometric gravitational-wave detector.  This project will assist the LIGO project with the development and implementation of different algorithms.  These algorithms will be tested with data from the Caltech 40m interferometer and with parts of the LIGO system as they come on into operation.  The results of this work will be a collection of tested, documented and proven data analysis software as well as insight into how the expected data analysis techniques can be usefully applied to the actual data stream from LIGO.\r\n***\r\n",
