 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemistry faculty members at Western Carolina University, a primarily undergraduate institution in the southern Appalachians, have added an environmental focus to the curriculum. This emphasis is a logical fit for this department because of our ecologically-diverse location, our student employment record in the environmental sciences, and a number of environmentally-based student research projects. The FT-NMR instrument system is being used to develop novel experiments that promote student learning by (1) identifying synthesized compounds using of state-of-the-art instrumentation, (2) exploring alternative methods of synthetic chemistry that strive to minimize impact on the environment, (3) examining preparative procedures for compounds that serve alternative methods for pest control, and (4) developing a general environmental awareness. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry is a powerful tool that, although rarely associated with environmental chemistry, significantly enhances the learning process. Using this instrument, students characterize compounds which have been prepared using alternative methods of synthesis. The dye-sensitized irradiative removal of protecting groups-is one preparative method that seeks to prevent pollution from the outset.  The FT-NMR system is  also used to characterize ferrocene-based catalysts which have been prepared with the concept of atom economy in mind. More sophisticated, multi-dimensional NMR technique are used to evaluate the three-dimensional structure of the products of these catalytic processes. Insect pheromones, employed for mating disruption of insect pests, are prepared and characterized by NMR. Finally, the requested instrument supports a vigorous undergraduate research program.",
