 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Borough of Manhattan Community College is developing a cohesive and unified curriculum in Multimedia Programming and Design in partnership with Murry Bergtraum High School. Courses are being developed and/or redesigned to include the use of collaborative learning and multimedia instructional technology. BMCC is working in partnership with Murry Bergtraum High School and industry representatives to develop the curriculum, which allows students to move efficiently from secondary education into an associate degree program in Multimedia Programming and Design. In addition, the project provides faculty development in the use and integration of advanced multimedia technology instruction and collaborative learning to full-time faculty and high school instructors from the New York City region. This exemplary program serves as a national model for other colleges and high schools seeking to reform their programs, to ensure that underrepresented groups are attracted to and retained in those programs, and to provide opportunities for secondary and postsecondary faculty to collaborate in improving the quality of advanced technological education.",
