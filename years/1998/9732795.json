 "awd_abstract_narration": "9732795\r\nSimchi-Levi\r\n     This grant provides funding for the analysis of large scale logistics systems. In such systems, finished products, which are assembled from a set of components, may be produced and stored in various locations prior to their distribution to retail outlets. Thus, the logistics system includes suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses and retail outlets as well as raw materials, work-in-process inventory and finished products that flow between the facilities. The objective is to coordinate production, routing and timing of shipment so as to minimize system-wide cost, including manufacturing, inventory  and transportation, while satisfying all demands.  The focus in this research is on logistics systems that employ two types of transportation modes; a private fleet, or Less Than Truck Load carriers. In both cases, the goal of the research  is to understand the underlying theoretical structure  of optimal solutions and utilize it in the development of practical and efficient algorithms.\r\n     If successful, the results of this research will lead to the development of new algorithms that are effective,\r\nindependent of the specific environment and the variability of the data. That is, these algorithms are robust; they are designed to handle a general setting rather than a set of library problems.  These algorithms make it possible to implement optimization based decision support systems that take into account the interaction between the various levels of the logistics network, and utilize the wealth of available information in the supply chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
