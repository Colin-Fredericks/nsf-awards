 "awd_abstract_narration": "9801024  Crowell    This project aims for a fundamental understanding of the effect  of dopants and alloying (additives) on the nanostructure and  nanochemistry of epitaxial deposition. Emphasis is placed on  determining the role of dopants in modifying the geometric,  electronic, and chemical reactivity of Group IV semiconductor  surfaces. The approach is to delineate the surface chemistry and  reactivity of Group IV precursor reagents in the presence of  additives and dopants on Si surfaces, to assess how nucleation  begins, and how differences in the local deposition chemistry  affect the growing films' nanostructure and morphology. The  research strives for a basic understanding of the changes in  bonding and electronic structure induced by dopants through  characterizing the vibrational structure of deposition and  etching intermediates, determining what effect additives and  dopants have on reaction mechanisms and on the surface  energetics; correlation of the deposition chemistry and the  geometric structure at the nanometer scale is expected to lead to  better understanding and process control. A broad range of  spectroscopic probes will be used to characterize and correlate  the deposition chemistry with the surface growth morphology.  These studies will couple existing expertise and spectroscopic  capability with variable temperature STM and ultraviolet and  x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies.  %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  materials science having high technological relevance. The  research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a  fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic  devices.  Experimental tools are now available to allow atomic  level observation of elementary surface processes which when  better understood will allow advances in both fundamental science  and technology. The basic knowledge and understanding gained from  the research is expected to contribute to improving the perform  ance and s tability of advanced devices and circuits by providing  a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and  producing improved materials, and materials combinations.  An  important feature of the program is the integration of research  and education through the training of students in a fundamentally  and technologically significant area.  ***",
