 "awd_abstract_narration": "The eighteen databases of the Oregon Coalition for  Interdisciplinary Databases (OCID) and the over 250 databases  of the Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) at the H.J.  Andrews Experimental Forest will serve as a testbed for a  project to develop Web-based software that will make it  possible to integrate distributed databases into a seamless  virtual database. The proposed software framework will include  Web-based tools for defining metadata to describe what aspects  of each database are appropriate for cross-referencing against  other databases, as well as software agents that mediate among  independent repos-itories of data. The project will  demonstrate how the software can be deployed to cross  disciplinary agency and hardware/software boundaries to create  a virtual database of bio-logical, geophysical, and climatic  data. Such a resource will offer a much richer context for  studying the biology and ecology of the northwestern region of  the United States than has been available previously. As a  model for interlinking other similar regional and national  databases, it will be a valuable resource not only for  research and natural resource management, but also for  education. The project brings together a multidisciplinary  team led by a computer scientist specializing in helping  multidisciplinary groups adapt advanced computing technology  to their specific needs and an ecologist-statistician-infor-  mation manager from the LTER program. Each of the scientists  who have agreed to coop-erate with the PIs has already built  at least one research database of national significance. The  close collaboration of computer scientists and biological  scientists on this project will yield a practical, well-tested  foundation that database owners throughout the country can  exploit to link their own resources with colleagues at distant  institutions or in other disci-plines.    ***",
