 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for a CAREER award.  The principal goal of this project is to develop systematic design methods for the shape synthesis of mechanical structures subject to unconventional actuation.  The following three synthesis problems will be addressed:  (1) Synthesis of novel micro- and meso-scale devices with embedded electro-thermal-compliant actuation such that they deform desirably upon applying an voltage differential between two points; (2) Synthesis of a structure for prescribed normal mode shapes; and (3) Shape synthesis of piezoelectrically driven structures.  In each case, the coupled interactions among the field equations of multiple energy domains will be modeled and used in conjunction with the numerical optimization methods to develop the optimal synthesis algorithms.  The educational plan includes involving undergraduates in research, and developing design-oriented graduate courses and a curriculum for graduate and undergraduate students in the rapidly growing area of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS).  A new outreach activity of `Taking MEMS to high schools` is included as part of this integrated research and education activity to inspire and encourage high school students to pursue careers in science and technology.       If successful, this research will result in design methodologies for optimizing shape to exploit the full potential of materials and unconventional actuations used in modern mechanical systems such as MEMS and Smart Structures.  This will impact the MEMS, and micro-sensor and actuator industries making their products more competitive because of improved quality and lower cost.  The successful implementation of the educational plan of this project will result in mechanical engineering graduates with interdisciplinary skills for the 21st century.",
