This proposal is focused on nontraditional material removal or machining processes.  They include electrical discharge and electrochemical machining (EDM/ECM), laser machining processes (LMP), and abrasive waterjet machining (AWJM), among others.  NTM processes can machine precision components from sophisticated materials.  They offer the advantages of a reduced number of machining steps and a higher product quality.\r\n\r\nDriven by the increasing interest in the vastly superior properties of innovative materials such as superalloys, composites and ceramics, and requirements for high quality and flexibility, research in NTM process innovation, quantitative analysis and process simulation, and monitoring and control has been very active and considerable progress has been made in recent years.  These advances have made NTM processes more attractive and sometimes the best or only choice.  At the same time, these research results have been introduced into engineering curricula in order to prepare a new generation of engineers who keep abreast to the latest developments.  Due to the high diversity and multidisciplinary nature of NTM processes, however, more orchestrated efforts are needed to expand the range of expertise needed in the curriculum development.\r\n\r\nThe curricular deliverables of this project include a set of seven modules including five instructional modules and two software based modules.  These seven modules will form an in-depth course on NTM at the upper level undergraduate and introductory graduate level.\r\n\r\nTo prepare a new generation of engineers who would have analytical background knowledge, appreciation for the vital area of NTM processes, and skills to use recent research based modern tools to tackle process innovation, design and optimization problems will have a significant impact on whether the potential of NTM technologies can be fully and properly realized and in turn whether the promise held by these advanced materials can be fully realized. \r\n",
