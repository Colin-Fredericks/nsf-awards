Their evolution is often described at the microscopic level while questions are asked at a much larger or macroscopic scale.  The transition from one scale to another always requires some averaging at the microscopic level and sometimes, as in the non gradient models, getting rid of certain divergences as well.  In the case of hyperbolic scaling, the macroscopic equation is a nonlinear hyperbolic equation that develops shocks.  The characterization of the microscopic profile of the shock is an interesting problem.  Studying the rescaled motion of a single tagged particle that interacts with large number of particles requires a central limit theorem to be proved under very minimal mixing assumptions.\r\n\r\nMany complex physical systems consist of a large number of elementary components.  Each of these components interacts in some fashion only with a few neighboring ones.  However, the large system, as a whole, evolves in some complex manner due to the interactions of the individual components.  This project is devoted to the exploration of this phenomenon, in several concrete examples.  The goal is to provide mechanisms for making inferences about the behavior in the large scale based on assumptions on the nature of the interaction in the small scale.\r\n",
