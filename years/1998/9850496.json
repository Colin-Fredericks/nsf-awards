 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to achieve the following goals: 1) Introduce Workshop Physics style laboratories at the University of Wisconsin - LaCrosse, for an increasing number of students taking calculus physics, and 2) to enhance learning in the physics laboratory for the average student, particularly Physics/Engineering Dual Degree majors and other science majors. The project is using a networked Microcomputer Based Laboratories (MBL) in the laboratories that are part of the calculus based introductory physics courses. These courses, General Physics I, II (Physics 203, 204), are being run very much in the Workshop Physics style, although the formal lecture sessions will be kept as well. Such a model has already been implemented in a modest fashion in the algebra based physics course. Implementing this project is enhancing the education of future scientists and engineers in a cost-effective way. In addition, students in \"Broad Field Science,\" teacher certification program, students satisfying their General Education Program science requirement, and students in various pre-professional programs (medicine, physical therapy etc.),who take this course are also benefiting. Finally, science teachers participating in summer workshops will also use this laboratory.",
