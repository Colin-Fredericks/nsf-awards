The project has two aspects, the first  being  growth  of  excellent epitaxial films of  Tl2201  on  tri-  crystal and other substrates. This will be performed by the PI at  SUNY Buffalo. The second task is a set of subtle measurements  to  be  made  at  IBM supervised by the IBM co-PI's in  the  project.  These   measurements  will  include  but  not   be   limited   to  measurements using a state-of-the-art scanning SQUID  microscope.  The   measurements  are  designed  to  clarify  the   nature   of  superconductivity  and  the symmetry of the  order  parameter  in  excellent  single  layer samples. This choice of  samples  avoids  complications  of  copper chains and interlayer interactions,  to  enable  more  transparent  tests of the  relevant  theories.  The  research will involve a postdoctoral researcher who will  receive  excellent  training  at both locations, beneficial  to  a  future  career  in  industry,  government  or  academia.  This  work   is  interdisciplinary  in  nature and is supported  in  part  by  the  Office  of  Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical  and  Physics Sciences Directorate at NSF.  %%%  This  experimental research project is in the category  of  Grant  Opportunities  for Academic Liaison With Industry (GOALI),  which  fosters    collaboration   between   academic   and    industrial  researchers.
