 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the investigation of how   N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) and related diamines modify,   or fail to modify, organolithium aggregate structures and reactivity.    Structural studies with NMR will use TMEDA and related diamines  with   n-butyllithium, phenyllithium, lithium acetylides and related   organolithium derivatives.  Comparisons and competitions of diamines with   tetrahydrofuran and related ethereal ligands will ascertain the   circumstances under  which  the ethers bind competitively or   cooperatively to organolithiums.  Quantitative ligand binding studies   will establish thermochemical foundations for subsequent rate studies.   Rate data for representative reactions of diamine-solvated organolithium   derivatives, in the context of well-established solution structure   assignments, will afford insights into the solvation and aggregation   events proceeding to the rate limiting transition structures.  Dissection   of solvation effects into ground state and transition state contributions   will be central to an understanding of TMEDA's role in organolithium   chemistry.  With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular   Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. David B. Collum of   the Department of Chemistry at Cornell University.  Professor Collum will   focus his work on challenging the existing notions on how   N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) and related diamines   influence organolithium structures and reactivities.  The research has   substantial implications for organic synthesis due to the wide spread use   of organolithium reagents.",
