 "awd_abstract_narration": "Causal induction, the process of identifying causes for events, plays a central role in everyday life as well as in science.  The goal of this project is to find out how people discover that one thing causes another, in daily life and in the laboratory.  Because relations between causes and effects are neither deducible nor directly observable, they must be induced from observable events.  Inferring causes is far from trivial; whereas effects regularly follow their causes, not all events that regularly follow one another are causally related.  Cheng recently proposed a theory of causal induction in which the reasoner explains regularity of succession (a function defined in terms of observable events) by a general notion of causal power (an unobservable theoretical entity), just as scientists explain data with theories.  Cheng's theory explains (1) the boundary conditions under which regularity implies causality and (2) a diverse set of robust psychological phenomena concerning judgments of what causes, or prevents, an effect.  In addition the theory makes many novel predictions.  The goal of the proposed research is to test these predictions against alternative accounts.  The experiments involve asking human subjects to make causal judgments when given information about the occurrence of candidate causes for an effect.  The project directly aims at gaining a deeper understanding of the process of causal induction; it indirectly aims at providing a basis for the development of an effective program for teaching scientific methodology.",
