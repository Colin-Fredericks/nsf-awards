 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726885  Reinen    It has been known for 30 years that hydrous phases subjected to  stress during dehydration at low pressures can develop a  mechanical instability leading to faulting.  This phenomenon is  considered to be the leading candidate to explain earthquakes at  depths between 30 and 300km in Earth and a possible mechanism at  all depths at which earthquakes exist.  The accepted explanation  of this phenomenon rests on the assumption that the volume of  fluid produced in such dehydration reactions is greater than the  volume of the dehydrating phase.  It is now known that at very  high pressure, the total volume produced by such reactions is  actually smaller than that of the parent phase, raising the  question as to whether this phenomenon can operate as an  earthquake mechanism at depth.  This project will utilize unique  high pressure instrumentation to conduct deformation experiments  on antigorite serpentine under pressures greater than 2.2 GPa,  physical conditions such that the total volume of the product  assemblage is smaller than that of the dehydrating phase, in  order to test whether a mechanical instability can exist under  these conditions.  It is hypothesized that under these  conditions, the primary failure unit will switch from formation  of fluid-generated tensile microcracks to formation of fluid-  generated compressive microanticracks and that the instability  will be preserved.  ***",
