 "awd_abstract_narration": "The impact of Two Year Colleges (TYCs) in the teaching of college level physics is often not appreciated. This is particularly true for students who have been historically at risk. Nationally 47% of all minority students are enrolled at TYCs. Most of the students who are trained to enter the technological workplace are trained at TYCs. Historically the opportunities for TYC faculty members to participate in professional development have been limited.    This two year program is designed to serve as a continuing model for the utilization of cooperative relationships between university professors and outstanding TYC physics faculty members working together to provide professional enrichment opportunities for TYC physics faculty members from across the United States.    The program focuses on the recent developments in physics research, innovative physics teaching methods and successful techniques for recruiting local minority students into two year college science and engineering programs. The program includes an annual May Institute at Texas A&M University, biannual academic year follow-up workshops, local projects and staff visits to the 18 participants from across the United States.",
