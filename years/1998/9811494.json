 "awd_abstract_narration": "Throughout its existence East Germany has aspired to excel in sports and science.  At its pinnacle it had achieved notoriety in sports and spying, but fell short in science.  This book will be a history of deceit--embodied by espionage--in the quest for scientific and technological excellence, and a study of the culture of technology under surveillance in East Germany.  The objective of the study is to investigate the relationship between science and espionage in order to uncover its extent, methods, sources and success for science.  The book will attempt to answer whether and to what extent espionage aided East Germany's scientific aspirations.  The approach will be mainly historical, though it will also draw on other approaches to Science and Technology Studies.  At the core will be archival research in the `Stasi` archive, the Party archive, and the Bundesarchiv (all in Berlin, and access has been arranged); plus the CIA and KGB archives.  This material will be supplemented with printed and secondary material to create an analytic narrative.  Interviews with agents and officers, viewed with appropriate skepticism, will add detail, depth and corroboration.",
