Some examples are shear flow in fluids with temperature dependent   viscosity; Hodgkin-Huxley type models of nerve bundles; and models of   the spread of disease in populations.  Because such problems are   typically highly nonlinear and exhibit complex behavior, numerical   solutions of the differential equations have become the main tool for   investigation of their properties.  However, these same qualities give   rise to some fundamental scientific questions: How can reliable and   accurate estimates of the accuracy of information computed from   numerical solutions be obtained and how can a desired range of accuracy   be achieved?  The project will address these question on three levels: theoretical analysis; implementation in code;   and application to practical problems.      The proposed approach is based on developing an a posteriori theory of error   estimation in which the error is estimated in terms of quantities   depending on the numerical solution that can be computed or   approximated. The theory will then be used to develop methods of   computational error estimation and adaptive error control. The PI will also analyze the reliability and accuracy of the  computational error estimates and, because stability has a direct impact on the accuracy of numerical solutions, the preservation of stability properties of the differential equation under discretization. Practical goals of this project include; a  publicly-accessible code for solving general reaction-diffusion problems using computational error estimation and adaptive error control, applications to the practical models like   those mentioned above,  and an educational component in the form of a   textbook on the finite element method for the basic nonlinear models of   science.",
