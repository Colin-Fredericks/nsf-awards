 "awd_abstract_narration": "A year-long integrated course of study organized around the fundamental concept of linearity and the process of linearization is being developed at the University of New Hampshire (UNH). The goals of this sequence are: 1) to unify the learning of the core ideas and techniques normally studied in a separate fashion in ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, and multivariable calculus, by captitalizing on the rich interconnections among the three subject areas, and 2) to maximize student opportunities to engage in contextual learning of these key concepts. To achieve these goals, mathematical sciences faculty are collaborating with colleagues from mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and physics, to develop \"bench-lab experiments\" for use in the classroom. These experiments are drawn from the application areas studied in many of the courses in which students are concurrently enrolled, and enable the restructuring of the normally static learning environment into a dynamic one employing a \"studio\" or laboratory approach. Teaching and learning materials based on the set of \"bench-lab\" experiments are being developed for commercial publication. Pilot testing will begin with a group of mechanical engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and applied mathematical sciences students. Full implementation of this approach is expected to impact all students in the UNH College of Engineering and Physical Sciences.",
