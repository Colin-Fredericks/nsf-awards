 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of mathematical problem solving for all students, including preservice teachers, has been well documented.  The integration of mathematics and reading is a natural way to explore the actual contexts of problems.  The main goal of this project is to enhance preservice teachers' problem solving and mathematics learning by integrating the teaching and learning of mathematics and reading in rich, authentic, contexts.      The goal of the proposed project will be accomplished by focusing on the following primary objectives: (1) coordinate curriculum offerings in three inter-related courses for preservice elementary teachers (mathematical content, mathematics methods, and reading methods); (2) create and field test new curricular materials for use in the targeted courses; (3) evaluate the completeness and appropriateness of the courses and materials developed; and (4) disseminate the curriculum materials to teacher education faculty locally, regionally, and nationally.     This development work will be supported by collaboration with the NSF-funded Oklahoma Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation, known as \"O-TEC,\" and the principal investigator of that project, Dr. Robert Howard.   This collaboration will ensure that the development work in this project is fully aligned with the goals and needs of O-TEC and will also assist in the dissemination and implementation of the projects products.        Under this proposal, a series of \"rich problem solving contexts\" will be developed and field tested under the guidance of an outside evaluator.  Briefly, this will be an inter-related set of mathematical ideas and educational activities designed to build a full context for meaningful learning.  It is anticipated that the proposed project will provide valuable data which will have important implications for the design of reading and mathematics curricula for preservice teachers.  The resulting curriculum materials will be disseminated through a variety of media including paper presen tations, journal articles, and a professional development conference which will serve as a vehicle for establishing a network for the exchange of information among teacher education faculty and other interested individuals locally, regionally, and nationally.",
