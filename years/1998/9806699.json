 "awd_abstract_narration": "9806699  Kaplan    An international symposium on silk will be held June 15-17, 1998,  at the University of Virginia.  The symposium, cofunded by the  Division of Materials Research and the Division of Molecular and  Cellular Biosciences, will focus on biophysical, bioengineering  and materials science aspects of silk-based polymers.  The  symposium will include talks on the study of silk genetics, self-  assembly of silk protein polymers, phase transitions and liquid  crystalline behavior of these polymers, evolutionary  relationships between silk-producing organisms, shear processing  of the polymers leading to fiber formation in natural and  artificial systems, new analytical methods used to elucidate  structures and functions of silks, the analysis of mechanical  properties of silk materials, and biomedical and material science  applications for engineered silk polymers.  The studies presented  will deal with aspects of the genetics of highly repetitive genes  and their divergence into multigene families, the role of  crystalline size and orientation in fibers and how this  influences mechanical properties, physiological mechanisms  involved in converting high concentrations of water soluble high  molecular weight protein polymers into aqueous insoluble  materials, and the formation and function of mesophases during  the processing of these proteins.  %%%  The study of silk polymers represents an important new paradigm  for materials science.  This new paradigm, termed biomimetics,  suggests that new insights into the design, synthesis and  assembly of materials can be gained through the understanding of  related biological processes.  This growing interface between  biology and materials science leads to an interdisciplinary  approach in order to adequately address all aspects of the field.  The talks planned for the symposium illustrate this  interdisciplinary approach, with sessions on biology, mechanical  properties, composition and characterization methods, structural  features, molecula r modeling, silk genes and protein expression,  silk transformations and processing, and applications for silks.  The interchange between materials scientists, molecular modelers,  biologists, chemists and physicists at the symposium will provide  new directions in the research and a new level of understanding  of silk-based polymers.  A total of about forty presentations  will be given at he symposium and the presentations will be  published in a new book on silk.  ***",
