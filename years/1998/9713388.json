 "awd_abstract_narration": "Keith Nelson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is supported by   the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in his continuing   investigations of large amplitude lattice vibrations using time- and   space-resolved femtosecond optical pulse-shaping techniques.  Initially,   he will focus on crystals that undergo structural phase transitions, in   particular the switching among different ferroelectric phases.  In   addition, he will look at semiconducting materials whose bandgaps may be   influenced and perhaps closed by optically induced large-amplitude   coherent lattice vibrations.  Nelson also plans to examine the behavior   of molecular crystals in which the optical pulses induce motion along   reaction coordinates to affect crystalline chemical reactions.  He will   investigate both bulk and thin film perovskites to study structural phase   transitions and phonon-polariton cavities; diacetylene, perylene and   pyrene to study molecular crystals; and Ti2O3 and GeTe as semiconductors.    Prof. Nelson has demonstrated that significant nuclear displacements can   be induced in molecular crystals using high energy pulses.  In addition,   if the wavelength is long enough, damage to the crystal is minimized.  In   these studies Nelson will investigate alternative strategies for   achieving large nuclear displacements and what types of effects the   molecular properties have on the optimum strategy.    Prof. Nelson will apply techniques developed in his laboratory that   exploit femtosecond optical pulses to a wide variety of materials such as   ferroelectric crystals and small gap semiconductors, in order to   determine if it is possible to effect a chemical change.  In addition to   the direct advances this work will likely offer to the fields of lattice   spectroscopy and optical control of molecular processes, it can be   anticipated that the planned research will be of technological interest   and utility to designers of prototype devices for optical switching and   information transmittal.",
