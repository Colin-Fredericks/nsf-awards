 "awd_abstract_narration": "9873586 Sahinidis Refrigeration technology must eliminate the need for chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants (CFCs) and their substitutes if depletion of stratospheric ozone and global warming are to be prevented.  The objective of this research is to develop a systematic methodology or the design of environmentally benign alternative refrigerants.  Towards this goal, the researchers plan to (1) develop a mathematical model which selects the atomic composition of a refrigerant or refrigerant mixture in such a way that environmental and chemical constraints are satisfied while the energy efficiency and total warming impact of the refrigerant life-cycles are optimized, (2) devise an algorithmic procedure to solve the above model in a way that overcomes the combinatorial difficulty of the problem as well as difficulties associated with inaccuracies in property prediction estimation techniques, (3) establish a computational/experimental system for verifying, testing and implementing the theoretical models and algorithmic methods and (4) seek experimental verification of the theoretical findings through laboratory synthesis and testing of the newly designed compounds.  The research will emphasize the interdisciplinary interaction of ideas from atmospheric chemistry, process and solution thermodynamics, process and product design and operations research (discrete and nonlinear optimization theory).  Preliminary results demonstrate that the proposed approach carries a high probability of success.  In particular, a novel replacement of Freon 12 has been developed that possesses thermodynamic properties that render it more efficient than Freon 12 in the context of a typical refrigeration cycle.  This grant is made pursuant to the joint NSF/Lucent Technologies Industrial Ecology Research Fellowships Program 1998. ***",
