 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent developments in three-dimensional digitizing hardware and software make it possible, practical, and economical to scan and archive complex-shaped objects, including a range of skeletal elements from a variety of large and small-sized species, into a digital library for study and research.  Making anatomical materials, including elements from species commonly used in education and rare or even endangered species, widely available has far-reaching implications for research and for education from grade school through graduate school. This project will begin the creation of such a library, starting with chimpanzees and baboons and using both low and high resolution technologies.  It will also design and implement a discovery interface that will provide an interactive framework for investigation that will benefit both beginning and advanced users.  The project builds on work at the University of Texas, Austin including  the course  Introduction to Physical Anthropology and Human Evolution and the CD-ROM Virtual Laboratories for Physical Anthropology.\r\n",
