 "awd_abstract_narration": "Morse theory and catastrophe theory provide powerful models of  the neighborhood of a critical point of a real function. Under  suitable conditions these models are in fact capable of  discerning the topological type of the domain of the function.  This project extends software that finds and tracks critical  points to guarantee the topological type of an implicit surface  polygonization, and applies it to other areas of computer  graphics. These techniques can solve a variety of currently  open problems of computer graphics.    The most immediate application is a topologically-correct  implicit curve parameterization. The techniques can aid in the  visualization of complicated manifold immersions by providing the  ability to switch between surface renderings and 2-D slices on  and between Morse critical values of a height function. The  techniques can maintain the topological type of a shape during  transformation, such that for example the intermediate shapes in  the transformation of a donut into a coffee cup all consist of a  single component with one hole. Modeling the neighborhood of a  critical point should also aid in maintaining a consistent  texture mapping across a change of genus.  Incorporating critical  points in a data compression algorithm yields a data  compression that avoids errors that alter the topological type of  the reconstructed data. Similar techniques can insure that the  simplification of complex geometry for faster display does not  sacrifice the qualitative nature of its topological type.  Finally, the application of catastrophe theory to global  illumination will yield a faster algorithm for determining  regions of caustic reflection.",
