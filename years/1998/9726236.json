 "awd_abstract_narration": "Powell  9726236    Understanding the forces that have shaped the basic genetic material, DNA, has important implications not only for understanding how evolution has occurred, but also in understanding how organisms function.  Many genes code for the amino acids that are assembled into long chains, which then form functioning proteins, including enzymes.  The DNA-based code for amino acids is redundant; i.e., there is more than one \"word\" (called a codon) for a single amino acid.  Thus, it is possible to have mutations that do not change in any way the protein product; these are called \"silent\" mutations.      It was long thought silent mutations would be invisible to detection by natural selection.  Increasing evidence is accumulating that selection can and does detect such mutations.  One piece of evidence is that certain \"words\" for an amino acid are used more frequently than others; this is called codon usage bias.  In unicellular organisms (bacteria and yeast), it is known that this uneven usage of codons happens because the molecules that decode codons, tRNAs, are not in equal abundance in the cell.  Especially for genes that are expressed at a very high level, there is selection to use the codons for which there is the greatest abundance of decoding tRNA.      This hypothesis has never been tested in a multicellular eukaryote.  This proposal is the first such test employing the model organism, Drosophila.  In particular, Dr. Powell has documented that different species of Drosophila have very different codon usage bias patterns, i.e., they are biased toward different codons.  If the tRNA explanation holds for these organisms, then the tRNA pools should differ between species.  Dr. Powell will test this prediction by studying tRNA pools in different species.",
