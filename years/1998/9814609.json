 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support a workshop in the autumn of 1998 which is designed as a forum to share, disseminate and review engineering education innovations and integration with research.  Invited participants will be approximately 100 career awardees from the Civil and Mechanical Systems Division and related disciplines.  The workshop goals are to (1) foster technical and intellectual exchange about education amount career investigators; (2) bring innovative teaching methods to the fore, especially as applied to the incorporation of research in engineering education by providing a forum for dissemination of education plans implement by CAREER awardees; and, (3) foster and document discussions of how the successful integration of engineering education and research can be facilitated by academic institutions, federal funding agencies, and industry.  The workshop organizers include five awardees from CAREER competitions in the CMS Division.  They will plan the workshop agenda, invite speakers and develop interactive sessions, and prepare proceedings from the workshop.  The proceedings will (1) summarize the recommendations from working session discussions; (2) provide a workshop outcomes assessment and recommendations statement; and (3) include a two-page abstract from each participant that described key aspects of their research and education activities and innovations.  Finally, the document will include an assessment of the state-of-the-practice in engineering education, and the role of the CAREER program as a catalyst of change.  The workshop participants and other engineering educators will continue their dialogue on integration of research and education though a web-based discussion group.",
