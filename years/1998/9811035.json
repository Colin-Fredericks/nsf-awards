 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collins  9811035  Repeated measurements will be conducted to study the effect  of the 1997/98 El  Nino event on the hydrography and velocity fields off  Central California.  The  observations will enhance the temporal coverage of quarterly  cruises (1/98,  5/98, 7/98 and 11/98) funded by the Naval Postgraduate  School and the Naval  Oceanographic Office to monthly in the spring and bi-monthly  in the summer.  The main objectives of the work are to determine whether the  observed warming  of the surface waters is due to onshore advection of fresh  water or poleward flow  of saltier water and whether the oceanographic response is  locally or remotely  forced. The proposed measurements would complement similar  projects  scheduled to occupy off-shore transects from Baja California  to Washington  State. The CalCOFI (California Cooperative Oceanic  Fisheries) line #67 that the  PI proposes to sample in the Spring/Summer of 1998 has been  extensively  sampled since 1949 which would provide an accurate  description of the  climatology of the eastern boundary current system as well  as comparisons of  the oceanic response for the most recent El Ninos. The  processed data will be  made available on a web page for use by other scientists.",
