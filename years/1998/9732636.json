The following topics are addressed:\r\n\r\n\tConstruction of a general theory of symmetry reduction in relativistic field theories.\r\n\r\n\tInvestigation of the status of unitary dynamical evolution of quantum fields along arbitrary foliations of a fixed spacetime.\r\n\r\n\tCompletion of a general theory of local cohomology (p-form conservation laws) which is tailored to relativistic field theory, including development of computational tools and detailed applications to the Einstein equations.\r\n\r\n\tInvestigation of the status of curvature scalars as privileged canonical variables representing \"many-fingered time\" in the Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity.\r\n\r\n\tFurther development and applications of a new approach to asymptotic conversation laws in gravitational field theory.\r\n\r\n\tFurther development and applications of a parametrization of the jet space of vacuum metrics.\r\n\r\n\tRigorous treatment of Dirac constraint quantization of spacetimes admitting two commuting Killing vector fields using the techniques of parametrized field theory.\r\n\r\n\tDevelopment of a theory of path integrals in quantum gravity based upon results obtained using Ashtekar variables and canonical quantization.\r\n\r\nThe goal of work on these topics is to improve the state of knowledge regarding general relativity, gravitation, and quantum mechanics as well as the interaction of these branches of physics.\r\n***\r\n",
