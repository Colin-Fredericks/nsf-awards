 "awd_abstract_narration": "University of Wisconsin, Madison   The proposed research represents a theoretical and philosophical investigation of the concept of geographical judgement, divided into instrumental judgement (the usefulness of places for completing social projects; projects of geographical practice) and intrinsic judgement (the clarity of insight into the world that is afforded by geography as a science). The tensions between these are investigated with case studies of selected places, and conclusions about moral reasoning in geography will be drawn. Building on his previous work, the PI wishes to develop and operationalize a reconceptualized notion of `place` in relation to processes of judgement.",
