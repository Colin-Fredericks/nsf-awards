 "awd_abstract_narration": "A substantial body of work by a number of researchers has been done in program animation, algorithm animation, and computer science concept animation that could be used as the basis for laboratories in the lower-level undergraduate computer science curriculum. In spite of the impressive nature of this work, however, it has been slow to be adopted for one primary reason: the animation software runs only on specific computer platforms with specific operating system support. To solve this problem, work has begun by various researchers on adapting computer science animation systems to the World Wide Web using HTML and Java. The project of this proposal, called WebLab, will combine work done by the PI in computer science animation into a model laboratory curriculum that is animated, dynamic, interactive, and usable by virtually any computer science program. All that will be needed is a computing environment that supports a Java-ready browser, such as Netscape. The WebLab project will result in an infrastructure for introductory computer science laboratories. The Web-based infrastructure will consist of a set of laboratory exercises along with a user interface supporting animation that is based on HTML and Java, a Pascal program animator developed over the past number of years by the PI, an animator for a more modern programming language (C/C++), and a set of computer science concept animations (work already in progress by the PI). Algorithm animations developed by other researchers will also be incorporated into WebLab, making WebLab a comprehensive laboratory environment. Since WebLab will be developed around HTML and Java, it will be available incrementally over the Web as the project progresses. Final versions of WebLab will be available via the Web as well as in self-contained CD-ROM form for distribution with textbooks and lab manuals. The universal nature of the World Wide Web will ensure that WebLab is widely disseminated and used.",
