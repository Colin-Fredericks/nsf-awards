 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Shodor computational Science Institute is a series of workshops, seminars, and support activities to introduce the authentic use of numerical models across the undergraduate curriculum.  The SCSI project will enable teams of mathematics, science, and computer science faculty at small to medium sized colleges to work together, to enhance their professional standing through the use of technology and the wider use of mathematical modeling and the tools of computations science within a truly interdisciplinary approach.  This focus on modeling will enable these faculty to learn how to do computational science and how to teach computational science in engaging and enriching interactive environments incorporating the same tools, techniques, and technologies which characterize the modern practice of science and engineering.  During a series of workshops and follow-on activities, participants progress from finding and assessing models, to running other people's models, to modifying these models, to ultimately writing their own.  At each stage, the faculty grow to understand the importance of challenging the model and its numerical implementations, asking themselves and their students, \"How do we know if it is right?\"  The project includes a series of campus visits, a series of three, intensive, one-week, interdisciplinary summer workshops which cover the principles and practices of computational science at the introductory, intermediate, and advanced levels, and seminars and modeling-based activities back at the home institutions.  continuous support and follow-up, materials development, access to HPCC and visualization resources, and evaluation are coordinated and enabled by using collaborative tools and electronic networks.",
