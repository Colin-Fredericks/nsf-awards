The  materials to be studied are  various  polytypes  of  group  VB  transition-metal dichalcogenides MX2, where M=Nb,Ta,V,  and  X=S,Se.  These  materials have strong  quasi-two-dimensional  (2D) character and relatively simple crystal structures, and  yet  exhibit  very  rich  physical properties.  A  variety  of  charge  density  waves  (CDW's) have been discovered in these  materials.  The  mechanisms of the CDW's in quasi-2D and 1D systems  are  not  well  understood  and  are  of current interest.  The  electronic  structure near the Fermi energy plays a central role in  the  CDW  formations  and  other physical properties. The energy  bands  of  these  materials near the Fermi energy involve metal  d-electrons  and are governed by strong electron-electron correlation. In this  project, the detailed electronic structure near the Fermi energy,  such as the band dispersions and the Fermi surface topologies  in  the  normal state, and the momentum dependence of  the energy gap  in  the CDW state, will be thoroughly investigated. These studies  are  timely  because of the current interest in highly correlated  electron  systems, and the availability of ultra-high  resolution  (energy  resolution better than 8 meV, angular resolution  better  than  0.5  degrees) ARPES facilities. Much of the  work  will  be  carried out at the NSF-supported Synchrotron Radiation Center  at  Stoughton,  WI.  This  work is expected  to  advance  fundamental  understanding of the CDW mechanisms, and the electronic structure  in  high  correlated electron systems. More broadly, the  results  from  this  basic  investigation  may  include  fundamental   new  phys ical  effects  and  also may provide  insight  into  electron  behavior in other systems including semiconductor microelectronic  devices.  This highly interdisciplinary project involves graduate  students who pursue thesis research at both laboratory locations,  and  receive excellent training beneficial to a future career  in  industry, government or academia.  %%%  This experimental research project uses the most advanced methods  of surface physics to clarify the electronic band structure of  a  class  of  layered  materials. These  materials  to  be  sutdied,  including  tantallum diselenide, are important because  they  are  model  systems  of  nearly-two-dimensional  form,  which  exhibit  electronic phase transitions to correlated electron states  known  as  Charge  Density Waves (CDW's). The research  is  intended  to  clarify  why  these phase transitions occur, as  related  to  the  electron  bands in the compounds. The electron bands  essentially  define   electrical  properties  of  semiconductors  and  metals,  including such properties as electrical resistance, the speed  of  carriers  in  an applied electric field (the mobility,  which  is  very  important in making transistors with excellent performance)  and  others.  Electronic band structure in this project  will  be  studied    in   detail   using   state-of-the-art   photoemission  techniques.  In  this experiment, monochromatic light  of  chosen  wavelength  and direction falls on the sample, and leads  to  the  emission of specific electrons, which must have the right energy,  speed,  and direction in the material. These three properties  of  the  emitted  electrons are measured. Systematic measurements  of  this  type  are  the best experimental method of determining  the  electron   band  structure,  which  as  mentioned,  governs   the  electrical properties. The most advanced experiments of this type  are  carried  out a synchrotron light sources such  as  the  NSF-  supported  Synchrotron Radiation Center at Stoughto n,  WI,  where  this  project  will  be active. Synchrotron  sources,  which  are  related  to  high energy physics accelerators such as cyclotrons,  provide extremely intense beams of light including light of  very  short  wavelengths.The results from this basic investigation  may  include  fundamental new physical effects and  also  may  provide  insight   into  electron  behavior  in  other  systems  including  semiconductor     microelectronic    devices.     This     highly  interdisciplinary project involves graduate students  who  pursue  thesis   research  at  both  laboratory  locations,  and  receive  excellent  training  beneficial to a future career  in  industry,  government or academia.  ***",
