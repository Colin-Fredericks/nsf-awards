 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on thermally and photochemically induced electron   transfer and electrophilic addition reactions in solid matrices.   X-ray   diffraction analysis of donor-acceptor doped solid matrices will be used   to correlate matrix structure and its changes with dopant reactivity in   order to develop a database useful in achieving reaction control,   enhancing charge separation, and increasing reaction product lifetime.     Correlating solid state structural changes with observed reactivity   offers graduate and postdoctoral students a unique opportunity to become   familiar with modern fast reaction and structural analysis techniques.  With this Renewal, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   supports Professor Kochi's studies of donor-acceptor reactivity in solid   matrices.   Professor Kochi will focus his research on correlating the   structural changes that occur in the matrix with donor-acceptor   reactivity and product stability in order to develop the database needed   to utilize the host matrix as a means to control reactivity in the solid   state.   Graduate and postdoctoral students carrying out the experiments   will gain experience in modern fast reaction techniques and x-ray   structural analysis.                                                                           / \u00a5\u255d\u00c1_\u00c1>\u2524?\u2510\u00a2 \u2563_\u2551/\u2502\u00a5 \u2563> ?\u2510\u255d /\u2593\u2563%\u2563\u00a5` \u00a5? _/>\u2563\u2551\u2510%/\u00a5\u00c1   \u2502\u00a9\u00c1_\u2563\u2502/% _/\u00a5\u00a5\u00c1\u255d />\u2524 \u2502\u00a9\u00c1_\u2563\u2502/% \u255d\u00c1/\u2502\u00a5\u2563?>\u00a2",
