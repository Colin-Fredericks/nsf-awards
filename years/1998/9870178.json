Bivariate and trivariate splines of smoothness r and degree d, will be studied more carefully to enhance their computational efficiency which is essential for applications in computer aided geometric design (CAGD) and numerical solutions of partial differential equations (PDE).     The PI will identify the best spline spaces for these applications in the   bivariate setting, comparing the dimension of all spline spaces of a fixed   smoothness, the number of triangles of  their underlying triangulations and   their approximation power.  The PI will implement these best spline spaces   when r=1 and r=2 for typical applications in CAGD and numerical solution   of PDE's, e.g., scattered data fitting, filling polygonal holes,  numerical   solutions of linear and nonlinear biharmonic equations. The PI will study   the construction of compactly supported orthonormal wavelets under H1 norm    using bivariate splines so that the numerical solution of the standard   elliptic equations can be solved without inverting the linear systems.   Furthermore, the PI will also study the trivariate spline spaces and identify   the best one for the application in numerical solutions of 3D  partial differential equations, in particular 3D Navier-Stokes equations.  Once the best spline space for r=1 is identified, the PI will implement  it for numerical solution of PDE's in the trivariate setting.   When computing with these splines, multi-level and domain decomposition   methods will be employed to improve the performance of the computation.",
