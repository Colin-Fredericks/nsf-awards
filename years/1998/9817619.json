 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the continued commitment by NSF and ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers) to increase the number of women, minorities, and other under-represented groups entering the civil engineering professions.  The requested budget is primarily for speaker travel costs to the workshop, which will be held in conjunction with the ASCE National meeting in Boston in October, 1998.  Requested funds also support dissemination of conclusions.    The primary objectives of the workshop are:  1) to promote discussion about the current barriers limiting under-represented groups from entering and completing engineering programs; 2) to disseminate successful practices related to retention and recruitment to a broad audience of civil engineering educators and administrators; 3) to learn from experts how to best apply retention and recruitment practices at the university level; 4) to create an environment that promotes discussion, networking, and brainstorming; and 5) to provide a forum that enables practitioners, students, faculty, and administrators to share their ideas freely.",
