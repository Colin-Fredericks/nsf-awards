 "awd_abstract_narration": "9807740  Farley   The Coast Mountains of British Columbia are central to two scientific questions concerning how an oblique convergent margin operates.  These involve the extent and rate of along-orogen transport of  terranes and uplift and erosion of attached blocks.  Paleomagnetic results indicating long-distance along-orogen transport are ambiguous because the plutons that were used for these data may have been tilted.  Part of this project will test for tilting using new techniques of low-temperature closure age methods.  These and associated structural data will also address the amount and rate of tectonic uplift in this nearly strike-slip end member of oblique collisional circumstances.  The work will benefit from and will complement geological and geophysical study along the ACCRETE transect.  Results are expected to help resolve the degree of northward transport of terranes along the western coast of North America and the uplift associated with oblique collision.",
