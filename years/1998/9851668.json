 "awd_abstract_narration": "A microcomputer-based laboratory is being used to introduce an inquiry-based curriculum into the general physics sequence. The student population of the course is approximately half science majors and half secondary education majors. While one of the motivations for the project is to improve the all of the students' understanding of basic physics by using and adapting the well tested Workshop Physics curriculum, there is a particular focus on the pre-service secondary teachers in the course. This focus consists of having \"alumni\" of the general physics sequence return as peer instructors in both the workshop physics course and the conceptual physics course designed for non-majors. This is being done by having the physics and secondary education faculty work together to effect program changes that would require the secondary education students to have this teaching experience as an internship that would count towards their degree in education. The goals are to further improve the understanding of physics of these science teachers-to-be and to give them some practical experience with an inquiry-based physics curriculum.",
