 "awd_abstract_narration": "***   9760865  Jones    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address contamination in environments surrounding sites of petroleum exploration, production, refinement, and storage.    Bioremediation techniques have been used to remove hazardous chemicals from the environment; however, monitoring these sites is hindered by expensive and time consuming techniques required to obtain necessary sensitivity and specificity.  For example, gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GCMS), capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) have been used to monitor environmental exposure, and various methods of microbial activity and biomass assays have been used to monitor remediation processes.  GCIMS, CZE, and HPLC require expensive instrumentation, extensive operator expertise, and laboratory analysis removed from the site of contamination.  Microbial activity or biomass assays are time consuming, and specificity for the microbe of interest is not reliable.  Phase I will explore a novel optical fiber sensor that has the potential for environmental monitoring in areas of petroleum activity and its in a chemical and biological sensing platform.    Biological and chemical sensors are expected to yield high-resolution, low-cost, multi-target systems for applications in 1) environmental monitoring, 2) drinking and wastewater monitoring, 3) large scale, high-speed testing in the medical field, 4) chemical analysis, and 5) intelligent monitoring of advanced materials processing.  ***",
