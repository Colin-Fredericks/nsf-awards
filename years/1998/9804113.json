 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804113  This research addresses two important problems in the design of  large and complex distributed software systems, namely: a) the  need to increase the reusability of software components by  reducing, or in some cases, eliminating their dependency on  interconnection patterns, and b) the need to establish confidence  that the final architecture will meet performance requirements by  the proper selection of interconnection patterns between atomic  components and aggregate components. More specifically, the  project focuses on the design of a language to describe the  architectural and performance characteristics of  components, connectors, and patterns of interconnected components  as architectural building blocks; the composition of patterns and  target system architectures from the building blocks; and  constraints on the composition of patterns and target system  architectures. This research also addresses developing a method  for mapping a target system to an analytic performance model used  to predict the performance of the target systems under various  workload intensity situations. By characterizing the performance  of components and their interactions, the overall performance of  the target system can be estimated. The biggest impact of this  research is in advancing the methods and software technology  needed to reduce the costs and risks in the software development  of large and complex distributed software systems.***",
