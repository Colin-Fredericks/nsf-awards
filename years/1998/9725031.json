This series of international conferences has   brought together statisticians and climatologists for both formal   and informal discussions of problems and statistical methods for  addressing them.  There are two invited lectures per day, each   with discussions by both statisticians and climatologists.    This format promotes cross-disciplinary interactions and  collaborations.  Many of the leading issues in climatology are   related to general circulation models.  The major problem of interest  is in comparing model runs to historical data, which have varying   spatial and temporal coverage, varying instrumentation, and very   different precision.  These models are used to assess the effect of  various anthropogenic influences on the climate, such as changing   composition of various greenhouse gasses.  Important topics to be  discussed at this conference are the statistical techniques such as  hiden Markov models, wavelet methods, and neural networks that can   be used in developing useful models.    This award is in support of expenses of participants from the United  States. A large portion of the grant will go towards expenses of   graduate students, new researchers, and members of underrepresented  groups.",
