 "awd_abstract_narration": "The planned work investigates the predictive power of two \r\nsimple continuum models in condensed matter physics. Do the\r\nmodels predict the formation of certain spatial pattern in an\r\norder parameter, patterns which are experimentally observed \r\nin special regimes?  The two considered models are \r\na) the micromagnetic model and b) a model for quasi-stationary \r\nflow of a mixture of two incompressible fluids of\r\ndifferent viscosity, a flow driven by slowly changing forces on each\r\ncomponent.  In case of model a), the objective is to identify a\r\nregime of the physical parameters in which the model reproduces \r\nthe characteristic domain and wall pattern \r\nof the magnetization which is observed in a ferromagnet \r\nwith a thin film geometry.  In case of model b), the objective \r\nis to inquire if it explains the creation and self-similar \r\ncoarsening of sponge-like pattern, which are formed by \r\nthe concentration of the polymer phase during spinodal decomposition\r\nof a mixture of polymer and water.  Mathematically speaking, \r\nmodel a) comes in the form of a non-convex, non-local minimization problem \r\nin the magnetization.  Model b) comes in the form of a partial \r\ndifferential equation of gradient flux type, which evolves the \r\npolymer concentration in time.  For model a), the mathematical goal is to \r\ncharacterize variational limits of minimizers in the targeted \r\nparameter limit. Rigorous proofs will be given. \r\nModel b) actually is a modification of the model proposed by\r\nthe experimentalists. The goal is to show that the modification\r\nis necessary to reproduce their observations at least qualitatively.\r\nA combination of asymptotic analysis and numerical simulation will\r\nbe employed.\r\n\r\nModeling certain phenomena is the key to control them - and to make\r\nuse of them. A good model is both simple and of high predictive power.\r\nModels in sciences and engineering usually are cast in mathematical language,\r\nand making prediction with the model then amounts to solving a mathematical problem.\r\nThe goal of this work is to use modern mathematics for two specific\r\nmodels in order to assess the quality of a model's predictions and\r\nto improve the models.  The first model describes \r\nthe behavior of magnetic thin films such as coatings in magnetic recording media.\r\nThe goal is a better understanding of the size and shape of micromagnetization \r\npatterns.  This is a major factor in the storage capacity of such media.  \r\nThe second model describes the behavior of polymer-water mixtures over time. \r\nSuch mixtures are used in polymer processing and are ubiquitous in \r\nbiochemistry.  The goal is to understand the patterns that often \r\nform during the polymer concentration process. The new tool at our disposal \r\nis a powerful computer, which allows to solve the mathematical problem \r\nbehind the model numerically. Implementing a mathematical problem on the \r\ncomputer is delicate and requires a good theoretical understanding of the \r\nproblem. Modern tools in mathematical analysis have become indispensible \r\nfor this task and will be used in conjunction with numerical calculations \r\nfor the planned work. \r\n  \r\n",
