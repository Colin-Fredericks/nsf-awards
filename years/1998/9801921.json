It is a joint experimental/theoretical study  of  the  physics  of  vortices in low and high Tc thin  films  subject  to  artificial  pinning.  The pinning structure is  engineered  using  state-or-the-art lithography processes. Pinning structures  under  study  include regular and weakly disordered arrays  of  \"holes\",  and/or  \"stripes\"  made  of  normal or  magnetic  materials.  The  pinning  characteristics of these arrays over  a  wide  range  of  temperature, field and materials parameters will be characterized  by  transport,  noise,  and  direct imaging  measurements.  Novel  pinning  patterns will be used to expand the pinned  phase  to  a  broad  range  of  magnetic fields, beyond  the  nominal  matching  field,  to enhance vortex pinning. They also provide new  \"media\"  in which a variety of new and interesting vortex phenomena can be  studied.  Theory  is  an  inherent  part  of  the  project.   New  fabrication methods and devices will be developed using state  of  the  art thin film techniques together with forefront lithography  processes. This research program is interdisciplinary  in  nature  and  involves several pre- and post-graduate researchers  in  its  activities. They will become familiar with research equipment and  methods applicable to condensed matter physics, microelectronics,  magnetic  recording  and  sensors, and  superconducitng  devices.  Their  training  will  be excellent preparation  for  careers  in  industry, government laboratories or academia.  %%%  This  experimental  basic  research  project  is  concerned  with  increasing the current carrying capacity of superconducting  thin  films. The \"critical\" current of a superconductor in the presence  of  a magnetic field is influenced by \"pinning centers\" which act  as anchors fo r the magnetic flux lines (vortices) which penetrate  the  thin  film.  The  critical  current  can  be  increased   by  increasing the pinning. This study investigates vortex pinning in  thin film superconductors by controlled pinning structures. It is  a joint experimental/theoretical study of the physics of vortices  in  low and high Tc thin films subject to artificial pinning. The  pinning    structure   is   engineered   using   state-or-the-art  lithography  processes.
