Recognizing the need to actively involve students in their own learning, the College has interwoven and incorporated this ideal into the fabric of teaching science at the institution.  Having a strong record of supporting the integration of teaching and research, Oberlin is now prepared to extend institutionalized initiatives that integrate discovery-rich learning into all levels of the curriculum for majors and general audiences. Oberlin devotes considerable efforts to assessment, and has developed an assessment model that provides accountability at the level of institution, department and individual faculty members.  \r\n\r\nThe College has identified student outcome goals, which confirms the institution's mission to help students develop: proficiency in a discipline; the ability to formulate and present an argument through effective writing; the ability to formulate and present an argument through quantitative and analytical reasoning; the ability to integrate knowledge across disciplinary boundaries; and appreciate various interdisciplinary perspectives, and cultural, linguistic, gender, and ethnic perspectives.\r\n\r\nOberlin College is being awarded  $500,000 to advance institutional goals of integrating research and education, document and disseminate information of its exemplary activities, and expand the integration of research and education by conducting outreach activities over the coming three years.  To broaden its evaluation efforts and assist other institutions with integration of research and education activities, the College plans to establish a Committee for Integrating Research and Teaching (CIRT).  CIRT will unite two major components of Oberlin's educational mission, providing students with a rigorous academic foundation, as they develop community awareness and social responsibility. \r\n\r\n",
