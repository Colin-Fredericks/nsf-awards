In particular, he continues his work\r\nconcerning the existence and the classification (up to concordance) of\r\nmetrics of positive scalar curvature.  Some of his earlier work shows\r\nthat these questions boil down to determining an abelian group R that\r\ndepends only on the dimension of the manifold M under consideration,\r\nits fundamental group, and its first and second Stiefel-Whitney classes\r\n(e.g., this group acts freely and a transitively on the set of positive\r\nscalar curvature metrics on M).  The role of R is reminiscent of the role\r\nof Wall's surgery obstruction group in the classification of manifolds up\r\nto diffeomorphisms.  The investigator hopes to show that a periodic\r\nversion of R contains as a direct summand the K-Theory of a C*-algebra\r\nassociated to the data.  He hopes to find invariants for the `non-periodic'\r\npart of R by exploiting the minimal hypersurface method for studying\r\npositive scalar curvature metrics.  Concerning other types of curvature,\r\nthe investigator is pursuing his conjecture that the existence of a\r\nmetric of positive Ricci curvature on a spin manifold M with vanishing\r\nfirst Pontryagin class implies that the Witten genus of M is zero.  He\r\nhopes to prove this conjecture by constructing a Dirac type operator on\r\nthe free loop space of M and analysing its Weitzenbock formula.\r\n     Relating geometric features of a manifold M to its topology is the\r\ncentral problem in global geometry.  Here `geometric' refers to\r\nquantitative features of the manifold; e.g., the scalar curvature that\r\nassociates a real number s(x) to any point x in M; this number is a\r\nmeasure for how the volume of small balls around x compares to the\r\nvolume of a ball of the same radius in Euclidean space.  The `topology'\r\nof M captures the qualitative features (like the number of holes);\r\nthese don't change when M is `deformed' (think of squeezing a balloon).\r\nOften, as in the case of scalar curvature, the basic connection between\r\nthe geometry and the topology of a manifold is made by studying\r\ndifferential equations on M.  It is an exciting possibility that new\r\nrelations between the geometry and the topology of M might be obtained\r\nby studying similar differential equations on the infinite dimensional\r\nspace of loops in M; this makes contact with stochastic analysis and\r\nwith physics (`string theory').\r\n***\r\n",
