 "awd_abstract_narration": "Existing restructuring compilers have been successful in  detecting the parallelism of regular programs, i.e., codes  with relatively simple access patterns that are  statically (compile time) defined, by using current  dependence tests and symbolic methods. Unfortunately, for  more than 50% of programs the access pattern are either very  complex or are completely undefined before execution.  Examples of such \"cycle consuming\" applications are SPICE,  DYNA-3D, GAUSSIAN, DMOL, CHARMM and FIDAP. As modeling  techniques become more sophisticated, future large scale  simulations will be mostly dynamic in nature, thus  increasing the fraction of statically non-analyzable codes  and therefore effectively decreasing the coverage of current  compiler technology. Sparse, dynamic programs are  fundamentally intractable through classic compile-time  analysis techniques making parallelization or other  optimizations impossible. This work will extend the coverage  of current technology to dynamic programs by creating a  framework that will complement  static compilation  with run--time  analysis and optimization techniques.  Application level programmable hardware for the acceleration  of certain simple, repetitive operations will also be  studied. Finally, an adaptive strategy in which static and  run-time methods will be connected in an adaptive loop with  hardware and software performance monitors and statistical  databases will tune the application to its data during  execution.",
