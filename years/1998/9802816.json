The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and  experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Mark B. Edlund of the University of Michigan to  work with Dr. Ts. Jamsran at Mongolian State University in  Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia as well at the University of Michigan  with Dr. Eugene Stoermer on biatom diversity and training in  Lake Hovsgol National Park.  Partial support is being  provided by the East Asia-Pacific Program in the Division of  International Programs.    Dr. Edlund will study a component of the algal flora of Lake  Hovsgol, completing a floristic survey, and create an  herbarium of diatoms (single cell microscopic algae) and a  reference collection.  Lake Hovsgol is an ancient ecosystem  in a tectonic basin.  Lakes such as Hovsgol have existed for  millions of years and are natural laboratories for the study  of ecology and evolution.  It has been named Mongolia's  first International Long-Term Ecological Research site  (LTER).  Because this site is at risk ecologically, it is  important to document its diversity.  In addition to  performing this documentation, Dr. Edlund will be working  with Mongolian scientists, helping to train and prepare them  for future research collaborations with the United States.  ***",
