 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, which is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and   Organometallic Chemistry program, Dr. Richard Eisenberg of the University   of Rochester will continue his studies on the chemistry of platinum group   element complexes relating to homogeneous catalysis and bond activation.    Part one of the project is a continuation of mechanistic studies   involving applications of parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) to new   organometallic systems.  This method can permit the detection of new   hydride intermediates and may help elucidate the mechanism of hydrogen   addition.  The activation of hydrogen by oxidative addition to a variety   of metal centers will be investigated,  including  rhodium and iridium   complexes capable of  intramolecular C-H and C-C activation and   tantalocene hydrides.  The addition of hydrogen to metal-nonmetal   multiple bonds contained in alkylidene, alkylidyne, imido and sulfido   complexes will also be studied in an effort to provide proof for a   concerted 4-center addition.  Catalytic reactions that will be   investigated by PHIP include asymmetric hydrogenation and   hydroformylation.  Part two of the project focuses on the bond activation   and catalytic reactions of organometallic systems that exhibit   electrophilic or radical character.  Cationic diphosphine complexes of   Ir(III) and complexes with specifically designed tetradentate ligands   will be synthesized.  These complexes will have two adjacent labile sites   for substrate binding, activation, and coupling.   Related electrophilic   complexes of Pt and Pd with new diimine and diamine ligands will also be   studied.  These and related complexes will be screened for reactivity in   reactions that include H/D exchange, isomerizations, C-H bond activation,   and olefin polymerizataion.  Bond activation by odd electron complexes   will be studied with new d7 Rh(II) and Ir(II) Schiff base complexes that   contain tetradentate N and S donor ligands.   The metalloradical   reactions that will be studied most extensively are those involving C-H   activation of methane, toluene, alkanes, and zylenes, and radical driven   polymerizations.    A program of research on the chemistry of platinum group element   compounds relating to homogeneous catalysis and bond activation will be   conducted.  Platinum group element complexes include the most widely used   catalysts in industry today, and developments in the past decade,   particularly with regard to asymmetric catalysis and polymerization   catalysis, suggest that this role will increase in the future.  This   program will advance our understanding of the fundamental transformations   that take place at the metal and will help in the design of new important   catalysts for the chemical and pharmaceutical industry.",
