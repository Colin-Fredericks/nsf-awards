 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI instituted innovative teaching techniques in an elementary chemistry course called \"Chemistry and Crime: From Sherlock Holmes to Modern Forensic Science\" for the non-science major. In the lecture hall, this approach involved stimulating the student's interest in the science topic to be discussed by first discussing a crime in which the \"science\" was instrumental in its resolution. In the laboratory, the same principle manifested itself by stimulating the student's interest in conducting a series of experiments in a cohesive investigation rather than simply assigning a collection of unrelated exercises. The experiments helped the \"investigative unit\" resolve a crime to which they had been called and which scene they had processed. The \"discovery method\" used in the laboratory has received national attention and many colleagues have instituted similar innovations. However, many institutions do not have the resources to develop laboratory programs along these lines and, as times have changed, are increasingly concerned with exposing the students to situations now recognized as potentially dangerous.    Since the PI has demonstrated that forensics can be used to spark interest in science and since it is a given that young people are intrigued by computer graphics, it was decided to use computer animated simulations to allow extensive, intensive investigation of scientific evidence collected at simulated crime scenes and studied using simulated scientific instruments. With support from the NSF, a computer animated crime scene module and three computer animated instrumentation/procedure modules are under development. These will be incorporated into an interactive CD-ROM (and most like linked to the world wide web) based instructional tool. By using these modules, the student will be able to process the crime scene and collect physical evidence for later analysis. In the computer simulated crime lab, the student will be able to use the instrumentation modules to analyze the evidence. In addition  to the data generated by using the instrumentation/procedure modules, the CD will contain subroutines instructing the users in the necessary theory and background of both the instrument and the analytical method. While these modules are intended to be used as a package, they could be used individually and the animated instrumentation modules will enhance not only the laboratory program in the forensic science course but also could be used in the laboratory programs in introductory science courses for majors.    The PI will guide the development of the computer animated modules, develop the story board and oversee the computer interfacing and the integration of the components into the curriculum.     Additional support will be used for the development of additional modules for the analysis of other types of physical evidence. It is anticipated that this multimedia form of computer/world wide web based instruction, as part of an overall program including actual laboratory experience, will enhance science education by stimulating interest and engendering enthusiasm instead of promoting the stereotype that science is boring and hard. This project is expected to have an impact on undergraduate education because, in addition to the informative content and its visualization in space and time, the virtual laboratory components will enhance critical thinking, quantitative skills, and science writing skills.",
