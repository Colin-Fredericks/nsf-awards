 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731278   Copeland    The Technology Education Leadership Project (TELP) provides two-week leadership development workshops for 90 Maryland technology education teachers during the summers of 1998 and 1999. The workshops include technical instruction in the nine core technologies in the Maryland curriculum framework for technology education: mechanical, electrical, electronic, structural, fluid, optical, thermal, bio, and materials. The leadership workshops also include instruction in facilitative leadership, information systems, and the teaching/learning strategies used in Maryland technology education courses: investigation; modular technology activity packages; topic investigations; engineering design and development; product generation; and research and experimentation.     Four weekend institutes supplement the summer workshops during each of the three years of the project. These sessions deal with the implementation of the core technologies and the teaching/learning strategies outlined above, the use of instructional technology, standards for technology education, and the planning, delivery, and assessment of the teacher enhancement programs in each of the school districts. These weekend workshops meet in locations across the state.    During each of the second and third summers, the leadership group of master teachers provides five days of teacher enhancement activities in each of the school districts across the state. This instruction covers the core technologies, information systems, teaching/learning strategies and instructional technology.",
