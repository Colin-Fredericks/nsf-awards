 "awd_abstract_narration": "9872890\r\nRon\r\n     Advances in communication, sensing, and  computational power\r\nhave led to an explosion of data.  The size and varied formats for\r\nthese datasets challenge existing techniques for transmission,\r\nstorage,   querying, display,  and numerical manipulation,  to\r\nthe point where limits on their accessibility and portability may\r\nseverely restrict their usefulness for human knowledge.  This\r\noften leads to the paradoxical situation where experiments or\r\nnumerical computations produce rich, exquisitely detailed\r\ninformation, for which, at this point,  no adequate analysis\r\ntools exist.    In order to address this challenge, the\r\ninvestigator and his colleagues develop a new technology for data\r\nrepresentation based on the two  basic principles of   multiscale\r\ndecompositions and redundant representations.   Multiscale\r\ndecompositions arrange data into strata reflecting their relative\r\nimportance.  This allows for rapid access to good coarse\r\nresolution of the data while retaining the flexibility for\r\nincreasingly fine representations.  Redundant representations\r\nallow for a multitude of data decompositions.  While this on the\r\nsurface appears contrary to the need for efficiency, the\r\nredundancy gives the flexibility of choosing `best\r\nrepresentations'   from a unified family of representers and\r\nthereby provides efficiency and robustness.  The proposed\r\nresearch is expected to deliver major results for: (i) accurate\r\nrepresentation of image and acoustic data, (ii) parsimonious\r\nrepresentation of high dimensional data, (iii) parsimonious\r\nrepresentation of images and volumetric objects with\r\nsingularities along curves and surfaces, (iv) acceleration of\r\nscientific/engineering computations.\r\n     The KDI initiative takes place at a time when intellectual\r\nand commercial life are beginning to feel the effects of a\r\nrevolutionary combination: sensor ubiquity, computational\r\nubiquity, and internet connectivity.  A clear priority in all\r\nfields of commercial, engineering, and scientific endeavor must\r\nbe to identify and exploit the opportunities available in this\r\nnew era.  The center of the effort  should be the intensive\r\ndevelopment of new schemes for representing digitally acquired\r\ndata, and for rapidly manipulating those representations.  In\r\nfact, advances in this central area have tremendous\r\nrepercussions, accelerating progress in every other area.  For\r\nastronomers straining to detect faint gravitational signals\r\ncoming from the farthest reaches of the universe, or looking back\r\nin time to the earliest moments after creation, searching for\r\ntemperature fluctuations that would give clues about the central\r\ntheories of physics; for geophysicists looking for subtle\r\ndeformations in the earth's inner structure for clues about our\r\nseismic future; for engineers developing new medical imaging\r\ndevices;  even for Hollywood entrepreneurs wanting more realistic\r\ncomputer graphic simulations for mass entertainment -- data\r\nrepresentation plays a key role.  To this end, this project\r\nassembles a team of experts to address issues of developing new\r\ndata representations and new methods of analysis and\r\nmanipulation.  The premise of this venture is that significant\r\nadvances in data representation  require an interdisciplinary\r\neffort, meshing the skills and knowledge of theoreticians and\r\npractitioners from varied fields of research that involve large\r\ndatasets.  Thus, the proposed research team consists of\r\nmathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, and engineers\r\nwith extensive skills and experience in  the development and use\r\nof representations for datasets.  A primary component of the\r\nproject is the  set of application areas in image and signal\r\nprocessing, large scale computation, and computer graphics.  The\r\nproject produces conceptual deliverables in the form of new\r\nmethods for storing, compressing, denoising, and querying data.\r\nIt also produces concrete deliverables in the form of algorithms\r\nand software for use in the scientific and commercial sector.  The\r\nproject serves as a national center for data representation.\r\nInteraction between the project and other national and\r\ninternational centers treating datasets is cultivated.  The\r\nproject also provides a national resource for theoretical\r\nadvances, techniques of implementation, and software development.\r\n\r\n",
