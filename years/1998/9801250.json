The main theme of   this project, and also of the research of the PI over the past several   years, is to study special sets associated to solutions to differential   equations and variational problems. An important part of the study is   the investigation of the asymptotic behavior of the solutions near   these sets. The problems that the PI would continue to work on include   the geometric structure of level sets, in particular the nodal sets and   the singular sets. Such sets arise in the study of the axis of the   optical director in the Erickson model of liquid crystals. These sets   are also related to the singularities in the Ginzburg-Landau model in   the  superconductivity and in other geometric variational problems.   This study is partly motivated by the desire to understand to what   extent the solutions can be described quantitatively by polynomials or   by homogeneous solutions. These problems have a close connection with   other fields in mathematics, including several complex variables and   algebraic geometry.     The problems of the singular sets originate from  material sciences   and control theory. Singular sets, as the name suggests, are those   sets where singularities occur. Precise definitions vary according to   problems where they arise. In reality it is impossible to eliminate   the singular sets, the so-called \"bad sets\". Hence one of the central   tasks is to investigate under what condition the singular sets can be   controlled and under what condition such sets are small. Another   application involves high-performance computing, in particular   image processing. One problem is to recover the image from a distorted   copy and the difference is measured exactly by some singular sets. It   is usually expected that such sets should be small enough to be neglected.   T he problems mentioned above in the project are simplified mathematical   models. It is the hope of the investigator that the discussion of these   mathematical problems will improve the methods to control the singular   sets in various applications.",
