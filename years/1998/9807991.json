Some of these behavioral choices may involve conscious         deliberation, but others occur automatically. In vertebrate         animals, the spinal cord mediates limb movements. In some cases,         the spinal cord can select an appropriate limb movement for each of         several situations, even in the absence of inputs from the brain.         The turtle spinal cord, in particular, can appropriately select and         generate several types of hindlimb movements on its own. This makes         the turtle spinal cord an excellent \"model system\" to investigate         how \"circuits\" of nerve cells can produce an appropriate behavior         in vertebrates. The research performed under this NSF grant will         address the general question, Does the selection and generation of         movements depend mainly on the activity of individual nerve cells         that are specialized for one type of movement or instead depend         mainly on the activity of an interacting network of nerve cells,         each of which contributes to multiple types of movements? This         research will also test specific hypotheses about how the nerve         cells in the turtle spinal cord are connected to one another to         select and generate three types of a behavior termed \"scratching,\"         as well as two types of swimming. This research will contribute to         our understanding of mechanisms of behavioral choice in vertebrates         and to our understanding of the spinal cord control of limb         movements. In addition, this research will provide training to         graduate students in the design and execution of experiments         involving neurophysiology and neuroanatomy.",
