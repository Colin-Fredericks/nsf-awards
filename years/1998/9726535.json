The researchers will be exploring the  influence of natural processes and human modifications of  river channels on stream-groundwater interactions in the  hyporheic zone of mountain streams.  The overall objective  is to learn about controls on the extent of the hyporheic  zone and associated biological and geochemical processes in  mountain watersheds.  The researchers are interested in  constraints on vertical and lateral exchange flows of  surface and groundwater and how exchange flows may be  limited by controls on flow path direction and flow rate.  Their general approach is to combine: (1) field studies of  existing natural and managed sites;  (2) before/after  observations at sites altered by natural processes or  experimental manipulations of flood control structures; and  (3) modeling to draw general conclusions about types and  magnitudes of effects of various constraining factors.     This project brings together the efforts of two  laboratories that have complimentary expertise, research  capabilities and equipment.  Streams at the Andrews  Experimental Forest in Oregon range from relatively pristine  to moderately impacted.  They offer the opportunity to study  the natural dynamics of forest-stream interactions and their  influence on surface-and subsurface exchange flows.  Stream  networks in Japan are highly modified relative to streams in  the Pacific Northwest.  Thus, the Japanese streams provide  an important contrast to the pristine streams in Oregon.  Research results will include further refinements of the  conceptual framework for riparian ecosystems as well as  specific findings relevant to the mountain streams under  study.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this  project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote  international understand ing and cooperation.  ***",
