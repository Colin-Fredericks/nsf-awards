 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator and collaborators have developed a \r\nmathematically rigorous and highly stable inverse scattering algorithm for \r\na lossless stratified medium (1-D Helmholtz Equation), which has \r\nsuccessfully treated experimental remote sensing data with high noise \r\nlevels.  The method is a layer stripping method, based on a nonlinear Riesz \r\ntransform, rather than a trace formula. It features a nonlinear Plancherel \r\nequality and some nonlinear Payley-Weiner theorems. Together with the Riesz \r\ntransform, these allow us to develop a rather complete Fourier analysis, \r\neven in the presence of strong multiple reflections.  In this project, we \r\nplan to investigate the extensions of these methods to more complicated \r\n(e.g.  lossy and non-stratified) media. For a more detailed overview, see \r\n\"www.math.washington.edu/~sylvest/\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fundamental task of science is to probe the world around us.  The most \r\npowerful method for accomplishing this goal is to direct energy, in the \r\nform of waves, at an object and to observe the waves after they have \r\ninteracted with that object. For example, a conventional photograph is \r\nproduced by directing light waves from the flash bulb to the object under \r\nstudy and recording the image formed by the reflected waves on film.\r\n\r\nWhile the results of such an experiment can be readily understood by the \r\nhuman scientist (we can just look at the picture), results of analogous \r\nexperiments using waves which penetrate more deeply into the medium under \r\nstudy (e.g. microwaves, X-rays, and some sound waves) are less directly \r\nmeaningful.\r\n\r\nA wave which penetrates deeply into a medium gives us the opportunity \r\nto see below the surface. However, the picture we obtain is a stack of \r\nimages of the top surface and the various layers below it, all \r\nsuperimposed on the same \"photograph\". In addition, there are even more \r\nsuperimposed images, formed from internal reflections between layers \r\n(multiple reflections).\r\n\r\nThis project continues development of a mathematical method for turning a \r\n\"microwave photograph\", made up of a stack of superimposed images, into a \r\nstack of individual photographs, each containing the image of a single \r\nlayer of the medium. From these individual photographs, we see the true \r\nstructure of the underlying medium.\r\n\r\n",
