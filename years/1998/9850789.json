 "awd_abstract_narration": "We will use this grant to improve the Arizona Western College (AWC) General Chemistry Laboratory curriculum and the AWC / Northern Arizona University-Yuma (NAU-Yuma) Environmental Science program by augmenting and expanding lab{laboratory activities through the use of Calculator Based Laboratory (CBL units) and Macintosh computers. Faculty and students from the Departments of Chemistry, Environmental Science, and Geology along with scientists from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation will participate.    The proposed laboratory projects will incorporate 20 CBL units interfaced with pH, conductivity, colorimetric, and temperature probes and 2 Macintosh computers into both the AWC General Chemistry laboratory curriculum and the AWC / NAU-Yuma Environmental Science program. The CBL is an automatic data collection device from Texas Instruments that collects and stores data in a laboratory environment. The Macintosh computers will allow for a more sophisticated, graphical and statistical analysis of the experimental data.    Use of CBLs and Macintosh computers will expand the range and type of laboratory activities, shift student focus from tedious data collection to its interpretation and hence conceptual relevancy, allow faculty to teach topics previously never taught, allow students to conduct experiments that previously could not be done, and give new options for student learning and participation.  The successes of the project will be shared with the Yuma County Educational Consortium, which includes AWC, NAU-Yuma, the Yuma Union High School District as well as nine public school districts the Yuma Math and Science Consortium, and regional and national Science education communities through workshops, presentations at professional meetings, and journal publications.",
