 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CISE Educational Innovation award supports the development of interactive formally-grounded courseware for teaching both mathematics and computing.  The courseware is created by a modern proof development system, Nuprl, based on its reference library of formal computational mathematics.  This project builds on earlier work in the area and 1) adds targeted lessons as entry points to the corpus of formal mathematics, 2) gathers feedback from students and instructors for evaluation purposes, and 3) includes work necessary for utilizing the full Nuprl interactive capability when it becomes available on the Web in 1999.  The project is creating easily used and novel educational technology by modifying existing research tools and incorporating ideas from the practice of machine assisted reasoning to make plain the conventional logical structure of mathematics text.  It has the potential to make a broad impact.",
