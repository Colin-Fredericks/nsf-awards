 "awd_abstract_narration": "9709915  Ruby   Gene expression in nearly all eukaryotes requires the excision of introns from nuclear pre-mRNAs to produce functional mRNAs. The introns are spliced out by the spliceosome, which is composed of five snRNPs and many proteins. These components assemble on the pre-mRNA before splicing begins. This project focuses on the role of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Usa3p in the splicing pathway. Usa3p has previously been shown to interact with Snp1, a U1 snRNP-specific protein. Usa3p is essential for cell viability and splicing in vivo. Its deduced amino acid sequence has several interesting motifs, suggestive of its function in splicing. These include several SR, RE and RD dipeptides, which are hallmarks of known metazoan SR proteins that regulate constitutive and alternative splicing. In vitro assays will be utilized to determine the function of Usa3p in splicing. The roles, if any, of the SR dipeptides and of Usa3p phosphorylation in the regulation of splicing will be assessed by a combination of genetic and biochemical assays.   Pre-mRNA splicing is a process for gene expression in all eukaryotic cells. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the regulation of splicing at the level of splice site recognition and selection as well as at a more global level in coordinating splicing with other cellular processes. Yeast is used as the experimental organism because biochemistry and genetics can be used together to characterize complex transient molecular interactions.",
