The focus of the research is the synthesis and characterization of spinel type material.  These materials are used in industry in applications such as magnetic memory, transformers, television tubes, and components for microwave communications.  The objective is to improve the performance of low loss electrical power transformers, microwave integrated circuits, thin film magnetic recording materials.  The research centers on aerosol decomposition and solution precipitation are to produce materials to study the crystal structure of these materials.  The magnetic properties of these materials are being measured and analyzed.  There is an impact on the education of minorities, as the students involved are either Hispanic or Native Americans, and hopefully will encourage these students to pursue careers in science and engineering in an area of significance to the US economy.",
