 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728622  Housner  This project by the U.S. Panel on Structural Control Research is  to support U.S. participation in the Second World Conference on  Structural Control (2WCSC) which is planned for convening in  Kyoto, Japan during the period 28 June - 1 July 1998.  The US  Panel is co-sponsoring the 2WCSC with the Japan Panel on  Structural Response Control.    This project will enable the participation of U.S. researchers  and support their activities of U.S. and Japan researchers  involved in the field of structural control of smart civil  infrastructure systems in 2WCSC.  These activities will include  joint research studies and meetings in the U.S. as well as Japan,  by small groups of U.S. and Japan engineers and scientists, for  the purpose of coordinating and implementing ongoing and future  research activities in the U.S. and Japan.  Specific areas of  joint studies include:         o Developing the technical program for a jointly-organized           (the U.S. and Japan) \"Second World Conference on          Structural Control\" to be held in Kyoto, Japan.       o Participation in joint research investigations on          structural control testbeds in the U.S. as well as Japan,          particularly the recently established test structure at             the Disaster Prevention Research Institute (DPRI) in Kyoto          University under the support of Science and Technology              Agency (STA) in Japan.       o Coordinating ongoing and developing future research                 projects funded by the U.S. and Japan in the emerging          field of smart civil infrastructure systems.    The proposed collaborative activities will be valuable for  developing new, major collaborative efforts between US and Japan.  ***",
