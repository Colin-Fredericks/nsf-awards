 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 98-10809  ERLICHMAN      The brain is composed of two types of cells termed neurons and  glia. Most of what we know about the processing of information in  the brain involves the generation, propagation and transfer of  electrical signals between neurons within the brain. Although it  is clear that neurons play a pivotal role in all brain-related  activities such as learning and memory, recent research suggests  that glial cells may play a crucial role in normal neuronal  function. The importance of glia in normal brain function may be  related to their ability to regulate a variety of chemicals  accessible to the neurons. The regulation of these chemicals is  important to study because these substances that can have profound  effects on the production of electrical signals in neurons and  thus the type and content of information processed by the brain.  Dr. Erlichman will examine role of glia in a region of the brain  involved in the regulation of breathing. Using live brain tissue  and a special microscope, he will investigate how glia regulate  the level of acidity in a region of the brain known as the  medulla. Controlling the level of acidity in the body is one of  the most tightly regulated systems known. This tight regulation is  thought to occur because slight variations in acidity (either too  much or too little) can greatly disrupt cell function throughout  the body. The medulla is a particularly important region of the  brain since neurons at these sites 'sense' changes in acidity by  altering their production of electrical signals. These changes in  electrical signals ultimately result in a change in breathing,  which is one method the body uses to regulate acidity.  Investigating the role of glia in this response is exciting  because it will provide important new information on how glia help  regulate acidity in the medulla and more generally, how the  interaction of these two cell types help shape information  processing in the brain.",
