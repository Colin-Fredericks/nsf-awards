 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of improved methods for the   synthesis of optically pure organic compounds, using   alpha,beta-unsaturated acyl diiron carbonyl complexes incorporating a   chiral thiol.  Reactions of these reagents with nitrones results in the   formation of asymmetric isoxazolidines.  Structural studies will be   carried out to determine the origin of the observed product   selectivities, and the isoxazolidines will be used as intermediates in   the synthesis of optically active  beta-amino acids and beta-lactams.    The acyl diiron complexes will also be used in asymmetric Diels-Alder   reactions in the regioselective addition of nitrile oxides, and as   organometallic components for the  asymmetric Michael addition.  With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   provides continuing support for the research  of Dr. Scott R. Gilbertson   of the Department of Chemistry at Washington University.  Professor   Gilbertson's research is focused on developing new and improved synthetic   methods for the preparation of organic compounds.  The methodology,    based on organometallic reagents,  has potential for use in the   preparation of organic compounds having interesting biological   properties.  In this work, students will receive training useful in   developing synthetic skills of great interest to the pharmaceutical   industry.",
