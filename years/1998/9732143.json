 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will continue support for the Research  Experiences for Undergraduates physics program at the  University of Washington.  The program offers prospective  students a wide variety of research opportunities:  astrophysics and cosmology, atomic physics, nuclear physics,  condensed matter physics, particle physics, and physics  education.  Each student is paired with a faculty advisor,  who often is supported by interested postdocs and advanced  graduate students.  The program lasts 10 weeks and includes  a machine shop course, a faculty lecture series on research  opportunities in physics, and informal Monday gatherings.  Special efforts are made to encourage women and minority  group members to apply and participate.  As the new UW  physics/astronomy building meets or exceeds the latest ADA  standards, we also emphasize our ability to accommodate the  needs of physically challenged students.  As typically one  student in 10 works with the UW Physics Education Group, our  project also has an impact on the training of in-service  elementary and secondary teachers.",
