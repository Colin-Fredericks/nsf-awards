Rock mass strength and deformability depend on  a) the  discontinuity (e.g., joints, fractures, faults) network, b)  the  geomechanical properties of the discontinuities, c) the  geomechanical  properties of the intact rock, d) the in situ stress system,  and e) the  loading/unloading stress path.  Due to the complex nature of  natural  discontinuity patterns in rock, and uncertainties associated  with  estimating factors a) through e) above, the prediction of  mass  properties of rock at a large scale using the available  stress analysis  techniques and a limited field and laboratory investigation  presents a  great challenge for the rock engineering profession.      This research focuses on the effect of joints on strength  and  deformability of rock masses.  Primary objectives of this  research are  to establish the following relationships for jointed blocks  made out of  two model materials:  a) the modulus of deformability in any  direction  as a function of the fracture tensor (a combined measure of  joint  geometry parameters component in that direction,  deformational  properties of the intact model material and joints, and the  confining  stress, and b) the strength in any direction as a function  of the  fracture tensor component in that direction, strength  properties of the  intact model material and joints, and the confining stress.  Biaxial  loading tests will be performed on jointed block samples  having  numerous joint geometry configurations.  Model materials  will be chosen  to satisfy the similitude requirements compared to soft  brittle rocks.  Secondary objectives are to establish some guidelines to  estimate  equivalent continuum properties for jointed model material  and rocks  with respect to both strength and deformabilit y properties..  ***",
