The two plan to build an integrated model that can describe quantitatively the process behavior during net shape fabrication of advanced aluminum structures.   The proposed model consists of two modules: the physical and the numerical modeling modules.  In the physical module, which will be handled by the US team, material constitutive equations are established and the process-structure-property relationships are determined.  In the numerical module, to be developed by the AUC team, simulation of the entire net shape fabrication process will be conducted using the non-linear finite element code ABACUS.  The integrated model can then be used with the robust design methodology to explore the optimum process parameters and product configuration that would maximize quality and minimize cost, while reducing waste and impact on the environment.  The work will target the newly developed aluminum-copper-lithium alloy X2090 as a typical example of advanced material for use in various applications.\r\n\r\nScope:  This award will allow collaboration between Egyptian and US scientists who have complementary capabilities needed to carry out the proposed research efficiently.  The model to be designed will be used with two manufacturing methods, the superplastic forming (SPF) and diffusion bonding (DB) for net-shape fabrication of complex multi-sheet structural components.  Cost savings associated with this technique are based on high material utilization, reduced part count and the resulting assembly costs.  The resulting alloys can provide the transportation industry (automotive and aircraft) with the capability of a cost-effective manufacturing process for large complex structures.  The two collaborating teams are considered to be well qualified and experienced in the area of the research.  This proposal meets the INT objective of increasing US-foreign collaboration in areas that benefit both sides.   This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities. \r\n***\r\n",
