 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most powerful set of  findings in international relations is that democracies are less likely to engage in conflict with one another, less likely to escalate disputes to war, and never or very rarely fight wars with each other.  Most studies of this proposition of a democratic peace posit that two democracies are more prone to peaceful behavior than other pairings of regime types.  Even if one controls for other factors that affect conflict propensity, the effect of democracy still persists.  This result is now widely accepted by most scholars of international politics as well as by policy-makers.  Yet, some of these empirical findings are based on debatable statistical assumptions.  The current investigation focuses on several fundamental methodological issues relevant to the democratic peace:  issues relevant to different levels of analysis, problems caused by the dyad-year construction, case dependence, endogeneity, substantive significance, and measurement problems.  The investigators address these issues through a variety of statistical models on a set of cases from 1816-1992 involving both the Polity database  and an expansion of the Vanhanen database.  Specifically, the investigators compare several maximum likelihood modes:  a Cox proportional hazard model, the Gompit model, generalized additive models, and a Heckman simultaneous equations model.  At the systems level the investigators compare structural equations approaches with a Kalman filter technique.  The models control for a set of factors know to affect the likelihood of war:  contiguity, power status, alliances, war diffusion, recurrent conflicts, etc.  The investigators compare the statistical and substantive significance of parameters across the models for a variety of indicators.  These models assist in addressing the methodological difficulties affecting the democratic peace results.  It is expected that many of the findings from this investigation will be transferable to other fields in the study of war and peace.",
