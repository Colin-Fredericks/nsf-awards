 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802072  Stebbins    The objective of this project is to use nuclear magnetic  resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to acquire quantitative  structural and dynamical information on borate,  borosilicate, and boraluminate glasses and liquids at  ambient and high temperature, and to interpret and model  existing macroscopic thermodynamic and transport property  data in light of these new findings.  The fundamental  difference between a glass and the corresponding liquid is  that the structure of the latter can change with temperature  rapidly enough to remain in equilibrium.  This process  results in often large effects on properties that must be  assessed to accurately describe melt behavior during glass  melting and processing.  Structural change with temperature  also controls the mechanical relaxation during annealing of  glasses, which in turn is an essential step in making  technologically useful glassy materials.  Extensive data  sets exist on these macroscopic properties, and  sophisticated phenomenological models have been formulated  to describe and quantify relaxation.  However, these models  in general lack empirical data on temperature effects on  either molecular-scale structure or dynamics and thus are  limited in their predictive value: when extrapolated  hundreds (or even >1000) degrees up to temperatures of glass  melting furnaces, they may even be grossly in error.  The  studies proposed here will use NMR on a variety of nuclides  at ambient temperature to determine the effects of varying  fictive temperature on glass structure, which will constrain  T effects on liquid structure in the vicinity of the glass  transition.  In situ, high resolution, high T NMR on these  nuclides will also be used to determine T effects on average  coordination environments to temperatures as high as 1500   C.  The effects of observed structural changes on entropy,  enthalpy, activities, molar volumes, and other properties  will be assessed using simple thermodynamic models.  At  lower temperatures but sti ll in the liquid range, static and  MAS NMR will be used to observe exchange among structural  species and measure their exchange rates.  Spin-lattice  relaxation times will be measured to gain dynamical  information over wider ranges in temperature.  These results  for molecular-scale dynamics will be compared to shear  relaxation times derived from existing data on viscosity,  and to data on electrical conductivity and diffusivity.  Models linking the microscopic and macroscopic will be  formulated and tested.  %%%  Boron-containing oxide glasses, and their corresponding high  temperature liquids, are of wide-ranging importance in  industry and society, finding use in corrosion- and  temperature resistant containers, tanks and pipes, fibers in  structural composites, optical components, computer display  screens, etc.  Borosilicate glasses are also likely to be of  major importance in the solidification and sequestering of  radioactive wastes.  This research project will have a major  impact on the understanding of glass formation and  relaxation needed to improve the properties of commercial  products.  ***",
