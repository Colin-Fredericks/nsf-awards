 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a novel architecture for the construction  of scalable Internet servers from commodity hardware and modular  application software components. The architecture targets network  servers based on clusters of workstations or PCs, and allows  servers to fully realize the performance potential of this  platform.  Off-the-shelf server applications are executing on the  server nodes in a modular fashion and are unaware of the  existence of multiple server nodes. As a result, ScalaServer  leverages both existing server applications and the  price/performance curve of commodity hardware.  The design of the  ScalaServer architecture will be based on the results of  extensive tracedriven simulations. Prototype systems for both  single-node and cluster servers will be disseminated to the  research community. It is expected that the project will  significantly advance the state-of-the-art in highperformance,  scalable, and cost-effective network server design and  implementation, an area that is critical to the future global  information infrastructure.  The project will also contribute to  the education of scientists and engineers in this important area,  both at the graduate and undergraduate level.***",
