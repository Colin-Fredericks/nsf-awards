 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dockery\r\n9805701\r\n     The investigator develops differential equation models to\r\nstudy heterogeneous biofilms in fluid-saturated porous media.\r\nThe underlying question is how biofilm interactions affect\r\nspatial heterogeneities in the biofilm.  Of specific interest are\r\ncauses of observed heterogeneities, whether heterogeneity is\r\npurely a hydrodynamic effect, whether cell-cell communication\r\nthrough chemical signaling can be responsible for some of the\r\nheterogeneity, and whether species competition can be a\r\ncontributing factor in the observed roughness of the film.  The\r\nmathematical approach involves one- and two-space-dimensional\r\nmodels, the development of analytical techniques, and\r\ncomputational studies.  In the project the investigator\r\ncollaborates with experimentalists at the Center for Biofilm\r\nEngineering and shares mentoring of students with members of the\r\nCenter.  Understanding the variations in biofilm form and\r\nstructure will clarify the important issues of transport and\r\nchemistry within the biofilm.\r\n     In the vernacular, a biofilm might be called slime or\r\nsludge.  A biofilm is a film of microorganisms that accumulates on\r\nthe surface of an object in a flowing fluid environment.  The\r\nmicroorganisms secrete polymers outside their own body cells,\r\nwhich anchor the cells to each other and to the surfaces on which\r\nthe film forms.  Biofilms can clog pipes, foul the hulls of\r\nships, corrode steel, sour oil fields, or cause infections by\r\ngrowing on host tissues or medical implants.  Because of their\r\npervasive effects on water quality, power generation, energy\r\nefficiency, and product quality, their negative effect is felt in\r\nmost U.S. industries.  Not all biofilm activity has negative\r\nresults.  They can also break down contaminants in water or soil\r\nand often are used for bioremediation.  The potential of biofilm\r\nprocess control has yet been fully realized due in part to a lack\r\nof fundamental knowledge of biofilm form and structure.  Recent\r\nexperiments have shown that biofims are not so uniform in\r\nstructure as once thought.  In this project, the investigator\r\ndevelops mathematical models of biofilms to study heterogeneity\r\nin biofilms.  Understanding the variations in biofilm structure\r\nwill lead to understanding issues of chemistry and transport in\r\nthe biofilm: how the biofilm grows and what it can do.
