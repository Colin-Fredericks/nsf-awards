 "awd_abstract_narration": "David Oxtoby is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his work on nucleation   theory.  He will use statistical mechanical techniques, primarily density   functional approaches, to investigate the dynamics of first-order phase   transitions.  Such transitions are of central importance in many areas of   science and technology.  The objective of the current research program is   to develop new theoretical approaches to be able to predict nucleation   rates for gas-liquid and liquid-solid phase transitions.  The density   functional approach used by Oxtoby incorporates atomic-level interactions   to an extent not possible in traditional classical theories of   nucleation.  Specific targets of the research program for the next three   years include: 1) a better understanding of the effects of dipolar   interactions on nucleation; 2) a microscopic and predictive approach to   the phase diagrams of three-component water-oil-surfactant systems that   produce microemulsions; 3) an improved theory of crystal nucleation in   metal alloys; 4) a new approach to protein crystallization and its   relation to coagulation; and 5) a careful study of the effects of solid   substrates and electric fields on crystal nucleation.  Nucleation is important in a number of areas of science and technology   including: 1) the condensation and freezing of water vapor in clouds; 2)   the casting of solid metals and metal alloys from the melt; and 3) the   growth of protein crystals from solution in order to determine their   structure.  On a molecular level, the mechanism of these changes of state   are not well understood, and perhaps the least-understood aspect is the   rate at which the first clusters of the new phase appear.  This step,   defined as nucleation, is often rate-determining for the formation of the   new phase, and it is the step which Oxtoby's research will attempt to   elucidate.",
