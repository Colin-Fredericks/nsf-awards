 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9760703  Hodko    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project describes the development of an innovative approach for decontamination of soils and wastes polluted by heavy metals.  Heavy metal contamination presents one of the most intractable problems for soil clean-up.  Present technology relies mostly upon ex situ metal extraction or in situ contaminant immobilization processes, which are expensive and which remove all biological activity in the soil during the soil treatment.  Recently, the use of metal-accumulating plants was explored for the removal of metals from contaminated soils.  This new phytoremediation technology utilizes specially selected or engineered metal accumulating plants or plants native to metalliferous soils with a capacity to bioaccumulate metals to concentrations greater than 2% in the aerial plant dry matter.  However, the use of this technology is limited to superficially-contaminated soils, which is determined by the plant root length and plant suction potential.  Lynntech, Inc. proposes a development of an innovative approach to phytoremediation, which will significantly enhance the process of phytoextraction and extend its application to soils with deep subsurface contamination.  The approach involves a process which allows an upward, counter-gravitational transport of contaminants, water, as well as nutrients through the soil matrix to the rhizosphere.  Once the contaminants are transported to the rhizosphere they will be extracted by contaminant-accumulating plants which can concentrate contaminants from the soil into the harvestable parts of roots and above-ground shoots.    Potential Commercial Applications of the Research: The development of this technology, if shown to be successful, will have a large potential commercial applications: (i) in remediation of mixed waste polluted soils (heavy metals, organics and radionuclides); (ii) in agriculture for remediation of sewage sludge amended soils and for removal of pesticides and other toxins fr om the rhizosphere zone, and (iii) as an innovative practice for nutrient and moisture transport and containment in dry soils.  ***",
