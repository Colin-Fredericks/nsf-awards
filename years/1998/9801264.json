This study is expected to unravel intricate and fundamental properties of the objects and patterns which are of interest in arithmetic and geometry through the study of these symmetries.  One way to understand a group of symmetries is through a representation of its elements as matrices.  Representation theory does this in a systematic way.  Ultimately the goal is to we are able to construct and classify all representations of the reductive p-adic groups, and from this settle important questions about the underlying geometric object.  This is important because so many interesting arithmetic and geometric objects have interesting symmetries that form a reductive\r\np-adic group. \r\n\r\nThis research comes under the umbrella of harmonic analysis on topological groups.  Group theory and harmonic analysis are a part of the fundamental underpinnings of certain applications of mathematics to technology in such fields as error correcting codes for efficient and reliable communication and computer imaging, eg. medical imaging, geological imaging or planetary imaging.\r\n\r\n",
