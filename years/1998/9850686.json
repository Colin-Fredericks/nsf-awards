 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hofstra University proposes to enhance the science education of non-majors, and especially prospective K-12 teachers by constructing a dedicated Teaching Laboratory for the Departments of Mathematics and Physics (which includes Astronomy). The laboratory will serve 820 students enrolled annually in the courses \"Mathematical Excursions\" and \"Explorations in Mathematics\" (MATH 12 and 16), 625 students enrolled annually in the courses \"The Solar System\" and \"Stars and Galaxies\" (ASTR 11 and 12) and an anticipated 120 students enrolled annually in a new course \"Models and Algorithms\" (MATH 13, provisional title) to be developed with support from this project. The major thrust of this proposal is to involve students actively in learning major concepts and methodologies of both mathematics and astronomy: the processes of observation, discovery, description (as rules or algorithms) and verification. Some topics will be studied in both mathematics and astronomy; in which case the treatment in each course will be self-contained, but connections between the disciplines will also be explored. The proposed Teaching Laboratory will include 18 networked high-end PC's together with an instructor station, projector and printers serving instructional needs in all of the affected courses and PC-based CCD cameras to be attached to existing telescopes to facilitate gathering data for later analysis in Astronomy 11 and 12. The proposed Teaching Laboratory will complement several existing open-access laboratories located throughout Hofstra's campus. This project is expected to improve instruction both locally and nationally, the latter through dissemination of class materials and results via professional meetings and journals, as well as courseware on Hofstra University's world wide web site.",
