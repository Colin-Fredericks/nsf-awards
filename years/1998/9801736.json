For 2000 years, it was believed that the geometry involved  was Euclidean geometry.  But, at the beginning of the 19th century, C.  F. Gauss and N. Lobachevskii independently speculated that the Universe  might have a non-Euclidean geometric structure (this geometry is  obtained by negating Euclid's fifth postulate, and it is generally called  \"hyperbolic geometry\").  Further, they took measurements to determine if  their speculations were correct.  Gauss's measurements came from surveys  on the earth, while Lobachevskii's measurements were astronomical and  used the parallax for the star Sirius.  Their measurements were  inconclusive, but this year, a variety of astronomical studies have  provided substantial evidence that the Universe has a hyperbolic  geometric structure.  Just as Gauss and Lobachevskii speculated, the  Universe is a hyperbolic 3-dimensional object, technically, a hyperbolic  3-manifold.       There are many, many different types of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  Which one of these types is our Universe?  Answering this question is a  daunting task, but there appears to be one significant simplification:  some theoretical and esthetic information indicates that if geometric  measurements could be made, it would turn out---after a re-scaling  related to the expansion of the Universe---that the Universe is \"small\"  in size, that is, it is a hyperbolic 3-manifold of low volume.  Thus, we  want to understand all hyperbolic 3-manifolds of low volume.  This is a  hard problem, and for many years progress was slow, but recent research  has provided powerful new tools for attacking the problem.  Some of the  tools involve the use of rigorous computer programs to analyze parameter  spaces and to study configurations of natural geometric objects in  hyperbolic space.  This project will use these tools and develop new  ones to lead us towards the goal of definitively identifying the   low-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  Coupling this theoretical  information with data from the planned MAP (microwave anisotropy probe)  space project could lead to the determination of precisely which  hyperbolic 3-manifold the Universe is.  ***",
