 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding is requested for global positioning system (GPS), geographical information system (GIS), and image analysis technology for student use in field oriented courses in biology and environmental science. This technology will be incorporated into a number of courses that all require a variety of spatial analysis applications (e.g., lake bathymetry, habitat analysis, endangered species distribution mapping, lichen community dynamics, landscape analysis of old growth forest, and avian bioenergetics). The overall objective of this project is to foster problem solving skills, critical thinking, and a richer appreciation for the scientific process by involving all science and science-education majors in real-world, field research problems, rather than contrived classroom \"studies.\" The natural attraction that students exhibit toward field research will be encouraged through the combination of state-of-the-art, computer interfaced technology and hands-on examination of ecological problems that were previously logistically difficult or technically impossible using available alternative methods. Students will engage in both course-related and independent field research projects, which will be original and/or applied, and may last for a semester, several semesters, or a number of years and involve several cohorts of students. Student involvement in all phases of research will be reflected in greatly increased student authorship of publications and project reports for local organizations and governmental agencies. Thus, it is expected that the addition of the GPS/GISrlmage analysis technology will enhance our field oriented courses and independent student research opportunities, and it will provide effective and highly visible tools for the science faculty to increase student motivation and interest in careers in science and science teaching.",
