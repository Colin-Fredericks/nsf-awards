Maryland  ------------------------------- Message Contents -----------------  --------------  Abstract: CMS-9733925, Kaye Brubaker, U. Maryland    In regions with significant seasonal snowpacks, some of the most  devastating floods are caused by sudden snowmelt or rain-on-snow  events. At  the other hydrologic extreme, a below-average winter snowpack is  likely to  translate into severe warm-season water shortages. In the United  States,  operational hydrology has made great strides in short-term and  extended  forecasting of these disastrous events, aided by sophisticated  observations  and models. Modern hydrologic techniques can incorporate  information on  uncertainty in the snow pack, precipitation and other weather  factors to  produce probabilistic forecasts.  The aim of this CAREER project  is to  develop tools to determine mathematical expressions for physical  variability and measurement uncertainty, for a variety of  topographic  climatic situations, and for different resolutions of measurement.    The research objectives are:  * Characterize patterns in snowpack/snow-cover depletion during  the melt  season using remote-sensing products at different spatial  resolutions, and  a Geographic Information System;  * Relate these spatio-temporal patterns to topography, land cover,  and climate;  * Investigate the scaling properties of these patterns and their  dependence  on the resolution of the observed data; and  * Test the use and value of these findings in short-term and  extended  streamflow forecasting models, both deterministic and  probabilistic.    It is expected that this research will result in:  * Physically-based mathematical expressions for uncertainty in  snow-water  equivalent estimates used to update streamflow forecast models.  * Model validation data sets of spatially-distributed time-series  of  multi-se nsor snow-cover and weather observations, and weather  forecasts for  testing and developing forecast models.    The educational objectives are:  * Develop a new hands-on seminar in hydrologic prediction, design  and  forecasting, incorporating the research results.  * Incorporate the research findings into a modest number of new  modules for  an existing graduate hydrology class and an existing undergraduate  probability and statistics class. The new modules will incorporate  innovative classroom technology and pedagogy.  * Perform objective and subjective assessments of the value of  these  innovations in aiding students' learning.    It is expected that this educational objective for water-resource  engineers  will result in training in the use of sophisticated observational  and  analytical technology, including remotely-sensed Earth systems  data, and  Geographic Information Systems and spatial data manipulation; a  solid  understanding of natural variability in hydrologic variables,  measurement  uncertainty, mathematical expressions for that variability and  uncertainty,  and the implications for resource prediction and forecasting; and  exposure  to techniques and perspectives from related disciplines.    +=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=  +  Clifford J.
