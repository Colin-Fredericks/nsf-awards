 "awd_abstract_narration": "Looking up the route to send a message is a major bottleneck in traditional\r\nInternet Routers.   Traditional routers only use the destination address in\r\na message to determine how to forward the message.   However, in the last\r\nfew years, there have been proposals for more sophisticated routers that\r\nare capable of what is called Layer 4 Switching.  We believe that the\r\ncapabilities provided by Layer 4 Switching in terms of security, quality of\r\nservice, and guaranteed service will make Layer 4 Switching an integral\r\npart of the Next Generation Internet.\r\n\r\nIn Layer Four switching, the route and resources allocated to a packet are\r\ndetermined by the destination address as well as other header fields of the\r\npacket (such as source address, TCP port numbers etc.).  Layer Four\r\nSwitching unifies a number of recent trends (such as firewall  processing,\r\nresource reservation, providing virtual private networks) into a single\r\nframework.  The forwarding database of this new kind of router consists of\r\na potentially large number of filters on key header fields.  A given packet\r\nheader can match multiple filters; thus each filter is given a cost, and\r\nthe packet is forwarded using the least cost filter that matches the packet\r\nheaders.\r\n\r\nThe flexibility and service differentiation provided by Layer 4 Switching\r\ncomes at a cost.  Given that traditional Internet forwarding based only on\r\ndestination addresses is itself a challenge to implement at Gigabit speeds,\r\nLayer 4 Switching at Gigabit speeds is a difficult problem for next\r\ngeneration routers.  In this proposal, we address the question of designing\r\nand implementing fast algorithms for Layer 4 Switching that can be\r\nimplemented at Gigabit speeds even with hundreds of thousands of filters.\r\nWe introduce three promising candidate algorithms (cross-producting, Grid\r\nof Tries, and Tuple Search).  We propose to implement, evaluate, and\r\nfine-tune these new ideas, consider combination schemes, and to search for\r\nother fast algorithms for fast filter matching.  As part of our proposal we\r\nplan to design a chip capable of doing Layer 4 Switching at Gigabit speeds.\r\n\r\n",
