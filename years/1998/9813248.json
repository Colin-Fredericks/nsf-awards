 "awd_abstract_narration": "Landfilling is the most common method used for permanent disposal of wastes.  A thorough understanding of the processes occurring within wastes and liner materials is required for proper design and operation of landfills and associated facilities.  Temperature affects the processes occurring within wastes and liners and also the properties and engineering behavior of both wastes and liner materials.    The objective of this GOALI study is to investigate temperature fluctuations and spatial distributions of temperatures in landfills and investigate the effect of temperature on the engineering properties of wastes.   This information will be used to determine temperature related behavior of solid wastes and landfill components to optimize performance of landfills.  The study will involve four major phases.  The first phase will be to identify the thermal regime of landfills.  Thermal properties of wastes will then be determined as a function of temperature.  A numerical model will be formulated using these thermal properties to predict temperature distributions within landfills and conduct parametric evaluations.  Finally, engineering properties of solid wastes will be determined as a function of temperature.  The study will be conducted with collaboration between Lawrence Technological University, Wayne State University, and Allied Waste Industries.  Results of this investigation will be applicable to various practical design and operational aspects of landfills. Cooperation between universities and industry will promote improved design and operation of waste containment facilities as well as complement educational objectives.  Knowledge of temperatures within a landfill and the temperature-dependent behavior of wastes is expected to advance the state-of-the-practice.",
