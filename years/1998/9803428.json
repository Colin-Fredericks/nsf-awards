 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803428  Miller       In earlier work, Professors Hopkins and Miller have shown how the  purely algebraic theory of elliptic curves can be embedded into  homotopy theory.  The result is a construction of a new object, the  spectrum TMF of topological modular forms, which is a deep enrichment  of the classical ring of modular forms.  Professor Hopkins hopes to  show that this object can be used in several ways.  It should receive  a generalized \"Witten genus,\" assigning sophisticated algebraic  invariants to certain geometric manifolds.  On the other hand, it  should account for deep arithmetic congruences satisfied by certain  theta-functions (conjectured earlier by Professor Hopkins and proven  by R. Borcherds).  Hopkins' program is to extend the construction of  TMF to a construction of suitably defined \"topological  theta-functions.\"  Professor Miller intends to pursue earlier work  with Hopkins on higher analogues of real K-theory; there is an  infinite family of these, of which only essentially one has been  investigated.  He hopes to use the theory of formal groups to give  conceptual and generalizable proofs of recent elaborate computations  of certain homotopy groups.  He will also attempt to extend the  relationship between K-theory and the spectral theory of a manifold to  an elliptic analogue.  Professor Hesselholt intends to continue his  research into the relationship between a homotopy-theoretically  defined \"linear\" invariant of rings (topological cyclic homology) and  a deep arithmetic \"nonlinear\" invariant (K-theory), and to extend his  computation of TC to more difficult cases.       The work of Professors Hopkins, Miller, and Hesselholt stands at the  forefront of the application of homotopy theory to other parts of  mathematics, notably, arithmetic and conformal field theory.  Homotopy  theory offers a vast enlargement of combinatorics, in which one keeps  track not only of equivalence classes but also of the ways in which  various objects are equivalent to each other.  The w ork of these  investigators serves as a formal background against which one may  organize the search for objects with meaning in these other areas, in  addition to possessing great intrinsic complexity and beauty.  ***",
