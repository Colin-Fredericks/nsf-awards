 "awd_abstract_narration": "WALLACE  9809704    Successful computer based educational programs have impact in K-12 science education because students become investigators of a wide range of scientific disciplines while applying computer technology developed in (and previously limited to) research laboratories.  Students are most likely to become engaged by a new technology when the subject of investigation is familiar.  A computer technology with tremendous potential in K-12 education is Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  GIS software with global and national data packaged for K-12 educational uses has been developed and is available to schools at affordable prices.  The Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) K-12 Schools and Libraries Program has provided an effective model for a graduated introduction to GIS and for organization of GIS coverages in their Arc Voyager package.  What is not readily available is locally derived GIS coverages which can provide hooks for grabbing the attention of K-12 students.    Through the efforts of professional GIS experts, a wealth of GIS coverages are available for Tucson, Pima County, and the State of Arizona.  This award will make these immense and varied GIS data coverages accessible to K-12 teachers and their students.  Most of the locally derived GIS datasets are too large and complex for the level of the learner and the level of computing power available in the K-12 environment.  The initial task will be to transform the most relevant available GIS coverages into datasets readily usable on computers generally found in the classroom.  Using the adapted local data, a small set of pilot GIS activities for the high school classroom will be developed.  Working with high school teachers the P.I.'s will perform classroom testing and assessment of the modules.  Assessment will address: 1) student learning behavior and the different ways students use GIS to solve problems, 2) student learning and response to locally focused versus regionally focused activit ies, 3) institutional and pedagogical obstacles for integrating GIS in the classroom.  The processes and exercises can serve as models to guide others in bringing local GIS coverages to K-12 classrooms across the country.",
