 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research focuses on two topics in Applied Cryptography:  efficient generation of shared RSA keys and the bit security of  the Diffie-Hellman secret.    To protect a high security private key one may wish to share it  among a few sites. If a small number of sites are compromised no  harm is done. An obvious question is who generates the shared  key? Traditionally, a \"trusted dealer\" generates an RSA key pair  and then splits the private key among the sites.  This project  studies various protocols for enabling three or more parties to  efficiently generate a shared RSA key WITHOUT a trusted dealer.  At the end of the computation the participants have an RSA  modulus N=pq. They are all convinced that N is the product of two  large distinct primes; however no proper coalition knows the  factorization of N.  The protocols should be appropriate for  small, low bandwidth devices such as smartcards or Personal  Digital Assistants (PDA's).    The project's second topic is the bit security of the Diffie-  Hellman secret.  The Diffie-Hellman protocol enables two parties  to exchange a secret.  Although an adversary may not be able to  compute the entire secret, she may be able to infer certain  information about it.  The proposed research will provide bounds  on the amount of information an adversary can infer.  To do so  one shows that if an adversary can recover certain bits of the  Diffie-Hellman secret then she can also break the entire  protocol.  The techniques needed for such reductions involve  lattices and the LLL algorithm.",
