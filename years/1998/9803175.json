Virginia    The International Conferences on Properties and Phase Equilibria for Product and Process Design are held every three years, presently alternating between North America and Europe.  The first seven conferences have produced highly desirable interactions between academic and industrial and government workers in this vital area for chemical process design and simulation.  The meetings have also become the most important gatherings for workers from all over the world; the Seventh Conference held in 1995 in Snowmass CO USA attracted 238 participants from 22 countries.  Each conference has produced important collections of papers in Proceedings volumes.  The Seventh Conference provided almost 1000 pages of reviews and new research when published in the international journal Fluid Phase Equilibria.     The Eighth Conference is schedule for April 26-May 1, 1998 in Noordwijerhout, The Netherlands, with much of the same successful format as for the previous conference but, as the name change reveals, includes some significant enhancements toward consideration of products as well as processes and education.    The present proposal requests funds for travel, meals and lodging for up to 25 needy US academic researchers to reach the conference site as well as communication cost.  Those supported would include 12 presenters of papers with the rest being young research workers who would not be able to attend without such support.  No request is made for meeting organization expenses or for non US participants.   ***",
