Statistical mechanics  provides powerful tools for quantifying collective  phenomena, in both average behavior, and fluctuations around  average.  This research is aimed at understanding static and  dynamic fluctuation phenomena in polymers, flux lines,  surfaces, networks, and complex fluids.    The chief analytical tool for extracting universal features  of interacting systems is field theory.  Equations governing  the variation of a relevant field in space and time are  constructed on the basis of various arguments (symmetry,  locality, etc.) and then analyzed by well known techniques  such as perturbation expansions and renormalization group.  Numerical methods are also employed to simulate complex  systems.  Some less conventional approaches will also be  explored in this research: (i) standard field theory can be  regarded as a description of fluctuating linear objects  (world-lines).  A generalization to describe a class of  fluctuating manifolds (with fixed connectivity) of arbitrary  internal dimensions will be formulated. (ii) Path integral  methods are introduced to study boundary effects introduced  by extended objects immersed in a complex fluid.  Even a  simple system such as a moving mirror in vacuum modifies the  quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field, leading  to forces and radiation phenomena that can be calculated by  this method.    Specific topics of study include: (i) flux phases in type II  superconductors: the modification of the phase diagram by  the combined effects of thermal fluctuations, pinning by  disorder, and destabilizing longitudinal currents. (ii)  configurations of polymers and gels with random interactions  and crosslinks. (iii) nonlinear patterns formed in  biological systems (cortical maps or microtubule  assemblies). (iv) description of nonequilibrium fluctuations  in growing sys tems and drifting aggregates. (v) fluctuations  of a single polyelectrolyte (charged polymer) and  interactions between several extended charged objects.  %%%  Complex phenomena often emerge from the collective  interactions of simple underlying entities, such as atoms in  a crystal, or neurons in the brain.
