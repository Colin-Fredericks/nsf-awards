 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Proposal #9727428  RUI: Learning and Development      Experiences early in life can have profound effects on both  normal and abnormal behavior later in life.  The aim of the  project is to develop a model system for studies of the  roles of experience in behavioral development.  The system  in which these processes are analyzed is the transition from  dependent to independent feeding in ring doves.  The  specific ways in which experience with different foods,  parental interaction, and observing other birds influence  the development of this response are studied.  Additionally,  we are able to investigate the neural changes that underlie  the behavioral development.  These studies are leading to  the development of a framework in which the roles of  experience in the development of any behavior can be  analyzed.    How to get new responses to occur is an important aspect of  many human activities.  Parents want to provide experiences  for their children that help them to develop adaptively.  Teachers want their pupils to acquire new repertoires.  Therapists try to induce new and more adaptive behaviors in  their clients and businesses may wish to promote creative  problem solving in their employees.  Because there are some  general principles about how new behaviors emerge, the  results obtained by analyzing this model system can be  applied in a wide range of practical settings.",
