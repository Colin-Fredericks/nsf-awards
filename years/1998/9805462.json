 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chinese rural family has been characterized as an obstacle to economic development because its patriarchal authority pattern and interlocking obligations seemed to limit entrepreneurship. Recently the extraordinary economic performance of Chinese society has led social scientists to challenge this view.  This pilot project by a young cultural anthropologist will carry out ethnographic fieldwork in three rural villages in northeast China.  Using participant observation, formal and informal interviews, a formal questionnaire and several systematic data collection techniques such as free lists, pile sorts, ratings and rankings, as well as documentary research methods, the investigator will analyze the changing meanings of private lives of individual family members.  The project will yield information about the shifting role of the family in both the public and private spheres and its relation to state policies and the local political economy, a systematic exploration of the increasing importance of sentiment, intimacy, privacy, and individual autonomy within the Chinese rural family and the changing meaning of private life for individual villagers. In the future the project will be expanded with Chinese colleagues to study similar issues of family change and private life among family firms in a fast-growing rural market town.  This research will support the beginning research career of a young social scientist, and will advance our understanding of changing social life in the largest, most dynamic society in the world today.",
