 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9807242  Guyden     Thymic nurse cells (TNC) are unique epithelial cells in the thymus that internalize immature thymocytes into cytoplasmic vacuoles.   This laboratory has established nurse cell lines which will internalize immature double positive thymocytes, some of which undergo apoptosis, while others are rescued.  The latter mature to single positive cells, which are released, suggesting that the nurse cells are important in determining the fate of developing thymocytes.  This research is looking at the mechanisms by which this occurs.  The  laboratory will try to identify the proteins which are involved in the recognition of the thymocytes, and those involved in their internalization.   They will examine the events that lead to survival versus those that result in cell death.   These investigations will provide important information about the mechanisms of development of thymocytes.  ***    The mechanism by which immature T cells in thymus develop into mature cells is not known.  This laboratory is studying an unusual group of thymic cells that can internalize immature T cells and determine whether they will mature or die.   These studies are important to our understanding of the development of the immune system.",
