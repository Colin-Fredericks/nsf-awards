 "awd_abstract_narration": "An interdisciplinary research and education project between the  Statistics Department at the CWRU College of Arts and Sciences,  and the Chemical Engineering Department at the CWRU Case  School of Engineering is being proposed. Its principal component  is Professor Woyczynski's residence in the Chemical Engineering  Department during his 1998/99 sabbatical, with Professor J. Adin  Mann playing the role of a host.  This residence will be a part  of, and will help to jump start a broader collaborative effort in  research and education being developed by Professor Woyczynski on  the Statistics side, and Professors Jay Mann, John Angus and Phil  Morrison on the Chemical Engineering side.    Professor Woyczynski's expected duties will include three  components:    (a) A joint research program to help in the development of a   virtual integrated prototyping and synchroneous  manufacturing/control of vapor/plasma deposition processes for   thin and thick films of wide band gap semiconductors, such as  gallium nitride and diamond.  The proposed control design will be  model-based, and the main effort will be directed at a detailed  study of the required interfacial growth models.    (b)  Design of undegraduate statistics courses to fit chemical  engineering needs, including creation of interactive,  Mathematica-based, chemical engineering-oriented computer  packages, to complement the about-to-be-published text  \"Introductory Statistics and Random Phenomena:  Uncertainty,  Complexity, and Chaotic Behavior in Engineering and Science\"  (joint with M. Denker, Birkhauser, 1998, 505 pp.).    (c) Creation of a framework for joint recruitment, supervision,  and job placement of statistics and chemical engineering graduate  and, more generally, materials science, students; initiation of  the writing process of a graduate text on random media for that  population.    The PI's expectation is that his residence at the Chemical  Engineering Department will produce lasting impact on the  research and educational en vironment at CWRU and beyond,  including:    -Development of new statistical and mathematical tools needed in  the virtual integrated prototyping of thin films.  Without such  tools the optimization of such processes does not seem to be  feasible;    -Direct application of these tools to the practical issues  related to the design of plasma reactors for vapor deposition of  such films, including development of industrial-strength software  for that purpose.  The latter will be done jointly with  industrial software vendors, such as ControlSoft Inc., of  Cleveland, Ohio, and CFD Research Corp. of Huntsville, AL, that  collaborate with the Chemical Engineering department.    -Development and fine tuning of statistics courses well adapted  to the needs of undergraduate students majoring in materials  sciences and engineering.  The hope is that this will increase  the attractiveness and relevance (as measured by enrollment) of  such courses.  The publication of the Uncertainty book should  have an impact on the way statistics is taught to engineering and  science students nationwide.    -Creation of an interdisciplinary environment for graduate  students would attract new types of students to the program, but  more importantly, would improve the marketability of new Ph.D.'s  and their flexibility in the job market.      The PI plans to apply the acquired expertise to broaden  experience and career options of the students by:    - Developing and fine-tuning statistics courses to fit the needs  of chemical engineering and other materials sciences  undergraduate students.    - Developing chemical engineering oriented packages and modules  for the Uncertainty book.    -Writing a graduate level book on random media.    -Developing a formal framework for joint advisorship and rotation  of Ph.D. level students between the Statistics and Chemical  Engineering Departments.    -To widen the employment opportunities for undergraduate students  with interdisciplinary training, special co-op programs will be  pu rsued with selected industrial companies that indicated  interest in broadly educated statistics and engineering students.    This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
