 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728694  Kaufman     The complex locus, arrow (arr), which resides in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster has been demonstrated to encode the protein, Centrosomin (Cnn). The gene has multiple tissue-specific transcription start sites and alternatively spliced mRNAs that produce different forms of the protein. The gene's structure will be characterized by mapping exons, transcription start sites and the sequencing of cDNAs from different tissues. Such information will lead to the construction of a more effective rescue construct than is now available. Concurrently, an expanded mutant analysis will be continued. Previous work has demonstrated that Cnn is involved in critical roles in development, gametogenesis and cell biology in Drosophila.  The focus of the inquiry into possible function(s) of this protein will center on its role in the Wingless/Wnt(Wg) signal transduction pathway in the centrosome and in the patterning of the oocyte. A set of Cnn protein deletion constructs will be expressed in cultured Drosophila cells in order to establish the functional domains within Cnn that are required for localization to the centrosome, to respond to Wg signaling and to be phosphorylated. Studies have demonstrated that Cnn is phosphorylated in a cell-cycle dependent manner. The parameters of that phosphorylation will be determined. The ultimate goals are to position Cnn within the Wg signaling pathway to determine its function in its various roles in development and to determine its role in the organization of the cytoskeleton.    How messages are delivered in a synchronized manner within cells and how they lead to the formation of a complex organism is still largely unknown. This work will expand our insights into that process.",
