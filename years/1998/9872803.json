 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds for the partial support of an  International Glaciology Society symposium on Sea Ice and its  Interaction with the Ocean, Atmosphere, and Biosphere, to be  held in Fairbanks, Alaska, in June 2000 under the scientific  sponsorship of the International Glaciology Society.  The  IGS, based at Cambridge University, England, is the  professional society for scientists who study snow and ice in  all its forms.  There is no comparable national organization.  The IGS sponsors at least one symposium annually, with the  presentations published in the peer-reviewed Annals of  Glaciology.  This symposium is timely since there has not  been a symposium dedicated solely to sea ice and its  processes since 1990, and a number of major multi-  disciplinary sea ice programs will have been completed within  the next two years.  The symposium will provide a suitable  forum for the dissemination of significant new results from  (e.g.) the joint NSF/ONR Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic  program, the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program,  the NSF/ONR submarine science program, the NSF Long-term  Ecological Research site at Palmer Station, ongoing NASA  satellite-based studies, and NOAA -sponsored arctic  oceanographic research.    Polar sea ice is both a bellwether and an agent of climate  change.  The effects of climate change on the characteristics  of the Earth's sea ice cover will affect the physical,  chemical, and biological processes beyond the immediate  influence of the ice because these processes are interlinked  on a global scale.  Interdisciplinary studies involving a  combination of field investigations, satellite-based remote  sensing, and numerical modelling studies will make important  contributions to increasing our knowledge of the geophysics  of sea ice and its impacts on the global environment.  Dissemination of research results at conferences such as this  will promote future cooperative research, and maximize the  benefits of research results.",
