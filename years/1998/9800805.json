The principal focus of this research is an approach to multidimensional truncated moment problems based on an extension theory for the associated moment matrix. When this matrix admits an infinite, positive, finite rank moment matrix extension, this method yields an explicit formula for a finitely atomic representing measure supported on the joint spectrum of a normal tuple of operators corresponding to the extension. The aim of this research is to determine concrete conditions on the moment data which permit the desired extension. Existence theorems for representing measures can also be interpreted as subnormal completion criteria for multivariable weighted shifts. Another facet of this research concerns the multidimensional K-moment problem, where the support of a representing measure is required to be contained in a prescribed closed set K. A direct application of this study concerns the Multidimensional Quadrature Problem in Numerical Analysis. By applying the matrix extension technique in the context of quadrature, this research seeks to construct minimal quadrature rules for such sets as the disk, square, triangle, or annulus. The algorithms that we develop can be explicitly implemented as computer programs.    Mathematical moments are used to model many real-word phenomena, such as area, velocity, momentum, weighted averages, probability distributions, etc. In the evaluation of moments using integrals, the greatest computational costs are associated with function calls. It has long been of interest to scientists, mathematicians, and engineers to devise efficient computational methods for evaluating integrals, methods which minimize the number of expensive function calls. For classical moments, computed as integrals over a straight line, this problem is solved by  classical tools of Numerical Analysis, particularly Gaussian Quadrature. In the present study we seek to devise highly efficient computational algorithms for integrals over sets in the plane (such as a triangle, disk, or square.) We use a new matrix extension method to develop concrete computational rules for efficient evaluation of two-dimensional moments over planar sets. These rules can be coded into computer programs which enhance the ability of scientists and engineers to evaluate integrals efficiently.",
