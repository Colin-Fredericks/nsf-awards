The workshop will focus on procedures and programs that were instituted to respond to and recover from recent urban earthquakes in the U.S. and Japan, including the 1994 Northridge and 1995 Kobe earthquakes.  Both earthquake researchers and practitioners will represent the U.S. at the workshop.  Papers and working group records, issued as proceedings, should have substantial utility for those interested in earthquake hazard mitigation throughout the U.S. and Japan.\r\n\r\n",
