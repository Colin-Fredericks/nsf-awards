The first phase of the project brings together an expert panel to offer, through and invited conference, a framework for understanding law's role and to make recommendations for improving the performance of international legal instruments of environmental protections. Conference participants will present formal commissioned papers reviewing lessons learned from international environmental law efforts, and will participate in plenary discussion.  They  will analyze two key cases with experts addressing questions aimed at understanding the degree of success for the international instruments.  Finally, the participants will generate hypotheses to be tested in subsequent phases of the research. The subsequent phases will use survey research and field observation to explore sociolegal components of global environmental law.  %%%  This project begins a systematic and comprehensive analysis of factors related to the success of international environmental institutions and global environmental laws.
