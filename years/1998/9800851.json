The study of these algebras has led to important discoveries in statistical mechanics, quantum groups, particle physics, and invariants of knots and 3-manifolds.  The main focus is to answer important questions from representation theory and geometry using discrete, combinatorial constructions. The primary example of a Coxeter group is the symmetric group of permutations of the numbers 1,2, ..., n.  This group arises naturally in many physical settings, such as the study of the chemical structure of molecules and the physics of subatomic particles. Many important questions regarding the representation theory  of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of the symmetric group have recently been answered combinatorially.  These questions extend naturally to general Coxeter  groups, their (finite) Iwahori-Hecke algebras, and the (infinite) affine Hecke algebras. A main thrust of this project is to answer these questions in these general settings. One focus of this research is to understand the relationship between different bases of the irreducible matrix representations of these algebras, in particular to produce explicit combinatorial descriptions of the transformation matrices between these bases.  A second focus is to explore a representation of the Hecke algebra on cosets of a Borel subgroup of a finite Chevalley group.  The trace of this representation counts fixed points in the flag variety of the group, determines a Frobenius formula for characters of the Hecke algebra, and, at least in type-A, provides a natural pairing between conjugacy classes of the underlying Weyl group and unipotent classes of the Chevalley group. This project incorporates a collection of undergraduate research projects that study algebras that are generalizations of the symmetric group.  Students will derive character algorithms and compute characters relations for these algebras.  They will implement and  analyze character algorithms for the Hecke algebras and use the implementations to study further questions in character theory.     This research is in the general area of combinatorics. One of the goals of combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying ways that discrete collections of objects can be arranged and used to concretely model abstract or complex phenomena. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely important in modern communications and is used in the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems.",
