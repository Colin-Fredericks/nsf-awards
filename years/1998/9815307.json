 "awd_abstract_narration": "Monitoring one's performance plays a critical role in the self-regulation of cognition and behavior.  Recently there has been a substantial amount of research examining the role of monitoring in cognitive performance.  For example, in terms of memory performance, inefficient monitoring results in poor assessments of the contents of our memories (i.e., deciding whether we know some information) and poor assessments of the amount of time required to learn some specified material.  Surprisingly, there has been little research examining the role of monitoring in acquiring skills; more specifically, in acquiring complex skills.    There are three goals to this project.  The first is to identify psycho-physiological, as well as neuro-psychological, correlates of monitoring performance.  This will be accomplished by obtaining measures from several psycho-physiological measures as well as several neuro-psychological tests.  These measures will be correlated with three monitoring stages: (a) assessments or predictions of how one will do when acquiring a complex skill; (b) assessments of how one is doing when acquiring the skill; and (c) assessments of how well one did upon completion of the task, and (d) assessments of how one will do in similar situations.  The second goal is to identify the role played by monitoring in acquiring complex skills.  This will be accomplished by assessing how well individuals monitor their performance at each of the acquisition stages.  The third goal is to develop a rehabilitation program for individuals with less-than-optimal monitoring performance (e.g., older adults as well as individuals with neuro-degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's).  It is argued that monitoring one's performance, be it the monitoring of one's cognitive processes or the monitoring of one's behavior, requires substantial amounts of working memory resources.  Thus, monitoring one's performance reduces the amount of working memory resources that are available for other tasks, such as acquiring complex skills.  If monitoring interferes with the acquisition process then it may be possible to develop techniques that can aid individuals in acquiring complex skills by `bypassing` the use of monitoring processes.  The effectiveness of several techniques will be examined such as the Procedural Reinstatement Hypothesis which states that skill performance will be optimal when the same procedures that were used in acquiring the skill match those that are used to carry out the skill at some later point in time.",
