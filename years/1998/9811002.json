The two plan to develop pesticide biosensors using chlorpyrifos (CPS) which is widely used in Egypt.  Antibodies (Abs) will be produced for use as sensing peptides.  Materials produced at Dr. Eldefrawi's laboratory will be used to construct a dipstick biosensor for field use to detect CPS and the data will be validated by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) analysis of the same samples.  The knowledge gained will be used for future construction of a portable enzyme electrode for detection and quantification of CPS.  The technology and procedures are applicable to most pesticides and other chemicals of environmental concerns.\r\n\r\n Scope:  This award will allow collaboration between Egyptian and US scientists who have significant complementary technical background and expertise to carry out the proposed research.  The US scientist has extensive experience in biosensor technology, while the Egyptian scientist has long experience in pesticide chemistry, and in chromatographic techniques.  This project will provide for a new method of detecting environmentally hazard chemicals that are widely used as pesticides in developing countries, using relatively simple but accurate methods.  This proposal meets the INT objective of increasing US-foreign collaboration in areas that benefit both sides.   This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities. \r\n\r\n",
