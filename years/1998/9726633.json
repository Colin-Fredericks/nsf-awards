 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726633  Fink    This award supports a three year collaborative research  project between Professor Anthony Fink of the University of  California at Santa Cruz and Professor Hiroshi Kihara of the  Kansai Medical University in Japan.  The researchers will be  exploring protein  folding at subzero temperatures.  The  objective of the research is to use subzero temperatures to  slow the rate of protein folding down so that early events  in folding may be monitored.  In particular, they are  interested in using small-angle X-ray scattering to measure  the rate at which an unfolded protein becomes compact.  Information about concurrent secondary and tertiary  structure formation will be obtained from parallel  investigations using circular dichroism and fluorescence.     This project brings together the efforts of two  laboratories that have complementary expertise, research  capabilities and equipment.  The U.S. researchers' primary  expertise is in subzero temperature protein folding and the  Japanese expertise in the use of small-angle X-ray  scattering to follow conformational changes in proteins.  Current stopped-flow technology is limited to processes with  lifetimes of about a millisecond or longer.  the initial  collapse of proteins is believed to occur on a faster  timescale.  By using subzero temperatures, in conjunction  with suitable cryosolvents, they can significantly slow the  protein folding process, effectively extending the window of  observation to shorter timescales.  Knowledge of the rate at  which the protein collapses is very important and will help  distinguish competing models for folding.  This should  significantly increase our understanding of the process of  protein folding.  Through the exchange of ideas and  technology, this project will broaden our base of basic  knowledge and promote international understanding and  cooperation.  ***",
