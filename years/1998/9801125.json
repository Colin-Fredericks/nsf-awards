Serving as a mechanism of genetic change, natural hybridization has the potential to produce novel and relatively fit hybrid genotypes which, in turn, can affect the pattern of evolution between hybridizing species.  Contemporary hybrid zone studies emphasize experimental determination of the relative fitness of hybrid and parental genotypes and measurements of the interactions between the environment and genotype.  The distributions of two amphibian species, Rana blairi and Rana sphenocephala, meet and hybridization occurs in a zone extending from Missouri to Texas.  Hybridization frequently occurs between these two species in Missouri, but is more limited in Texas populations.  It is only through experimental analysis of relative parental and hybrid fitness from these two unique geographic areas that we can understand if different evolutionary processes are structuring the hybrid zone in these two areas.  Preliminary experimental evidence from Missouri localities suggests that certain hybrid genotypes posses equivalent or higher levels of fitness compared to parental genotypes.  Thus, certain hybrid genotypes may maintain a relative fitness advantage over parental genotypes in some environments, potentially leading to the replacement of parental genotypes with recombinant ones.  Empirical approaches to hybrid zone analyses provide direct methods of measuring important components of lifetime fitness for both parental and hybrid genotypes.  These methods are critical for understanding the effect that hybridization can have on patterns of hybrid zone structure and evolution.\r\n",
