The University of Texas at El Paso    CISE Research Instrumentation: A Multiprocessor Platform for Cross-Disciplinary Research in Parallel Systems    This research instrumentation enables the following research projects:- Dynamic and Adaptive Multiprocessor Resource Management, - Run-Time Monitoring of Parallel Programs, and- A Parallel Implementation of SequenceL Programs.    To support the aforementioned projects, the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) will purchase additional processors and memory, a star router to interconnect them, a DLT autochanger, a spare hot-swappable hard drive, and software to upgrade their SGI/Cray Origin 2000.    The upgraded multiprocessor system provides a platform that builds upon funded-research efforts and creates new cross-disciplinary research opportunities in the area of parallel systems.  The system supports research in computer and information science and engineering, in particular, research in: end-to-end performance modeling of large, heterogeneous, adaptive parallel/distributed computer/communication systems; dynamic and adaptive multiprocessor resource management; run-time monitoring of sequential and parallel programs; and very high-level parallel programming languages for data mining applications.  This research is significant because it addresses important performance issues with respect to the design of future parallel architectures, in particular, the   memory hierarchy of these systems; the feasibility of run-time monitoring of the integrity of software; and the effectiveness of mining large databases.    The research requires, and the system provides, the ability to: characterize process resource demands, measure application performance, acquire parameters for multiprocessor system modeling, validate multiprocessor simulations, and perform parallel discrete event simulation. With these methods, it is possible to evaluate the performance of dynamic and adaptive multiprocessor  resource management policies; various implementations of integrity-constraint monitoring, in particular, concurrent processes; and very high-level programming constructs.",
