 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  CTS-9809784  Glauser & Ahmadi  Clarkson University      Presently Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurement cannot be experimentally obtained at sufficiently high sample rates due to bandwidth limitation with pulsed YAG lasers (15 Hz or less typically).  This poses a problem when dealing with high Reynolds number flows and, in particular, with time dependent and temporally evolving flows if more than just snapshots of the flow are required.  The objective of this research is to develop and fine tune a technique that is based on two-dimensional (2-D) Spatial Linear Stochastic Estimation (LSE) which will provide a solution to the low sample rate problem.  The method combines the outstanding temporal bandwidth characteristics of hot-wires with the superb spatial resolution of the PIV.  The instantaneous velocities are measured via hot-wire anemometry at a few optimally selected points in space, simultaneous velocities are then estimated at the remaining spatial positions where the correlations, obtained from the PIV measurements, are known.  This new and important technique can be developed to its fullest potential at Clarkson University.  In addition, the PIV system will add a much needed capability to the Experimental Turbulence Laboratory and will impact several current and future major experimental research projects.",
