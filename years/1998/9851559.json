 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project enhances our popular introductory statistics courses. We plan to increase participatory learning activities for students and better incorporate student use of computer-based tools that are pervasive in the practice of statistics. The college's innovative One-Course-At-A-Time (OCAAT) academic schedule provides a flexible setting for developing and implementing the proposed project.    We are equipping a statistics classroom with one computer for each two students and one computer for the course instructor, each supplied with appropriate statistical software. More than just a computer lab, the use of computer-based statistical software will be thoroughly integrated into our statistics courses, especially through use in exploratory data analysis class activities. Seven to nine statistics course sections will be offered each year in the computerized statistics classroom. This will enhance the learning of statistics for over 150 students annually. Over half of Cornell students--social science students, future teachers, natural science students, and other liberal arts students--will benefit from the improved instruction during their academic careers.    During the first year of the project we will establish and equip the classroom; modify our introductory statistics courses by increasing student use of software tools in data analysis and incorporating hands-on activities (designed and tested elsewhere) into classroom instruction; begin using statistical software in examinations; and publish on-line course materials on our Web site. During the second year of the project we will develop our own activities and fine tune the integration of technology into course work and examinations. When the project is complete, we will have developed a model introductory statistics course for a liberal arts college. The results of our work will be of special interest to schools that offer introductory statistics courses in a condensed format, including summer school, workshops, and on-line courses.",
