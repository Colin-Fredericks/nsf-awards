 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714946  Shield    Samarium-iron compounds with interstitial nitrogen (Sm-Fe-N)  comprise a promising class of magnetic materials with  properties competitive to those of Nd-Fe-B permanent  magnets.  This project seeks to accomplish two interrelated  objectives: (1) to control the microstructure evolution in  Sm-Fe-N-based permanent magnets through processing and alloy  development; (2) to establish relationships between the  microstructure and magnetic properties in Sm-Fe-N-based  permanent magnets.  Of primary concern is the influence of  grain boundaries, second phases, and grain size on the  magnetic properties.  To control microstructure evolution,  alloys are designed that effectively enhance the formation  of the samarium-iron compound during rapid solidification  processing.  Alloying additions, such as Ti, Zr, Si, V, C,  and combinations of these, are used to alter the  solidification behavior of Sm-Fe alloys.  The goal is to  either enhance the formation of the Sm-Fe compound at lower  solidification rates or to suppress the formation of  crystalline phases altogether.  In the latter case the  resultant amorphous materials are crystallized to the Sm-Fe  compound.  Subsequent nitrogenation results in the hard  magnetic Sm-Fe-N phase.  The relationships between the  microstructure and magnetic properties of Sm-Fe-N-based  permanent magnets should be clarified in this project.  %%%  The most notable advantage of Sm-Fe-N materials over Nd-Fe-B  magnets is the Curie temperature (approximately 150 degrees  C higher) allowing applications in more demanding thermal  environments.  However, Sm-Fe-N magnets pose many  challenges, especially with regards to intelligent  processing and understanding of the microstructure-property  relationships.   ***",
