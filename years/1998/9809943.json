 "awd_abstract_narration": "Joseph V. Martin  IBN 98-09943    The goal of the proposal is to clarify how thyroid hormones  influence the adult mammalian brain.  During growth and  development, hormones from the thyroid gland enter many cell  types (including brain cells) and alter protein synthesis.  In adulthood, the cellular metabolic rate is accelerated by  thyroid hormones entering cells of many tissues, but not in  the brain. However, some of the potentially most  debilitating complications of thyroid glandular disease in  adulthood are due to neurological disorders, ranging from  anxiety and sleep problems to seizures or coma.  The  preliminary evidence demonstrates that thyroid hormones bind  to and influence the function of brain GABAa receptors.   These proteins on the outside of neuronal membranes are  responsible for cellular effects of the major inhibitory  neurotransmitter (local chemical messenger between neurons),  gamma-aminobutyric acid or GABA.  Further preliminary work  indicates effects of thyroid hormones on the whole brain  electrical activity, as measured in the electroencephalogram  (EEG). Experiments will be performed in rats to determine  the types of effects that thyroid hormones have on the GABAa  receptor binding and the subsequent cellular response. Small  amounts of thyroid hormones will be injected directly into  selected brain areas to ascertain the sensitivity of the  sites in mediating thyroid hormonal effects on EEG and  temperature regulation. The results of these studies will  elucidate the biological significance of a brain action of  thyroid hormones that more closely resembles the action of a  neurotransmitter than the typical action of thyroid hormones  in other tissues.",
