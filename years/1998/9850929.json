 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposed project, equipment will be provided for seniors in the department of electrical engineering taking senior design. Matching support for twenty projects covering two years is being requested. Through this support, student design teams will be able to build, test, and  demonstrate electronic devices which they have designed on paper. Through this hands-on experience, the students will gain    A far better understanding of electrical engineering through hands-on experience,      A far greater understanding of how the subjects and tools presented to them over the past three years apply,      Experience working in a team environment (since each project is completed by a \"team\" of 2-4 students)~ and      Exposure to the design process, from concept to working prototype.      Further, the devices designed, built, and tested in senior design will enhance the education and recruitment of engineers throughout the educational process. Many of these projects will be focused on developing specialized laboratory experiments and equipment. These projects will then allow small universities, colleges, and K- 12 schools to obtain equipment for their laboratories which were either too expensive or nonexistent. Additional projects will originate from local industries, giving the students, faculty, and company employees exposure to the needs and capabilities of each other. Each of these projects (once completed) will be presented to the sponsor and other students on campus - aiding with recruitment and retention of undergraduates through demonstrating how some of the tools they are learning can be applied.",
