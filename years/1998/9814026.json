Besides being a  food source for many species of seabirds and marine mammals,  krill also forms the basis of an important commercial  fishery.  Since the First International Symposium on Krill  was held in 1982, many research projects have addressed  issues of krill distribution, abundance and biology.  The  purpose of this symposium is to review current knowledge of  krill biology, to highlight gaps and future areas for  research and to show how the comparative study of different  species of krill can illuminate more general problems (for  example, krill flux, recruitment, swarming behavior, age and  growth).  The symposium will focus on the functional aspects  of krill biology, rather than krill distribution, abundance  and behavior in different environments. An international  group of scientists will participate in the symposium and  results will be published in the peer-reviewed scientific  literature.  This symposium will advance the field by  providing new synthesis and insight into current research  and by providing direction for the future.",
