 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804061  Reusable object-oriented software components often must be  adapted to fit into a new application that also uses other,  independently developed components. This research investigates  Binary Component Adaptation (BCA), a new way to integrate  components. Component adaptation takes place after the  component has been delivered to the reusing programmer, and the  component is directly modified in place in order to make changes.  By directly rewriting binaries, BCA combines the flexibility of  source-level changes without incurring its disadvantages. BCA can  rewrite component binaries at load time and also guarantees  release-to-release compatibility. That is, an adaptation is  guaranteed to be compatible with a new binary release of the  underlying component as long as the release does not modify the  public interface except by adding new elements. A BCA system will  be constructed for Java to show that an efficient implementation  is feasible, and will be made available publicly to allow an  evaluation of BCA's usefulness based on  the feedback received from external users. BCA promises to solve  a number of important integration and evolution problems; if  successful, it could significantly improve the reusability of  Java components, thus reducing software development costs.***",
