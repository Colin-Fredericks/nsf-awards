 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI -9800274  Thomas   This work is to develop mathematical models of transient fluid flow in the continuous casting of steel slabs, validate them with measurements, and apply them to provide a detailed understanding of how defects form, so that the process can be improved.  Continuous casting accounts for 89 percent of the 100 million tons of steel produced each year in the United States. Continued viability of the high-volume-low-profit-margin steel industry depends on improving the quality of the steel product while also increasing efficiency. Plant observations have found that many serious quality problems are directly associated with the flow pattern in the mold region. This flow is highly turbulent, and is characterized by large scale unsteady recirculation. A better understanding of the flow physics would enable improvements to process modeling and future optimization. With many different operations to optimize, the industry can no longer afford the traditional trial-and-error approach.  This project will advance the state-of-the-art of Large-Eddy-Simulation flow modeling, which has not previously addressed a process of this complexity.    The models will be calibrated and validated through experimental measurements obtained in both the research labs and plants of a consortium of steel companies, who are cosponsoring this work. Then, based on the improved fundamental understanding gained from model application, improved nozzle designs and operating conditions that minimize defects will be found.  In the future, as thin slab and strip casting processes continue to be developed, the computational tools developed in this work can be applied to these new processes as well.",
