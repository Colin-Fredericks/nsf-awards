 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a radically new approach to vector calculus that is completely aligned with recent reform efforts in other college entry-level math, science, and engineering (MSE) courses. As part of this larger MSE curriculum, it brings more coherence and consistency to it, emphasizing the common foundation for much of these courses. Sophisticated computer visualization is vigorously exploited as it has opened a completely new avenue to vector calculus, allowing to reconnect the concepts of vectorial derivatives back to their foundation, local linearity. Students now can see the curl by zooming. Connections to concepts of linear algebra and differential equations perspectives are omnipresent. The curriculum is ideally suited for cooperative learning environments where students are guided to make many key discoveries themselves via often dramatic computer experiments. The new course is also broadening the range of applications (beyond the traditional EM and fluid dynamics) by drawing on modern geometric control which has ubiquitous applications, even connecting to recent research achievements that fit into this sophomore course. The curriculum is being implemented in the form of interactive texts, and is using modern electronic media and the WWW for rapid dissemination. Assessment of the enhanced learning experiences is an integral part of the project. This curriculum is having a high impact on both MSE majors and future math and science teachers by conveying a coherent and modern view of advanced mathematics.",
