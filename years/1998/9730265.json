 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between childhood economic deprivation and several early adult outcomes, including (1) the timing and sequencing of family formation, (2) school completion and socioeconomic attainment, and (3) avoiding antisocial and self-destructive behaviors and practicing prosocial behaviors. The proposed study uses recent young adult supplements of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). These data will be linked to records from earlier NLSY samples including mother and family records, adults' assessments of childhood development, and neighborhood indicators specially created from zip-code addresses provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the first time. There are three specific objectives: to use these data to describe and model the economic trajectories of `at risk` young adults during childhood; to estimate the deleterious effects of family income trajectories during childhood on critical indicators of successful adjustment in late adolescence and early adulthood; to evaluate the causal mechanisms underlying these connections, as well as identify the moderating influences of neighborhood and family context on successful early adult transitions. The overriding objective is to bring together several disparate literatures in a unified theoretical and analytical framework. The study will provide a unique opportunity to examine the first generation of `at risk` adults who grew up with the major social and economic upheavals of the past two decades.",
