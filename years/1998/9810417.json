 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810417  Kerrick    Following a period of marked earthquake activity in 1989,  emission of CO2 from the flanks of Mammoth Mountain, California,  resulted in large areas of tree kill.  This region again  experienced considerable seismic unrest in 1997.  Using a  portable fluxmeter, the PI's measured CO2 emission in the largest  tree kill area (Horseshoe Lake) in August, 1997, and January,  1998. These measurements suggest that there was a significant  increase in CO2 flux within this period.  To shed light on the  controls of CO2 degassing through the volcanic edifice at Mammoth  Mountain, and to monitor for volcanic hazard, there is a  compelling need to continuously monitor CO2 emission at Mammoth  Mountain.  Accordingly, this grant provides funds to purchase,  install and maintain equipment to continuously monitor CO2 flux  at a carefully chosen site in the Horseshoe Lake tree kill area  at Mammoth Mountain.  The continuous flux measurement system is  based on the accumulation chamber principle where CO2 flux is  derived from the rate of increase of CO2 concentration  immediately following placement of the chamber on the ground  surface.  The continuous monitoring system automatically makes  flux measurements every 30 minutes and acquires and stores data  that is remotely transmitted via a UHF telemetry system.  The  instrumentation will be constructed and installed by West Systems  of Pisa, Italy, who have successfully installed and field tested  identical instruments in European localities of high CO2 flux.  Following installation and training by the West Systems  personnel, the P.I. and John Rogie (a Penn State graduate student  carrying out research on CO2 emission) will be involved in  instrument maintenance, and in the acquisition and interpretation  of the data. Matching funds for this equipment acquisition will  be provided through the Volcano Hazards program of the U.S.  Geological Survey.  Accordingly, this equipment acquisition is  enthusiastically supported by U.S.G.S. personnel wh o are actively  involved in surveillance of unrest at Mammoth Mountain and the  Long Valley caldera.  ***",
