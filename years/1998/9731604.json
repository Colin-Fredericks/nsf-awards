 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9731604  The Physics Department at Rensselaer will continue a REU  Site program for weeks to be held in each summer from 1998  to 2000.  The program will involve 10 undergraduate  students, at least six from other institutions, to  participate in frontier physics research by pairing up with  senior graduate students under the supervision of  experienced faculty members.  The available projects cover a  variety of topics including Astrophysics, Condensed Matter  Physics, Optical Physics, Particle and Nuclear Physics, and  Innovative Undergraduate Physics Education.  Our philosophy  of the undergraduate research project is to let the students  experience the challenge, the excitement, and sometimes  frustrations in research outside the lecture room.  The  final goal is to attract and encourage talented students  into careers in science and engineering.  ***",
