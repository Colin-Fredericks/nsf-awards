 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genetic makeup of crop plants is the fundamental basis for yield, grain quality, plant breeding and crop improvement.  In principle, this genetic makeup can be determined by sequencing plant DNA, and in this way identifying most if not all of the genes encoded by a given plant genome.  Sophisticated software tools are becoming available that allow a great deal of information to be extracted from sequence data, but ultimately the function of a gene can only be determined by genetic analysis.  Classically, this has been achieved by subjecting plants to mutagenizing agents, such as chemicals or X-rays, and then searching for those mutants that have a desired property or trait.  The gene mutated in each case can then be identified by a laborious genetic procedure to ultimately isolate the corresponding sequence of DNA.  The availability of large amounts of methodically determined DNA sequence information, however, allows a novel, systematic approach to be taken to determine gene function.  This approach, first pioneered in model animal genomes such as the fruitfly Drosophila and the nematode worm, C. elegans, involves first constructing a library of thousands of organisms, each of which has a different spectrum of mutations.  This library is then screened directly with a DNA sequence to identify mutations in a given gene.  Two technological advances make this possible.  The first is the use of transposable elements as the mutational agent.  Transposable elements were first discovered in maize at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory by Dr. Barbara McClintock in the 1940s.  These elements have a conserved DNA structure enabling them to be readily identified in the genome.  They disrupt genes at random, simultaneously providing the mutation of interest, and labeling the gene with the conserved DNA sequence.  The second technology is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which allows such DNA sequences to be amplified from individual plants giving immediate access to a plant carrying a given mutation.  Scientists at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory have combined these advances to develop a systematic method for determining gene function in maize.  Robertson's Mutator transposable elements, first characterized at the DNA level at the University of California at Berkeley, are uniquely suited for this purpose, and a sophisticated genetic strategy has been developed allowing large populations of plants to be screened for mutations in pools.  In partnership with Novartis AG, geneticists at Cold Spring Harbor and Berkeley are developing a population of 40,000 plants, and DNA samples are being extracted.  Seed from each plant will be cataloged and stored.  The PCR reaction will be performed on DNA pools derived from this population so that seed corresponding to mutations in a given gene can be readily identified.  Individual geneticists from the maize community will be able to send in sequence information for targeted disruption of genes of interest to them.  The information will be entered into a database, and seed corresponding to the mutation will be distributed to interested researchers to allow them to determine the function of each gene chosen in this way.  The Mutator Targeted Mutagenesis (MTM) system can thus be used to build up a database of gene function in maize, eventually comprising a significant proportion of the genetic makeup of this crucial crop plant.",
