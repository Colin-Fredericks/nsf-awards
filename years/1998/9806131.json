 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is broadly concerned with the production and perception of nonlinguistic, indexical cues in speech and in laughter.  Recent findings support a theoretical approach to indexical cueing that integrates the source-filter theory of speech production with knowledge regarding both sexually dimorphic and individual variation in vocal production-related anatomy.  Testing vowel segment acoustics extracted from running speech, very high classification success rates were achieved using this framework.  Extensions of this work will include examining a broader range of articulatory gestures and testing the perceptual importance of statistically identified patterns of acoustic cues.  Results of preliminary analyses indicate that this application of the source-filter model is also useful for understanding indexical cueing in laughter.  Furthermore, these results indicate that while laugh acoustics are highly complex, they appear to vary predictably in response to relevant social contexts.  Together, these outcomes provide support for the perspective that laughter is an evolutionarily conserved vocal communication repertoire.  In order to understand the functional significance of laugh sounds, variation in laugh acoustics will be studied using both comparative and perceptual research strategies.  This project is concerned with fundamental issues in human vocal communication.  The results will advance knowledge regarding the production and perception of indexical and motivationally significant cues in speech and other species-typical vocalizations.  With this POWRE Visiting Professorship award, the investigator will receive training in some unfamiliar research methods and analytic techniques at Cornell University.  More specifically, in the context of the experiments that will be performed in this project, training in comparative bioacoustics, perceptual methodologies, and speech synthesis techniques will be provided.  This training and collaboration with experts in human vocal communication will enhance the investigator's ongoing research and her career development.",
