 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grodzicker  97-26948    This proposal requests support for the third biannual open-invitation Conference on Zebrafish Development and Genetics.  The meeting will focus on the cellular, molecular, and genetic regulation of development and growth in zebrafish, the only vertebrate in which systematic large scale screens for embryonic lethal mutations have been conducted.  The following sessions are planned:  1) Early development and axis formation I,  2)  Axis formation II,  3)  Somitogenesis and muscle formation,  4) Central nervous system,  5) Neural crest and head development,  6) Sensory systems  7) Organogenesis,  8) Other aspects  of development  9) Genomics,  10) Innovative methodologies,  11) Perspectives from other fish, and 12) Keynote address.  The Perspectives session will expose the zebrafish community to related work in a few other key fish (Medaka, Xiphophorus, the pufferfish).  The Keynote address will be given by a developmental geneticist whose primary interest is not zebrafish, but who is likely to stimulate zebrafish workers to broaden their ways of thinking about the ways they approach their research topic.  The proposed meeting will attract members from most zebrafish laboratories, and will provide an open arena for the presentation of the latest research results.  It will also provide an opportunity for the exchange of materials and information about evolving technologies and methodological approaches.  About 360 people attended the previous meeting and presentations  were given by investigators from 17 countries.  They anticipate an increased number of applications for attendance at the proposed meeting.",
