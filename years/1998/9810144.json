 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study assesses the viability of forest uses in Kabarole District, western Uganda, in terms of particular measures of resiliency and sustainability.  Four different communities have access to forest resources (domestic users, brewery and still operators, brick and charcoal producers, and tea companies), and the members of each of these communities vary in their capacity to extract and benefit from the forest resources.  In addition, four different property regimes characterize the forest property systems in Western Uganda:  (1) state forests, (2) royal and church forests, (3) corporate forests, and (4) village forests.  The study will examine the way in which these property systems disparately affect the measures of resiliency and sustainability employed in the study.   The energy efficiency of the cooking and industrial burning technology employed by these user groups will be analyzed and compared to determine if ownership of the forest resource and/or the technology explains patterns of efficiency.  The project uses a regional political ecology framework to integrate the notions of forest access and control by these diverse (and often conflicting) actors with empirical assessments of actual forest conditions.  At the core of the research is the recognition that forest conservation and management in developing countries must incorporate local resource demands and foster local participation in forest management.",
