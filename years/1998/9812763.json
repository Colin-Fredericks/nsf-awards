The next two workshops will take  place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (June 8-10, 1998) and  Honolulu, Hawaii (November 2-4, 1998).  A third will be held  in Africa.  For the Rio workshop, participants from  Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the U.S. will be invited.  Themes will include:  energy/transportation, infrastructure,  communication, and education.  For the Hawaii workshop  participants from the following countries will be invited:  China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, Australia, Singapore,  Malaysia, Taiwan, India, and the U.S.  Topics for that  workshop will include:  energy/transportation,  education/policy/informational network, and research  resource management.  The workshop in Africa is currently  under planning.  %%%  The programs of the workshops will focus on discussions of  topics pre-agreed upon by the organizers from the  participating countries.  The goal of the workshops is to  enhance international collaboration in materials research,  technology, and education. To assure that this goal is  realistically met, a materials World-Net that will  electronically link materials-related international sites is  being developed.  This activity is jointly supported by the  Division of Materials Research and the office of  Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS, the Division of  Chemical and Transport System in ENG, and the Division of  International Programs in SBE.  ***",
