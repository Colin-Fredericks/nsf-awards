 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 98-08861 LI (Christine).  Different components of the nervous  system communicate with each other through the use of chemical  messengers.  These chemicals, known as neurotransmitters, are  strictly regulated within the body.  Imbalances in the levels of  neurotransmitters can have severe effects on the behavior of an  animal.  For instance, decreased levels of the neurotransmitter  dopamine is the basis of the behavioral deficits seen in patients  with Parkinson's Disease.  The laboratory of Dr. Christine Li has  been examining the regulation of neurotransmitters in a simple  model system, the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans.  C. elegans  offers many experimental advantages, such as ease of genetic  manipulations and generation of transgenic animals. Dr. Li has  been examining a specific family of neurotransmitters, the \"FLP  neuropeptides\", in C. elegans.  There are over 50 similar, but  distinct members of the FLP family in C. elegans.  The goal of her  lab is to elucidate the function of these different transmitters  and to determine how these chemicals signal to other parts of the  nervous system.  Thus far, it appears that despite the structural  similarities between different FLP transmitters, they have  different roles in C. elegans, and are present in different parts  of the nervous system.  This research may give insights into the  function of homologous transmitters in mammals, such as humans,  and reveal how these chemicals are used for communication among  different parts of the mammalian nervous system.",
