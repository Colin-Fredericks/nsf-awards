 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 1998 IEEE Infocom Conference on Computer Communications will be held  in San Francisco, California, from March 29 to April 2, 1998.  This  conference is the pre-eminent technical conference for presenting new  results in all areas of computer communications.  This proposal requests  funding to assist approximately a dozen United States-based graduate  students, post-docs and faculty in attending this meeting.   Participation in conferences such as Infocom is an extremely important  part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to  interact with more senior researchers and be exposed to leading edge  work in the field.  It is also vital to the continued development of  post-docs and faculty, particularly those relatively new to the rapidly  growing field of computer communications.  The support requested in this  proposal will enable the participation of students, post-docs and  faculty who would otherwise be unable to attend Infocom'98.",
