 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725017  Yang    This award supports a U.S.-China workshop on computational  mechanics in structural engineering. The U.S. organizer is  Jann Yang, University of California at Irvine; the Chinese  organizers are Gu Yuanxian and Zhong Wanxie, Dalian  University of Technology. This workshop will focus on recent  advances in structural engineering and identify possible  joint research efforts.    In the past two decades, the field of structural mechanics  has made important contributions to the practice of  structural engineering.  Computational mechanics, failure  and fracture mechanics, structural control and monitoring  have all made dramatic contributions to the improvement of  construction and maintenance of structural systems. The  development of a systems approach to civil infrastructure  has dramatically changed the research agenda in countries  worldwide. Given China's susceptibility to events such as  strong earthquakes, China has also emphasized research in  these areas, and has developed techniques and technologies  that are very competitive. This symposium will allow  exchange of current information and definition of mutually  advantageous joint research projects.  Participation will  include senior and junior researchers on both sides.  Support on the Chinese side will be provided by the National  Natural Science Foundation of  China and by the State  Education Commission.",
