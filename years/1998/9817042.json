This is a timely effort as the recently-released 12th-grade results from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) found that U.S. students enrolled in Advanced Placement (AP) Programs outperformed only one of the other 16 participating TIMSS countries.  The study's organizing question will be, \"Are secondary mathematics and science instruction and assessment programs doing all they can to help sutdents develop advanced competencies in these subjects?\"  The AP Programs, International Baccalaureates (IB) Programs and perhaps others will be examined.\r\n\r\nThe study will be carried out under the auspices of the Commission on Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education of the National Research Council (CBASSE).  A study committee of approximately 18 members will be named and will include experts in the subjects of calculus, physics and biology, as well as math and science education, assessment, cognitive science and education policy.  The committee will meet approximately seven times over the first 24 project months.  Additional meetings are scheduled for the six-month dissemination period.  The committee will gather information through fact-finding workshops, literature reviews and commissioned papers from independent scholars.  As a result of the study, a consensus report will be developed with recommendations that will address major aspects of the AP, IB and other programs under study and tie results to issues of concern in the mathematics and science education communities.\r\n",
