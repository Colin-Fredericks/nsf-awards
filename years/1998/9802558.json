For example, a manifold containing some  embedded essential surfaces, but no essential spheres, is called a  Haken manifold.  The geometric structure of Haken manifolds is well  understood, but unfortunately many manifolds are not Haken.  One is  thus forced to consider other lower dimensional objects in studying them,  such as laminations and immersed surfaces.  The objective of this project  is to understand the role of immersed essential surfaces in 3-manifolds,  particularly the issue of whether such surfaces will lift to embedded  surfaces in a finite covering.  This would be an important step toward  a clear understanding of the topological and geometric structure of  3-manifolds.       Manifolds appear naturally in physics and other sciences, since a  manifold is an object for which each point is surrounded by a small  neighborhood the same as one in the solid ball in a Euclidean space.  If the Euclidean space in question is of dimension three, we call such  a manifold a 3-manifold.  This being the dimension in which we live,  it is not surprising that 3-manifolds have attracted a great deal of  attention in mathematics and physics.  What is perhaps more surprising  is the extent to which 3-manifolds have shown themselves resistant to   analysis, generally more so than manifolds of dimensions above five,  where our 3-dimensional intuitions flounder but other tools come to the  rescue.  Most of these tools are not available in dimension three, and  that is what is at issue here, finding alternatives that do work in the  critical dimension three.  ***",
