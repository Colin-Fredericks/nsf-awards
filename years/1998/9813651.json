Mitsch This is an award for support of international travel by 6  persons who will participate in the SCOPE (Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment) Workshop on Ecological Engineering Applied to River and Wetland Restoration to be held in Paris, France from July 29-31, 1998.  This is the third of three workshops planned by the SCOPE Committee on Ecological Engineering and Ecosystem Restoration.  The prior workshop held in Estonia in 1995 addressed restoration of ecosystems damaged by air pollution, soil and water contamination.  The 1996 workshop that was held in China dealt with the integration of agricultural production, fertilizer production and pollution control.  Participants for whom support is provided by this award will contribute to workshop sessions on river and stream restoration, wetland uses for pollution control and coastal restoration.  \r\n\r\nResults of this award are expected to contribute toward identification of research needs associated with the application of ecological principles in restoration of damaged ecosystems.  Support for this award is being jointly provided by the Environmental Engineering and Environmental Technology elements of the Environmental and Ocean Systems Program in the Division of Bioengineering and Environmental Systems and by the Ecosystems Studies Program in the Division of Environmental Biology.\r\n\r\n",
