 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has recently been appreciated that quorum sensing, the ability of a bacterial species to monitor its own population density and activate specific sets of genes at appropriate cell concentrations, is a common trait. This trait is critical to the success of bacteria in adapting to changes in environmental conditions. The classic example of quorum sensing is the luminescent, symbiotic bacterium, Vibrio fischeri. Recent evidence indicates there are two quorum sensing systems in V. fischerii, one that is known to control expression of a set of genes including the luminescence genes and one that presumably controls another set of genes. With the exception of the luminescence genes, the target genes for the two quorum sensing systems remain undefined. The specific aims of this research project are to identify the genes controlled by each of the two quorum sensing systems and to determine whether control of individual genes is direct or indirect. Two main approaches will be taken to identify target genes. I. Wildtype and V. fischeri quorum sensing mutants will be employed to identify proteins expressed at higher levels with or without each of the signal molecules. This approach will involve pulse-chase radiolabeling of cellular proteins. II. Transposon mutagenesis of a V. fischeri quorum sensing null mutant with promoter probe vehicles will be employed to screen for and identify genes that require for their expression the presence or absence of either of the quorum sensing signals. The two main approaches to determine whether quorum sensing control of target genes is direct or indirect will be: I. To measure transcription of target genes in vitro. II. To examine expression of lacZ fusions to target gene promoters in recombinant Escherichia coli. Luminescence gene regulation is the best studied model of quorum sensing in gram negative bacteria. In this model and in other systems it has become clear that the role of quorum sensing in the general regulatory circuits of the cell is complex, yet this has not been investigated systematically. This research will open a new area of study in bacterial cell-to-cell communication.",
