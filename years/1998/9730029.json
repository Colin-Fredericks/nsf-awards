 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lawrence E. Raffalovich  The proposed research investigates the relationship between income inequality, economic development, and political democracy. It will focus on a crucial but neglected topic in stratification theory: the power of a small elite to appropriate a disproportionate share of society's surplus. A primary objective is to specify the structural sources and social consequences of this power. Time series analyses will permit the examination of models that incorporate both over-time change and cross-national differences in inequality. These models also can estimate the extent to which short-term power--such as the power to appropriate the immediate benefits of economic growth--is conditioned by the institutional structure of society, such as the extent of political democracy. This will help illuminate the apparent contradiction in prior research between longitudinal and cross-national findings. The proposed research will contribute to theory and research in social stratification, the sociology of development, and quantitative research methods. In addition, by examining both cross-national and longitudinal variation in inequality, the proposed research will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the short-run and long-run processes that produce observed patterns of inequality in society.",
