 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThis project brings together two lines of research in systems modeling - the study of complex dynamic systems and the use of participatory simulations.  The proposer plans to perform dynamic systems modeling that will be used in classrooms with hand held computers. Systems modeling can be designed to show how different interacting elements change and evolve over time, and how global phenomena can arise from local interaction of these elements, e.g. order vs. chaos, randomness vs. determinacy.  In other words, the theoretical and computer-based tools from this study show the changing phenomena of science and the everyday world. \r\n\r\nThe PI and co-PI will implement the system, HubNet, in classrooms at middle and high schools in Roxbury, Massachusetts and Austin, Texas.  A prototype of the system has been developed with the help of Texas Instruments (TI), and has already been piloted tested.  It has flexibility in being able to be uploaded as well as downloaded, can run modeling programs in both aggregate and object based programming languages. The PI's will be working with teachers who have the experience already, or will be given release time to gain the training in classroom networking as well as hand held computers.  The researchers and their graduate students will be collecting data on how the students are working and learning with the set of programs.\r\n\r\nThe proposal named a number of major deliverables.  Among them were such items as:\r\n\r\nPackage that can support and analyze results of learning in HubNet  Field-tested simulation packages and networked connections to traditional tools\r\n\r\n Fundamental research using participatory simulations as means into systems learning, and\r\n Set of tools for programming HubNet that would allow expansion as well as further dissemination.\r\n",
