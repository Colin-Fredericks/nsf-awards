The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and  experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Luis G. Valerio, Jr. to work with Dr. Xavier  Pares of the Universitat Autonoma de  Barcelona in Spain.  This project proposes to determine the  role of the alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) enzyme as a defense  mechanism against peroxidative damage to cellular membrane  lipids (lipid peroxidation) in a rat liver cell model of  enhanced oxidative stress. The objective is to understand  functional requirements of the ADH enzyme to metabolize 4-  hydroxynonenal, a major product of lipid peroxidation using  site-directed mutagenesis.  The PI will use both chemical  toxicology and molecular biology to do this investigation.  The findings of this research will provide a  multidisciplinary approach to understanding how this enzyme  functions and what its toxicological relationship is to  lipid peroxidation.    The host, Dr. Xavier Pares is Professor and Chair in the  Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the  University of Barcelona.  He has a close collaboration with  Dr. Hans Jornvall of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm,  Sweden.  They have made significant progress in the  understanding of our basic knowledge of the biological  function and evolutionary origins of the ADH enzyme.  Dr.  Valerio will become a member of this multi-country  collaboration.  Besides doing research with these two  internationally-respected colleagues, he will gain new  skills in molecular biology, computer-assisted molecular  modeling, and enzyme kinetics.  ***",
