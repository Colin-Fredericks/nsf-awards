 "awd_abstract_narration": "Schwartz  Recent work in judgment and decision making has begun to consider how people feel about the results of their decisions. When a risky situation turns out badly, how unhappy will you be?  Past research with simple gambles has shown that feelings depend not only on what happened to you, but on how likely it was, and what else could have happened. This project extends past work by examining an important set of real-world situations -- decisions about health and medical treatment.  How do people feel about the results of their medical decisions?  How do doctors feel? Can people anticipate their feelings, and do they use these anticipations to guide their choices between treatments?  A set of studies using undergraduate students and physicians explores these questions and others.",
