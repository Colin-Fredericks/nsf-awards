 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide a substantial, on-line collection of primary historical data that will reveal the interplay among sanitary engineering, laboratory science, social and cultural understandings of the determinants of disease, and urban transformation.  The project has three intermediate objectives.  First, we will digitize three sets of rare and hard-to-use documents that describe the creation and transformation of the New York City Department of Health, one of the most important social institutions of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries:  the 1865 report on the `Sanitary Condition of the City,` the `Annual Reports of the New York City Department of Health` from its creation in 1865 through 1920, and the 1890 compilation `Vital Statistics of New York City and Brooklyn.`  Second, these materials will form the backbone of a new web site, `Health, Wealth and the City:  Engineering Social and Urban Change in New York City, 1865-1920.`  As part of the site we will create interfaces for users to search and download the text and tables of the above documents, and will also host course syllabi and materials for distance learning.  Third, we will integrate such materials into the curriculum of Columbia's Program in the History of Public Health and Medicine and use them as the basis for faculty and student research.                                                       \u2524\u00c1>\u00a5\u2563\u00c2\u2563\u2502/\u00a5\u2563?> ?\u00c2 \u2510\u00a2\u00c1 \u2534\u00c1/\u255d ?> %\u2563\u00a5\u00a9\u2563\u2502 />\u2524 \u2593?>\u00c1 \u00a5??%\u00a2 \u00c2\u255d?_ /\u255d\u2502\u00a9/\u00c1?%?\u00c0\u2563\u2502/% \u00a2\u2563\u00a5\u00c1\u00a2  \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u2524\u00c1\u2514\u00c1%?\u2551_\u00c1>\u00a5 ?\u00c2 \u00a5/\u00a2\u00a5\u00c1 \u2593\u2510\u2524 _?\u255d\u2551\u00a9?%?\u00c0` />\u2524 \u00c0\u2510\u00a2\u00a5/\u00a5?\u255d` \u2551/\u00a5\u00a9\u2534/`\u00a2 \u2563> \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u2593\u255d/\u2563>\u00a2 ?\u00c2 \u00c2\u2563\u00a2\u00a9\u00c1\u00a2  />\u2524 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u00c1\u252c/_\u2563>/\u00a5\u2563?> ?\u00c2 \u00e1\u00a2\u2502?\u00a2\u2551?\u255d\u00c1\u00a2 ?\u00c2 &\u00a9`%%/\u2502\u00a9?\u255d/  \u00a1>\u2524\u00c1\u255d\u00c0\u255d/\u2524\u2510/\u00a5\u00c1\u00a2 \u2534\u2563%% \u2593\u00c1 \u2563>\u2514?%\u2514\u00c1\u2524 \u2534\u2563\u00a5\u00a9 _/>` ?\u00c2 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1\u00a2\u00c1 \u2551\u255d?\u00d5\u00c1\u2502\u00a5\u00a2 />\u2524 \u00a5\u00a9\u2510\u00a2 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u2563>\u00a2\u00a5\u255d\u2510_\u00c1>\u00a5/\u00a5\u2563?> \u2534\u2563%% \u00a2\u00c1\u255d\u2514\u00c1 /> \u2563_\u2551?\u255d\u00a5/>\u00a5 \u00c1\u2524\u2510\u2502/\u00a5\u2563?>/% \u00c2\u2510>\u2502\u00a5\u2563?>",
