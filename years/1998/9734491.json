This premier program emphasizes  the importance the National Science Foundation places on the  early development of academic careers dedicated to stimulating  the discovery process in which the excitement of research is  enhanced by inspired teaching and enthusiastic learning.  It  combines in a single program the support of research and  education of the highest quality and in the broadest sense.    The research activity involves the use of ultrasound-modulated  optical tomography (USMOT), a novel system combining an  ultrasonic transducer and a laser system, to study the acousto-  optical effects in liquid and gel turbid media (e.g. biological  tissues).  The specific tasks of the activity include: 1)  computer modeling of turbid acousto-optics; 2) effects of the  ultrasonic wave on the ultrasound modulation of light; 3) effects  of the light source on the ultrasound modulation of light; 4)  effects of the relative configuration between the ultrasonic wave  and light on the ultrasound modulation of light; 5) effects of  the acoustic and optical properties and geometry of the media;  and 6) characterization and optimization of images of turbid  media.  The educational plan aims to directly involve students in  the research, with specific goals including the development of a  new course in Optical Imaging, expansion of an existing course in  Medical Imaging, and outreach to pre-college students through the  Texas A&M Summer Student Program.    It  is  conjectured that the development of turbid acousto-optics  as a new field in optical engineering may lead to applications in  medicine, underwater detection, and atmospheric optics.  ***",
