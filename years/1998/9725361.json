 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725361  Bursik  Pyroclastic flows or  nuees ardentes are perhaps the most destructive, yet most poorly understood  of  volcanic phenomena.  Because of their destructiveness, they are virtually impossible  to observe directly; yet they leave deposits that have proven extremely difficult to interpret.  The primary objective of the proposed research is to determine in specific, well-constrained situations the link between active flow conditions in pyroclastic flows and the resulting deposits.    Because we may be able to determine what is happening within the flows, the results could have important ramifications for  the simulation of flows in hazards analysis, and for volcanic hazards assessment.  The proposed  work will  procede with experimental, theoretical and fieldwork phases.  The work will begin by carefully making deposits in the laboratory  under well-constrained flow conditions, using special facilities designed only for the purpose of these studies.   Theoretical modeling will  extend the range of applicability of the  experiments by generalizing the observed flow mechanics.  Laboratory and theoretical results will be tested by careful sedimentological analysis of  certain diagnostic portions of pyroclastic flow deposits, especially modern deposits for which there is some information on active flow conditions.",
