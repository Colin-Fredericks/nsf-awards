 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project further develops, evaluates, and disseminates a pilot project for a Java-based, interactive, self-paced learning module entitled \"Product Design for Injection Molding.\" This module was identified from a group of seven pilot modules for freshman engineering design as the project with the greatest likelihood of success as an on-line, multimedia learning tool and the  most potential impact beyond the Columbia courses in which it will be used.    The module strategically uses multimedia technology to enable users with little or no engineering background to learn and begin to apply basic mechanical design principles to reverse engineering problems and their own designs, both for injection molded parts and parts using related design principles. Educational institutions and companies can use the module to train students and new employees. The module also provides useful computational design tools that can be used on a day to day basis by practicing engineers.    This is a collaborative effort among Columbia University, industrial partners (Texas Instruments, Inc. and Symbol Technologies, Inc.), and several NYC high schools. The criticism, use and evaluation of the module by this diverse group helps to direct and focus the development of the module. The different computer platforms and skill levels of the team members will also ensure that the module is universally portable and useable.    Formative and summative evaluations of the module will be conducted by experts from Columbia's Teachers College with an emphasis on the effectiveness of the module in attracting, motivating, and retaining students of all backgrounds in engineering. A substantial fraction of the high school students have backgrounds that have been traditionally disenfranchised from professional engineering.    Dissemination to industry, academia, and high schools will leverage the resources of the Society of Plastics Engineers and a coalition of 80 NYC K-l 2 schools fostering technology enabled education.",
