 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729609  Cook  The objective of this research is a determination of the  mechanism of O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (OASS-A), a pyridoxal  phosphate (PLP) dependent enzyme .  The kinetic and chemical  mechanisms of OASS-A have been determined, and the three  dimensional structure of the enzyme has been solved.  A number of  questions still remain concerning the mechanism.  The slow steps  in the first half of the reaction have been identified, but  virtually nothing is known concerning the second half of the  reaction.  In this project, the reaction mechanism will be probed  using presteady state and steady state kinetic techniques.  Kinetic isotope effects will be used to obtain information on the  second half of the reaction. The stereochemistry of the  elimination of acetic acid and the addition of H2S, and whether a  quinonoid intermediate exists along the reaction pathway will  also be examined.  Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis will be  used to identify the enzyme residue that interacts with the  acetyl side chain of OAS, groups that interact with the cofactor,  and residue(s) involved in binding the alpha-carboxyl of OAS. The  long term goal remains an elucidation of the mechanism of the  multienzyme complex cysteine synthetase, composed of serine  transacetylase and OASS.  A complete description of the  mechanisms of the component enzymes alone and in complex will be  determined.  The present project, however, focuses on the study  of OASS-A.    A study of the mechanism catalyzed by OASS-A should significantly  increase our understanding of PLP enzymes in general, and those  that catalyze beta-replacement reactions.  Isotope effects is a  technique that allows one to look at the structure of the  activated complex (transition state) as reactant is converted to  product, and the types of bonds formed and broken during the OASS  reaction and the differences in chemistry compared to other PLP  enzymes make OASS-A of interest.  A knowledge of transition state  structure provides a basis f or bactericides for PLP-dependent  enzymes catalyzing beta-replacement reactions.  The OASS-A  reaction provides potential for the production of a number of  novel beta-substituted amino acids.",
