 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project develops an interactive multimedia intelligent tutoring system (IMITS). The IMITS will be used within regularly scheduled required courses for electrical engineering undergraduate students. Its purpose will be to monitor a student's interactions with multimedia learning modules. The IMITS will analyze the student's interactions to decipher what the student is learning, is not learning and is learning incorrectly. When learning difficulties are discovered the IMITS will tutor the student. The tutoring will consist of identifying any logical or procedural flaws that the student may have assimilated and then dynamically modifying both the instructional sequence and the amount of detail presented within the multimedia modules. These modifications are made so that the student may understand any logical flaws and correct them as well as clear up any misunderstanding about the material. The project consists of three major tasks: 1) to develop and integrate the components necessary to form an interactive multimedia intelligent tutoring system; 2) to use existing modules as well as develop a new set of interactive multimedia modules to be used with the tutoring system; and 3) to implement the system as a supplement to portions of existing courses.",
