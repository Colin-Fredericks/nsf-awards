 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Crompton  9801134    Limb reduction in terrestrial vertebrates (tetrapods) is a common  phenomenon. Some lineages reduce the total size of their limbs or lose them  altogether, while others simply reduce the total number of bones  (amphibians have only four fingers and birds have only three). Despite the  common occurrence of limb reduction in tetrapods, the evolutionary and  developmental mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood.  This study will take an integrative approach to understanding the  morphological, molecular, and functional aspects of limb reduction through  the Australian lizard Hemiergis. Hemiergis is an ideal model organism for  limb reduction studies because it features a gradient of digit  configurations (from 5 fingers and toes to 2 fingers and toes) within a  genus of several closely related species. This investigation endeavors to  compare patterns of skeletal development in different species of Hemiergis,  trace changes in the expression of limb patterning genes, and document the  functional changes that accompany limb reduction. Limb reduction typically  involves a common order of digit loss, and studies of Hemiergis development  will provide insight into cases of limb reduction in other tetrapod groups.  This project will also elucidate the evolutionary role of specific genes in  patterrdng the embryonic limb.",
