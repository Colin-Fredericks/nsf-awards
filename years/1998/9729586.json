 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract        Long term studies of primates in their natural environment  are especially valuable.  This project studies the  interdependencies among behavior,    ecology (especially life history and population size) , and  genetic structure of natural groups.  The empirical research  focuses on several generations of individually identified  baboons, Papio cynocephalus, that are monitored throughout  their lifetimes in the Amboseli region of East Africa.  This  project will perfect the development of determining the  genetic identity of individuals using DNA that is derived  from feces as well as from blood.  This will permit genetic  sampling with a minimum of disturbance to the animals.  Combining knowledge of genetic identity and known  maternity  will be used to determine genetic relatedness structure  within and between groups and to test theories of the  relationship between social interactions and kinship in a  variable environment. Data on social dominance and  affiliative relationships, demography, and general female  reproductive condition are obtained observationally.  Differences in fitness components will be estimated and the  consequences of dominance status will be evaluated at  conception, gestation, several stages of post-natal  survival, and mating using the genetic, behavioral, and  reproductive data.      Genetic and social partitioning of the population arises  both from male dispersal and fissioning of social groups  into new, independent units. Genetic, social, and ecological  (including demographic) causes and consequences of dispersal  and fissioning are uniquely amenable to analysis in this  study and provide insights relevant both to evolution and to  conservation of fragmented populations.  Therefore, this  long term research promises to provide information that will  be applicable to a wide variety of organisms over a range of  situations.",
