In protein trafficking, several components of the molecular machinery that targets proteins to specific sites in the cell have been identified and cloned.  The study of plant signalling has revealed steps, signals and intermediates that are novel to plant cells or of broad significance to both plants and animals.  Perhaps the most exciting advances are from studies of plant cell development because these studies have brought together several previously independent directions of research.  This Keystone Symposium entitled Plant Cell Biology will highlight the most recent progress on signalling and trafficking pathways in plant cells.  Emphasis will be placed on integrating these studies with those on cell division, cell death, morphogenesis and other aspects of plant development to elucidate the intricate relationships among them.",
