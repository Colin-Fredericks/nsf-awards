 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  University  of  Puerto Rico  (UPR)  and  the  Materials  Research  Science  and  Engineering Center  (MRSEC)  at  the  University  of  Pennsylvania (PENN) will form  a  long  term  Collaborative to Integrate Research and Education (CIRE)  to  enhance  the  participation  of  minority  students  in  the  national pool of scientists and engineers (SE).    The CIRE will:        Increase  the  number  and  quality  of  baccalaureate    degrees in the sciences at UPR and equip students with the    tools  necessary to enter first rate graduate programs  in    science and engineering.        Create  long-lasting collaborative  research  projects    between UPR and PENN-MRSEC faculty who have similar research    interests.        Establish  exchange programs whereby UPR  faculty  and    students  to  the PENN-MRSEC for hands on experience  with    advanced research techniques and PENN-MRSEC faculty go  to    UPR to give short lecture series, collaborate on research,    and participate in the program's annual review.    Faculties  from  both institutions have  been  selected  for  their  mutual research interests.  The research program  has  been  designed around `Charged Interfaces' and falls  within  the  realm  of  Materials Research.  Four research  programs  will integrate chemists and physicists at UPR with chemists,  physicists, and materials scientists at the PENN-MRSEC  with  the goal of including many undergraduates in these programs.    A  special feature of this Collaborative will be the use  of  videoconferencing between institutions to enhance  the  flow  of    information   and   provide   real-time   interaction.  Videoconferencing  techniques will be used  to  enhance  the  educational  and  research experiences of  UPR  faculty  and  students  by  exposing  them to PENN's  Shared  Experimental  Facilities,  allowing  participation in  real-time  research  group   interaction,   and  having  real-time,   interactive  lectures and colloquia from the MRSEC.    Continued  funding of th is collaboration at 60% in  matching  funds  of  the NSF level will be guaranteed by  UPR  for  at  least three years after termination of NSF funding.",
