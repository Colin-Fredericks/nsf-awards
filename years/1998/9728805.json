New  York University, with three collaborators - Cornell  University, the University of Southern California, and the  Polytechnic University of New York - will establish an  Institute for Civil Infrastructure Systems (ICIS) within  NYU's Wagner School of Public Service.  This Institute  builds on partnering institution expertise in infrastructure  engineering, management, and social science, and  incorporates a diverse set of participating organizations  and individuals.      The Institute's vision is to facilitate, build partnerships  and networks, supported by a strong educational initiative  and information technology to organize and transfer  information to the CIS community. The ICIS will be an  incubator for ideas and a marketplace for information to  promote connectivity.  It is a new approach, combining  technical and social science expertise critical to the  future direction of American's infrastructure.      The ICIS strategic plan is organized around sustainability  and coordinated renewal, education and learning, community  awareness and participation, performance measurement  assessments, and research needs assessment programs.  Sustainability is central to other program operations.  ICIS  outputs include white papers, and electronic information  system to support connectivity; conferences/forums to set  ICIS agendas; and demonstration/pilot projects for education  and community outreach.  Self-evaluation and development  functions are included.  The organization includes a  director, and executive committee coordinating program work  and technical advisory, management oversight, and  development boards.  The ICIS is chartered  by NSF to  function for up to five years with NSF support.      ***",
