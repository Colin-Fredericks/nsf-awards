One such epigenetic phenomenon is parental genomic imprinting which renders maternal and paternal chromosomes functionally non-equivalent. Both the mechanism and function of genomic imprinting remain poorly characterized. This project utilizes the strain-dependent difference in paternal genome modification between the C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mouse strains to search for the factors responsible for the difference in egg phenotype. An analysis of egg phenotypes of the 25 C57BL/6 x DBA/2 recombinant inbred mouse strains (2000 nuclear transplantations) revealed the chromosomal locations of two modifier loci, to within 8.7 and 5 centimorgans (cM) on chromosomes 1 and 2. More complete gene mapping studies will be done by 1) fine mapping of the modifier locus on chromosome 2 which lies within an interval containing many polymorphic markers and for which a significant number of recombinant chromosomes exist and 2) to narrow the candidate region on chromosome 1 by identifying additional polymorphic markers that can be used for further fine mapping at this locus.\r\n\r\nBecause the biochemical and functional properties of imprinting modifiers are unknown, genetic systems provide invaluable opportunities for identifying the factors that are involved in the process of mammalian genomic imprinting. These studies should also improve our understanding of how egg cytoplasm controls nuclear reprogramming during normal development. So little is known about the fundamental process of genomic imprinting that this study could have an impact beyond just locating relevant genes. All cells carry the same DNA in most muticellular organisms but how the genes are regulated ultimately defines the function of the cell. Some human diseases are being recognized as lacking the usual parental genomic imprint and ultimately, these studies have the potential to contribute to our understanding of those genetic defects in humans.\r\n",
