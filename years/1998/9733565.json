 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project addresses the complex problem of  modeling, analysis, and experimental investigation of  nonlinear characteristic related to smart materials, such as  piezo-ceramic composites, and investigates their application  in vibro-acoustic energy conduction transduction,  dissipation and excitation. This research is vital for  meeting critical needs in applications such a structural  noise and vibration control, non-destructive testing and  evaluation, health monitoring of structures and machinery,  music and micro-electro-mechanical systems. The education  plan  is integrated fully with the proposed research topic.  It included outreach activities involving inner city youth  through the medium of music via a non profit program called  Music Education Reaching Instrumental Talent (MERIT). In  this program, the PI plans to incorporate a sequence of  instructions on `Science and Engineering in Music.` In  addition, he plans to augment the laboratory experience in  UIC Minority Engineering Recruitment and Retention Program  with `Science and Engineering of Musical Instruments,` in  which students first study traditional musical instruments,  and then design and develop their own musical instrument.  The project will result in a better understanding of vibro-  acoustic energy transmission, and engineering concepts via  musical acoustics.",
