 "awd_abstract_narration": "9801824  Rosenbaum  In this research conducted by Prof. Th. A. Rosenbaum of the James  Franck  Institute  of the University of Chicago  the  problem  of  metal-insulator   (MI)  transitions  resulting  from   continuous  changes   in   external   parameters   will   be   experimentally  investigated.    Specifically,   the   continuous    Mott-Hubbard  transition  in  NiS(2-x)Sex, the MI transition in  metal  hydride  films,  and  the  MI  transition in vanadium sesquioxide  in  the  highly  disordered limit will be studied.  These researches  have  important bearing on the properties of novel materials,  such  as  transition  metal  oxides  and sulfides, high-Tc  superconducting  cuprates, giant magnetoresistance manganates, and others that are  governed  by strong charge carrier correlations.  The purpose  of  this  research is to elucidate the fundamental nature of  the  MI  transition  in  materials  where  electron-electron  interactions  dominate  and  where  it  is possible  to  apply  the  experience  obtained from studies of continuous phase transitions.  %%%  Many materials of current technological importance, such as,  for  example,  transition metal oxides and sulfides,  metal  hydrides,  high-temperature      superconducting     cuprates,      colossal  magnetoresistance manganates,  exhibit behaviors that are not yet  fully understood.  This absence of detailed understanding impedes  their  efficient  application  in technological  devices.   Among  these  properties is the continuous change of a material  from  a  metal  to  an insulator (MI) in systems in which the behavior  of  the  electric charge carriers is highly correlated.  For example,  at  liquid  helium temperatures the electrical conductivities  of  materials can vary by 32 orders of magnitude.  It was only during  the  last  year  that  materials systems were  discovered  (doped  semiconductors and amorphous alloys) in which the  MI  transition  proceeds in a continuous manner in  response to the variations  of  an  external  parameter.   The purpose of  this  research  is  to  elucidate   the  fundamental  nature  of  the  MI  transition  in  materials where electron-electron interactions dominate and where  it  is  possible to apply the experience obtained from continuous  phase  transitions.  The results of these investigations will  be  of  great importance for the development and application  of  new  and improved electronic solid state materials.  ***",
