 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular genetics is not just for biologists anymore, and biologists must become technologically competent for research in the next century. A result of collaboration between biologists, chemists, electrical engineers, and computer scientists is the development of automated DNA sequencers that utilize capillary electrophoresis coupled to laser detection of fluorescently-labelled molecules. These instruments eliminate the need for radioactive material and neurotoxins, and are ideal for undergraduate education since extensive safety training is eliminated, and toxic wastes are not generated.     In addition, the advances that have made this technology possible are relevant to other disciplines. The goals of this project are to modernize the biology curriculum and interface biology with other disciplines. The theme is the importance of collaboration between scientists to insure continued advances in science and technology. Sequencing will first be introduced in faculty directed undergraduate research projects, and then into upper division courses taught by those faculty. This includes required courses in environmental engineering and environmental science. An introductory module appropriate for introductory biology students and non-biology majors will be developed.     Bioinformatics, the storage and analysis of sequence data, will be introduced in first year and advanced computer scientist courses. Electrical engineering principles used in the instrument will be emphasized in seminars by personnel from the manufacturer of the instrument.  A seminar course will bring together students and faculty from different disciplines to design multidisciplinary projects. Technical Communication majors will design internet sites, instructional material, and assessment questionnaires for the project.     The outcomes of this project mirror the mission of the school; students will learn (1) how DNA sequencing can be used as tool in medical and environmental science; (2) how knowledge is created and communicated  and; (3) the importance of multidisciplinary collaborations in solving technical and scientific problems.",
