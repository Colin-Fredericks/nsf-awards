 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-speed diamond turning of eyeglass lenses, noncircular  machining of camshafts and pistons, high-speed scanning and  vibratory probing in atomic force microscopy (AFM), and  metal rolling are examples of  industrial processes which  can benefit from repetitive control algorithms. Motivated by  the nonlinearities in optical turning and AFM control, this  research project addresses basic challenges in nonlinear  repetitive control. In addition to research on basic theory  involving the existence of periodic motions, stability  results, and design methods, specific nonlinear problems in  optical turning and AFM control are addressed. The project  involves collaborations with DAC Vision, Inc. to understand  the diamond turning of polycarbonate eyeglass lenses. The  process requires quasi-periodic tool trajectories and  suffers from significant actuator nonlinearly. Following the  initial investigations into the nature of nonlinear periodic  motions in single-input single-output (SISO) repetitive  control systems, extension to MIMO systems, possible  connections with normally hyperbolic manifold theory, and  the onset of chaos in nonlinear repetitive control will be  investigated. Modeling and simulation of the DAC Vision  diamond turning process will be accomplished in this same  period followed by control design and implementation of  controllers on DAC's machines. Instructional development in  UCSB's graduate control lab in collaboration with Magnetic  Moments, a supplier of educational control experiments is  also a part of this project. The PI will incorporate  repetitive control design into this teaching lab for the  outbalancing of a magnetically suspended rotor. Later in  this program, repetitive control problems in atomic force  microscopy (AFM) are to be addressed with the aim of  improving the imaging speed of these devices. The specific  problem to be addressed is the control of AFM's in tapping  mode. At high tapping and scan rates, AFM's can enter into  chaotic motions that degrade image quality significantly.  One of the aims of this research is to control the onset of  chaos and thus improve system performance.",
