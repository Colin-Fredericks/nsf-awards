 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    IBN-9728543  Behavioral and Biological Effects of Chronic Social Stress    Social stress is a common and enduring feature of life with  important behavioral and physiological effects.  A  multidisciplinary research collaboration between the  Laboratory of Behavioral Neurobiology at the University of  Hawaii and the Laboratory of Neuroendocrinology at the  Rockefeller University is aimed at description and analysis  of these effects.  Previous work with laboratory rodents  indicates that single, two-week stress periods can produce a  variety of potentially damaging changes, including:  increased defensive behavior and decreased social and sexual  behavior; higher levels of stress hormones and impairment of  brain mechanisms that normally limit stress hormone action;  impairment of brain and peripheral mechanisms of male sex  hormone production; and widespread changes in brain  neurochemical systems.  Work in an initial granting period  has begun to outline the time course of these changes and to  describe their permanence or reversibility; crucial factors  in understanding the dynamics of the stress cascade.    The proposed program will undertake a fine-grained analysis  of the development of stress effects by using behavioral,  brain system, and hormone measures taken at closely spaced  intervals.  This will enable comparison of the relative time  course of these changes, enabling the creation of more  precise hypotheses concerning the relationships among these  phenomena.  A second focus will involve the role of male sex  hormones in the development of dominance-subordination  relationships and in modulating the stress responses of  subordinate males.  The final focus of the proposed work is  on analysis of the role of previous (early or recent)  stressful experience in modulating or exacerbating the  response to subordination.  These studies, using an  ecologically appropriate model, will provide detailed  information in several areas that are crucial in  understanding the mammalia n stress response and its  widespread behavioral and physiological consequences.",
