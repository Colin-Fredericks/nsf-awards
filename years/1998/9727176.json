 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program,   Profesor Stephen DiMagno, of the Department of Chemistry at the   University of Nebraska - Lincoln, is developing `polar hydrophobicity` in   the design of fluorinated hosts and guests for molecular recognition.    Through the synthesis and study of heavily fluorinated carbohydrate   analogs incorporating multiple CF2 (for CHOH) substitutions, Professor   DiMagno tests the hypothesis that preorganized sites and bound guests are   `harder` than equivalent structures in solution due to the decreased   importance of energetic terms arising from electron polarization.  The   polar hydrophobic effect results from the peculiar physical   characteristics of the carbon-fluorine bond, which is at once both   extremely polar and hydrophobic.  Since the polar characteristics of the   C-F bond dominate in crystalline or organized phases while hydrophobic   effects are more important in solution, both enthalpic and entropic   factors may be more favorable for binding fluorinated analogs than   natural substrates.  Thus, these studies are expected both to demonstrate   the use of polar hydrophobicity as a tool for the design of hosts and   guests and to contribute to the general understanding of molecular   recognition and hydrogen bonding.  The specific recognition and binding of one molecule by another forms the   basis of a myriad of chemical and biochemical phenomena.  With the   support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor   Stephen DiMagno, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of   Nebraska - Lincoln, is developing the concept of `polar hydrophobicity`   in order to design new classes of `hosts` and `guests` for molecular   recognition.  Professor DiMagno's studies focus on the peculiar physical   characteristics of the carbon-fluorine bond, which is at once both   extremely polar and highly hydrophobic (water-hating).  Through the study   of sugar derivatives in which polar and hydrophilic (water-loving) groups   are replaced by fluorine atoms, Professor DiMagno obtains information   about the roles of polarity and hydrophobic interactions in molecular   recognition events, gaining both practical knowledge about the design of   new `hosts` and `guests` for general molecular recognition studies as   well as detailed information about the biological recognition of natural   substrates.",
