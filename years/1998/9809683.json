 "awd_abstract_narration": "This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the State   University of New York at Stony Brook supports the research of Professor   Nancy Goroff.  The theme of the research is the preparation of small,   size-specific neutral all-carbon molecules, such as C6,C8, and C10, from   molecular precursors which are accessible and stable organic species.    Using precursor molecules with different starting geometries, including   both cyclic and linear molecules, will allow the comparison of the   chemistry of different Cn isomers.  Gas-phase and low-temperature   experiments will examine the structures of these molecular carbon   allotropes and how they react.  Carbon is the basis of all organic chemistry, but only recently have   scientists begun to learn about the chemistry of carbon in the absence of   other elements.  These studies of the different carbon species in the   absence of other elements, including hydrogen, are a new part of organic   chemistry.  This work should help open up opportunities to tailor new or   poorly available all-carbon materials, including larger fullerenes and   all-carbon polymer networks, which may have unique materials applications",
