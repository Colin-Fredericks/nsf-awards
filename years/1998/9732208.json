 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of numerical methods for large algebraic systems  is central in the development of efficient codes for  computational fluid dynamics, elasticity, and other core problems  of continuum mechanics.  Many other tasks in such codes  parallelize relatively easily.  The importance of the algebraic  system solvers is therefore increasing with the appearance of  parallel and distributed computing systems, with a substantial  number of fast processors, each with relatively large memory.  A  very desirable feature of iterative substructuring and other  domain decomposition algorithms is that they respect the memory  hierarchy of modern parallel and distributed computing systems,  which is essential for approaching peak floating point  performance.  The development of improved methods is, together  with more powerful computer systems, making it possible to carry  out simulations in three dimensions, with quite high resolution,  relatively easily.  This work is now supported by high quality  software systems, such as Argonne's PETSC library, which will  facilitate code development as well as the access to a variety of  parallel and distributed computer systems.  Work willcontinue in  developing iterative substructuring and other domain  decomposition methods for increasingly difficult partial  differential equations.  Domain decomposition algorithms are  iterative methods, often of preconditioned conjugate gradient  type, for the parallel solution of the large linear, or  nonlinear, systems of algebraic equations that arise when partial  differential equations are discretized by finite elements, finite  differences, or spectral methods.  In each iteration step, local  problems representing the restriction of the original problem to  a potentially large number of subregions are solved  approximately.  The subregions, which can be allocated to  individual processors of a parallel computer, form a  decomposition of the entire domain of the problem.  In addition,  the inclusion of a coarse proble m often substantially increases  the efficiency of the preconditioner.  This study will combine mathematical analysis with the design and  numerical testing of algorithms.  A special emphasis will be  placed on the study of spectral elements and other high order  finite element methods, as well as on nonconforming methods such  as the mortar and Nedelec finite element methods.  The latter  have been developed for Maxwell's equation.  There will also be a  focus on the often very ill-conditioned problems which arise in  finite element approximations of elasticity.  Iterative methods  and production codes will also be developed for Helmholtz's  equation and other time-harmonic models arising, e.g., from  Maxwell's equations.  These problems pose very real challenges  for the development of iterative solvers and are also of great  importance in a number of engineering applications.",
