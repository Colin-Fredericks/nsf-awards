 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 98-10804  PRICE   Many of the cells that compose an animal communicate with each  other by means of chemical signals.  One cell releases a chemical  which is detected by another cell through the interaction of the  chemical with a \"receptor\" protein on the cell's surface.  The  receptor must pass the external signal into the interior of the  cell and often does so by opening a selective pore in the cell's  surface which lets particular charged ions into and out of the  cell.  The selective pore is called an \"ion channel\" and the  receptor is said to \"gate\" the channel.  Such signaling is  especially elaborate in the nervous system, but ion channels are  also involved in salt and water balance and are particularly  abundant in the kidney.  One of the kidney channels is called the  epithelial sodium channel because it allows the sodium ion to  pass.  It was thought that the epithelial sodium channels were  completely distinct from sodium channels mediating chemical signal  transmission in the nervous system, but it has recently been shown  that one type of channel in the nervous system is related to the  epithelial sodium channels.  In the snail Helix, one such  epithelial sodium-channel relative from the nervous system is  gated by a particular chemical named FMRFamide. FMRFamide is a  peptide released by certain nerve cells and is thus one example of  a group of signaling molecules known as neuropeptides.  FMRFamide  is the only neuropeptide known to directly gate an ion channel and  the channel it gates is the only epithelial sodium channel  relative known to be gated by a substance released by nerve cells  (i.e. by a \"neurotransmitter\"). Dr. Price has cloned portions of  two epithelial sodium channels from the sea slug Aplysia (an  animal related to the land-snail, Helix, but with a much more  extensively studied nervous system than Helix).  He will now try  to  isolate full length clones (cultured cells containing the gene  from Aplysia) containing these two channels so that their physica l  properties can be determined and also so that their localization  in the nervous system can be compared to the known localization of  FMRFamide.  The end result of these studies will be a better  understanding of how neuropeptides are involved in the  communication of individual nerve cells of an animal and how such  communication mediates the complex behaviors that even the most  simple animals exhibit.",
