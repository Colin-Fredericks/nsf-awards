This project uses advances in computer, multimedia, and information technologies to respond to the national priority of improving scientific literacy.  During Phase I, molecular graphics and virtual reality technologies were integrated into a prototype multimedia system.  Content covering enzyme structure and mechanism was developed that showed that the system could teach structure-function relationships in a visually compelling and intuitive fashion.  During Phase II, under the guidance of a development team including a molecular modeling specialist, a multimedia programmer, a graphic artist, and a cognitive scientist, the content will be expanded to include examples in six other areas of biochemistry, along with additional background material.  \"Molecules of Life\" will be reviewed by teachers and students both during design and following implementation.  The feasibility of distributing \"Molecules of Life\" at least in part over the World Wide Web will also be investigated.  The result of the Phase II project will be a multimedia product ready for testing in the marketplace.   The explosion of technological and fundamental advances in molecular genetics and biotechnology in the last twenty years is increasingly having an important impact on the health sciences, agriculture, environmental cleanup, forensics, and other diverse fields. By utilizing emerging technologies in interactive multimedia to provide individualized, interactive learning experiences, this project will contribute to overcoming some of the barriers to effective teaching and thus will contribute to meeting the need for basic literacy in the biological and health sciences among the general public as explicitly included in the National Science Education Stand ards.  \"Molecules of Life\" will be sold to college level students enrolled in biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology courses.  ***",
