 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870265  Readey    The goal of the project is to gain a fundamental  understanding of the active gas corrosion of ceramics.  This  research will study the high temperature corrosion of  ceramics by halogen-containing gases, initially hydrogen  chloride (HCl).  There exist very few data on active gaseous  corrosion of ceramics; that is, corrosion in which the  products of the reaction are generally gaseous.  However,  those data that do exist show that gas diffusion of the  product gases controls the rate of reaction at high  temperature.  As a result, the rate of corrosion can be  predicted from thermodynamic data and the kinetic theory of  gases. Hydrogen chloride will be used as the initial  reactant gas since the equilibrium product gas pressures  produced in reactions with it are predicted to be high over  a large temperature range, and thus it should be possible to  observe the transition from diffusion-controlled kinetics to  surface reaction-controlled kinetics.  Once the parameter  space where a surface reaction is rate controlling is  defined, then the mechanisms of the surface reaction can be  studied.  The reaction kinetics will be followed by weight  loss measurements and grain boundary grooving as a function  of temperature and gas composition.  Single and  multicomponent oxides, nitrides, and carbides will be  studied.  %%%  The significance of the research is that halogen corrosion  of ceramics has important technical implications in chemical  processing, incinerators, chemical waste disposal,  semiconductor processing, and high temperature heat engines.  Understanding the kinetics can help materials engineers  design materials that are less subject to degradation by  these gases.  ***",
