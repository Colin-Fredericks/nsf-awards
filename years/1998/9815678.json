Indeed, such power transfers are essential to a competitive market for electric power.  Power system available transfer capability indicates how much interarea power transfers can be increased without compromising system security.  Accurate identification of this capability provides vital information for operation of the bulk power market.  There is a need in this rapidly developing field to synthesize a coherent account of the various approaches to the methods underlying available transfer capability calculations and communicate this to industry.  The project will address this need by writing a tutorial on the methods developed and their relation to previous work.  Demonstration software to illustrate the concepts and calculations will be developed.  The tutorial and demonstration software will be placed on the world wide web so that anyone with a browser can understand the project results and interactively run the demonstrations over the web.  This is a collaborative project between the University of Wisconsin, Cornell University and Christensen Associates, a small firm located in Madison, WI.\r\n",
