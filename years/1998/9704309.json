Their magnetic bistability makes such materials strong candidates  as  elements for high-density storage of information.  The  spin-  tunneling  in  a  double  well potential that  we  have  recently  demonstrated   makes   them  interesting   from   a   fundamental  standpoint, and offers the possibility that materials of  this  class  could  be used as elements for quantum  computation.  The  aim  of our studies is to synthesize new molecular  crystals  that  will  optimize properties for applications, and to  gain  a  better understanding of their behavior.  %%%  This  new collaboration between a woman physicist at CUNY  and  a  chemist at UC San Diego will focus on the synthesis and study  of  molecular  crystals  composed of a  large   number  of  identical  magnetic   subunits,  such  as  Mn12  acetate.

Their  quantum  mechanical  properties at  low  temperatures  are  interesting  for  fundamental  reasons,   and  also   offer   the  possibility  that they can be used in \"quantum  computers\"  which  require  elements that are simultaneously in a  \"yes\"   and  \"no\"  state.
