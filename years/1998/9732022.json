 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work concerns two topics in numerical linear algebra: 1)  Regularization of ill-posed linear systems; 2) Solution of large,  sparse eigenvalue problems.  These topics share common features:  a wide range of application problems; the use of iterative  methods for large-scale problems; and interesting problems in  matrix perturbation theory.    When continuous ill-posed problems are discretized they result in  ill-conditioned linear systems which must be regularized to yield  accurate solutions.  This part of the work has several goals.  The first is to prove the folk theorem that if the components of  the data vector with respect to the singular vectors of the  matrix decay sufficiently fast then the conjugate gradient  iteration will produce a regularizing set of solution vectors.  The second is to compare the numerous formulations of discrete  ill-posed problems to see which are most effective.  The third is  to further develop preconditioners to speed convergence of  solution algorithms.  The fourth is to improve  data-gathering techniques so that the attainable accuracy from  imaging is better, thus, for example, revealing smaller tumors or  more information about distant stars.    Over the past decade many new algorithms for finding clusters of  eigenvalues of large matrices have been proposed.  Although the  effectiveness of some of these algorithms has been demonstrated  empirically, analytic results are sparse.  Fortunately, a large  number of these methods share a common framework, so that it is  possible to develop analytic tools that are widely applicable.  As a start toward this goal, attention is focused on a new,  promising method---singular vector enhancement---that fits in the  framework.  A preliminary analysis of a special case has already  yielded valuable results on the relation of eigenvalues and  singular values.    The results of this project will impact the solution of ill-posed  problems such as medical image enhancement, astronomical data  processing, nondestructive  testing, and spectroscopy, as well as  eigenvalue problems arising in systems modeling (Markov chains),  computational chemistry, and structural analysis.",
