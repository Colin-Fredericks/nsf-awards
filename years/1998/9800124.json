 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses problems in a variety of computational  settings, In each case, a significant goal of the research is to  obtain new lower bounds on the problems' complexity.  The prime  computational setting of interest is that of the complexity of  proofs in propositional tautologies is fundmental in that it is  equivalent to the NP versus co-NP question.  Analysis of the  complexity of specific methods of proof is important in its own  right as well as for practical questions of automated theorem-  proving and may yield insight into the NP versus co-NP question.  The research in this area is concerned with extending the range  of proof systems in which complexity bounds are currently known,  with particular emphasis on the study of randomly chosen k-CNF  formulas.  Based on past experience, methods from the study of  circuit complexity are expected to be useful in this analysis.  The second setting of interest is the complexity of computations  on random access machines able to operate on word-level  quantities at unit cost.  Surprisingly efficient algorithms for a  number of problems, such as sorting, have been shown in this  model.  The goal of the research in this area is to understand  the limits of the algorithmic improvements possible in this  model.  The final setting is that of the complexity of  representing Boolean functions so that they are easy to  manipulate and compare, important properties for symbolic model  checking algorithms.  The major question to investigate in this  area is whether representations which are easy to manipulate and  compare can efficiently represent non-linear as well as linear  functions.",
