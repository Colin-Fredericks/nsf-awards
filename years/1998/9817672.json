Garibaldi\r\n\r\nHoward University, the nation's largest on-campus producer of African American Ph.D. recipients, and the  nation's second largest producer of African American baccalaureate degree recipients, proposes to build upon its record of Ph.D. production by increasing its output of Ph.D. recipients in the science, mathematics, and engineering (SME) fields by fifty percent over the next five years.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, Howard proposes to establish and lead a consortium of the nation's most prestigious minority institutions which are among the largest producers of Bachelor's degree recipients who go on to obtain Ph.D. degrees in SME disciplines.  Partner institutions are:  Howard University, Bennett College, Bowie State University, Dillard University, Fisk University, Grambling State University, Hampton University, Morehouse University, Morgan State University, St. Augustine's College, Spelman College, Talladega College, Tougaloo College, University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez, and Xavier University of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nAt the undergraduate level, selected students will be provided an intensive summer research and graduate preparation-training program.  Upon completion of the master's degree and the fulfillment of requirements towards the Ph.D., all participants will be enrolled in Howard University's nationally renowned Preparing Future Faculty Program.  Lastly, a comprehensive evaluation plan will focus on issues of time-to-degree, completion rates, and post-graduation employment trends.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
