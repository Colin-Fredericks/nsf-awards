 "awd_abstract_narration": "Calculations will be performed to improve the  theoretical predictions for underground and accelerator  experiments detecting high energy elementary particle  interactions.  Consequently, experimental results can be  better interpreted whether as tests of aspects of the  standard model of strong nuclear, weak and electromagnetic  forces or as signals of new physics.       Large underground detectors act as neutrino telescopes  by detecting the conversions of neutrinos to muons in the  water, rock or ice surrounding the detector.  Neutrinos  produced by galactic or extra-galactic sources travel  undeviated to the earth, bringing information about the  astrophysical processes that cannot be inferred from  studying electomagnetic radiation.  Muons and neutrinos are  also produced by cosmic ray interactions with air nuclei in  the earth's atmosphere.  At high energies, charmed particle  production and decay in the atmosphere is the dominant  terrestrial source of fluxes of muons and neutrinos.  A new  calculation of the fluxes of muon and neutrinos from the  decays of charmed particles that are produced in the  atmosphere will be performed using a range of inputs  consistent with laboratory measurements of charm production,  extrapolated to higher energy.  In addition, calculations  related to the interpretation of electron neutrino and muon  neutrino conversions to charged particles in underground  detectors will be refined.  The improvements to existing  calculations may have an impact on the allowed regions of  parameter space in models with neutrino oscillations.       A `Monte Carlo` simulation of neutrino production of  charm quarks in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) will be  developed.  QCD is the theoretical description of the strong  nuclear force.  The Monte Carlo will be used by experimental  groups to help them determine strange quark content of the  proton.",
