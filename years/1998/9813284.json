 "awd_abstract_narration": "9813284  Drakunov  The objective of this research project is to develop robust  and computationally feasible control schemes which can  successfully deal with Distributed Parameter Systems(DPS).  The main difficulties to control DPS for example, a  diffusion equation modeling the evolution of the temperature  field in arc welding, or a Timoshenko equation modeling the  vibrations of a flexible manipulator, are complexity and  strong uncertainty.  Although one can assume for simulation  purposes that the geometry and properties of the heated (or  cooled) materials are known, or that the manipulator payload  may be ignored, in practice they vary in a wide range.  An  accepted model for a DPS is obtained by (1) selecting a  suitable set of boundary conditions that describe a closely  related problem; (2) solving the associated  eigenvalue/eigenfuction problem; and (3) invoking the  assumed-mode method.  The result is an infinite system of  uncoupled, ordinary differential equations for the so called  system modes.  In practice, one truncates the model and  fulfills the control design using a finite number of  equations.  To validate such an approach in general, the  effects of unmodeled dynamics, that is, control and  observation spillover, need to be examined.  On the other  hand, there exists the sliding mode control methodology,  which is well developed for finite dimensional systems but  relatively very little has appeared in the literature for  infinite dimensional systems.  The appeal of this approach  is its robutsness to matched disturbances and parameter  variations. The design idea is based on the following  procedure: in order to solve a control problem such as the  stabilization of the weld width or heat penetration, the  objective is formulated as a certain function of the system  states which defines a desired manifold.  A control is found  such that the set in the state space where this relation is  true forms a sliding manifold, that is, an integral manifold  reachable in finite tim e.  Once in the sliding mode, the  dynamic behavior is prescribed by the choice of switching  surfaces, and the system is inherently insensitive to that  class of parameter variations and external disturbances  which is implicit in the system input channels -- the so  called matched uncertainty.  The inherent insensitivity of a  system with sliding modes to parameter variations and  disturbances eliminates the need for exact modeling - a very  desirable property that has quite remarkable theoretical and  practical implications.  In this research project, the  generalization of this method is developed with mathematical  rigor to further study and synthesize efficient control and  sensing algorithms for DPS.  ***",
