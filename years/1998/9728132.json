 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT      IBN-9728132  PI = ENGELAND, William C.            Secretion of steroid hormones by the adrenal cortex  is required to maintain whole body homeostasis; that is, the  ability to maintain blood pressure and volume, carbohydrate,  protein and fat metabolism and immune and nervous system  function within normal limits is dependent on adrenocortical  hormones.  The primary goal of the project is to  understand  the role of adrenal innervation in the control of steroid  secretion. The hypothesis to be tested is that under non-  stress conditions when reduced steroid secretion is  required,  neural activity is inhibitory, whereas during  stress conditions when elevated steroid secretion is  necessary, neural activity is excitatory.  The capacity for  innervation to produce both inhibitory and excitatory  effects suggests that neural input must be encoded  differentially; encoding could be dependent on the  neurotransmitter released or on the target affected.  Experiments are designed: (1) to define the  neurotransmitters that modulate non-stress and stress-  induced secretion of adrenal corticosteroids and (2) to  elucidate the adrenal site of neurotransmitter action. Rats  will undergo immunological, surgical, or pharmacological  sympathectomies to remove selectively adrenal  neurotransmitter systems. The effect of adrenal denervation  on non-stress steroid secretion will be assessed using in  vivo adrenal microdialysis, a technique developed to measure  adrenal secretion in awake animals. It is proposed that  circadian variation in non-stress steroidogenesis which is  reflected by differences in episodic secretion is regulated  in part by the inhibitory effects of innervation.  Episodic  corticosterone secretion will be assessed by time series  analysis and diurnal variations in adrenal sensitivity to  ACTH will be determined. It is proposed that adrenal neural  elements interact positively with ACTH to mediate acute  stress-induced increases in steroid secretio n. Neural input  could act directly at the adrenal cell to affect  steroidogenesis or act indirectly by changing adrenal blood  flow.  Experiments will assess the interaction between  stress and ACTH and characterize the neurotransmitter  system(s) mediating facilitatory control. Experiments will  also measure adrenal blood flow during stress using  fluorescent microspheres and define the  neurotransmitters that mediate stress-induced changes.  Neurotransmitter-specific  innervation will be monitored  using immunofluorescence histochemistry and quantitated by  radioimmunoassay. Effects on specific steroidogenic enzymes  will be assessed by measuring gene expression using in situ  hybridization and RNAse protection assay, by  measuring enzyme content using western analysis and by  quantifying enzyme activity in adrenal cells.  Results of  these experiments should delineate the role of autonomic  nerves as an extra-ACTH mechanism in the control of adrenal  corticosteroid secretion and define the neurotransmitter  systems involved.  Understanding the nature of the this  unique neural-endocrine interaction will provide a new  perspective on physiological regulation of  corticosteroid secretion.",
