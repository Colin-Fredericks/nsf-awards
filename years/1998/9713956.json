 "awd_abstract_narration": "As environmental disturbance, fragmentation, and  pollution become more widespread, it is imperative that  new collaborative mutidisciplinary research provide  insights into complex ecological phenomena on a larger  scale than has been possible in the past.  The facility  that is the subject of this project is a regional center  for research on the responses of lake systems to  disturbance at varying scales.  The investigators  associated with this facility have many years of  experience using small experimental surrogate  ecosystems(e.g.. experimental ponds) to identify the  responses to disturbance of larger, \"real world\",  systems.  The objective of this project is to enhance the  aquatic research facility at the University of Kansas  field station, the Kansas Ecological Reserves (KER), in  order to continue the extension of this work to larger  scales.    The aquatic facilities at the KER are extensive with  nearly 200 experimental ponds over 55 outdoor  fiberglass tanks and different types of enclosures for  smaller scale experiments within these systems.  Research over the 20 year history of this aquatic  program, reported in nearly 100 publications, has often  focused on the use of these relatively small surrogate  ecosystems for aquatic research.  This work has  firmly established that experimental perturbations  applied to these surrogate adequately simulate a  variety of environmental changes.  New modeling  techniques are being developed to extrapolate these  results to the \"real world at larger spatial and temporal  scales.    To extend this empirical research to larger lentic  ecosystems )lakes and reservoirs).  1991 a 4.5 ha, 13 m  deep reservoir was constructed in a protected 50 ha  watershed.  This reservoir was constructed as a model  ecosystem with many of the important characteristics of  larger lentic systems.  Now investigators working at KER  can conduct empirical investigations in a large, secure  and carefully managed lake/ reservoir surrogate.  The  proximity of this lar ger scale surrogate ecosystem to one  of the largest experimental pond facilities in the nation  makes the facility attractive to researchers from  institutions throughout the region.  No limnological  manpipulations are conducted in the reservoir at the  whole-lake scale so that natural reference conditions can  be continually provided.  However, experimental  perturbations simulating environmental change at this  reservoir scale can be studied in situ enclosures and in  adjacent smaller experimental ponds and tanks.",
