 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-resolution images are essential in many important areas of  science, engineering, law enforcement, and medicine.  The need to  extract meaningful information from degraded images is vital in  many areas such as aero-optics imaging, surveillance photography,  confocal microscopy, and medical imaging.  Sources of image  degradation vary among application areas, but include atmospheric  turbulence, turbidity in a fluid medium, motion blur, and  numerous other effects.    Image processing tasks such as image enhancement, reconstruction,  and restoration are computationally intensive; the underlying  physical models require the solution to  data-massive and often ill-posed inverse problems where the  solution may not depend continuously on the data.  All such  problems require significant research into the algorithm-  architecture-application interaction and can profit substantially  from the availability of high-performance software systems.    Iterative solvers that exploit both the structure of the problem,  and the parallel computing platform, appear to be the most viable  candidates for  diverse, large scale image enhancement problems.    This research project includes the following technical topics:    a) New iterative algorithms with effective regularization  strategies for blind deconvolution image restoration using  adaptive filtering and multichannel phase diversity methods.    b) Acceleration of the iterative algorithms utilizing Krylov  subspace based multi-level preconditioning.    c) New algorithms which partially mitigate the ill-posed nature  of the image restoration problem by integrating numerical and  symbolic computational methods.    d) Development of a high performance software package, entitled  \"Parallel Image Processing Environment (pipe})\", which utilizes  the image processing algorithms developed in the course of this  research.",
