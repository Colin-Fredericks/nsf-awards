Other conjectures he made then have since evolved into the\r\nnilpotence theorem of Devinatz-Hopkins-Smith, the periodicity theorem of\r\nHopkins-Smith, and the the thick subcategory theorem.  All of these are\r\npart of the chromatic approach to homotopy theory, which continues to\r\nattract the interest of numerous algebraic topologists.  More\r\nspecifically, Ravenel has constructed and will study the Thomified\r\nEilenberg-Moore spectral sequence, which includes the usual\r\nEilenberg-Moore spectral sequence, the Adams spectral sequence, and the\r\nAdams-Novikov spectral sequence as special cases.  He also has a program\r\nfor the computation of the Morava K-theory of interated loop spaces of\r\nspheres. \r\n     Stable homotopy theory is a branch of algebraic topology, which has\r\nbeen central to pure mathematics since its founding by Poincare a century\r\nago.  It has been a continuing source of new ideas in algebra and geometry,\r\nas seen in the work of Lefschetz on complex algebraic varieties in the\r\n1930's, the efforts leading to the proof of the Weil conjectures of\r\narithmetic algebraic geometry in the 1960's and 1970's, and most recently,\r\nin the successful application of motivic cohomology to the Milnor\r\nconjecture in algebraic K-theory by Voevodsky in 1997.  It has also found\r\nnumerous applications in differential geometry, in graph theory, and in\r\ntheoretical physics.  The University of Rochester is one of the leading\r\ncenters of algebraic topology in the world. \r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
