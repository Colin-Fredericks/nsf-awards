 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733062  Hommerich    This CAREER project aims at a comprehensive investigation of  chromium doped II-VI semiconductors for tunable solid-state laser  applications in the mid-infrared wavelength region. Synthesis of  materials will be carried out in an ongoing collaboration with  researchers at Brimrose Corporation of America. Materials will be  optically characterized by spectral luminescence studies,  luminescence excitation and decay time measurements, optical  absorption, and laser performance studies over the temperature  range 15 - 450 K. Spectroscopic results will be modeled within  the framework of crystal field theory to derive crystal field  strength parameters, electron-phonon coupling strengths, and  luminescence quenching activation energies. The results of the  modeling will be used to derive structure/property relations  which can guide the optimization of selected materials to achieve  better laser performance. Educational components include: a new  course in optical spectroscopy and new experiments for an  advanced graduate laboratory; and activities to increase student  participation in research from K-12 through the graduate level.  This project aims to increase the skilled work force in an  important field of optoelectronics with a special emphasis on  enhancing the participation of underrepresented students.  %%%  The project addresses research and education issues in a topical  area of materials science having high technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at  a fundamental level to photonic materials. An important feature  of the program is the emphasis on education, and on the  integration of research and education through the training of  students in a fundamentally and technologically significant  research area with a special emphasis on participation of  underrepresented students.  ***",
