In addition, these techniques will be applied\r\nto symmetric Hamiltonian bifurcation theory by combining them with\r\nmethods of dynamical systems and classical bifurcation theory methods.\r\nA Lagrangian counterpart of reduction will be developed, where\r\nsymplectic geometry techniques are replaced by variational principles.\r\nApplications of these variational methods yield the equations of\r\nvarious approximate models in geophysical fluid dynamics.  A second\r\ngoal of this project is to understand completions of diffeomorphism\r\ngroups with the scope of applying geometric and Lie theoretical\r\nmethods to the study of nonlinear wave equations and the understanding\r\nof the convexity properties of the momentum map in infinite\r\ndimensions. A third goal is the application of methods of Hamiltonian\r\ndynamics in conjunction with singular reduction to study the\r\nbifurcation and the long term behavior of concrete mechanical systems\r\nsuch as the Riemann ellipsoids. The same methods are intended for the\r\ndesign and study of numerical algorithms on nonlinear manifolds.\r\n\r\nSymplectic methods in geometric mechanics are a powerful tool to\r\naddress difficult questions in the dynamics of concrete problems such\r\nas the control of submarine or robotic arm motion, the elaboration of\r\nmodels for continuum systems such as rods and shells, or the study of\r\nthe shape of liquid or gaseous masses ranging from tiny drops to\r\ngalaxies. The development of the geometric foundations to attack these\r\nproblems as well as their application to several problems comprises\r\nthe work to be done on this grant.\r\n",
