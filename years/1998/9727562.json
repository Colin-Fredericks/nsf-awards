 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Frederick is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his studies of the dynamics   of photoisomerization and nonadiabatic relaxation processes.  The   objective of this work is to develop detailed models for the electronic   and vibrational dynamics of the photoinduced processes in the hexatriene   and octatetraene systems.  Quantitatively accurate potential energy   surfaces for the lowest three singlet states of these systems and the   nonadiabatic coupling between them will be derived using a combination of   high-level ab initio calculations and spectroscopic data.  Ultrafast   internal conversion and isomerization processes in these systems will be   studied using both quasiclassical and quantum dynamics.  A number of   specific questions regarding the photochemistry and photophysics of these   systems will be elucidated.  The photochemistry of polyenes is of central importance in a number of   natural processes, such as vision and photosynthesis, and in the   development of organic materials with conducting and photochromic   properties.  The proposed work has a potential for significant scientific   impact in providing a molecular level interpretation of these phenomena.",
