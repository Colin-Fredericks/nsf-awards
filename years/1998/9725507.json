Su-Yun Chung,  Uniformed Service University of the Health Science, and  Subramanian Subbiah, Wistar Institute, collaborating with  Dr. Limsoon Wong, National University of Singapore.  Drs. Su-  Yun Chung and Subramanian Subbiah request funds for travel,  communications, laboratory supplies, and computer time to  carry out a pilot experiment involving a data integration  and information synthesis system using the genetic data  collected from the fruit fly eye as a model.  The purpose of  this study is to develop a database query and integration  tool to handle complex biological problems. Dr. Chung's  expertise is in the area of homeobox gene regulation.  Dr.  Subbiah is trained in protein structure and function.  Their  Singapore counterpart scientist, Dr. Limsoon Wong,  is a  system scientist with a strong background in bioinformatics.  Their areas of expertise are complimentary for meeting the  project goals.  This study addresses a very important  fundamental question of integrating biological information  from disparate sources and could have a significant impact  on bioinformatics. This is a cutting edge project, which  will use the very Fast Backbone Network System (vBNS)  connection between the U.S. and Singapore.  The project is  jointly supported by the Singapore Science and Technology  Board and the NSF.",
