 "awd_abstract_narration": "Courseware tools are typically developed by an individual faculty member for a single course.  These tools are often designed to deliver content and are not learning based. Consequently it is difficult to assess how effectively these tools increase student learning. The goal of this project is to create a software-development environment in which science-based courseware tools with dynamic learning spaces are produced. This environment will involve an interdisciplinary team of faculty who will emphasize shared learning objectives, common assessment tools, and mutual software. The first step of the development process is for the team to determine which principles and intellectual approaches are shared by multiple scientific disciplines. Those team members teaching similar scientific principles and approaches will develop common design techniques in their courseware tools. Assessment tools will be developed to determine if a shared software design effectively teaches these principles and approaches in multiple disciplines. Assessment data will be collected continually as these tools are developed and released. The assessment results will allow the development group to determine which specific pedagogical methods span multiple disciplines and may have broad application. Therefore, the development of new module to enhance a courseware tool will benefit from the entire team's experience.    The team has identified three innovative approaches that have promise in terms of improving active student learning --- visualization, interface and simulation. Underlying each of these approaches will be student interactivity with the course content. Many scientific concepts can be presented both spatially and graphically. To facilitate learning of these concepts, one development approach will emphasize Visualizing Course Content. Specific tools to be developed that emphasize interactive visualization include the 3D Virtual Cell, the Visual Computer Program, and 3D Water Chemistry. Simulating Course Concepts wil l allow the student to travel to places they would never ordinarily experience by interacting and modifying the environment. The Geology Explorer is a tool that will designed to simulate interactive exploration at a geologic site. Finally, Interfacing with Course Content requires more efficient ways of presenting information, supporting navigation, and delivering course content. The development of Java/MOO Virtual Worlds will define interactive environments broadly applicable to different scientific disciplines. To ensure usability, design and components of the tools will be continually evaluated throughout the development process.    By combining assessment and evaluation with innovative learning approaches, the team will produce courseware tools rich in discipline-based content that teach principles and approaches common to many scientific fields. Collaborations with other universities will provide multiple course/multiple location assessment and evaluation data that will strengthen the products as they are designed. Because these courseware tools will have application in large enrollment general biology, geosciences and computer science courses, a broad range of students will be affected. Therefore, the developmental environment can serve as a model to define effective pedagogical approaches to teach science principles and content by using innovative courseware tools.",
