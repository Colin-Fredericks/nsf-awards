Capabilities to inventory and map land  cover conditions and to monitor land surface changes at  higher spatial and temporal resolution are needed. To  address these issues, a collaborative study between  researchers in Oklahoma and Nebraska will be carried out to  improve the simulation of surface heat and moisture fluxes  in mesoscale NWP models. This project will focus upon  weather events that are not forecast well by present  operational NWP models, such as extreme high and low  temperature events, where the incorporation of improved land  cover data is likely to have the greatest impact. Four  specific objectives are defined:  (1) evaluate the ability  to improve upon the daily coarse-resolution (1 km) satellite  data by blending in very high-resolution satellite data;   (2) evaluate the improvements from using a detailed land  surface parameterization scheme in mesoscale model  simulations by comparing modeled fluxes to the unique flux  observations available over Oklahoma;  (3) document the  improvements in simulating several extreme temperature  events that have occurred over the United States by  comparing mesoscale model simulations with and without the  detailed land cover data; and (4) incorporate the high-  resolution land cover into the Advanced Regional Prediction  System (ARPS) for use in operational NWP efforts. The  knowledge gained from this study will provide the  information necessary to improve the forecasts of extreme  weather events, particularly extreme high and low  temperature forecasts, that are a significant economic  concern. It is expected that improved forecasts of  temperatures would be of great use to insurance companies,  electric power utilities, agriculture, and the  transportation industries.",
