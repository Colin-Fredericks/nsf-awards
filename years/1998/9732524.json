Corcoran.  Ten students   will participate each year over the next three years in a ten-week summer   program.  The students will be selected from non-Ph. D. granting colleges   and universities in the West with emphasis on recruiting Native American   students.  Participants will be able to choose from a variety of research   topics across the fields of modern chemistry.  Research-oriented   instruction will include training in topics such as safety, library   search methods, report preparation, and techniques for effective public   presentation of research results.  Other aspects of the program include   career-oriented instruction and a field trip to a chemical company.    Students will be required to report research results in both written   reports and an oral presentation at an Undergraduate Research Symposium   to which a mentor from each student's parent institution will be invited",
