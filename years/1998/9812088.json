 "awd_abstract_narration": "9812088  Rabolt    This GOALI award between the University of Delaware and DuPont, co-funded  by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, is  focused on non-invasive analysis of polymers during actual processing.  Vibrational spectroscopy has the potential to act as a non-invasive probe  which is sensitive to chemical, conformational, crystal and morphological  structure as well as molecular orientation.  Both infrared spectroscopy and  Raman scattering will be utilized to examine polymeric films and fibers  because these spectroscopic probes are sensitive to the development of  backbone and side chain orientation and unlike x-ray diffraction do not  require a coherent stacking of crystalline regions in order to provide  structural information.  As a spectroscopic technique, Raman scattering is  non-invasive, capable of differentiating between conformers, and can  provide information on chain orientation when the directional nature of  polarized Raman scattering is utilized. An additional advantage of Raman  scattering is the ease of sampling.  Since it is a scattering technique,  spectra can be obtained on fiber bundles as well as individual filaments.  If instead, studies of thin films are of interest, then infrared (IR)  absorption spectroscopy is the choice since the absorption cross section is  5-6 orders of magnitude greater than the scattering cross section for the  same normal mode and the flat film geometry is ideally suited for IR  studies.  Hence both IR and Raman studies will be conducted in the \"real-  time\" domain as structure and orientation develop in poly(ethylene  terephthalate) (PET), poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) and poly(ethylene  napthalate) (PEN) during deformation and/or heating.  %%%  The use of polymeric materials is extremely widespread in our lives today.  The value that these materials provide to the end user is directly related  to the various properties, e.g.,  elasticity, toughness, and strength, that  they exhibit.  Infrared spectroscopy and Raman scattering are important  analytical techniques for the non-destructive evaluation of the development  of orientation and order in polymeric materials.  Traditionally studies are  done either before or after a polymer is processed into its final form  (e.g., soda bottle) but this fails to provide an insight into the evolution  of structural development as it happens.  The proposed approach outlined  here will allow for the real-time measurement of local order and  orientation as materials are processed.  The application of these  spectroscopic techniques to polymers will provide important information on  structure/property relationships which develop during processing and will  allow us to design new manufacturing protocols to optimize polymer  performance.  ***",
