 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Proposal:  97-33929  Northwestern University  PI:  Athanasius Ziliaskopoulos  \"CAREER:  On-line Optimization and Control of Real-Time  Transportation Systems\"      This CAREER award supports research concerned with the  problem of on-line control and optimization of the  operations of a real-time dynamic and stochastic  transportation system.  The motivation for this research is  two-fold:  to use to use new technological advances to  improve the control and management of transportation  operations; and to fill the gap created by the lack of  algorithms that can use these technologies to improve the  efficiency of transportation operations.    In addition to the research problems initiated by the  technological advances, several fundamental educational  issues are raised:  In general, students and practicing  transportation engineers do not have sufficient technical  background to fully appreciate the complex behavior of  stochastic and dynamic systems and the knowledge to exploit  the potential of real-time data.  This is partly due to  training that has traditionally been limited to the concepts  of equilibrium, steady state average system behavior and  determinism.  Educators are faced with the challenge of  developing innovative pedagogical material and methodologies  that convey the fundamental principles of dynamic and  stochastic systems, given the limited background of typical  engineering students.    The main research and educational objectives are:  to  analyze the operations of real-time transportation systems  and identify their properties; to develop closed form  analytical formulations by exploiting their special  properties and to explore various exact and heuristic  solution approached, optimality conditions for exact  algorithms and performance bounds for heuristic approaches;  and to develop new pedagogical tools that will enable  students to understand the fundamental principles of dynamic  and stochastic systems.  To achieve these objectives,  concepts from four  major areas will be utilized:  stochastic  programming, stochastic optimal control, process control,  and Markovian decision processes.",
