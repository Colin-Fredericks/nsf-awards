 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9760416  Yang    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on developing self-lubricating materials.  In certain applications involving high temperatures and vacuum environments, liquid lubricants cannot be used effectively and reliably.  Self-lubricating materials can provide an alternative lubrication method for these applications.  This program seeks to develop composites with microstructure in nanometer scale.  It is expected that nano-composites will feature friction coefficients low enough to be commercially significant.  Other anticipated benefits of the proposed material include superior wear resistance, hardness, corrosion resistance, and low density. During Phase 1, research will be conducted to demonstrate the proof-of-concept that nano-composites with significantly lower friction coefficient can be synthesized.  Phase II will develop, optimize and field test nano-composites.  Phase III will commercialize the technology.    Self-lubricating materials are very attractive for applications that require high temperatures and low pressure environments.  Potential applications include advanced gas turbines, space vehicles, satellite launch seals, high performance aircraft, and uncooled engines for automobiles.  Self-lubricating nano-composites would enhance energy efficiencies, extend life, improve system reliability and reduce environmental impact.  ***",
