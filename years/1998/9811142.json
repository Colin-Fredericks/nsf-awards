The doctoral dissertation research is concerned with the manner in which `communities` are constructed in today's changing technological environments.  The construction of community has long been associated with changes in technology, especially computer technologies, and this study interrogates the changing meaning of community in the information age.  It is thought that traditionally local forms of community have been weakened and that community networks are being used as tools for community revitalization and for countering the perceived effects of globalization on place.  These local community networks differ from other placeless virtual environments in that they provide explicitly local or regional information and free or low-cost electronic forums for discussion of local issues.  Moreover, they provide links to regional and global information that can be used to situate or provide context for local circumstances and to solve local problems. The study will assess how particular meanings of place and community used by networks help to empower or limit the potential of community responses to perceived effects of globalization.  A general survey of various community networking movements will be conducted, and this will be followed by in-depth interviews with community networking activists in four cities.  The results of the research are important to understanding whether new, globally-informed meanings of community are evolving in the information age and thereby challenging absolute understandings of place based on self-contained and inward looking perspectives.",
