 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870407  Rutledge  This project utilizes angle-resolved light scattering to study  materials science aspects of historical and artistic objects.  Light scattering is based on the differences in refractive index  of a feature and its surrounding matrix. Thus, it is possible to  carry out light scattering experiments without staining if  appropriate contrast is present. For the materials to be studied,  primarily ancient glasses, these features exist in the form of  inclusions, voids, and bubbles. The distribution, size and shape  of such defects provide valuable information on the method and  conditions of production and processing. In addition, the index  of refraction allows identification of impurities, providing  information on materials resources and fabrication techniques.  This project will develop and extend this analytical tool to  include the study of vitreous materials from the Antioch mosaics  and the glass beads of Nippur. A critical part of the project is  modifying, analyzing and understanding the data and further  developing the theory of light scattering for solid state defects  on the order of a wavelength. These extensions of current  capabilities will also be of value in studying more traditional  materials, including chemical vapor deposited diamond films,  optoelectronic materials and connective tissue. New undergraduate  research projects have been initiated, and an undergraduate  program in this area will be developed, and offered by Worcester  Polytechnic Institute in conjunction with conservation  departments at the Worcester Art Museum and at the Conservation  Analytical Laboratory at the Smithsonian Institution.  %%%  This is a research enhancement grant made under the Professional  Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE)  program. The project will contribute basic materials science  knowledge and materials characterization capabilities to the  study of historical and artistic objects.",
