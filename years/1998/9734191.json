 "awd_abstract_narration": "New digital information resources necessitate the creation of new tools for resource discovery. Users must negotiate a large number of collections of information, such as new digital libraries and the collections of traditional libraries and museums. The distribution of resources into separate domains prevents optimal searching, and users must search multiple systems sequentially in order to perform exhaustive searches. The solution to this problem is to provide an integrated control of resources so users can locate information without regard to its location. The focus of this project is to investigate user behavior in the selection of diverse information resources from distributed collections using qualitative field work methods. A prototype system which integrates various types of metadata and forms networks of linkages is used to determine how users select resources. The educational component of this project is to develop a broad interdisciplinary program that integrates various theories in information retrieval. The curriculum is intended to provide students with a technological grounding and a theoretical framework for addressing significant problems relating to networked information resource discovery and retrieval. The results of this project will provide insight into the integration of digital and traditional collections, and the optimal retrieval of resources from them. The findings will also provide for the design of diverse types of information retrieval systems, including search agents that seek out resources among distributed collections, and present an integrated view for user consultation.",
