These  fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative, computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic  evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled the history of  natural selection and other evolutionary processes in the  chalcone synthase genes of two grass species.  This study  uses coalescent theory to examine evolution at the chalcone  synthase (Chs) loci in maize and pearl millet. The relative  importance of effective population size, mutation,  recombination and selection is being evaluated through  statistical analyses of Chs gene genealogies. The primary  goal of the research is to detect the influence of selection  and explore the historical forces that have governed  molecular diversity in a major plant biosynthetic pathway.",
