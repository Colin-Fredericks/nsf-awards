The symposium will provide a foum for discussion of recent development in studies of nonlinear optical processes in organic and polymeric system and their applications in photonic technologies. This symposium is the fourth in a series that has been supported by NSF  previously. The funds granted to support this conference will be used for travel of graduate students with highest priority given to students who are presenting papers at the conference as first authors. This is appropriate utilization of NSF funds, since the experience obtained in attending conferences are often invaluable to the graduate students in educational terms, in establishing professional contacts and in job searching.    I recommend  an award to be made for the sum of $3,000 for this conference. The PI has accepted the reduced amount of support from his original request.",
