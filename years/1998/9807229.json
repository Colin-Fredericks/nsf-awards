 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vladimir Mandelshtam is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to develop methods for the study of   quantum dynamics in molecules and clusters.  His central technique is the   filter-diagonalization method, with the utilization of Chebyshev   dynamics.  Spectra will be computed and analyzed for unimolecular   dissociation and recombination processes.   Applications include   triatomic species such as nitorgen dioxide, formyl radical, and nitrosyl   hydride, with emphasis placed on non-adiabatic effects, including   Renner-Teller coupling and conical intersections.  Longer-term   applications include quantum effects in water and argon/hydrogen fluoride   clusters.  Theoretical studies of chemical dynamics based on accurate quantum   mechanical calculations are only possible for small molecules.  Therefore   such studies play a fundamental role in understanding the dynamics of   much larger systems and in relating exising approximate theories to   accurate quantum results.  Of special interest here are systems with   chaotic underlying classical dynamics and high densities of states.  A   complex quantum dynamics with unassignable spectra offers a challenge   even in the case of triatomic molecules.",
