One of the central\r\naims of the proposed research is to develop new techniques for\r\nstudying spacetime rigidity phenomena.  The proposed research seeks to\r\nestablish maximum principles for null hypersurfaces and use these to\r\nobtain splitting theorems/rigidity results for spacetimes which\r\ncontain null lines.  Problems in the theory of black holes are also to\r\nbe investigated.  These new techniques for studying null hypersurfaces\r\nwill make amenable the problem of rigorously establishing under\r\nnatural regularity assumptions Hawking's black hole area theorem.  The\r\ninvestigator will also continue research on topological censorship and\r\nits relationship to the topology of black holes, focusing on the\r\nconnection between asymptotic structure and black hole topology.\r\n\r\nIn more general terms, this research project is concerned with\r\nachieving a better understanding of the structure of the spacetime\r\nuniverse at both the cosmological scale and the scale of collapsing\r\nstars.  The aim of spacetime geometry, as to be utilized and developed\r\nin this project, is to study the relationship between three\r\nfundamental aspects of the spacetime universe: curvature (which by the\r\nEinstein equations is generated by the presence of matter), topology\r\n(i.e., the global shape of spacetime) and causal structure (i.e., the\r\nbehavior of light cones).  This research has applications to general\r\nrelativity and gravitation theory.\r\n\r\n",
