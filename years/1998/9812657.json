B.  Kokshenev, at UFMG  in  Brazil.  The  research  involves theoretical models for the formation of quadrupolar  and  orientational  glasses  in  molecular solids.  Examples  of  such  systems    are    ortho-para-hydrogen,    nitrogen/argon,     and  methane/krypton solid mixtures.  The new ideas introduced by  the  Brazilian  collaborator  have the  potential  of  being  able  to  distinguish  between  different scenarios for  quadrupolar  glass  freezing.  The  approach will be tested using  combined  NMR  and  calorimetric  techniques at the Univ. of Florida.  This  research  program  is interdisciplinary in nature and involves one or  more  graduate  students, who receive excellent training in preparation  for careers in industry, government laboratories or academia.  %%%  This  small  research  grant expedites collaboration  between  an  experimental  nuclear magnetic resonance group in Florida  and  a  theorist,  V.  B.  Kokshenev, at UFMG  in  Brazil.  The  research  involves  advanced  experimental techniques of  nuclear  magnetic  resonance (NMR), which allows the magnetic moment of atoms to  be  studied  within a solid sample. The experimental and  theoretical  research  probes  the interaction of different  magnetic  moments  within  a  sample, and possible transitions which  may  occur  in  their   collective  behavior.The  research  involves  theoretical  models for the formation of quadrupolar and orientational glasses  in  molecular  solids.
