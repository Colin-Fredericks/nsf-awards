This device measures continuous  particle size distribution in samples by measuring the time  varying attenuation of X-rays passing through samples as  particles fall under the force of gravity through a liquid  medium.  The basic principle of the measurement relies on Stokes'  Law of particle settling; larger particles settle more rapidly  (neglecting particle shape and density variations) than smaller  particles.    The particle size analyzer will be used for a variety of funded  research projects both for grain size analysis and as an  alternative mineral separation technique.  Studies of size-  dependent isotopic exchange between zeolite minerals and  surrounding fluids, size-dependent/surface area dependent  silicate mineral weathering rates and provenance studies of  marine sediments will take advantage of the instruments ability  to rapidly measure continuous grain size distributions over a  wide range of silt and clay sized particles (100 microns-10 nm).  Several researchers at Dartmouth will make use of this equipment  and will involve undergraduate students in the analytical phases  of their respective research programs.  ***",
