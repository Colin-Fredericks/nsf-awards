 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research will be the development of strategies for   engineering homogeneous glycoforms on proteins and cells using the   principle of chemoselective ligation.  For gycoprotein engineering, a   three-step process is envisioned.  First, recombinant expression of   O-linked glycoproteins in the presence of an oligosaccharide elongation   inhibitor yields truncated glycoproteins with single GalNAc residues at   the O-linked sites.  Second, an aldehyde group is introduced onto   truncated glycoproteins using galactose oxidase.  Third, synthetic   oligosaccharides functionalized with complementary reactive groups are   ligated onto the truncated scaffold, affording glycoproteins with   rationally designed, homogeneous glycoforms.  The focus of the   educational activities involves course and web site development.  With   this Faculty Early Development (CAREER) award, the Organic and   Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and   educational activities of Dr. Carolyn Bertozzi  of the Department of   Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley.   Professor Bertozzi    will focus her research efforts on  developing strategies for   engineering homogeneous glycoforms on proteins and cells using the   techniques of synthetic chemistry, recombinant expression and metabolic   engineering.  This approach will be used to investigate glycoproteins   involved in leukocyte activation and cell-cell interactions essential to   the inflammatory response.   Course and curriculum development will be   stressed in the educational efforts supported by the award.",
