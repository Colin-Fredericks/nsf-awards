 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870676  Johnson       This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training  (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a broadly-  based graduate training program in mathematical, cognitive and  computational approaches to understanding how diverse  cognitive processes, including language, movement and  reasoning, are learned.  The basic phenomena to be addressed  are of significant commercial as well as scientific importance  because, for example, they form the basis for design of speech  and pattern recognition software, and for the design of  robotic systems.   The program is a joint effort of 13 faculty  from the Departments of  Applied Mathematics, Cognitive and  Linguistic Sciences, and Computer Science. In combination with  institutional resources, NSF funds will provide stipends for  12 graduate students, 2 postdoctoral students and 9  undergraduate students each year, as well as for related costs  of  student research training. Graduate students will be required  to satisfy existing coursework requirements of their home  departments and to take at least three new IGERT advanced  topics courses meant to span the three participating  disciplines.  During the first two years of graduate school,  each student will complete an interdisciplinary research  project before beginning thesis research.  All IGERT graduate  trainees and faculty will also participate in a weekly  research seminar, biannual retreats, a yearly week-long mini-  course lead by a visiting researcher and a national conference  to be organized during the second year of the project.  Postdoctoral fellows will jointly organize one of the advanced  topics courses and will themselves receive additional training  to complement that received during their own graduate studies.  Undergraduate students will become involved through active  involvement in summer research projects in the groups of  participating faculty.       IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program whose goal is to sponsor  the establishment of innovative, researc h-based graduate  programs that will train a diverse group of new scientists and  engineers to be well-prepared for varied careers in the  private and public sectors.  IGERT provides an opportunity for  the development of new, well-focused multidisciplinary  programs that bridge traditional organizational barriers,  uniting faculty from several departments or institutions to  establish a highly-interactive collaborative environment for  both training and research.  In its first year, the program  will provide support to 17 institutions for new or nascent  programs that collectively span all areas of science,  engineering and mathematics eligible for support by the NSF.",
