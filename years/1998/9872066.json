 "awd_abstract_narration": "Systems-on-a-chip (SOCs) contain predesigned subsystems that  contain intellectual property (IP) from many sources. IP-  based design technologies allow the use of predesigned  subsystems, which facilitate the design of complex, critical  systems. However, it introduces some fundamental problems in  validation. This research is exploring methodologies for  lifetime validation for ensuring that an IP based SOC  operates within acceptable correctness bounds over its  projected lifetime. Here, validation means the task of  ensuring that a system contains no undetected design errors  or physical faults that can cause a critical system failure.  An integrated approach to design verification and physical  fault testing for SOCs employing components, whose  implementation or validation status is incompletely, known  is being pursued. The research focuses on two related  issues: (1) devising synthetic models of design errors that  lead to high quality design validation methods; and (2)  validating designs that contain IP-style circuits.  Functional testing methods that provide implementation-  independent fault coverage are being developed. The research  includes theoretical studies and experimental work using  university-industry designs, with emphasis on hard-to-detect  faults and safety-critical applications.",
