 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microbial processes are very prominent in research and industry, but few college laboratories, and fewer high school courses are able to present this technology to their students.  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from EDVOTEK, Inc. will conduct research focusing on the feasibility of developing biotechnology teaching and learning resources, which include cost-effective fermentation equipment.  This equipment will be utilized with investigative problem-based experiments.  Along with the advantages in cost and simplicity of fermenters, EDVOTEK proposes to craft laboratory experiments illustrating a variety of processes.  Kits of culture media, live inocula, and all the accessories needed for each experiment will be researched.   At this time there is no fermentation equipment at reasonable cost ($500 to $1000) that can simulate that used in the biotechnology industry.  Likewise, there are no readily available commercial experiments that can provide new approaches to teaching and learning fermentation biotechnology.  The project will contribute what is currently unavailable:  cost-effective fermentation equipment and accompanying experiments and thereby enhance student understanding of biological concepts in such a way as to illuminate student cognizance of the relationship between laboratory activities and the solution of real-life biotechnology problems.",
