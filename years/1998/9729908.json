The goals of the workshop are: to review the basic principles and methodologies of axiomatic design, to share the knowledge, results and course materials developed in the field of axiomatic design, and to provide a means of networking and exchange of ideas between professors and university instructors involved in design education.  The workshop is to be arranged with seven instructional sessions, and one breakout session for each afternoon to provide ample opportunity for review of materials and follow-up discussions.  The workshop proposal was sent out for mail review by three reviewers.  It was rated excellent by all three reviewers.  The reviewers feel that since axiomatic design is one of major design paradigms used in engineering colleges, such a workshop could have a great impact if it could have the right attendance.  Axiomatic design is one of major design paradigms used in engineering colleges, and it has important applications to design of manufacturing processes, equipment and systems.  Such a workshop could have a great impact if it could have the right attendance and lively discussions.",
