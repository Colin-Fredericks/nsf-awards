 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research project focuses on the current struggle over American racial classifications. The \"color line,\" once so clearly and indelibly drawn by the one-drop rule, is being redrawn by a putative multiracial community. We argue that this movement is comprised of multiple strands of action, oriented toward self-expression, family and state. Three issues in particular will be addressed: 1) the social conditions leading to the formation of the \"multiracial movement\", 2) whether or not a collective multiracial consciousness is developing, and 3) the motivations behind this activism. Hypotheses drawn from the insights of social movement research predict that the multiracial movement has emerged through the convergence of three critical factors: 1) political opportunities that have allowed agents to gain access to the political sphere, 2) an organizational base that allows groups to take advantage of those opportunities, and 3) framings of the experience of multiraciality that encourage more organization around the issue.\tData will consist of a combination of interviews with the founders, leaders, and a sample of membership from multiracial organizations; archival research, demographic data, and fieldwork at events sponsored by multiracial organization. The study will provide needed systematic analysis of multiracial movement where none exists to date.",
