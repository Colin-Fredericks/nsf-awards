Clyde  Institution: Duke University  Project: Mode Uncertainty, Model Selection, and Robustness, with   Applications in Environmental Sciences    Abstract:    Finding models to describe data and relationships among  variables is a fundamental problem in statistics and science. Linear   regression and its generalizations are some of the most commonly used   statistical methods for data analysis.  As scientists collect   increasingly larger data sets, the fear of over-fitting the data by   using all measured covariates leads to the standard approach of  selecting a single ``best'' model based on a subset of the  covariates, and then proceeding with scientific inferences and  predictions as if that were the true model.  This typical analysis  ignores the uncertainty about which variables should be included in  the model, potentially leading to overconfident inferences.  Model  uncertainty often significantly outweighs other sources of  uncertainty in problems, but is generally ignored in standard  statistical practice and teaching.    This research focuses on Bayesian methods for incorporating model  uncertainty into data analysis and decision making.  In Bayesian  model averaging, predictions and inferences are based on a set of  models rather than a single model; each model contributes  proportionally to the support it receives from the observed data.  Novel methods of identifying promising models for use in Bayesian  model averaging are studied.  These can increase the applicability  of Bayesian methods to realistic problems that involve a large  number of variables.  One of the major applications of the  research is to estimate the effect of particulate matter on  mortality in the elderly population and assess the potential  impact of the EPA's new National Ambient Air Quality Standards  for particulates.  This and other case studies will be used to  develop a new course in modern Baye sian statistical methods for  environmental and biological science students at Duke University.",
