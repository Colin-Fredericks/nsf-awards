 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clemson University has established a Genomics Institute (CUGI) focusing on research, teaching and service in agricultural genomics. The service component of the CUGI has been to produce high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries from plants and plant pests and to provide convenient and affordable access to these products. With the assistance of several high-throughput robotic instruments, the CUGI has produced, acquired and distributed the majority of plant and fungal BAC libraries in use today. Because of the increasing demand on the service component of CUGI, funding is requested to support operations of the service facility. Funding of this project will expand services provided by CUGI to include: picking, arraying and rearraying of EST (expressed sequence tag) clones; arraying and rearraying of BAC and EST DNA onto filters; production of BAC DNA pools for library screening with primers; distribution of BAC and EST clones; BAC library screening by hybridization and PCR; fingerprinting of BAC clones identified by hybridization and PCR; BAC end sequencing; a centralized database for BAC fingerprints, hybridization and BAC end sequence data; training in BAC library construction and characterization through workshops at Clemson; and development of microarray technology for gene expression profiling and provision of this technology to the community. CUGI operates as a non-profit organization and will provide these services on a cost recovery basis. The service component of CUGI described here should be fully self-supporting by the end of the proposed funding period.",
