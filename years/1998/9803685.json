A complete characterization of the \r\nsequence of bifurcations leading to turbulence will be attempted based on \r\nthe calculation of hidden steady states, analyses of their local stability \r\nproperties and controlled numerical simulations. The striking similarity \r\nbetween those hidden ordered states and the coherent structures observed \r\nexperimentally near boundaries will be investigated. It is also proposed to \r\ndevelop simplified models of the self-sustaining process, such as a low-\r\norder model developed in earlier work.\r\n\r\nThis work illustrates the unique capabilities of high-performance \r\nScientific Computing. The flow features that are revealed by this approach \r\nare not accessible by any other means, including analytical or \r\nexperimental techniques or even numerical simulations. These features are \r\nthe order hidden beneath the turbulence and their elucidation is of deep \r\ntheoretical and practical interest. Turbulence is the defining characteristic \r\nof fluid flows in engineering and geophysical settings as well as of many \r\nbiological flows. Therefore, progress in the fundamental understanding of \r\nturbulence is of wide-ranging practical relevance. A direct application of \r\nthis research is to the development of robust models for prediction and \r\ncontrol of turbulent flows in pipes and channels and over wings and \r\nsurfaces, with an aim at drag and noise reduction.\r\n",
