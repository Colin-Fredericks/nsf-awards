 "awd_abstract_narration": "9812276  Philip Liu, Cornell U.    This action is to support a workshop in Baltimore, MD, 8-9 May  1998, to  discuss the needs in tsunami coastal engineering within the  proposed  National Network for High Performance Seismic Simulation (NHPS).  While the  focus is on the needs within coastal engineering, the interface  with  facilities for structural and geotechnical engineering seismic  simulation  will be considered.  The proposed NHPS responds to the need, expressed via a series of  workshops extending over a period of twenty years, to obtain  experimental  data on the behavior of engineering materials, soils, and  constructed  facilities exposed to earthquake strong-ground shaking and/or the  related  runup of a tsunami. Integral to the NHPS is the concept of  connecting the  experimental facilities via a modern high-performance computer and  communication network in order to enhance the capabilities of the  individual facilities through synergism, and to provide remote  access by  off-site users.  It is planned to extend the network to include  key  experimental facilities around the world.  The tsunami research community is considering the upgrade of two  existing  research facilities: a large three-dimensional facility with a  directional  wave generator, and a two-dimensional wave tank. Each facility  would be  used both for numerical-experimental comparisons and for  experiments for  which current theoretical-numeral approaches are not possible. The  objective of this workshop is to discuss challenging research  topics to be  addressed, and the specific experimental facilities needed to  perform the  associated experiments.  It is expected that the deliberations of this workshop will: (1)  contribute to a clearer definition of the experimental facilities  to be  included within the NHPS, and the experiments that can be  undertaken using  these facilities; and (2) begin a discussion of important culture  changes  associated with the NHPS resulting from remote access  capabilities, the   rapid dissemination of results, and the need to give appropriate  authorship  credit for the rapid publication of experimental results.",
