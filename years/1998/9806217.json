 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rosemary Steinmetz    Project Title:  Estrogen Receptor-Beta Activation of  Prolactin Gene Expression    Estrogens modulate the growth and differentiation of many  body tissues by influencing the activation or deactivation  of estrogen-responsive genes.  The first, and most critical,  step that is involved in this activation is the binding of  estrogen to its endogenous intracellular receptor (ER).  ER-  alpha (ERa), the first identified and best characterized ER,  is composed of several regions or functional domains. Each  of these domains carry out a specific function which is  absolutely essential for the ER to induce gene activation.  Recently, a new ER variant ER-Beta (ER-B) has been  discovered.  ER-B differs from ERa both in size and the  sequence of the amino acids which comprise it.  These  differences may cause this new receptor to interact with new  genes or new ligands or allow it to interact with already  identified estrogen-sensitive genes in a manner different  from that of ERa.  Little is known concerning how this new  receptor interacts physically with the genes it governs.  The overall objective of this study is to determine the  functional domains of ER-B that are required for the  activation of the estrogen-responsive prolactin gene.  Based  on information concerning the structure of ER-B and its  homology to ERa, the first specific aim is to construct a  series of expression vectors which will express either  truncated or mutated ER-B receptors.  Using theses mutants,  for in vitro transfection assays, we will be able to  identify which domain(s) of the ER-B molecule bind various  estrogenic compounds and which are required for gene  activation.    ER-B has been detected in a variety of tissues including the  pituitary. Prolactin is a pituitary hormone that is  exquisitely estrogen-sensitive. Prolactin is involved in  many physiologic functions including reproduction,  lactation, sexual development, cellular immunity and  behavior.  Little is known concerning the regulation  of the  prolactin gene by ER-B.  Estrogens bind to the ER and in  synergy  with the pituitary-specific factor Pit-1 stimulate  prolactin synthesis and release.  While the nature of the  interaction between Pit-1 and the ERa variant has been well  characterized, the interaction between Pit-1 and ER-B has  not been determined.  The second specific aim of this study  is to characterize the molecular interactions between Pit-1  and ER-B that are involved in prolactin gene activation.  This will be accomplished by using the prepared mutant  receptors in gene transfer studies.  Each of the mutant  receptors will be introduced into heterologous cell cultures  in combination with Pit-1 and a prolactin reporter gene.  These cells will then be treated with selected estrogenic  compounds and the transcriptional activation of the  prolactin reporter gene will be quantified.  These studies  will determine which regions of the ER-B work  synergistically with Pit-1 and which are required for  induction of prolactin by estrogenic compounds.  Results of  these studies will begin to determine the physical  interactions between this new receptor isoform and the genes  that it controls, as well as, expanding our existing  knowledge concerning the mechanisms which govern prolactin  homeostasis. These results will advance our knowledge  concerning the actions of this newly discovered receptor.",
