 "awd_abstract_narration": "This twelve-month award will support a US-Portuguese workshop on regional economic   indicators models chaired on the US side by Douglas Woodward of the University of   South Carolina and on the Portuguese side by Paulo Guimaraes of the University of   Minho in Portugal.  On the European side, the workshop will be attended by European   scholars and practitioners outside of Portugal as well as those from Portugal.  The goal of   the workshop is to develop a common methodology and approach to regional economic   indicator modeling, based on work that has been done at the national level.   The US brings to the workshop significant methodological advances in the development   of national economic indicators, as well as a strong effort to develop regional indicators   at the University of South Carolina.  This expertise is matched by similar research efforts   at the University of Minho, as well as the Europeans' broader experience in developing   indicators to track regional differences in Europe.  The different research backgrounds of   the participants will enable the design of an integrated approach to regional economic   indicator modeling",
