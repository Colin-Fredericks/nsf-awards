This  meeting will bring together experts in the field of solid state  chemistry to inform a broad range of inorganic, solid state and  materials chemists about the latest advances in this field to  include new synthetic tools involving high pressure,  supercritical fluids, and crystal engineering for the  preparation of novel materials such as porous modular solids,  composites, perovskites, complex arsenides and antimonides,  sulfides and  phosphides.  %%%  New materials classes of high technological importance are  emerging at a rapid rate due in large part to the development of  new solid state synthetic strategies that provide new materials  exhibiting a wide range of interesting properties such as  thermoelectric, dielectric, ferroelectric, and colossal  magnetoresistance. These approaches have recently been used by  industrial firms searching for new materials for diverse  applications such as batteries, fuel cells, detectors, and  refrigeration.  ***",
