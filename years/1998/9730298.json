 "awd_abstract_narration": "9730298  Fischer    This   interdisciplinary  experimental   research   project,  involving  a  major  collaborator in Budapest,  Hungary,  is  concerned  with electronic conduction in fulleride compounds  such  as A3C60, where A is an alkali metal. A novel, cavity-  less,   high   magnetic   field  electron   spin   resonance  spectrometer  developed  by the Hungarian  collaborator,  A.  Janossy,  will for the first time allow measurement  of  the  conduction electron spin resonance below Tc. The American PI  Fischer    has   considerable   experience   in   synthesis,  characterization  and  structure-property  correlations   in  superconducting   fulleride  salts.  Characterization   will  routinely make use of NSLS at Brookhaven National  Lab.  The  goals  of  the  combined effort will be to  solve  important  unanswered   questions  in  fulleride  superconductors   and  polymers:   the  nature  of  the  electron-phonon  coupling,  importance  of electron-electron correlations, the  identity  of  the  antiferromagnetic resonance in AC60  (spin  density  wave   vs.  3-D  magnetic  order)  and  the  importance   of  interchain  coupling. This highly interdisciplinary  project  will  involve  a  graduate student who  will  pursue  thesis  research  at  both  laboratory locations, and  will  receive  excellent   training  beneficial  to  a  future  career   in  industry, government or academia.  %%%  This   interdisciplinary  experimental   research   project,  involving  a  major  collaborator in Budapest,  Hungary,  is  concerned  with  electrical conduction  in  novel  compounds  solid compounds known as fullerides. These compounds have as  basic  building block the carbon-60 (C60) molecule, commonly  referred  to  as  the  Buckyball.  To  make  the  conducting  compounds alkali metals such as Rubidium, which easily  give  up  an electron, have been used. It has been found that  the  resulting compounds can be superconducting up to about  30K,  which  is  higher  than  any  of the  convention al  familiar  superconductors such as Pb or NbTi, and the reasons for this  interesting  and potentially useful behavior are imperfectly  understood. The collaborative research project is especially  appropriate  because  one  PI  is  expert  in   making   and  characterizing  these  compounds,  and  the  other,  who  is  located in Budapest, has developed and is expert in the  use  of  a novel electron spin resonance instrument which will be  especially   useful  to  study  the  electronic   conduction  processes. The collaborative research will involve  training  of  a graduate student who will work in the laboratories  of  both  PI's,  and  thereby obtain an unusually  international  educational  experience. This student, and others  that  may  also be involved, will receive excellent training beneficial  to a future career in industry, government or academia.  ***",
