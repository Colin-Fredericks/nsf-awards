 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of physical problems involve localized phenomena\r\nthat move in time, such as fluid fronts, interfaces and shocks.\r\nOften, these phenomena are not captured well by finite difference\r\nmethods on uniform grids.  The investigators work on three\r\nclasses of such problems: flow in porous media, particularly\r\nchemically enhanced aquifer remediation; thin film flow with\r\nfluid fronts due to vanishing diffusive fluxes; and excitable\r\nmedia, particularly the modeling of the propagation of electrical\r\nimpulses in the heart.  All three of these problems involve\r\ndiffusion; the diffusion can be nonlinear, subdiffusive or\r\nsuperdiffusive.  The investigators develop efficient multilevel\r\niterative methods and adaptive mesh refinement tools to solve\r\nthese problems on parallel processor machines.\r\n     The power of computers has dramatically increased  since\r\nthey were introduced a half century ago, and this improvement in\r\nperformance continues at a breathtaking pace.  Nonetheless,\r\nalthough the public is generally unaware of this, the\r\ncomputational resources required to simulate many phenomena, like\r\nthe weather, greatly exceed those currently available.  One way\r\nto obtain a lot of computer power is to arrange for many\r\ncomputers to work simultaneously on a problem.  However, it is a\r\ndaunting task to program these computers so that they will\r\ncorrectly produce the desired simulation in a timely fashion.  In\r\nthis work, the investigators develop effective methods to use\r\nmany computers working together to simulate the flow of\r\ncontaminants in the ground, the behavior of thin films, and the\r\nelectrophysiology of the heart.  Groundwater contamination is a\r\nsignificant environmental problem.   Thin film problems arise in\r\nlubrication and in manufacturing processes.  A fundamental\r\nunderstanding of the electrical and muscular behavior of the\r\nheart is important and could lead to better control of the\r\nmechanisms of arrhythmia.\r\n\r\n",
