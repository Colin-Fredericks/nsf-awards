 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)  project is supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.  It  focusses on collaboration between Stanford University and IBM  Almaden Research Center on an extremely important problem,  increasing the durability and areal density of magnetic recording  media.  Professor Klug and his students at Stanford University will  work in close collaboration with Drs. Wade and Sherwood at IBM  Almaden to systematically study the overcoat-lubricant interface of  hard disks using surface spectroscopy and solid-state Nuclear  Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.  Overcoats on sol-gel silicon  dioxide and on amorphous carbon composed of perfluoro-polyethers  will be the focus of this study.  The technology of magnetic  recording devices will be improved by this project and this high  risk-high return project will enhance the educational experience of  students. The students will gain broad experience in an industrial  setting ranging from basic laboratory work to implementation in a  manufacturing facility.  The mentoring of these students by many  industrial scientists will be invaluable to them as they make  career decisions.  Professor Klug and his students at Stanford University will  collaborate with Drs. Wade and Sherwood at IBM Almaden Research  Center in the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with  Industry project to study the surfaces of magnetic recording  materials.  Through a systematic study of the lubrication  properties of these surfaces computer hard disks will be developed  that have increased data storage capacities and improved  durability.  Solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy  will be the central method used to study these surfaces and special  attention to handling of these thin film materials will be required  in this work in order to obtain useful information.  Professor Klug  and his students will gain valuable experience through  collaboration with their IBM industrial partners during this  project.  Mentoring of these students by industrial scientists will  be invaluable as they make future career decisions.",
