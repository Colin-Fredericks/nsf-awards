In most actiniarians, this larva is a transient stage that   develops into an adult with twelve mesenteries and a distinctive basal  disc.  One family, the Edwardsiidae, gives its name to the larval stage  because its adults retain eight mesenteries and lack a basal disc.  The  similarity between the larval form of other zoantharians and adult  edwardsiids has given rise to various hypotheses including the hypothesis  that the Edwardsiidae are the basal group or the derived crown group of  the Zoantharia.  The goals of this research are:  (1) to evaluate  hypotheses concerning the evolutionary placement of the Edwardsiidae in  the Zoantharia using phylogenetic methods.  Data for this will come from  gross anatomical and histological investigation of adults, studies of  developmental morphogenesis, scanning electron microscopy of nematocysts,  and transmission electron microscopy of sperm. (2) Because the  Edwardsiidae are apparently disappearing from many habitats, it is  important for us to develop accurate species and generic characterizations  and identification guides.  Therefore we will initiate of a revision of  the species and genera of Edwardsiidae that will include an analysis of  morphological variation within species collected from the same area, lists  of synonomy, distribution information, and indentification keys. The  Dissertation Improvement Award will allow us to travel to collect  specimens and to examine specimens in museum collections in Europe.",
