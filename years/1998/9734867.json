 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Prof. Veronica   Bierbaum of the University of Colorado-Boulder in her continuing studies   of the kinetics, mechanisms and thermochemistry of gas phase ion-molecule   reactions.  Dr. Bierbaum will carry out research in the following areas:    1)  the study of symmetric SN2 reactions of methyl chloride as a function   of pressure, buffer gas and isotope substitution, and SN2 reactivity at   neutral nitrogen in the gas phase; and 2) experimental and computational   studies of ion thermochemistry to systems of atmospheric relevance.  In   addition, she will pursue two new projects:  3) the study of reactions of   ions with nitrogen and oxygen atoms; and 4) chemical ionization detection   of biogenic emissions.  The PI will employ a tandem flowing   afterglow-selected ion flow-drift tube coupled with a triple quadrupole   detector to carry out the reactions and monitor products.    The experimental results from this research program will contribute to   our fundamental understanding of reaction kinetics, mechanism, and   thermochemistry, as well as provide valuable comparison with theory.    Much of the thermochemical data has relevance to important combustion and   atmospheric processes.  The characterization of biogenic emissions   addresses a critical problem in atmospheric chemistry:  the sources of   high concentrations of oxygenated hydrocarbons in the earth's troposphere   are not currently understood; however, their impact on atmospheric   chemistry is significant.",
