 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the synthesis and characterization of molecules,   called photoacids, that exhibit changes in acid-base properties on   optical excitation.   Synthetic methodologies will be developed to   achieve molecules whose photoacidity can be tailored thereby providing   new methods for studies of proton transfer reactions and novel   polymerization catalysts.  The research introduces graduate and   postdoctoral students to new concepts in acid-base chemistry and   kinetics, and to the methodologies to examine these transient effects.  With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   supports the research of Professor Laren Tolbert of the School of   Chemistry and Biochemistry at Georgia Institute of Technology.     Professor Tolbert will focus his research efforts on the synthesis and   excited state chemistry of molecules, called photoacids, whose acid-base   properties change on optical excitation.   These molecules, which can   exhibit immense, but transient, changes in acid-base properties, provide   new methods to study acid-base chemistry, and novel approaches to   photoactivated, polymerization catalysts.   Through Professor Tolbert's   research, graduate and postdoctoral students will be exposed to new   concepts in acid-base chemistry, and the methodology to examine these   transient effects.",
