For the Kaehler-Ricci flow, we would\r\nlike to understand the structure of certain gradient Kaehler-Ricci\r\nsolitons, which arise as limits of dilations of singularities of the\r\nRicci flow. This has important applications in Kaehler geometry and\r\nmay lead to new knowledge and new insights in the field of geometric\r\nevolution equations. It turns out, as our research indicates, that the\r\nstudy of gradient Ricci solitons has a close link to the symplectic\r\ngeometry of existence of closed orbits for certain special Hamiltonian\r\nvector field. For the second problem, our goal is to classify\r\nasymptotically locally Euclidean Ricci-flat four-manifolds via\r\nSeiberg-Witten theory. This is related to the generalized positive\r\naction conjecture of Hawking and Pope.  For the third problem, note\r\nthat a remarkable consequence of the existence of a Kaehler-Einstein\r\nmetric on a Kaehler surface is the Miyaoka-Yau inequality between the\r\nEuler characteristic number and signature of the underlying\r\nfour-manifold of the Kaehler surface. In this proposal we also propose\r\nto study the interesting question whether every closed oriented\r\nEinstein four-manifold satisfies the Miyaoka-Yau Inequality.\r\n\r\nThe Ricci flow is an important geometric \"heat\" equation. In general,\r\nheat equations describe the process of changes of tempreature of\r\nmaterial to a steady state. The Ricci flow describes changes of\r\nmetrics. Its \"steady state\" is an Einstein metric, whose existence is\r\nof fundemental importance in geometry, topology, and general\r\nrelativity. Our proposal relates nonlinear partial differential\r\nequations, differential and complex geometry in mathematics, and\r\ngravity, general relativity in physics. A thorough understanding of\r\nthe problems proposed should advance our knowledge in these aspects\r\nand give us new insight.\r\n",
