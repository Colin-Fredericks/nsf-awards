 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project submitted by CyberScan Technologies Company provides an affordable means of electronically enhancing the nation's large installed chalk boards, white boards, and drawing board base.  By adapting conventional writing surfaces rather than replacing them with expensive electronic white boards or graphics tablets, academic institutions, corporations, and governments could save approximately $5 billion in new equipment and installation costs.  CyberScan Technologies proposes to develop a retrofittable, low cost, area adaptive system that can optically capture notes, drawings or sketches to a computer or the Internet.  CyberScan will research the feasibility of digitizing hand strokes in real time using two small optical sensors and an optically transmitting pen or chalk holder.  CyberScan anticipates this technique could convert written information on surfaces from one to twelve feet in diagonal into electronic data suitable for display on a PC SVGA display screen.  Potential commercial applications of the research include: CAD/CAM digitizers, low cost and portable electronic white board alternatives, video conferencing input devices, medical patient charting, and academic, corporate, military, and government interactive presentation devices.  Because of the serious interest of a potential marketing partner in the electronic white board field, rapid commercialization of products is extremely likely.",
