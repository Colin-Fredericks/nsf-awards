 "awd_abstract_narration": "Failure in requirements analysis is increasingly seen as a key problem in system design.  Low-level requirements arising out of established and stable organizational workflow patterns are relatively easy to comprehend, but it is harder to determine high-level requirements arising from the broader institutional and organizational contexts of workflow that determine what ultimately can and cannot be accomplished with computer-based information systems. Environments with broad degrees of freedom for organizational action, especially when systems are intended to change organizational behavior present designers with the need to reduce the search space to viable options.  The process for determining high-level requirements through a strategy of search-space definition and reduction is developed using  an enhanced version of the  Grossman, Hart and Moore property rights model to create an a priori alignment model of task responsibilities and asset ownership in a complex production system dependent on non-integrated coordination mechanisms such as contracts.  This is used to determine a limited but realistic set of workflow parameters that frame the requirements analysis task.  The test domain is the development of information system support for process coordination in advanced logistics, but the results of the work will be  generalizable to a wider range of organizational problems. http://www.ics.uci.edu/~king/hlr.html",
