 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Jonathon L. Sessler, of the Department of Chemistry and   Biochemistry at the University of Texas at Austin, is supported by the   Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies of expanded   porphyrins and calixpyrroles.  Through the synthesis of expanded   porphyrin systems, including those designed to provide three-dimensional   coordination geometries to complement the planar to near-planar geometry   afforded by simpler porphyrin derivatives, Professor Sessler assesses the   geometric requirements of anion complexation, cation coordination, and   neutral substrate binding by these systems.  Related studies address the   basic molecular recognition properties of two new substrate binding   platforms, the calix(n(pyrroles and calix(n)pyridines.  The specific interaction between ions or molecules and receptors for them   represents a critical feature in countless biochemical processes.    Whereas the `molecular recognition` of positively charged species   (cations) has received intense scrutiny, the recognition of negatively   charged molecules (anions) has developed more slowly.  With the support   of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Jonathon   L. Sessler, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the   University of Texas at Austin, prepares large-ring cyclic compounds   designed to display specific interactions with various anions.  Given   their unique structural features, many of these compounds also act as   binding agents for cations and neutral molecules.  Through the synthesis   and study of these compounds, Professor Sessler gains critical   information regarding the relationship between structure and function in   the binding of ions and molecules.",
