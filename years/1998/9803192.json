 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Proposal: DMS-9803192  Principal Investigator:  Simon Donaldson    The main topic of this project involves the application of methods  from complex geometry to symplectic topology. The investigator  will develop a general procedure for translating problems in this  area into combinatorial questions involving the monodromy of a  family of codimension 2 submanifolds.  It is expected that this  will apply, in principle, both to the classification problem for  symplectic manifolds and also to Lagrangian submanifolds and  symplectomorphisms. Once the general foundations are in place  applications will be considered: the question here will be to see  if the combinatorial problems can be cast into a tractable form.  Particular attention will be paid to the role of the Floer  homology groups obtained from the monodromy. One subsidiary topic  in the project involves research into the geometry of Kahler  metrics: the specific goals here are to prove the existence of  certain geodesics in the space of Kahler metrics, and apply these  to Calabi's extremal metric program. This existence question is  a version of the Dirichlet problem for the homogeneous  Monge-Ampere equation, a topic of independent interest. The other  subsidiary topic involves research into manifolds with exceptional  holonomy groups, and particularly the search for new examples,  obtained using complex 3-folds as building blocks.    Complex numbers, made up of real and imaginary components, are  fundamental throughout mathematics. In geometry, it has been  realised since the middle of the last century that properties of  the complex number system are intimately bound up with the  geometry and topology of 2-dimensional spaces. The elaboration of  this theme, and its extension to higher dimensions, has been one  of the main achievements of twentieth century mathematics. The  ideas have many contacts with numerous branches of Mathematical  Physics, including the theory of potentials and fields, quantum  theory and relativity. Mat hematically, many of the questions come  down to the detailed analysis of nonlinear partial differential  equations.  The proposed research will contribute to this brood  development, focusing on a number of specific and topical  questions, in all of which complex variables play a key role.",
