 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 9803480    Paul Roberts, Natalia Berloff    GENERALIZED NONLINEAR SCHRODINGER EQUATIONS AND APPLICATIONS       TO SUPERFLUID TURBULENCE    The proposed research has three closely related objectives.  The first  is to develop and study new variants of the nonlinear Schroedinger  equation (NLS) that are more faithful to superfluid helium. In real  helium, even in the low temperature range, normal fluid is present  which is coupled to the superfluid and which, through its viscosity,  provides a high wavenumber energy sink. So the existing models need to  be modified to include the mutual friction with the normal fluid. To  evaluate the energy loss of interactions with the normal fluid one  needs the kinetic coefficients in the Landau two-fluid model.  Calculations of these coefficients are usually performed with a  simplistic dispersion relation, i.e., the relation between the  frequency of sound waves and their wavenumber. For example, the  dispersion relation is supposed anomalous and with no roton minimum. We  shall study models in which the interaction potential is nonlocal and  which imply the correct dispersion curve.  The second objective is to  analyze such dissipative NLS models from the point of view of dynamical  systems. We shall study and classify attractors, bifurcation sequences,  and routes to chaos. The third objective is to make use of the results  to elucidate superfluid turbulence in the low temperature regime where  the density of the normal fluid component is smaller than the density  of the superfluid component and where one may expect turbulence in the  superfluid largely to determine turbulence in the normal fluid.    Our investigations will provide targets for experimental work in the  low temperature range. Such experiments are currently in the planning  stage by the Donnelly group at the University of Oregon.  There may be  important implications well beyond the field of liquid helium research:  similar ideas may apply to the newly discovered, high temperature  super conductors, to systems of magnetic spins, to the melting  transition of crystals, and to some cryogenic engineering applications.  Superfluid Helium is used as a coolant in superconducting magnets and  infrared detectors, and superfluid turbulence affects the transfer of  heat in such devices. An understanding of superfluid turbulence may  make it possible to design more efficient methods of refrigeration for  superconducting devices.  Turbulence in ordinary fluids is one of the  most formidably difficult subjects in physics and engineering.  Superfluid turbulence is similar but in some respects simpler for  theoretical study, and it is believed that some of the models we shall  develop will throw light onto turbulent behaviors in ordinary fluids.",
