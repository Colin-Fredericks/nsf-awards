The College's approach to the integration of research and education is established in an environment where young women can thrive in science, and is multifaceted, based on research.  Wellesley has developed a comprehensive program that promotes a variety of systematic experiences to engage students in discovery and communication of knowledge from the very beginning of their college careers to their most advanced independent research projects.  Their approach incorporates curricular revision and strong student/faculty research collaborations. The recently established quantitative reasoning requirement helps ensure that students have the skills to begin their study of science and to master advanced level courses.  A mandatory writing course in the first year and an emphasis throughout the curriculum on oral and written presentation skills link effective communications and course work. \r\n\r\nWellesley College is being awarded  $500,000 to advance institutional goals of integrating research and education, document and disseminate information of its exemplary activities, and expand the integration of research and education by conducting outreach activities over the coming three years.  With the success achieved in the natural sciences, the institution plans to and is well positioned to expand the paradigm of discovery-based learning more broadly to the social sciences.  By augmenting successful programs and stimulating further innovations in the teaching of the natural and social sciences, Wellesley will continue to attract talented women already interested in embarking upon an array of science related careers.  In addition, by enhancing gateway skills and making connections across disciplines, the College will establish a more expansive and diverse student/faculty research community, a true investment in human institutional potential.\r\n\r\n",
