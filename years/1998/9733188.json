 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported in the   Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focuses on developing nuclear   magnetic resonance (NMR) methodologies for the study of environmental   catalysis.  In particular, the surface chemistry involved in the thermal   and photocatalytic decomposition of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)   will be investigated using new NMR probes which permit study of these   reactions in situ.  Professor Raftery and his students will use NMR   methods to study the structure of various adsorbed species, their   proximity to active sites on the solid catalyst surfaces, and monitor   dynamic surface processes.  This CAREER project includes the use of   group-based, interactive and Web-based learning tools as a means to   better connect classroom and laboratory experiences and provide a   contextual framework to introducing emerging technologies in   undergraduate and graduate curricula.  The study of catalytic reactions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at   the surface of a wide range of materials is important to a number of   energy and environmentally-related technologies.  New spectroscopic tools   are required to gain intimate knowledge of the dynamics of the gas-solid   interactions to better tailor processes to the reduction of air polution,   for example.  Professor Raftery and his students at Purdue University are   developing such methodologies for the study of the thermal and   photocatalytic degradation of VOCs, which could have implications in   reducing ozone-depleting emissions.  The use of of group-based,   interactive, and Web-based teaching methods will be used at both the   undergraduate and graduate levels to enhance students' connectivity   between their experiences and fundamental science.",
