 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733907  LiWang  Chemotactic cytokines (chemokines) are a family of structurally interesting proteins that have been subdivided into two subfamilies, each showing different dimer structures.  The research hypothesis for this project is that since chemokines from both subfamilies have similar monomer subunits and yet have completely different dimer interfaces (with a relatively high sequence identity) there are likely to be changes in sequence that will allow one stable dimer type to be turned into the other dimer type.  Therefore, the specific aims involve mutation of a representative member of each subfamily:  First, human MIP-1( will be rationally mutated such that this chemokine forms a stable dimer that more closely resembles the dimer of human IL-8.  The next goal is to rationally mutate IL-8 such that it forms a stable dimer that more closely resembles that of MIP-1(.  After initial analysis and perhaps several rounds of mutagenesis, a detailed structure determination by NMR of the most promising mutants will be carried out.  The teaching aims are to give students a greater understanding of the relevance of Biochemistry coursework in modern basic science research, pharmaceutical research and in medicine; to establish a class project in a senior-level Biochemistry course that provides an opportunity for students to attempt to solve a real research problem; and to improve classroom participation.  In addition, a plan is presented to continue the modernization of the graduate level NMR curriculum, and to implement problem sets that use actual, entire multidimensional data sets.  The chemokines provide a unique opportunity to investigate the details of protein dimer and multimer formation.  This research will allow a detailed analysis of the interesting structural properties of chemokines and will also be valuable in learning the details of protein-protein interactions in general.  The teaching goals will allow the gradual development of a better educator in the biochemical sciences, and inclu de exploring several ways in which to make modern biochemistry accessible to students, both in lecture and with the introduction of a project requiring research into recent scientific advances.  In addition, teaching will be improved at the graduate and undergraduate level by introducing the use of computers for molecular graphics and for the interpretation of actual multidimensional NMR data sets.",
