Behery of the Department of Textiles at Clemson University in South Carolina and Drs. Sami Mansour of the Textile Department at the National Research Center in Cairo, and Moustafa El-Okiely of the Faculty of Engineering at Alexandria University in Egypt.  The two sides plan to study the need for a scientific and engineering-based system for costing of textiles and garments, and to develop the basis for such a system in Egypt with its specific developing world conditions of productions and consumption. \r\n\r\nScope:  This award will allow collaboration between Egyptian and US scientists on a problem of great importance to many developing countries where the textile segment of the industries is a major contributor to the national income and especially to the foreign currency earnings.   The survival of these textile industries depends to a great extent on efficient operation and pricing that will generate resources for R & D improvements white maintaining global competitiveness.  Dr. Jarvis is the Director of Clemson Apparel Research (CAR) at Clemson University, which has extensive state-of-the-art apparel manufacturing equipment and some of the best available hardware and software for the proposed study.  The NRC and Alexandria University have strong collaboration with and access to the garment industry in Egypt.  This proposal meets the INT objective of increasing US-foreign collaboration in areas that benefit both sides.   This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.\r\n",
