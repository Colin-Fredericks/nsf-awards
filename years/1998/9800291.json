They are  thin sheets of  polymer used to construct relatively impervious barriers to  fluid flow.   Designs that incorporate geomembranes typically involve  creation of a  composite material composed of alternating layers of  geotextiles  (polymer fabrics), and soils ranging in size from gravel to  clay.  To  achieve improved interface shear resistance, geomembranes  are  manufactured with a vast range of roughness and surface  texture  patterns.  The relationship between surface texture and  interfacial  shear strength is not well understood and there is  considerable debate  in the professional community regarding what form of surface  texturing  provides the best performance for specific applications.    This research is a GOALI award, with the collaborative  university-industry research aimed at developing a method to  design  optimal geomembrane surface textures for use in civil  infrastructure  applications.  The research will involve experimental  surface analysis,  interface shear testing using granular soils, and mechanical  property  testing of a range of prototype and production geomembranes.  The  experimental results will be used to quantify optimal  texture  characteristics and methods for specific end-use design.    Development of methodologies for design of geomembrane  surfaces for  specific applications and for specific material combinations  without  sacrificing mechanical performance is an important  contribution to  infrastructure construction and rehabilitation.  ***",
