 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802180  Okamoto    Aromatic conjugated rigid rod polymers play an important role in  a number of diverse technologies including high performance  engineering materials, conductive polymer, nonlinear optical and  laser materials.  Recently aromatic conjugated polymers and their  blends have found applications in various photoelectronic  techniques.  Electroluminescence devices based on  conjugated  aromatic polymers have attracted increasing attention due to easy  fabrication of large areas, wide choices of colors and thermal  stability.  However, the luminescence properties of these  materials both in solution and in the solid state when blended  with a second polymer have not been fully investigated.  The  objective of this research is to expand past work to include  several new rigid aromatic polymers.  (1) The novel phenomena of  luminescence enhancement and alteration of emission wavelengths  in blends of aromatic rigid polymers will be studied in depth and  electroluminescence devices will be constructed for promising  candidates.  (2) An approach using non-covalently bonded graft  copolymers as compatibilizers will be adopted to design novel  elastomer-reinforced rigid polymers.  (3) The relaxation  properties of the rigid polymers will be measured in water and  organic solvents and compared with biological systems.  %%%  Display technology finds itself in many applications from laptop  screens to aerospace electronic devices.  The development of  organic materials for use in display technology is an area in  which the United States is in keen competition with Japan and  Europe.  The proposed work has the potential of offering new  candidates for light emitting devices.  Concurrent with device  applications, the novel approach to construct molecular  composites may lead to strong but light-weight plastics      for  high technology uses.  Graduate students trained in these areas  will be sought-after employees for industries.  ***",
