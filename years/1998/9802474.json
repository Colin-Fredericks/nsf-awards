Sorry about the delay in getting this back to you.    Because your note came during the holiday break, I put it  aside for awhile, and then forgot about it!  Thanks for sending the   reminder.  --Bill    TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION    This project concerns multivariable operator theory.  Specifically, we  are concerned with Hilbert modules over the algebra of polynomials   in several variables.  We seek concrete (numerical) invariants  for such objects.  The simplest of these is the curvature invariant.    The curvature invariant of a Hilbert module H is written K(H).    K(H) is analogous to the mean curvature of an even-dimensional   Riemannian manifold, and there is an asymptotic formula which   allows one to compute its value in many cases.  K(H) has turned   out to be an integer in all cases we have been able to decide, and   in fact it obeys a form of the Gauss Bonnet theorem for the Hilbert   modules which admit a \"finite free resolution\" in the following   sense,     K(H) = b(1) - b(2) + b(3) - b(4) +....    where b(1), b(2), ... are the Betti numbers of the free resolution.    We conjecture that K(H) is always an integer.  Not every Hilbert   module (in the category we have) has a finite free resolution, and   we are developing appropriate tools for computing K(H) in general.      GENERAL DESCRIPTION    The flow of time in quantum theory is different from the flow of   time in classical physics, in that the observable quantities do not  commute with each other.  For example, Heisenberg's famous   equation relating the position and momentum observables of   a one-dimensional quantum system is essentially this: PQ - QP = 1.    During the past ten years, a small but determined group of   mathematicians has been working out the theory of \"E_0 semigroups\".    Among other things, these mathematical objects give the simplest   situations which describe the way the  flow of time behaves in   quantum theory.  The current project has grown out of our efforts  to find ways of distinguishing between different types of E_0   semigroups.  This is accomplished by computing certain numbers   associated with them that can take on different values.  When one   has two E_0 semigoups whose numbers are different, one can be   assured that he has two systems which are fundamentally different.    This project is concerned with the definition and calculation of   numerical quantities which are associated to simpler objects that   are closely related to E_0 semigroups.",
