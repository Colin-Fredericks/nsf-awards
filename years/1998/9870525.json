The PI will utilize this work as a means of developing a role model for women computer engineers and getting them involved in this exciting project.  The goal is to perform exploratory work in the area of \"mixed logic structure\" synthesis for embedded system design.  By using a mixed logic approach., the designer can automatically synthesize designs that combine both conventional and non-conventional CMOS structures within the same circuit in order to best exploit the advantages of each structure in terms of area, delay, power, consumption, and signal integrity.  What makes this work unique is that the optimization techniques developed will not target one specific logic style, but rather will be able to pick and choose among several.",
