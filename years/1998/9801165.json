 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal: DMS-9801165  Principal Investigator: Manoussos Grillakis    Abstract: Grillakis proposes to study certain phenomena that are observed in the evolution of nonlinear waves. The basic object of study is a map from Euclidean space into a surface, for which two types of evolution will be investigated. The first is described by a wave equation, while the second is governed by a Schrodinger equation. The crux of the proposal is to study basic questions for such equations; namely, whether solutions exist globally or develop singularities, and how geometric properties of the target surface relate to analytic properties of the solutions.    The two equations that are proposed for study describe some extremely interesting physical phenomena. The wave equation, for instance, is a simplified model describing part of the evolution of two \"black holes\" in the setting of General Relativity. The Schrodinger equation models the evolution of magnetization on, say, a magnetic tape. In this context, the development of singularities serves as a possible explanation of how the tape becomes permanently magnetized.",
