 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support and under the direction of Dr. Nancy Squires, the State University of New York, Stony Brook, will purchase a Neuro Scan Inc. system which allows integration of simultaneous data obtained through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERP). The system,  allows: 1. combined functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological recording of event-related potentials in humans; 2. presentation of auditory and visual stimuli to subjects in a scanner; 3. analyses of the fMRI and EPR data, including correspondences between the two. The two techniques are complementary and their combination provides an extremely powerful tool to understand the functioning of the brain function. fMRI offers a relatively high-resolution spatial view of brain activation that can be traced to specific anatomical regions. However, the temporal resolution of the conventional fMRI scan is measured in seconds and this extended time period may conceal important temporal details of underlying neural activity. While the spatial resolution of ERP is much lower, its temporal resolution is excellent. Using this combined approach, Dr. Squires and colleagues will conduct experiments in collaboration with scientists at Brookhaven National Laboratory and utilize the 4-Tesla MRI scanner located there.  The group will pursue a number of projects. These include studies on : hemisphere-specific activation of the visual cortex by complex hemifield stimulation; hemisphere-specific activation of the auditory cortex by dichotic stimuli; hemisphere-specific activation of motor and pre-motor cortices during preparation for movement; perceptual learning in the visual system; and reorganization of the auditory cortex by extended practice in phoneme discrimination. Graduate students will be involved in these projects and the instrumentation, therefore, will serve an important educational as well as research function.",
