 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors are powerful regulators of genetic information and are responsible for integrating gene expression during embryogenesis. A comprehensive analysis of how these proteins control cell fate determination will yield critical insight into the mechanisms of vertebrate development. The AP-2 protein presents a particularly attractive system to study the various processes governing developmentally-regulated gene expression. During embryogenesis, AP-2 expression is concentrated in many tissues undergoing complex morphogenic changes - the developing neural crest, face, limb bud, kidney, mammary gland and epidermis. In addition, transcription of the AP-2 gene is influenced by retinoic acid, and AP-2 may act as an integral component of this signal transduction pathway.\r\n\r\nMice containing a homozygous disruption of the AP-2 gene die perinatally and exhibit multiple and severe developmental defects. Furthermore, preliminary analysis of chimeric embryos, composed of wild-type and AP-2-null cells, indicates that AP-2 is independently required for at least five fundamental morphogenic programs - formation of the neural tube, face, eye, body-wall and limbs. Clearly, a thorough understanding of the cell fate decisions regulated by AP-2 will yield a wealth of information concerning these normal development programs.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will utilize knowledge of the AP-2 knockout phenotype to probe the cellular mechanisms regulating mammalian morphogenesis. A new generation of AP-2-null embryonic stem cells will be established that are tagged with a lacZ transgene. These ES cells will then be used to generate chimeric embryos composed of wild-type and AP-2-null cells. Analysis of these chimeric animals will provide detailed information concerning the cellular basis of the numerous developmental programs with which AP-2 is involved.\r\n",
