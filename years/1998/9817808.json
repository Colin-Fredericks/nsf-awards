VSSt98 is the fifth in a series of biennial workshops bringing together researchers in the VSS area to discuss and share their latest developments in the theory and application of variable structure systems. The previous workshops were held in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia; Sheffield, UK; Bennevento, Italy and Tokyo, Japan. This is the first time that this workshop is organized and hosted by US control researchers. The workshop is scheduled during the week preceding the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control which will be held in Tampa, Florida.  High quality research are being pursued in many R&D centers in many countries around the world, as witnessed by the volume of published papers in the most prestigious journals in automatic control, several special issues have been also published. Many submitted and invited sessions, and plenary presentations on VSS have been included into the programs of key automatic control conferences, such that the American Control Conference, the Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), and the IFAC Congress. Control engineering design and practice which are based on VSS and Sliding Mode have improved system performance in many critical applications, such as robotics, electric drives, automotive control, and machine tools. VSS is recognized as one of the important research directions in modem control theory.  In our opinion, one of the key objectives of the VSS workshop series is to provide a forum for theoreticians and practicing engineers in automatic control to exchange ideas and share their perspectives, and for the young research investigators, particularly in US institutions, to have the opportunities to engage with the international VSS community. This workshop is focused on the application aspects in automotive control and aerospace systems which we considered to be of particular interests and great potentials.  \r\n***  \r\n",
