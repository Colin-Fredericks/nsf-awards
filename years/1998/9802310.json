 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work that is supported under this grant addresses the mathematical \r\nfoundations of the theory of disordered magnets known as spin glasses.\r\nAlthough there exist proposed solutions of idealized \r\n(and unrealistic) spin glass models, we are interested \r\nin answering fundamental statistical mechanical \r\nquestions that bear on the behavior of real laboratory spin glasses.  \r\nThese questions, many of which remain controversial despite\r\ntwo decades of intensive study, include the nature of ordering in \r\nthe spin glass phase, the number of ground states (and low-temperature pure phases), \r\nthe nature of the spin glass metastate (an ensemble of thermodynamic \r\nphases), understanding anomalous dynamical behavior such as slow relaxation and \r\naging, and proving the presence or absence of a phase transition.  \r\nThe methods used and concepts introduced should be \r\nrelevant not only for spin glasses but should also be applicable \r\nto other disordered systems, many of which remain poorly understood.\r\n\r\nOur deep physical and mathematical understanding of ordered systems in \r\nthe solid and liquid state - for example, crystals, ferromagnets, \r\nsuperconductors, liquid crystals, and many others - has been of \r\nfundamental scientific and technological importance throughout the second \r\nhalf of this century.  However, there exist many systems, both familiar \r\nand unfamiliar in everyday use, in which randomness or disorder plays\r\na key role, and in which our mathematical and physical understanding remains \r\ncomparatively primitive.  One familiar example is ordinary window glass, \r\nwhere the atoms or molecules are \"stuck\" in random locations (as opposed to a \r\nregular crystalline array as would be found, for example, in ice).  Spin glasses \r\nare disordered magnetic systems which are thought to be prototypes for\r\nthis kind of macroscopic \"frozen-in\" disorder, and they may be more amenable \r\nto mathematical analysis than other materials in this class.  Nevertheless, \r\nlittle fundamental progress has been made even here.  This work is aimed at \r\nresolving basic mathematical and physical issues concerning\r\nthese materials and at providing a general theoretical approach for \r\na wide variety of disordered systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
