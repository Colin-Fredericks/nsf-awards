 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Lawrence Barton, Chemistry Department,  University of Missouri-St.   Louis, is  supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic   Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for research on metallaborane   chemistry.  Heterobimetallaboranes that are derived from polyhedral   boranes by substituting two of the boron vertices by various metals will   be synthesized. Early transition metals will be combined with late metals   to obtain species with metals of different electronic configurations.   Since early transition metal complexes are good polymerization catalysts,   heterobimetallaboranes containing only these metals will be prepared and   evaluated as borane oligomerization catalysts. The work will be extended   to the incorporation of main group nonmetal atoms into a   monometallaborane. Routes to large cage derivatives will be sought and   the mechanisms of cluster substitution processes will be evaluated.   Boranes form a series of compounds and ions with regular structures in   which boron-hydrogen units define the vertices of polyhedra. The ability   of boron to support these cage structures is unique. The object of this   project is to substitute some of the vertices in such cages with   non-boron atoms. Special emphasis will be placed on examples with two   transition metals and ones with a transition metal and a main-group   nonmetal atom. These species will be designed as possible catalysts and   as probes to determine the details of how substitution occurs in the   boranes. This latter objective is important to preparing new   metallaboranes of specific shape and composition. In addition to the new   chemistry that will be uncovered in this project, postdoctoral, graduate,   and undergraduate students will be educated in the very precise   experimental techniques required for the investigation of boron hydrides.",
