 "awd_abstract_narration": "Donagi  9802456      This  project  attempts  to  explore  some of the  deep and beautiful   interrelationships   discovered   and  developed recently between algebraic geometry and high energy physics. The PI will study  three  issues,  each  involving  a combination of ideas from algebraic  geometry,  algebraically integrable  systems, quantum field theory and string theory. Of these, the first is  concerned  with  applications  of an algebro-geometric  idea  to  a  string  duality  conjecture, suggesting   along   the  way  a  new   description   of  an algebro-geometric   moduli  space;  the  second  explores  a construction  of  integrable  systems  which is motivated by stringy  ideas and which is expected  in turn to lead to new descriptions  for  certain   supersymmetric   quantum  field theories;  and  the  third  investigates  a  problem  within algebraic  geometry in light of recent  insights from string theory.   (1)  Principal  bundles  on  elliptic  fibrations,  spectral covers, and  Heterotic/F-theory  duality.  It is proposed to apply  and  adapt  previous  results  on  spectral   covers, obtained  in the  context  of  integrable  systems,  to  the description  of the moduli space of principal  bundles on an elliptically  fibered variety, and to the comparison of both the  moduli  spaces  and the  superpotentials  arising  from compactifications  of the Heterotic string with those coming from F-theory. (2)  Calabi-Yau  vs.  Seiberg-Witten   integrable   systems. Ideas  from  string  theory  suggest  a   construction   and classification of Seiberg-Witten integrable systems in terms of  degenerations  of the Calabi-Yau  system  constructed by Donagi and Markman.  It is  hoped  that  this  in  turn  will  allow  the construction of the missing SW systems,  including  those of the theory with adjoint matter for an arbitrary gauge group. (3)   The   Geometric   Langlands   Conjecture.  A   partial construction due to the PI, based on \"classical\"  integrable systems,  will be  compared in detail to another,  based on a quantized  analogue,  and the  possibility  will be explored that a certain  \"stringy\" system provides the correct common extension   of  both   constructions,   producing   all  the automorphic  sheaves  required  by the  geometric  Langlands conjecture.      This is research on the boundary of algebraic  geometry  and string  theory.  Algebraic  geometry  is one of  the  oldest parts  of  modern  mathematics,  but  one  which  has  had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  String theory  is the  newest  and most  exciting  candidate  for a physical  theory  unifying  the four  fundamental  forces of nature.  In  the  last  few  years,  the  two  fields have interacted  at great  depth and across a broad  frontier  of problems of common interest.  These interactions have led to some of the  most  exciting  recent  breakthroughs  in  both fields,  and hold  the  promise  of  leading  to a  physical \"theory of everything\"  as well as to an algebraic  geometry which fully incorporates quantum and stringy phenomena.",
