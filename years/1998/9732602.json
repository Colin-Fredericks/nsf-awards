 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zeilberger  9732602      Zeilberger plans to develop algorithms for automatic discovery and proof of results in combinatorics and related areas. In particular, he plans to mechanize Dodgson's method evaluating hypergeometric determinants, to use techniques from computational linguistics to empirically discover  and then rigorously prove `grammars' of combinatorial families,  and to develop a computational Ansatz for multi-variate rational generating functions. He also proposes to investigate combinatorial analogs of techniques from computational chemistry and to try to prove Haiman's Diagonal Harmonics conjecure.      This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections  of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely  important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in  computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of  combinatorial research.   This research is also in the general area of Symbolic Computation, that attempts to teach computers to perform research that previously required extensive human resources. Progress in this area promises to have important ramifications to science and technology.",
