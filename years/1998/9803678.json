 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to make it possible for  parallel programs, running on asynchronous shared-memory  multiprocessors, to share data flexibly, efficiently, and  reliably.  Specifically, the research seeks to develop  algorithms for building system software that (1) make it  easy to  implement any shared data structure, (2) ensure  that accesses to  implemented shared data structures are  fast, and (3) ensure that  the implemented shared data  structures are fault-tolerant.  A wait-free implementation  of a shared data structure ensures that the data structure  remains accessible to correct processes even if some  processes in the system crash.  A universal construction is  an algorithm that makes it easy to design a wait-free  implementation of any shared data structure.  To realize the  goal stated in the previous paragraph, this research seeks a  universal construction with low worst-case time complexity  and strong parallelism: concurrent operations run in  parallel even if they access common parts of the data  structure, provided that the commonly accessed parts are  only read, and not modified. Universal constructions often  require strong synchronization operations, such as compare &  swap.  Porting these constructions to weaker architectures  that do not support such operations is another objective of  this research.  A final objective is to understand the intrinsic limitations  of universal constructions.",
