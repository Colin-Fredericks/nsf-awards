 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ocean of Potentiality Project, in cooperation with  scientific, multiple nonprofit and state education organizations,  will build and support a Hawaii-wide experiential and accessible  guidance-instruction network to facilitate individuals who are  disabled to attain interest, education and careers in science,  mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET).  The project will  be organized and conducted by the University of Hawaii in  cooperation with multiple scientific and nonprofit and state  education organizations.  The project calls for use of a  three-tiered approach for the change of attitudes and for provision  of educational opportunities on a student, educator/family, and  state policy level.        We propose to create a program that involves a core of  students, families, scientists, educators, and university-level  science teacher trainers who will affect the larger population of  students by affecting science education curriculum, and educational  practices and policy in the state.  The project proposes to  identify, conduct, evaluate, and disseminate hands-on, field-based  science.  Emphasis will be placed on activities appropriate for  students with and without disabilities to promote collaborative  work in heterogeneous teams to actively experience science while  learning about the human ecology of Hawaii.       Role models and mentors, many with disabilities themselves,  will interact with the student teams to advance access and  inclusion of all students in the SMET fields.  Assistive technology  will be used in concert with Internet display arenas to insure that  students will be fully included and empowered in SMET activities.   Electronic technology (including the Internet) will be used to  encourage networking and information dissemination among student  teams, educational organizations, administrators, and members of  the community. The project will be carefully documented for public  television and Internet venues.  All publications produced by the  project wil l be available through fully accessible electronic  media.",
