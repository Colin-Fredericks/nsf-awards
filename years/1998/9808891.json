 "awd_abstract_narration": "9808891\r\nBrand\r\nThis award renews support of efforts to define effective methods for cryopreservation of a large variety of single-celled algae (microalgae) including over 2000 strains found in the UTEX collection of freshwater algae directed by the principal investigator of this award.  Such microalgae are used for basic research in genetics, ecology and physiology, and for varied commercial purposes. Development of reliable methods for their cryopreservation will eliminate the need for maintenance of strains through serial culture techniques.  Serial culture techniques are costly and, as importantly, permit the genetic makeup of the strains to change over time, thereby limiting their usefulness for some types of research.  Thus the development of reliable cryopreservation methods is of scientific as well as economic importance to the researchers and others who use microalgae.  Progress to date suggests that well over 50% of the strains in the UTEX collection can be cryopreserved.  Work supported through this work will allow completion of the testing of the collection and additional efforts aimed at development of new methods for dealing with those strains so far refractory to existing cryopreservation methodology.\r\n\r\n",
