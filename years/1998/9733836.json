 "awd_abstract_narration": "Detailed simulation of many discrete event systems is often slow even on state-of-the-art workstations.  Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) techniques offer an alternative to speed up such simulations.  However, PDES is a hard problem.  The irregular, data-dependent nature of most simulations make synchronization a difficult issue.  In this CAREER project an inter-disciplinary approach will be taken to address this problem.  A new class of \"adaptive\" protocols will be developed that integrates several mechanisms in a single framework, to achieve optimal performance automatically, notwithstanding the dynamic nature of most simulations.  The target platform is a network of workstations or possibly multiprocessors, connected by a high-speed network.  Several innovations are planned regarding protocol development and implementation in a PDES kernel on such platforms.  These include accounting for the multi-granular of the platform and use of fast, user-level messaging support. The work will focus on simulating of telecommunication and computer networks.",
