 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Mark Gabel and Black Hills State College will purchase a JEOL variable-vacuum scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-Ray Spectometer. The system can operate at both low vacuum and high vacuum pressures, providing high resolution @ 3.5 nm. at 30kV for high vacuum and @ 5.5mn at 30kV in low vacuum mode. The options permit high resolution images over a wide range of magnifications and voltages which allows examination of specimens which may be difficult to observe under normal operating conditions due to problems with low conductivity or water content or with borrowed specimens which can not be coated. Black Hills State College currently employs a 17 year old microscope which is rapidly nearing the end of its useful life.  Investigators at the College will pursue a wide range of research and the microscope X-Ray Spectometer system will be used in a variety of projects. These include: examination of Miocene plant fossils from North and South America; evaluation of the mechanical behavior of fiber reinforced cement and alkali-carbonate and alkali-silica reactivity in concrete pavements; comparison of tooth morphologies from Late Cretaceous Theropods; examination of seasonal diets of livestock, wildlife and insects in prairie ecosystems and woodlands; study of infections of the fungus Saprolegnia on Chinook Salmon; identification of use wear on lithic and bone tools from archaeological sites; the development of taste bud morphology and gustatory pathways in the brains of fishes; and the examination of Ascospores of Phyllachora. Undergraduates will be involved with many of these projects and thus the instrumentation will serve an important educational function.",
