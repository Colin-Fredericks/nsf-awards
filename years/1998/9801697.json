 "awd_abstract_narration": "In conventional studies of immigrant labor attainment, researchers assume that the main question of interest is how an immigrant group adjusts to the host society, while that society remains largely unchanged. But when an immigrant group is large relative to the size of the host population, it is conceivable that the social structure of the host country will change in ways that affect the subsequent incorporation of immigrants into labor market positions. The purpose of this dissertation will be to determine whether conventional models of assimilation into a stable labor market still obtain under large migration streams. The case of Soviet Jewish immigrants in Israel is especially instructive in this regard because the size of the Soviet migration stream has varied greatly over time, with the most recent wave reaching extremely large and unprecedented proportions. The data for these analyses will come from three surveys administered by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics. These surveys, which include native-born Israelis as well as immigrants, contain detailed longitudinal information covering the period prior to migration (for immigrants) through the first few years in Israel. Regression models and log-linear models will be used to address the issues posed above. Results of these analyses will provide valuable knowledge concerning how variation in the size of an immigration stream affects both the distribution of immigrants into available labor market positions, as well as the overall shape of the labor market itself.",
