 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Robert A. Moss, of the Department of Chemistry at Rutgers, the   State University of New Jersey, is supported by the Organic Dynamics   Program for his kinetic studies of carbenes and related reactive   intermediates.  Professor Moss uses direct spectroscopic techniques,   particularly laser flash photolysis, complemented by ab initio molecular   orbital calculations, to study the fragmentation reactions of   alkoxyhalocarbenes (RO-C-Cl), exploring the concertedness of R-O and C-Cl   bond cleavages as a function of the alkyl substituent.  The kinetics and   products of the 1,2-H shift rearrangements of benzylhalocarbenes and   alpha-phenylethylhalocarbenes are also under exploration in order to   deduce the influences of solvent, carbene structure, and halogen identity   on the linearity of the Arrhenius correlations for these rearrangements,   the possible incursion of tunneling, and the simultaneous occurrence of   intermolecular reactions.  Professor Moss also investigates the   possibility of modulating the rates of intramolecular rearrangements and   intermolecular capture by the intervention of transient carbene/benzene   pi complexes, competing 1,2-acyl and 1,2-H (or 1,2-C) migrations in   acyloxycarbenes, and the potentially pi-mediated rearrangement of   acenaphthenylfluorocarbene.  With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Robert A.   Moss, of the Department of Chemistry at Rutgers, the State University of   New Jersey, carries out kinetic studies of carbenes and related reactive   intermediates.  Such compounds, containing a central carbon atom bearing   only two attached groups rather than the more commonly seen (and more   stable) four, are formed transiently in a wide variety of chemical   processes.  Through the application of fast experimental techniques   complemented by calculational studies, Professor Moss determines the   effects of various factors on the chemistry of these reactive   intermediates.  These studies contribute to our understanding of the   fundamental atomic level processes occurring in many chemical reactions   and, ultimately, to our ability to control them.",
