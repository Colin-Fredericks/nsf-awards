Professor Gordon and his students employ state-of-the-art  techniques which allow precise measurement of hand and  finger movements and forces during tasks such as typing,  reaching and grasping.  They study how tactile information  contributes to the sequencing of movements (typing), how  these sequences are learned, and the coordination between  hand and eye movement during typing.  They also study the  contribution of tactile information to the regulation of  fingertip forces during object manipulation and how tactile  cues may provide information about the location of the limb  in space.  These studies provide insight into the nature of  learning and organization of movement in the brain.  The  educational component of this CAREER project beyond  involvement of students in this research is to form an  interdepartmental cooperation with the Program in Science  Education.  This enhances teacher preparation by introducing  Science Education doctoral students to research in systems  neuroscience.  Professor Gordon engages these students in  research which foster an understanding of the methodology  and rationale of science in order to facilitate exploration  of the nature of science and scientific inquiry in the  classroom and improve the learning process through the  process of discovery.",
