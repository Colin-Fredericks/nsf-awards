Hansen, Bell Labs, Lucent Technologies    Project:  Statistical Methods for Process Control and Improvement            in Advanced Manufacturing    Abstract:    This research project deals with methods for modeling, monitoring,   diagnosis, and improvement of manufacturing processes with spatial   data.  The scope of the project goes beyond the traditional Shewhart's  paradigm for statistical process control (SPC) which focuses  primarily on process monitoring.  A significant part of the research is  the use of in-process and product quality data to develop failure   diagnostics and to relate these to potential problems for process  improvement. These issues are studied in the context of an integrated  framework for process control and improvement. An overall strategy is  proposed for using the spatial information in defect clustering as the  basis for process improvement.  The methodology consists of several   parts. First, process monitoring methods for routinely monitoring the  spatial data and detecting objects with significant clustering are  developed. A Markov random field model with small-scale clustering is  used to characterize ``in-control'' data. Statistical methods for  failure diagnosis (signatures of spatial patterns) are obtained and  the patterns are then related to process information for improvement.  Various approaches for doing this including parametric models for   large-scale clustering and formal methods based on classification are  studied. Several other related topics, including modeling and analysis  of ordinal data from temporal and spatial processes and the analysis  of spatial data from designed experiments are also studied. These  methods are developed and studied in the specific context of wafer  map data in integrated circuit (IC) fabrication.    Semiconductor manufacturing is one of the key manufacturing   industries in the US, and hence statistical methods for process and    yield improvement are clearly important  from a practical viewpoint. However, the research issues and  methods developed here are quite generic in nature and are of general   interest to many other manufacturing processes with spatial data,   including flat panel displays, printed circuit boards, and the   manufacture and assembly of auto-bodies. These advanced manufacturing  and high-technology industries all share the following features.   Massive amounts of in-process and production data are now being   collected routinely, made possible by advances in computing and data  capture technologies. Much of these data have complex structures,   in the form of spatial objects, images and so on. At the same time,  competitive market pressures are placing a lot of emphasis on reducing  product development cycle time. Moreover, process/product designers  are operating on the boundaries of available subject matter knowledge  of the underlying technology.  Products are being manufactured and  marketed before the technology is well-understood. These manufacturing  processes are often not ``stable'', as is commonly assumed in the  traditional statistical process control (SPC) paradigm. Thus, there is  a critical need for statistical methods that exploit the extensive  information available from in-process and product quality data not  only for process monitoring but also for process improvement. The  results from this research project will significantly advance  methodology for the continuous improvement of advanced manufacturing  processes.",
