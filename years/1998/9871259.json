 "awd_abstract_narration": "9871259\r\nApblett\r\nX-ray analysis equipment will be acquired with funding from the Major Research Instrumentation program.  The specific instrument is an X-ray powder diffractometer with the full-range of sample temperature control and thin-film capabilities.  The equipment will be computer controlled and will possess all available software for data reduction, including Rietveld analysis and a complete X-ray powder diffraction database with search/match capabilities.  This equipment will bring state-of-the-art X--ray analysis to Oklahoma State University (OSU) and will tremendously enhance our capabilities for characterization of inorganic and organic materials and environmental samples.  Materials and environmental sciences are among the largest growth areas in research and research funding at OSU and the equipment will favorably impact research on novel ceramic precursors, colloids, liquid crystals, optical materials, ultraviolet sensors, tribological and corrosion -resistant coatings, forms/fractionation of heavy metals in contaminated soils, soil forming processes, polymer chemistry, corrosion, and catalyst development.  As well as being important in academia, X-ray powder diffraction is widely used in industry for research, quality control and product development. Therefore, the training of students in the operation and capabilities of this instrument and the interpretation of its data is an important goal.  It will be achieved by providing both the opportunity for hands-on research by students and by the use of the instrumentation in Chemistry or Agronomy courses on Materials Characterization, Clay Mineralogy, Solid State Chemistry, and Instrumental Analysis.\r\n%%%\r\nThe acquisition X-ray diffraction equipment, using funds from the National Science Foundation's  Major Research Instrumentation program, will foster greater interactions and collaboration between the Chemistry Department and the Departments of Chemical Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, and Agronomy at Oklahoma State University, as well as helping to maintain an active collaboration between OSU and Xavier University of Louisiana.  Additionally, interest in the equipment has been expressed by ASEC, a local division of Allied Signal.  A Internet-based course and promotional literature will be used to expand the user base to other nearby universities and industries.  Overall, the equipment will contribute to the establishment of a well-equipped learning environment for science, agriculture, and engineering students at OSU and will promote partnerships between researchers from a variety of departments and industry.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
