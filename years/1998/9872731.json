 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Collaborative to Integrate Research and Education (CIRE)  in  Earth  Systems  Science (ESS) builds  upon  an  existing  partnership between Clark Atlanta University (CAU)  and  the  School  of  Meteorology (SoM) at the University of  Oklahoma  (OU).   Formalized through a signed agreement in 1997,  this  partnership  has resulted in the establishment  of  a  five-  year, dual bachelor of science degree program in physics and  meteorology  at  CAU  and  OU.   This  partnership  will  be  strengthened  through the collaboration with the  OU  Center  for  the Analysis and Prediction of Storms (CAPS), Talladega  College and Atlanta Metropolitan College.    The  strategic goal of the CIRE program builds upon that  of  the    CAU   ESS   program.    The   CIRE   goal   is    the  institutionalization of initiatives that  allow  students  -  high  school, undergraduate, and graduate - the  opportunity  to     understand    and    engage    in    cutting    edge,  meteorological/earth systems science education, research and  outreach  experiences.  This goal will be  achieved  through  the  partnership  between CAU and CAPS by accomplishment  of  the following six strategic objectives:    1.    Adapt and develop four (4) instructional modules  that    will be infused into existing mathematics, physics, computer    science  and  ESS  courses at CAU.  Currently,  over  four    hundred (400) students are enrolled per academic year in the    targeted courses.    2.    Develop research initiatives at CAU, involving fifteen    (15) students and ten (10) faculty, needed to improve  the    predictive  capabilities of existing and future generation    mesoscale computer models.    3.    Retool  an  existing Weather Analysis  and  Prediction    course and associated laboratory at CAU, to allow students    the opportunity to analyze meteorological case histories and    to use state-of-the-art analysis and prediction tools within    the classroom.    4.    Use  existing  state-of-the-art videoconferencing  and     distance learning capabilities to allow faculty and students    to collaborate, and to attend courses and lectures without    leaving their environments.    5.    Integrate  remote  sensing technology  and  Geographic    Information System (GIS) applications into its existing ESS    education, research and outreach initiatives.    6.    Strengthen  an existing Environmental Data  Management    and  Analysis  Center (EDMAC) at CAU that will  result  in    providing  the  resources needed to sustain the  developed    initiatives when CIRE funding has ended.    The CIRE in ESS will advance the objectives of Georgia's NSF  sponsored Alliance for Minority Participation program;  will  further  assist  OU with its efforts to recruit  and  retain  Native  American  students in areas of ESS; will  strengthen  the  NSF  institution-wide reform of undergraduate education  agenda at CAU, and will serve as a model program that can be  sustained at CAU and replicated at colleges and universities  throughout the nation.  Through broad dissemination  of  the  ESS  CIRE framework and achievement of its objectives it  is  expected  that  the current underrepresentation  of  African  American students in the areas of ESS will be lessened.",
