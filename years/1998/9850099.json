 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\n\r\nEngaging Non-Science Majors in Methods of Investigation and Exploration\r\n\r\nScience, mathematics, and engineering faculty at The University of Tulsa are developing new student-centered, inquiry-based science courses for non-majors. The new courses will build on reforms instituted in the science and mathematics curriculum for pre-service teachers and on inquiry experiences developed for science and engineering majors. Courses will be of two types: Introduction to Scientific Inquiry and Connections. Introduction to Scientific Inquiry courses will develop science literacy by immersing students in a research experience focusing on a real world problem. These courses will be team-taught, interdisciplinary, and have natural ties to societal concerns. Problems will be selected from responses to an RFP issued to faculty. Some anticipated sections include bioremediation of oil spill sites on the Tall Grass Prairie, foraging behavior of bees, design of renewable energy sources, and degradation of water quality due to agricultural runoff. Courses in Connections will build on two strong current model courses, Plants and People and Earth's Physical Environment, and stress reasoning, the relationship between key concepts, and the interplay between scientific advancement and the needs of society. The Introduction to Scientific Inquiry and Connections courses will employ common instructional strategies, including an integrated classroom/laboratory/field format, appropriate use of mathematics, use of technology, and emphasis on oral and written communications. The courses will be developed through summer course development fellowships funded jointly by the award and the University. Release time for faculty during the initial semester of course presentation will facilitate high quality offerings from the outset of the new curriculum. The courses and their affect on the students and the institution will be studied by an internal evaluator. A Visiting Committee, composed of external experts, will offer additional guidance and facilitate dissemination of successful innovations.\r\n\r\n",
