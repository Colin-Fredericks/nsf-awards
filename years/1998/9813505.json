 "awd_abstract_narration": "Charles Knobler is jointly funded by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division and the Americas Program in the Division of International Programs to hold a US-Mexico scientific meeting entitled: \"2nd International Workshop on Current Problems in Complex Fluids: Thin Interfacial Films.\"  The workshop will be held in Oaxaca, Mexico, on January 3-9, 1999, and has been jointly organized with Prof. Jaime Ruiz Garcia of the Institute of Physics of the University of San Luis de Potosi.  The aim of the meeting is to discuss current developments in the field of thin organic films and related problems and to provide an environment for the establishment of joint research initiatives between Mexican and American scientific communities working in the field.  The meeting will be sponsored jointly by NSF and CONACyT with additional support from the University of Mexico and the University of San Luis Potosi.\r\n\r\nThe properties of complex fluid systems are employed to advantage in many areas of technology.  They play important roles in many industries such as pharmaceutical, microelectronics, food, polymers, paints, and cosmetics. Their study is associated with the development of new technologies and materials including microreactors, model membranes, biological and chemical sensors, and biomolecular materials.  There is active research in complex fluids in both the United States and Mexico, and informal interactions exist between the two scientific communities.  This workshop will provide additional opportunities for establishing joint international research programs and to initiate contacts with prospective students and postdoctorals.\r\n",
