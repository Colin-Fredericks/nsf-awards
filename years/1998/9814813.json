 "awd_abstract_narration": "9814813\r\nWhite\r\n\tContamination of soil and water by polluting organic compounds or metals has been shown to alter the composition of native communities of microbes in the environment. Recovery by the microbial community from contaminant effects and possible remediation of the environment are dependent upon a host of factors, biotic and abiotic, operating over varying time frames and spatial scales. A critical determinant of the recovery and remediation process is the composition of the initial, affected microbial community, in terms of taxonomic representation, abundance of individual populations, and metabolic status. The ability to assess, characterize, and track all the microbial species comprising a local community has been greatly enhanced by modern molecular methods of analysis for two major classes of bacterial compounds: bacterial cell wall lipids, and the DNA sequence of various ribosomal genes (usually the 16S rRNA gene). Obviating the need to grow or culture the bacteria in the laboratory, these molecular methods can provide rapid, accurate identification of microbial populations within soil or water samples, and preliminary indications of their relative abundances and metabolic states. As a pioneer in the development of the \"signature lipid biomarker\" methodology, Dr. White and his colleagues are now expanding the technology to include DNA sequence analyses, and to apply these methods to the study of contrasting contaminated and uncontaminated sites at two major field locations, at Wurtsmith AFB in Michigan and at Cocodrie marsh in Louisiana, both subject to persistent hydrocarbon contaminations. One overall goal is to test the hypothesis that microbial community composition will change in a directional and predictable manner as contaminants are attenuated either in space (over a gradient of contaminant concentration) or through time (over several seasons of microbial growth and metabolism). An auxiliary hypothesis under test is whether there are \"sentinel\" species of microbes that signal particular states of remediation.\r\n\tThe development of effective bioremediation strategies for contaminated soils or waters has been moving away from the \"silver bullet\" approach that relies upon a single agent (adding one particular bacterial species) to a more ecological approach that emphasizes metabolic dynamics among microbial community members in the environment. Rapid, accurate identification of the full range of microbes present in local communities increasingly is possible with the use of modern molecular methods of cell wall lipid analysis and DNA sequencing of diagnostic gene regions. In turn, the characterization of microbial community composition may reveal distinctive assemblages of \"sentinel\" species that correlate with various states of environmental remediation.\r\n",
