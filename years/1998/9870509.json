Beck.  The joint study will combine  the PI's expertise in identifying the causes of spatial  variability in seismic ground motions with Dr. Beck's expertise  in statistical system identification.  The spatial variation of  ground motions may affect the response of lifelines, such as  bridges and pipelines, beyond the loads expected from uniform  motions.  Existing models are based, generally, on regression  analyses of data recorded at a single site and for a single  event.  Thus, they cannot readily be applied to different sites  and events, which limits their usefulness.  In order to overcome  this limitation the present study will incorporate physical  parameters in the spatial variability model, parameters which are  estimated, where necessary, using system identification.  The  approach will embed the system identification scheme in a  statistical frame work, that accounts for uncertainties in the  model parameters and in the predictions from the model itself.  A  Bayesian scheme will be used, allowing the predictive  probabilities to be updated with additional information from  various sites and events, until the models stabilize or converge.   The project will enhance the PI's career by broadening her  research horizons, specifically in the areas of statistical  system identification, reliability-based optimal design and  robust structural control.  She expects to apply this knowledge  in future research related to the safety and reliability of the  older and decaying infrastructure of the East Coast, where her  home institution is located.  ***",
