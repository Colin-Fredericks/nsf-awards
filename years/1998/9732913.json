 "awd_abstract_narration": "Space is Special has been collaborating for several years with  NASA and Space Camp to provide some students with disabilities  exposure to hands-on science experiences along side students who do  not have disabilities.  This project will expand the project to  reach many more students, their parents, and teachers.  The  following are goals to expand past efforts beyond West Michigan to  encourage more communities and school districts to improve the  mathematics, science, engineering, and technology education of  students with disabilities.  Space is Special (SIS) will:  (1) Use  science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education to  enhance the self esteem of special education students.  (2) Create  opportunities for these students to work at a high level of  proficiency in science and mathematics.  (3) Provide more venues  for mainstreaming these students by demonstrating their ability to  be mainstreamed at Space Camp.  (4) Give parents the experience of  success for their children and provide an avenue for building on  abilities rather than disabilities.  (5) Help change the attitudes  of students with disabilities to reach for higher goals, to enroll  in more advanced courses, and to insist that they be given the  right to take normal course loads in mathematics, science, and  technology.  (6) Give students with disabilities the opportunity to  live, learn, and work in a team setting.  (7) Encourage special  education students to go on to higher education and pursue careers  in technical fields.  (8) Create a full set of educational  materials--including slides, video tapes, and written lesson plans  and experiments--so that teachers of special education students can  increase their effectiveness at giving these students opportunities  to demonstrate their skills in these fields.       To achieve these goals, SIS proposes a three-year pilot  project to demonstrate the effectiveness of specific activities and  materials on a state-wide basis in Michigan. If successful, the  pro ject can become the foundation for similar efforts elsewhere.  The project will develop a curriculum and establish a Web page for  the project that will include inputs from current and past SIS  participants that can be used as an educational resource by special  education classes anywhere.  The project will focus on involving  special education teachers directly in the project.  Teachers will  be selected who will observe project teaching methods and will  attend Space Camp with a group of students from their districts.   The concept of \"master teacher\" will be implemented with the first  group of teachers.  These teachers then later can be used to train  more special education teachers in the SIS concepts and demonstrate  student success in science, mathematics, engineering and  technology.  A Space Camp summer teachers institute will encompass  a week-long training session at camp with special attention to  taking lessons from the experience back to the classroom.",
