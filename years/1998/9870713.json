 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870713  Staley       This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training  (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a broadly-  based graduate training program in study of life in extreme  environments and on its relevance to understanding the  evolution of life on earth and, potentially, on other planets.  Recent scientific results have highlighted the practical and  theoretical importance of studying microbes that prosper in  unusual habitats, including those whose temperature and  chemical composition may well duplicate the conditions thought  to exist at the time life evolved on earth.   These results  have also pointed to the utility of such studies in planning  and evaluating efforts aimed at detecting environments on  other planets that might also foster the evolution of life.  This later aspect of the program is now often referred to as  \"Astrobiology\".  The multidisciplinary program will be the  joint effort of 14 faculty from the Departments of Aeronautics  and Astronautics, Astronomy, Atmospheric Sciences,  Biochemistry, Chemistry, Genetics, Geological Sciences,  Geophysics, Microbiology and Oceanography, as well as  internship mentors in the private and public sector.  NSF  support will provide stipends for 11 graduate students each  year, and for related costs of student research training.  Students will take at least three of five new courses to be  created for the IGERT program, and must complete existing  coursework requirements of their home departments.  Required  coursework will emphasize current knowledge of the evolution  of life from prebiotic synthesis through development of  Eukaryotic cells, and the physical and chemical principles of  planetary formation.  Along with participating faculty,  students will participate in a weekly IGERT seminar and an  annual workshop at a field site or laboratory that will focus  on methods and techniques not available on campus.       IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program whose goal is to sponsor  the establishment of innovative,  research-based graduate  programs that will train a diverse group of new scientists and  engineers to be well-prepared for varied careers in the  private and public sectors.  IGERT provides an opportunity for  the development of new, well-focused multidisciplinary  programs that bridge traditional organizational barriers,  uniting faculty from several departments or institutions to  establish a highly-interactive collaborative environment for  both training and research.  In its first year, the program  will provide support to 17 institutions for new or nascent  programs that collectively span all areas of science,  engineering and mathematics eligible for support by the NSF.",
