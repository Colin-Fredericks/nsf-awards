The project will bring together scientific illustrators with K-8 teachers to explore the types of techniques that are most appropriate for young children.  By using different artists, some of whom focus on nature and some on the engineered world, it is expected that teachers will learn, and pass on to students, another way of observing intensely and asking questions about structure, function, and movement.  Twenty-two exemplary teachers of science will be chosen for this initial pilot.  They will work with artists over the summer and will collaborate with each other as they plan for the academic year.  In addition, there will be individual follow-up school visits as well as cohort meetings during the year to judge the success of the project and its implications for further research.",
