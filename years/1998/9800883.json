 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal:DMS-9800883  Principal Investigator: Abel Klein    Abstract: The subject of this research proposal is the study of localization of classical waves and related phenomena, and of phenomena that occur in disordered systems. Classical waves can exhibit phenomena normally associated with quantum mechanical electron waves. The quantum mechanical wave nature of electrons is based on an analogy with the scattering and interference of classical waves. But only recently has the analogy been reversed and the possibility of the localization of classical waves started to be investigated. Localization is a generic wave phenomena, not specific to electron waves.  The primary objective of this proposal is to establish a solid mathematical basis for the investigation of the phenomena of localization of classical waves. The following subtopics will be studied: localization effects in complex media, nonlinear effects in photonic crystals, exactly solvable models, a general framework for the localization of classical waves, dynamical localization of classical waves, internal Lifshitz tails, absolute continuity of the spectrum of periodic Maxwell operators.  Other topics to be investigated are random Schroedinger operators (a model for the motion of an electron in a crystal with impurities) and long range spin glasses.    New optical materials and devices will lead to \"lightronics\" (electronics for light), presently a subject of intensive research. Optical transistors are examples of such new optical devices, and their fabrication will require new optical materials. The development of lightronics will have tremendous technological implications. Electronic devices (e.g., transistors) are based on quantum mechanical phenomena. Electronic bound states, the simplest example of a localized electron wave, are ubiquitous in nature. But the analogous phenomena for light are not commonly observed in nature, even if theoretically possible. Nature provides a variety of readily available materials for electronic locali zation. But the corresponding materials for the localization of light and other classical waves have to be fabricated. This requires a fundamental understanding of how classical waves (e.g., light) can exhibit phenomena normally associated with quantum mechanical electron waves. One of these is localization, a subject that the present proposal addresses. This is a new area of research in both basic and applied sciences, with a potentially huge payoff to society.",
