The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and  experimental conditions abroad.      This award will support an eighteen-month postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Tain-Yen Hsia to work with Dr. Marc R.  de Leval at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in  London, England.      Dr. Hsia's work involves the application of engineering  principles to medical problem solving, in particular, the  computational fluid dynamics as applied to cardiovascular  physiology.  For this project, he will apply computational  methodology to obtain quantitative solutions of the three-  dimensional flow characteristics in the hypoplastic left  heart syndrome.  This study will provide the groundwork for  engineering methods in the treatment of any congenital heart  disease.      The Great Ormond Street Hospital is the only place equipped  with the clinical experience and engineering expertise  required for this study.  Dr. de Leval has gathered data for  this work and has perfected the modeling.  The engineering  facility, in collaboration with Dr. F. Migliavacca of  Politecnico de Milano in Italy, has been designed to provide  a seamless operation of the numerical simulations.  Dr. de  Leval is an internationally known expert in the repair of  congenital heart defects and has led a team of international  experts using sophisticated engineering principles to  examine the fluid dynamics in complex congenital heart  defects and those same defects after repair.      ***",
