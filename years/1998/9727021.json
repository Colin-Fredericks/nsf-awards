 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of the Chemistry Division, Cline will study the preferred molecular   trajectories produced in the photodissociation of related but   structurally distinct nitrosoalkanes.  The experiments will measure the   correlation between the angular momentum and velocity vectors of products   in the frame of the energized parent nitrosoalkane parent molecule in   addition to scalar population distributions among product quantum states.    In most experiments the angular momentum distribution of nitric oxide   product will be probed by polarized resonance-enhanced multiphoton   ionization laser spectroscopy.  Time-of-flight mass spectrometry   techniques or new variations on two-dimensional ion imaging methods will   be used to measure velocities and spatial anisotropies in correlation   with angular momentum polarization.  Experiments will be performed in   low-temperature molecular beams or low-pressure effusive jets.  The major   goals of this project are to examine the influence of molecular rigidity   and conformations on product trajectories and to explore preferential   helical product trajectories produced in the photodissociation of chiral   molecules.    The data gathered in this study will reveal useful information about   preferential directional forces in molecules.  The addition of many such   forces from a large number of molecules can result in macroscopic amounts   of work from molecule-sized systems such as biological motors and   hypothetical nanotechnology devices.",
