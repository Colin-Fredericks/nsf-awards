 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides initiation funding for research on engineering design decision making under conditions of risk and uncertainty.  Specifically, the research will focus on design assessment and optimization methodologies for design decision-making processes in the face of design preferences, environmental uncertainty, risk, and incomplete data.  The proposed methods will integrate the notion of design theory, robust optimization, ordinal optimization, and a control-theoretic approach to simulation experiments.  As an initial attempt toward the research endeavors, the PIs will examine critical issues in design performance and design utility, establish formal characterization of design uncertainty and risk, and develop design optimization modules.  With rapidly increasing computational capability, simulation-based approaches have become feasible for large-scale complex systems.  The current set of solution methodologies will be expanded to include a hybrid procedure that combines the benefits of traditional optimization routines with the flexibility of computer simulation.  An optimal-simulation-budget-allocation algorithm will be developed, which can dynamically determine the best simulation lengths for different scenarios under conditions of uncertainty/risk and thus significantly reduce the total computational cost.  The theoretic results will be further strengthened through a detailed study of design cases in both mechanical component design and large-scale system design.      If successful, the framework will provide a theoretic foundation for engineering design, which will allow further development in design valuation, performance assessment, and design optimization.  The assessment and optimization methodologies will provide design engineers with critical tools that capture key design factors, analyze the effects of uncertainty, and optimize the design over its life cycle. The new simulation methodologies will offer an evaluative, confidence-seeking mechanism for design evaluation, which will also contribute to the computational tools and methodologies available for general simulation problems.",
