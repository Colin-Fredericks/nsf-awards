 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advocates for Women in Science, Engineering and Mathematics  (AWSEM) is a science and math advocacy program for fourth  through twelfth grade girls.  A program of Saturday Academy  at Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology, the  AWSEM project creates and supports regional networks of  science and technology professionals, educators, parents and  community organizations dedicated to enriching the  opportunities in science, engineering and mathematics for  young women.    These regional networks of community leaders work together  to:  (1) dispel the pervasive attitude that science,  engineering and mathematics are inappropriate fields for  women; (2) create links within local communities and their  public and private institutions to promote the expansion of  science opportunities for young women; and (3) establish a  vertical support system beginning with school girls and  including college students, teachers, parents and  professionals that will ensure sustainable, long-term  contact between young women and science practitioners.    AWSEM currently maintains a network of eighteen after-school  science and math clubs in the Portland metropolitan area  dedicated to hands-on learning and on-site experience with  professional women.  At present, professional women at over  twenty corporate, agency and academic worksites provide day-  long interactive site visits for club members throughout the  academic year.  Other, AWSEM clubs have begun with the  support and training of AWSEM's staff, using AWSEM  curriculum and materials.  The program is in the process of  expanding nationally through a collaboration with the  professional organization, Women in Technology International  (WITI).    AWSEM maintains a comprehensive regional database of science  and engineering practitioners and acts as a central resource  center for local communities interested in encouraging young  women to study science and mathematics, offering day-long  workshops on creating advocacy programs, and developing and   disseminating supplementary curriculum and materials.  These  materials include \"Passing the Torch,: a video overview of  the AWSEM Project, and the AWSEM \"Action Kit,\" a guidebook  to creating advocacy programming, including sections for  parents, teachers and professional, templates for permission  slips and other important paper work, and over 45 hands-on  curriculum pieces broken down by age group and field.  All  templates and curriculum are included on disk as well.    Other AWSEM materials include the \"Directory of  Practitioners:  Role Models for Young Women,\" a listing of  over 150 women in science, engineering, mathematics and  technology interested in working as mentors, and the  \"Passport to Science,,\" a guidebook for individual  explorations of science.    Since 1983, Saturday Academy's programs, including AWSEM,  have served over 44,000 motivated 4th through 12th grade  students throughout Oregon and Southern Washington,  providing opportunities to learn beyond the classroom by  making use of the expertise, equipment and facilities found  in industry, higher education and community agencies.  In  1996 Saturday Academy received the \"Presidential Award for  Excellence in Mentoring\" for its work in support of students  from groups under-represented in science and engineering.",
