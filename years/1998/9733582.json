 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733582  Bellon    This CAREER grant addresses research and educational  programs which are centered on non-equilibrium processing of  materials.  The research component examines the new idea  that in alloys under sustained external forcing phase  separation may take place on a mesoscopic scale, i.e. a  scale which is neither atomic, nor macroscopic, and these  meso-structures can be stable at steady-state. The  objectives of the proposed research are: (a) to perform a  detailed characterization of the composition field in alloys  with positive heat of mixing at steady-state during by ball  milling under controlled conditions; (b) to elucidate the  origin of the stabilization of mesoscopic phase separation  in alloys under sustained shearing; and (c) to test whether  the available experimental results on these mesostructures  can be rationalized by a kinetic model with competing  dynamics, where dislocation glide would be the dynamics  forcing the mixing of immiscible elements.  The approach  chosen involves the milling of Fe-Cu and Cu-Ag powders under  controlled conditions and the use of analytical techniques  that can resolve nanometric composition heterogeneity,  including for the first time for ball milled materials the  use of atom probe and three-dimensional atom probe  techniques.  Atomistic computer simulations and modeling  should assist in understanding of these forced systems.  The  educational component of the proposal consists in developing  a computer-assisted material for a graduate course on  materials under irradiation using CyberProf, a human-  computer interface developed at the Beckman Institute in  Urbana; and in reorganizing an undergraduate materials  science laboratory to stimulate initiatives from the  students.  %%%  Mesoscopic phase separations have been recently identified  in metal alloys with positive heats of mixing under  sustained shearing by atomistic computer simulations.  These  findings are consistent with the latest published  experiments showing complex dy namical phase equilibria and  strong chemical heterogeneity in alloys with positive heat  of mixing when submitted to ball milling.  This research is  motivated by the fact that the field of nonequilibrium  systems is in rapid development and has received much  attention in the last two decades.  Indeed in many  applications, materials are driven away from equilibrium by  some external forcing, either during their preparation  (e.g., by ball milling) or during their use (e.g., by  irradiation).  ***",
