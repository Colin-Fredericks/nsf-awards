 "awd_abstract_narration": "Moore\r\n9873442\r\n     There many massive databases in industry and science, and\r\nthis is particularly true for Astrophysics.  There are many kinds\r\nof questions that physicists and other users wish to ask the\r\ndatabases in real time, e.g., 'find outliers'; 'find clusters';\r\n'find patterns'; 'classify the data records into N predetermined\r\nclasses.'  Wide-ranging statistics and machine learning\r\nalgorithms similarly need to query databases, sometimes millions\r\nof times for a single inference.  With millions or billions of\r\nrecords (such as the new generation of astrophysics sky surveys)\r\nthis can be intractable using current algorithms.  This project\r\naims to make repeated statistical querying of huge datasets\r\ncomputationally feasible by transforming massive databases into\r\ncondensed representations that permit the rapid answering of such\r\nquestions.  To achieve these goals, the investigator and his\r\ncolleagues explore ways in which tools from statistics (such as\r\nBayesian networks), databases (such as kd-trees/R-trees), and\r\nArtificial Intelligence (such as AD-trees and rule-finders) can\r\nhelp, how they scale up, and how they can be combined.\r\n     The investigators intend to help automate the process of\r\nscientific discovery for astrophysical data sources in which\r\nthere is too much information for any unaided human to have a\r\nchance of spotting patterns, regularities, or anomalies.\r\nGovernment and industry in the U.S. have invested heavily in\r\ningenious new ways to gather information in all branches of\r\nscience and industry, from cell biology to the flows of capital\r\nin international commerce.  Scientists and analysts who have\r\nworked so hard to gather magnitudes more data than they had ten\r\nyears ago are now faced with an equally daunting task: exploiting\r\nit fully.  It is ironic that in fields such as astrophysics there\r\nis now so much data that no human has enough time to even see a\r\ntiny fraction of it.  The job of discovering new relationships,\r\nanomalies, and even causation, must now be at least partly turned\r\nover to computers.  The investigators comprise a team of\r\nstatisticians, computer scientists, and astronomers who have each\r\nalready made progress in this direction.  This team develops new\r\nalgorithms to squeeze as much information as possible from\r\ntrillion-byte astrophysics databases such as the Sloane Sky\r\nSurvey.  They also make sure that the resulting technology is\r\ndeployed elsewhere in science and industry.\r\n\r\n",
