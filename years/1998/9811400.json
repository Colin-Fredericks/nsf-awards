 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Jingsong Zhang will pursue molecular beam studies of prototypical free radicals.  This research program will be developed in three main areas: (1) photochemistry of small radicals such as C2H3, OH, and other small alkyl and alkoxy radicals, (2) benchmark radical reactions involving systems such as OH + CO and H + O2, and (3) energy transfer/state-resolved inelastic scattering in small model systems involving atomic hydrogen and colliding partners O2, CO2, and CO.  Velocity distributions of the hydrogen atom products or scattering probes will be obtained via the high resolution high-n Rydberg atom time-of-flight (HRTOF) technique.  The detailed state-resolved product energy and angular distributions obtained are expected to provide new insights into the photodissociation and reaction dynamics of these free radicals, and these benchmarks will in turn offer stringent tests for high-level theories.  \r\n\r\nFree radicals are short-lived, highly reactive species that have one or more unpaired electrons.  They play dominant roles in much of chemistry.  The gas phase free radicals chosen for study in this project are of current interest and of practical importance for understanding atmospheric reactions and chemical combustion phenomena.  \r\n",
