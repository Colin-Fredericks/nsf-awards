 "awd_abstract_narration": "Berea College is improving its program in chemistry by adding new laboratory experiments involving structural elucidation and molecular dynamics throughout its curriculum. One goal of our laboratory instruction is to have students learn basic experimental techniques and be able to apply these techniques to real world problems. The primary tool for developing these experiments is a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)1,2 spectrometer, an ideal tool for adding new structure and dynamic experiments. In the organic course, students are introduced to NMR spectroscopy in the laboratory. They use 1H and 13c NMR to verify the products from organic synthesis. In the instrumental analysis and physical chemistry courses, students learn how NMR can be used as a tool to determine complicated structures and to probe solution reaction dynamics. In physical chemistry, the students use NMR to apply the principles of quantum mechanics to practical problems. Once they complete their advanced coursework, students have experience with the basics of two-dimensional NMR techniques, including correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and heteronuclear correlation spectroscopy (HETCOR) to solve structural problems.  The last step in the education of our students is a required research experience. NMR enhances the research interests of the department, while providing a solid foundation for strong student-faculty interactions. Knowledge of NMR, along with Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), should prepare our students for a variety of problems they might encounter in a research environment. Implementation of this program is a model system to be used at other institutions; for example, our affiliation with the Appalachian College Association provides an excellent avenue to bring NMR experiments to an audience that might not otherwise have this wonderful opportunity.",
