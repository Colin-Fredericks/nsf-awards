 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is creating and maintaining a library of web-based, interactive modules that have been tested, reviewed, and edited.  The existence of general purpose mathematical software, such as Maple, Mathcad, Mathematica, and Matlab, has spawned development of learning environments based on interactive text.  The emergence of the World Wide Web enables the creation of materials that are easily linked to each other and to disciplinary data sites, that may be used with a range of mathematical software, that are easily accessible at a distance, and that are easily updated. These modules provide materials for a range of lower division college-level mathematics courses and for independent exploration and study. In addition, materials are available for use in mathematically rich courses in other disciplines across the curriculum.     The Coordinated Curriculum Library is a natural outgrowth of Project CALC calculus reform efforts and of a follow-on project to create modules for courses beyond calculus. This project is an integral part of the larger Coordinated Curriculum Project, currently involving faculty from the University of Arizona, Cal Poly at San Luis Obispo, Duke University, Hewlett Packard, and Montana State University. The format most appropriate for web-based materials is a combination of an HTML text with a mathematically sophisticated helper application-- e.g., Maple, Mathematica, etc. To determine how principles of module design should be applied in this setting, an integral component of the project is a study on how students learn in this environment.  In addition to putting the materials on the Web, presentations at meetings, minicourses, and workshops, are being used publicize the library as a source for innovative web-based learning materials that can be used with confidence and easily supplemented.",
