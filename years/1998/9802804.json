 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802804  Scott    Support is provided for the Third International Conference  on Grain Growth at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania, June 14-19, 1998.  This conference follows  previous conferences held in Rome, Italy (1991), and in  Kitakyushu, Japan (1995.  The field of microstructural  evolution has recently come into the forefront of materials  research and grain growth is a core topic.  There are two  recent developments which lead to more intense research  interest in this field.  One is the advance of computer  simulation techniques which, coupled with ever increasing  computational power, is capable of giving realistic and  statistically significant predictions of microstructural  evolution.  The second is development of automated  experimental techniques capable of accurately describing the  microstructure (grain size, shape, crystallographic  orientation, etc.) in sufficient detail as to provide good  statistical descriptions of microstructure.  Primary among  these experimental techniques is orientational imaging  microscopy using the texture measuring capability scanning  electron microscopy.  These parallel developments in  computation and experiment make this conference timely so  that direct interactions occur between the theoretical  modelers and the experimental investigators.  This special  topics meeting brings together the world's leading  scientists in grain growth.  The support helps defray travel  expenses for the distinguished speakers from abroad and  provides travel grants for student co-authors.  %%%  It is well known in both metallurgy and ceramics that  microstructure control is based on processing conditions and  choice of composition, and this provides a pathway to  improved material properties.  Under a broad range of  conditions grain growth lies at the heart of microstructural  evolution.  The consequences of grain growth are of  considerable technological and industrial importance in  determining the manufacturability and service life of  met als, ceramics, and other fine grain materials.  The  Pittsburgh conference organized by The Mineral, Metals and  Materials Society with co-sponsorship by ASM International  and Materials Research Society deals with all aspects of  grain growth in materials.  ***",
