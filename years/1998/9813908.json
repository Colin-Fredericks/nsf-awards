 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9813908\r\nCarmen Plank\r\n\r\nSweetwater Union High School District, in collaboration with twenty university, business and community partners, has developed a project model to help young women prepare for technically challenging careers.  This comprehensive partnership targets underrepresented middle school girls, 80% of whom are ethnic minorities, to help them recognize and develop their full potential in science, math and technology.\r\n\r\nSweetwater's Girl Power model grew out of the recognition that equity for girls must be achieved through change processes that are immediate, significant and systemic.  Girl Power's holistic approach incorporates four major elements: \r\n1) Comprehensive professional development for the district's counselors and science, math and technology teachers; 2) intensive services for middle school girls including: extra counseling, mentoring, science/ math/ technology clubs, hands-on math and science activities, a single -gender math/science summer \"camp\" and parent participation events; 3) teacher development of program curriculum and products; and 4) articulation, integration and dissemination among a wide array of project partners.\r\nSweetwater's Girl Power project is guided by three major objectives:\r\n1) Increase the number of young women accessing rigorous science, math, technology and      engineering-related learning\r\n2) Improve the achievement of girls in higher levels of science, math and technology\r\n3) Enhance equity for girls by promoting systemic change in partnership with educators, families and           community members\r\n\r\nThe challenges Sweetwater girls face reflect circumstances found in many other districts in California and the entire nation.  By creating an inclusive system wide culture for young women who are traditionally underrepresented I science, math and technology, Girl Power demonstrates great potential for helping girls in all parts of the country to access and succeed in SEM education and careers.  The strategies that bring success for girls in sweetwater can make a significant difference for other young women as well.\r\n \r\n",
