At present, the processes by which microbes adsorb and oxidize Mn are poorly understood and the compositions and structures of microbially precipitated oxide and hydroxide solids often are not known.  Microbes may control the aqueous reactivities for these Mn-oxide precipitates in aqueous solution by modification of surface areas and charge properties and may sequester deleterious contaminant metal ions within the Mn oxide precipitates.  Knowledge of these processes is necessary to the development of physically realistic geochemical models and could be used in the design of microbe-based remediation technologies.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this three-year multidisciplinary and multiinstitutional collaborative effort is to investigate the mechanisms of Mn(II) adsorption, oxidation and precipitation at microbe-water interfaces and the identities (i.e., structures and compositions) of Mn(III) and (IV) precipitates using XAFS spectroscopy and aqueous geochemical techniques.  Complementary surface characterization techniques and electron microscopy will be used to constrain design and interpretation of XAFS measurements.  Initially, the oxidation of Mn(II) by spores of the marine bacterium, Bacillus sp. SG-1, will be studied as functions of pH, Mn concentration, and major ion water composition.  SG-1, is an excellent model organism for the proposed studies because its mechanism of oxidation has been well characterized, it oxidizes Mn(II) over a range of environmentally significant conditions, and growth does not have to be sustained.  In the second and third years of this study, other microbes, including freshwater and marine strains recently isolated from the environment, will be investigated.  Specific hypotheses we wish to address are:\r\n1) Microbe-and/or enzyme-bound Mn(III) species are intermediates in the oxidation of Mn(II) to Mn(IV);\r\n2) Mn(II) cations are bound by microbes predominantly by inner-sphere complexation mechanisms under the experimental conditions;\r\n3) Mn(IV) solid phases are the principal products of microbial Mn(II) oxidation under the experimental conditions.\r\n4) Microbes influence the aqueous reactivities of Mn precipitates via modification of the surface areas, porosities, charge density and compositions of the Mn precipitates they produce.\r\n\r\nThe results will provide information on the factors that control the reactivities of bacteria surfaces and bacterially produced Mn oxides in aqueous solution.  Furthermore, since other metal ions are microbially oxidized by similar metabolic pathways as Mn(II), the results of this project will contribute to the knowledge base on microbially mediated metal redox reactions in natural ecosystems.  These studies on controlled model systems are a necessary starting point for understanding the complex suites of chemical reactions and transformations that occur at microbe-water interfaces in the environment.\r\n",
