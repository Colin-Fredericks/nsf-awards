 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program provides continued support for photochemical research by Dr.   Peter C. Ford, Chemistry Department, University of California, Santa   Barbara.  Work will focus on two classes of compounds:  metal nitrosyl   and nitrito complexes, and polynuclear copper(I) complexes.   The goal of   the first project is to elucidate the photochemical mechanisms of nitric   oxide (NO) generation as well as the dynamics of NO reactions with metal   centers of bioinorganic interest.   Flash and continuous photolysis of   various mononuclear metal nitrosyl and metal nitrito complexes will be   conducted, placing particular emphasis on compounds that may serve as   precursors for the photochemical delivery of NO  to desired targets on   demand.    In addition, the synthesis and photochemical-photophysical   characterization of dual chromophore systems that might serve as   luminactive sensors for detection of NO will be studied.  The second   project will investigate the photoluminescent behavior of mononuclear and   cluster compounds containing d-10 metal centers, primarily copper(I),   including how the excited state properties respond to perturbations in   the properties of the media.  When light is absorbed by a molecule, the energy that the molecule   acquires is sometimes used to initiate a chemical reaction and sometimes   is re-emitted as light of a different wavelength (luminescence).  The   methods used in this study enable changes of both types to be determined.    Nitric oxide(NO) affects bioregulatory and immune response and medical   benefits could be derived from controlled release of NO at specific   targets.  This study will contribute to the understanding of the   interaction of NO with biomolecules and the ability to monitor its   effects.  Studies of the changes of excited state properties of metal   clusters are relevant to the design, optimization, and application of   photooptical devices and photocatalysts.",
