These relations are associated with building one  space out of another by using basic operations like push-outs and  wedges.  The primary goal is to understand the lattice of the  equivalence classes of these relations (the so called Bousfield and  cellular classes).  In particular, the investigator has been looking  into possibilities of extending the Bousfield classification of a  sub-lattice of finite, p-torsion, SUSPENSION complexes to certain  non-suspension spaces.  For this purpose he has been studying homotopy  algebraic structures on spaces that are preserved by Bousfield  localization and Dror Farjoun colocalization functors.  Hurewicz  homomorphisms are an important source of examples of such structures.  Many traditional theorems in homotopy theory are reflections of  properties of the lattice of Bousfield classes.  For example,  classically the Blakers-Massey triad theorem was about connectivity of  certain fibers, i.e., it was shown that these fibers are built from  spheres of some high dimension.  It turns out that allowing other  spaces as building blocks, one can give more accurate Bousfield class  estimations.  Moreover, in this way statements that previously seemed  not to be related can be unified.  This is also a good starting point  for investigating similar relations in other settings, especially in  cases where one does do not have any natural choice of objects  analogous to spheres in the category of spaces.       Over the years it has become evident that homotopy theory methods are  useful in describing many fundamental concepts and capturing their  essential properties.  This has happened in a wide variety of settings  from manifold theory and algebraic geometry to physics.  Homotopy  theory is particularly helpful in studying those properties that are  local, i.e., that can be observed and  analyzed by forgetting the  information that is irrelevant to the problem.  In this way one can  focus on the most essential information and organize data in terms  that are easier to grasp.  Thus in this case the homotopy theory works  as a simplifying tool.  As a result, for example, one can see new  relations between objects that previously seemed not to be related.  Homotopy theory is also fruitfully applied in studying certain  algebraic structures (algebraic structures up to homotopy).  Ignoring  fine structure and using this coarser classification allows one to  cover more ground.  Physics is one of the main sources of examples of  this.  Algebraic structures are used in capturing symmetry of objects.  In this way homotopy theory can work as a distinguishing tool.  An  object with more symmetry must be different from one that is less  symmetric.  Studying the interplay between these two tools is also  profitable.  For example, to understand better the organization  principles of the localization process, it is helpful to know to what  extent it preserves a homotopy algebraic structure, and in order to  apply these tools fully, one still needs to understand the way they  behave in the test case of topological spaces.  ***",
