 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9760132  Owens    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will test a system for simultaneous application of pressure and microwave heating to curable wood assemblies.  Conventional curing processes apply heat by means of heated platens, which are in contact with the surface of the product.  Curing of the interior regions is slow since wood is a poor thermal conductor.  If platen temperatures are increased beyond a certain amount to increase heating of interior regions, scorching and over-curing of the product surface can occur.  Microwave energy affords much more uniform volumetric heating and curing, since it is directly and instantly converted to heat throughout a volume, even in the otherwise hard-to-heat interior regions of a product.  The additional uniform heating power afforded by microwaves will likely increase production rates substantially and produce more even cures for greater product strength and improved quality.    Potential commercial application are expected in the engineered wood industry, where numerous composite products are manufactured with heat-accelerated adhesives.  These products include particle board, fiberboard, waferboard, plywood, laminated veneer lumber, oriented strand lumber, and laminated beams  ***",
