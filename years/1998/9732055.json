 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal No.: 9732055  PI:  Farvardin  University: U of MD-College Park      ABSTRACT    We propose to establish a Research Internships in Telecommunications Engineering (RITE) Site within the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park to provide research opportunities for undergraduates in the broad area of Telecommunications.  The proposed RITE Site will involve approximately 18 undergraduates per year.  At least one half of the students will be recruited from institutions other than the University of Maryland.  Special emphasis will be placed on recruiting students from underrepresented groups and from institutions that do not have a strong research program.  The program will be limited to US citizens or permanent residents.    The program, which starts each year in the beginning of the summer, is intended for students who have completed their sophomore year.  The students participate in one of 6-8 research projects covering the broad spectrum of Telecommunications technologies.  Examples are: wireless communication systems, image and video transmission over the Internet; mapping DSP dataflows to software implementation; operating systems for DSP applications; line-of-site optical communications, rapid prototyping of DSP systems, and wideband amplifiers for communications applications.    Each project will be directed by one or more faculty (and a mentor from industry if appropriate) and will involve a team of graduate and undergraduate students.  A final project report will be produced for each project accompanied by a presentation in the last week of the summer session during the \"RITE Site Fair.\" There will be additional weekly activities including high-level technical seminars by faculty and industry speakers on emerging technologies and trends in Telecommunications, seminars on technical writing and speaking, applying to graduate school and preparing for the GRE exam, and career opportunities and trends, as well as field trips to telecommunications c ompanies.    In addition to providing exposure to telecommunications research, the program will promote communication skills, team work and university-industry interaction, and will provide exposure to the real-world applications of telecommunications research.",
