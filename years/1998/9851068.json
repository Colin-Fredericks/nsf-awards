 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using Case Studies in the Introductory Physics Laboratory addresses two important motivations for laboratory improvement. First, enrollments at the college in both algebra-based and calculus-based introductory physics has more than doubled since 1994 due to increasing numbers of biology chemistry, math and physics majors as well as revitalization of the physics program. Second, a pedagogical renovation of the introductory physics laboratory is needed to better prepare students for the world beyond the classroom and better foster an ability to understand and apply physics. The laboratory program in this project focuses on semester-long team-based Case Studies in which students develop a scientific approach to inquiry and problem solving, reinforce understanding of physics concepts, develop a sense of ownership of their work, experience application of physics to real-life situations, and learn to communicate their research and results.     After choosing a topic for Case Study, each student team chooses and defines a self-designed Case Study, and later proposes and conducts a series of tests and measurements. Regular instructor guidance and feedback is given throughout the entire Case Study process. Each team reports preliminary results and proposes additional tests and measurements to be made. Teams conduct Case Studies using a selection of computer-interfaced sensors, digitized video and ordinary lab equipment. Case Study culminates with a physics \"open house\" and a formal report prepared for the World Wide Web. Case Studies are supplemented with five basic-physics experiments, called Interludes, which develop basic skills and reinforce fundamental physics concepts.     Through the Case Study approach, students are encouraged to become active learners and to extend this capability to other academic experiences. Results of this program will be presented at local and national conferences and submitted for publication in appropriate journals; exemplary Case Studies will be posted on the Carthage  web page for access by interested parties at other institutions.",
