 "awd_abstract_narration": "Simulation tools, computers, and the Internet are transforming our instructional  methods and the ways students learn. This project integrates existing  measurement equipment, computers and simulation software, with new power  supplies, multimeters, and function generators in the main undergraduate  Electronics Laboratory allowing the instruments to be controlled by computer and  accessed via the Web. Using the LabVIEW environment and computer network,  students will simulate, measure, and collect data automatically in a wide  variety of experiments and easily share data across the network with team  members and instructors. The new laboratory will be heavily used in over nine  different undergraduate laboratory courses in the Electrical and Computer  Engineering Curricula.  By using LabVIEW's Internet components, and existing Win  NT server, the stations will be configured to be controlled through the Web as  we investigate remote laboratory experiences for non-traditional students, local  High Schools, and junior college pre-engineering students. This project goes  beyond simply automating data collection, but rather will provide a laboratory  course sequence, which builds on student's measurement and communication skills  throughout the curriculum. Specifically, the goals of this laboratory curriculum  are: (1) to improve the quality and the capability of the Electronics Laboratory  in support of critical measurements on electronic circuits and devices, (2) to  provide the capability to efficiently analyze and interpret real data against  simulation and theory, (3) to teach new measurement techniques including data  acquisition concepts, (4) to facilitate team projects with an integrated  measurement and communication network, and (5) to enable remote access to state- of-the-art electronics measurement facilities to benefit non-traditional, high  school and pre-engineering students.",
