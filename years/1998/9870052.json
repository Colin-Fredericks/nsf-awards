At the most basic level partition  theory deals with the problem of counting the number of ways a number can be written as a sum of smaller numbers.  The theory of partition has had important connections with other branches of number theory such as the theory of modular functions.  It has also had important applications to physics particularly statistical mechanics.  \r\n\r\nNumber theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within  the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse  applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems.  Modular functions are functions with highly symmetric properties.  One main goal of this work is to apply the classical theory of modular functions in a non-standard way to some problems in partition theory.\r\n",
