 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726626  Katz    This award supports the participation of American scientists  and engineers in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Abnormal Flow  Phenomena in Turbomachines -- From Avoidance to Suppression  and Control, to be held in Osaka, Japan from October 26-29,  l998.  The co-organizers are Professors Joseph Katz of Johns  Hopkins University and Oshinobu Tsujimoto of Osaka  University in Japan.  The seminar will focus on the  underlying flow mechanisms, available means to detect,  compute and measure them, as well as existing and potential  future effective countermeasures for them.    Turbomachines are being used in increasingly more severe and  demanding conditions in order to meet higher performance  requirements and a wider range of applications.  Under such  conditions, various kinds of \"abnormal\" flow phenomena, such  as rotating cavitation, rotating stall, surge, and massive  flow separation occur.  Besides having adverse effects on  the performance and causing increased levels of vibrations  and noise, these abnormal phenomena can and do regularly  lead to component and system failures.  Thus, in addition to meeting conventional design targets,  such as improvements in the performance and efficiency, it  is becoming increasingly important to understand the  underlying mechanisms causing these abnormal phenomena and  develop effective counter-measures against them.  The  participants  will develop clear identification of the  dominating flow phenomena and recommended strategies for  avoidance, suppression and control.  The U.S. researchers  are experienced in theoretical, computational and  experimental research tools while the Japanese have  expertise in the fundamental and practical aspects of flows.  The seminar brings together researchers from academia,  industry and government.  In addition, postdoctoral  researchers will be included.  The exchange of ideas and  data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S.  participants to advance their own work, and will set the  stage for fu ture collaborative projects.  ***",
