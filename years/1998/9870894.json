 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870894  Machina    The objective of this research is to explore the analytical robustness of the classical maximization hypotheses - more specifically, to determine the extent to which its analytics and comparative statics extend beyond the class of preference-maximizing choice functions, via the formal definition, characterization and application of the notion of \"local preference-maximization.\"    The concept of local preference-maximization is directed at well-defined choice functions which cannot be represented by a fixed underlying preference ranking.   Different definitions of this concept are developed and used to extend the classical preference-maximization framework to the comparative statistics of differential changes in available sets.  The potential impact of this research is that it would allow for local and global extensions o classical maximization-based comparative statitics analysis top choice functions which are not generated by underlying preference relations, such as aggregate demand/supply functions, or choice functions generated by collective mechanisms.  This research is also motivated by, and has potential impact for the analysis of  violations of classical choice theory such as systematic intransitivities, cancellation effects, similarity effects and response mode effects in a manner that retains as much as possible of the concepts, intuition and analytical results of the classical preference-maximization framework.    ??",
