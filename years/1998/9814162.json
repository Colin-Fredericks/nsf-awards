 "awd_abstract_narration": "EEC-9814162  University of Minnesota  Francis A. Kulacki    The 1998 International Conference on Engineering Education (ICEE) to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil is a follow up to ICEE '97 sponsored by Southern Illinois University, the National Science Foundation and National Cheng Kung University, the Technical University of Strata, and the U.S. technical societies ASME and IEEE.  After ICEE '97, working groups have carried on a continuing dialog through e-mail to fulfill their commitments to share courseware and other educational information, and to deepen the collaborative ties.  This proposal will provide partial travel support for 20 U.S. participants to the conference.    The proposal in intended to facilitate collaboration of engineering educators from different parts of the world in order for all parties to benefit from what is learned in the various countries.  This is judged particularly important at this time when the practice of engineering is becoming a global profession.    In the selection of the recipients of the travel grants a special effort will be made to assure that the recipients include a significant number of younger faculty so that they may gain experience in international activities.  The awards for partial travel support will go principally to those who do not have travel funds from their local sponsored activities, such as work in the NSF coalitions.",
