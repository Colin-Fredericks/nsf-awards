 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9733416  Eric I. Altman/Yale U.    Microelectronics, optoelectronics, and magnetic recording technologies all rely on the ability to grow low defect density, continuous, ultra-thin films. The objective of this project is to determine how the growth of ultra-thin continuous films can be promoted by addition of surfactants.  The effect of surfactants on nucleation and growth kinetics and mechanisms will be studied using in situ variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The observed mechanisms and kinetics will be used to develop kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of surfactant mediated growth.  The simulations will  be used to investigate the sensitivity of the growth mode to the different kinetic parameters and thus will reveal the key features required to successfully use surfactants to form stable, ultra-thin continuous films.    For almost all applications Frank-van der Merwe (F-vdM) or layer-by-layer growth is the preferred growth mode because it results in the thinnest, most uniform, continuous films possible.  Frank-van der Merwe growth is favored when the surface tension of the substrate is greater than the sum of the interfacial tension and the surface tension of the film. Even when F-vdM growth is favored, kinetic limitations can lead to nucleation of new layers before the previous layers are completed.  Addition of a surfactant can  promote F-vdM growth by altering both surface and interfacial tensions and nucleation and growth kinetics.  Recent studies suggest the latter is more important, although nucleation and growth mechanisms and kinetics in the presence of a surfactant remain largely a matter of speculation.  Therefore, we will investigate the kinetics of the key elementary processes that govern surfactant mediated nucleation and growth: surface diffusion, diffusion across steps, attachment to steps, adatom-surfactant exchange barrier,  nucleation.  Comparison of two very different systems, Ag and Ge growth on Si(100) with group V surfactants, will reve al the key features required to successfully use surfactants to promote F-vdM growth, and how the kinetic parameters are affected by the nature of the interactions between the film, the substrate and the surfactant.    Continued advances in a wide range of applications including microelectronics, optoelectronics and magnetic recording depend on the ability to form ultra-thin, low-defect density films on industry standard Si(100) substrates. Specifically, the development of methods to grow smooth Ge films on Si(100) is seen as a key to developing high-speed integrated circuits based on Ge-Si alloy and superlattice structures, and the Ag-Si system is of interest as a base for thin film magnetic structures.",
