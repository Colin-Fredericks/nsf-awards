New  materials  will  be  synthesized which contain arrays of magnetic atoms which interact  antiferromagnetically in one-dimension (chains) or two-dimensions  (layers).  These magnetic materials are predicted to  have  novel  quantum  mechanical  properties. For   example,  measurements  of  their  magnetic  properties  will  provide  important  tests   of  theoretical  predictions of the effects of quantum  fluctuations.  Such  tests  have  not been possible to date because  appropriate  materials  have not been available. Both the static  and  dynamic  magnetic  properties of the new materials will  be  examined  via  magnetization, susceptibility, and specific heat studies, as well  as  NMR,  EPR, and neutron scattering experiments. New  materials  are  being designed and synthesized to provide appropriate 1- and  2-dimensional S=1/2 antiferromagnets. The principles of molecular-  based  magnetism  are  employed to  link  transition  metal  ions  together in the appropriate lattice using organic molecules.  The  study   of  the  magneto-structural  relationships  in  the   new  materials  will  be  emphasized to aid in  the  creation  of  new  generations  of  magnetic  materials.  While  the  focus  is   on  fundamental magnetism the results are potentially of interest  in  the  general  are  of  nanotechnology or  artificially  structure  materials  where atoms might be individually arranged to  provide  lower dimension structures for technical applications.  %%%  This  is  a collaborative project with solid state chemistry  and  condensed   matter  physics  components.  While   properties   of  individual atoms can be analyzed in some detail by the methods of  quantum  mechanics, our understanding a large  numbers  of  atoms  linked  together in different geometries is a much more difficult  task.  This  fundamental research project will study the  quantum  mechan ical  properties of magnetic systems where  magnetic  atoms  interact  with  each  other  in one-dimension  (chains)  or  two-  dimensions (layers). In such geometries, quantum mechanics  makes  novel  predictions  that  have  not  been  tested  experimentally  because  of the lack of appropriate materials. This collaboration  has  designed  and created new magnetic layers and  chains  using  organic  molecules  to link magnetic moments.  The  project  will  provide  excellent training of graduate students in the areas  of  materials synthesis and characterization. While the focus  is  on  fundamental magnetism the results are potentially of interest  in  the  general  area  of  nanotechnology or artificially  structure  materials, where atoms might be individually arranged to  provide  lower dimension structures for technical applications.  ***",
