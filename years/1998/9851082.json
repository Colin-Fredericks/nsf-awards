 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs) are one of the most powerful and widely used metrological instruments in the manufacturing industry. There is virtually no workplace whose dimensions cannot be measured with a properly equipped CMM. The objective of this proposal is to enhance an existing CMM in the Metrology laboratory by acquiring a Motorized Probe Head, an Automatic Probe Exchange System, an Analog Scanning Probe, and a Valisys CAD/CAM software package. The enhanced CMM system will allow for the integration of modern, automated, and CAD-directed coordinate metrology into the Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering (IMSE) curriculum. It will directly impact students, with particular attention given to underrepresent groups, enrolled in the freshman course, IMSE-101 Manufacturing Processes, and upper level courses such as IMSE-384 Numerically Controlled (NC) Systems, IMSE-407 Polymer Processing, and IMSE-480 Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) Systems. The tasks of the project are to (1) fully automate the CMM system to allow for flexible inspection and integration in a CAD/CAM/CIM environment, (2) electronically connect the CMM with NC, CIM, and Polymer Processing laboratories to allow for real-time inspection feedback to close the production loop of these processes via the Valisys software, and (3) establish a CAD-directed inspection system to allow for intelligent inspection through the CAD/CAM system to verify design, combine tolerancing with soft gaging, simulate inspection procedures, and integrate the CMM with emerging technologies such as reverse engineering, rapid prototyping, and rapid tooling. Several laboratory experiments have been planned and will be implemented in the aforementioned IMSE courses. The enhanced CMM system will also be used to develop a new course in metrology, geometric dimensioning & tolerancing, and quality. It will provide students with opportunities for conducting undergraduate research and independent study, and publishing theses and technica l papers.",
