 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to better prepare students to meet the demand for environmental engineers with a wide range of expertise, laboratory courses are being revised to include the use of analytical equipment used throughout the industry. In this proposal, funds are requested to purchase a Hewlett Packard (HP) gas chromatograph (GC), headspace sampler, and data analysis and handling system. Purchase of the gas chromatograph would greatly enhance the undergraduate environmental engineering program by expanding the scope and material to which the students are exposed. The equipment will be used by students enrolled in undergraduate environmental engineering laboratory courses, by faculty run demonstrations, and by undergraduate students involved in student originated research projects.  The primary objective of the proposed project is to integrate the use of gas chromatography into the laboratories of three undergraduate courses in environmental engineering: Principles of Environmental Engineering (CE 170), Physical/Chemical Processes in Environmental Pollution Control (CE 175) and Biological Processes in Environmental Pollution Control (CE 176). The gas chromatograph will be used in CE 170 to teach the fundamental principles and general applications of gas chromatography. The development of laboratories that focus on the application of gas chromatography in the design and/or operation of a number of unit operations and unit processes will provide environmental engineering students enrolled in CE 175 and CE 176 a \"hands-on\" laboratory experience.",
