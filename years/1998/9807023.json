 "awd_abstract_narration": "9807023  Schoonen    This grant provides 50% of the funds to replace an existing  Ion Chromatograph (IC) with an automated IC equipped with  UV/vis, electrochemical, and conductivity detectors for the  aqueous geochemistry laboratory at the State University of  New York at Stony Brook.  The PI, Martin Schoonen, has been  using  IC for the last decade in a number of different  research projects, including studies of the occurrence of  metastable  sulfoxyanions in (hydrothermal) waters, chloride  and sulfate incorporation in sedimentary carbonates, and  nitrate in groundwaters.  Other users of the existing and  new IC include the PI's colleagues Dr. Meyers, Reeder,  Parise and Hanson in the Department of Geosciences and Drs.  Taylor and Brownawell at the Marine Sciences Research  Center, SUNY-SB.    The new IC will be used as the main analytical tool in the  PI's geochemistry lab, while the existing IC will be used  for in-line analysis.  The new IC provides the PI with a  versatile analytical tool that can be used to determine both  inorganic cations and anions as well as various organic  constituents in natural waters and experimental fluids.  The  new IC is equipped with an autosampler and PC data  acquisition package.  This automation makes it possible to  conduct routine analyses unattended, boosting the  productivity of the PI's research group.  The existing IC  will be used as a dedicated in-line analyzer in experiments  that require continuous monitoring.  Support for the  acquisition of the new IC is shared by the NSF Earth  Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program (EAR/IF) and  SUNY-Stony Brook.  ***",
