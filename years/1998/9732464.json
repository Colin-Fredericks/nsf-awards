 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9732464  Van Woert     This project is an interdisciplinary study, titled Research on Ocean-Atmosphere Variability and Ecosystem Response in the Ross Sea (ROAVERRS), of atmospheric forcing, ocean hydrography, sea ice dynamics, primary productivity, and pelagic-benthic coupling in the southwestern Ross Sea, Antarctica.  The primary goal is to examine how changes in aspects of the polar climate system, in this case wind and temperature, combine to influence marine productivity on a large antarctic continental shelf.  In the Ross Sea, katabatic winds and mesocyclones influence the spatial and temporal distribution of sea ice as well as the upper ocean mixed layer depth, and thus control primary production within the sea ice as well as in the open water system.  The structure, standing stock and productivity of bottom-dwelling biological communities are also linked to meteorological processes through interseasonal and interannual variations in horizontal and vertical fluxes of organic carbon produced in the upper ocean.   Linkages among the atmospheric, oceanic, and biological systems will be investigated during a three-year field study of the southwestern Ross Sea ecosystem.  Direct measurements will include regional wind and air temperatures derived from automatic weather stations; ice cover, ice movement, and sea surface temperatures derived from a variety of satellite-based sensors; hydrographic characteristics of the upper ocean and primary productivity in the ice and in the water derived from research cruises and satellite studies; vertical flux of organic material and water movement derived from oceanographic moorings containing sediment traps and current meters, and the abundance, distribution, and respiration rates of biological communities on the sea floor, derived from box cores, benthic photographs and shipboard incubations.   Based on archived meteorological data, it is expected that the atmospheric variability during the study period will be such that changes in airflow patterns a nd their influence on oceanographic and biological patterns can be monitored, and their direct and indirect linkages that are the focus of the research can be deduced.  Results from this study will contribute to our knowledge of atmospheric and oceanic forcing of marine ecosystems, and lead to a better understanding of marine ecosystem response to climatic variations.  ***",
