Continuing   his (joint with S. Ivanov) research in the large-scale geometry of   periodic metrics, D. Burago proposes to study the asymptotic volume   growth for Finsler tori; a related problem is to analyze   area-minimizing properties of affine subspaces in Banach spaces.  This   may help to understand how the absence of conjugate points for a   Lagrangian system on a torus is reflected in the dynamics of its   geodesic flow.  D. Burago also proposes to continue his analysis of   higher dimensional analogs for geometric conclusions of Aubry-Mather   theory.  Trying to further understand the relationship between   biLipschitz equivalence and quasi-isometries, it is natural to   consider such cases where density arguments (developed by the proposer   jointly with B. Kleiner) do not work; the most striking of such cases   include Penrose tilings and uniform lattices.  Continuing his (joint   with S. Ferleger, A. Kononenko) study of semi-dispersing billiard   systems, D. Burago plans to investigate if their topological entropy   can be infinite.  Another problem which arose from the proposer's   method of applying singular geometry to billiard theory is   constructing CAT(0) development spaces whose geodesics represent all   billiard trajectories.  E. Johnson, the proposer's advisee, works on   applying the proposer's method to prove the unboundness for complete   surfaces of finite variation of curvature to show stability of the   class of embedded flat surfaces.    The main subjects of the proposal have very clear physical analogs.    Large-scale geometric properties of periodic metrics can be   interpreted as global properties of a periodic medium consisting of   copies of the same microscopic pattern repeated in a regular fashion,   as in crystals.  In particular, dynamical properties of geo desic flows   for periodic metrics reflect how the light or radiation spreads in   such media.  The technique developed by the proposer and his   collaborators allows us to solve many of the open problems in this   area for the most important case (quadratic Lagrangians); in general,   this circle of problems remains wide open.  The proposer's research in   the theory of billiard systems started from a problem that goes back   to Boltzmann: can one give an upper bound on the maximum number of   collisions in a given time interval in a system of several balls   colliding elastically (gas model)?  The number of collisions per time   unit plays important role in thermodynamics.  Surprisingly, this   problem has been solved by establishing a connection with singular   geometry; in its turn, this connection led to new intriguing problems   of both geometric and dynamical origin.",
