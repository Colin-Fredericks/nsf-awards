 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803181  Bloch    In this project the proposer will continue research into the dynamics and   control of nonlinear mechanical systems in finite- and infinite-dimensions.   In particular, research is proposed in the following areas: integrable   Hamiltonian systems in finite- and infinite-dimensions, the stabilization   and control of nonlinear mechanical systems, the analysis and control of   nonholonomic systems with constraints, the optimal control of systems   with constraints, and the dynamics and control of infinite-dimensional   systems and systems with complex dynamics. The proposer will analyze   two basic classes of integrable systems -- the Toda lattice in finite- and   infinite-dimensions, and the generalized rigid body equations. The   proposer's view of these systems is inspired by work in applied analysis --   optimization and control problems. The proposer will also investigate the   dynamics of nonholonomic systems. Such systems, which are mechanical   systems subject to nonintegrable constraints such as rolling, are not   Hamiltonian in general but nonetheless conserve energy. This leads to   very rich behavior including the possibility of asymptotic stability. With   his collaborators the proposer has been developing an energetic approach   to the control of nonlinear mechanical systems which leaves the system in   classical Lagrangian form despite the presence of feedback. This enables   the classical theory of stability, which is normally applied to autonomous   systems, to be applied to classes of controlled systems. Several other   problem in the control and dynamics of finite- and infinite-dimensional   systems are discussed, such as the analysis of the structure and stability of   interconnected systems including linked finite- and infinite-dimensional   systems.    In broad terms the proposer will study the behavior and control of various   mechanical systems that are important in physics and engineering.   Engineering applications include aerospace systems and robotics.  He will   study certain model systems that can be solved explicitly. Such systems   are important for the light they shed on the behavior of more complicated   systems which can only be simulated on a computer. He will also consider   the optimization of the behavior of various mechanical control systems.   This optimization is important not only for obtaining desirable system   behavior but for reducing cost. He will study various methods for   controlling the motion of such systems as robots and satellites. In the   modeling of satellites he will consider the importance of flexible   appendages such as antennae in the stability of their motion. He will also   analyze the motion of systems in fluids -- for example the motion of   underwater vehicles. In general the hope is to obtain a better   understanding of the dynamics and control of a large class of engineering   and physical systems.",
