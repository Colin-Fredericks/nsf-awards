 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on improving WWW proxy caching in  order to sustain the continued growth of the Web on the  Internet. Caching is one of the most important techniques  that can be used to increase the salability of the Web.  The  research targets four major problems that currently plague  Web caching systems: lack of strong cache consistency, no  support for server control on cache accesses, inflexible  caching algorithms, and poor performance.  In order to solve  these problems, this project will explore  means to include  strong cache consistency maintenance in WWW via lease-based  invalidation protocols, active cache architecture that  supports server-supplied processing upon cache access, Web  caching strategies that adapt to network conditions and  utilize the unique capabilities of large proxy caches to  reduce network  congestion, and high-performance scalable  proxy architectures and cache sharing  protocols.  Combined,  these efforts promise to qualitatively improve the  scalability and availability of the Web, and to support the  increasingly important role that the Web plays in our  society. The educational activities include developing the  mini-scale Internet emulator, nurturing the \"crash and burn\"  lab, and other initiatives aimed at increasing the research  involvement of undergraduate students.",
