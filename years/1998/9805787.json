 "awd_abstract_narration": "9805787  Murfett  This POWRE proposal will investigate the auxin signal transduction pathway using a novel and well developed genetic approach.  Auxin, which is an essential plant growth hormone, has been the subject of intensive research for over 100 years.  However, the mechanisms by which this essential growth substance functions remain unknown.  The proposed research will almost certainly provide important insights for understanding auxin action.  The work utilizes a number of novel transgenic plant lines that the PI has constructed to use a reporter gene that is under the control of an auxin-specific promoter.  The transgenic plants were mutagenized and mutant lines that display altered expression of the reporter gene were isolated.  Several novel mutants have already been isolated and the proposed research will result in detailed characterization the mutant plants and eventually cloning of the genes.  Because of the central role of auxin in plant growth and development, identifying the genes involved in the transduction of auxin signals will be of fundamental significance to plant biology research and may eventually result in novel methods for controlling crop production .  The proposed research will also allow the PI to develop an excellent long-term research project that will demonstrate her ability to be an independent researcher and make her very competitive when searching for permanent faculty positions.",
