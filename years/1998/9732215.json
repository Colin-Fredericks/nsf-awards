The intent is to recruit students who: (1) are underrepresented in the field (women and minorities), (2) are undergraduates at other institutions, and (3) may not have the opportunity to conduct research at their undergraduate institutions.  The students will participate in the summer between their junior and senior years, and the intent is to instill in the students the desire to pursue a graduate education.  The program will include: (1) a self contained research project for each student that is aligned with a larger funded project, (2) individual direction by graduate students and faculty members, (3) regular research project meetings, (4) a final oral presentation and written report by the undergraduate researchers, (5) weekly meeting/seminars with other undergraduate researchers, including a series of outside speakers.  Research will be in the areas of Environmental, Geotechnical, Structural, and Transportation Engineering.  Faculty and students will be matched according to applicability of projects, desires of faculty and students, the needs of faculty, and the abilities of students.",
