 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is threefold.   First, the activity of   ruthenium olefin-metathesis catalysts will be determined as functions of   ligand composition and metal content.    Second, the chemistry developed   with the ruthenium complexes will be extended to iron and rhenium to   determine whether complexes of these metals also form metal-carbon double   bonds, and as such, function as metathesis catalysts.   Third, the   activity of the ruthenium complexes as initiators for the living   polymerization of strained olefins will be examined in unusual media   including aqueous solution and on the surface of a support.  Graduate   students involved in the proposed research will receive broad,   interdisciplinary training in the areas of organometallic and polymer   chemistry.  The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program (CHE) and the Solid   State Chemistry and Polymer Program (DMR) support the research of   Professor Robert Grubbs of the Department of Chemistry at the California   Institute of Technology.   Professor Grubbs will focus his research on   the synthesis of metal complexes capable of forming carbon-metal double   bonds, and the use of these complexes as initiators of polymerization   reactions.   Formation of polymers of unusual shape and composition and   initiation in unusual environments, including aqueous solution and on the   surface of a support, will be explored.   Professor Grubbs will train   graduate students in the design, synthesis and characterization of   organometallic complexes and their use as polymerization initiators.",
