 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  research  is  aimed  at supporting interaction  with  large  databases  that include handwritten documents.  The objective  is  to  advance  understanding  of  methodologies  for  interactively  querying  large  document databases.  Examples of such  documents  include  medical  and insurance information  systems  into  which  volumes  of paper records have been scanned, government  security  systems, and electronic historical document collections, such  as  the  collections  created by the Model Editions Partnership.   An  existing, high-performance handwritten recognition algorithm will  be  adapted  to  the  research  problem.   The  questions  to  be  addressed  include:  Which global, word-level training  objective  functions  result in better performance?  Which  character  class  confidence  measures result in better system  performance?   And,  which  character-based, word level confidence estimators  results  in   better  system  performance?  Experiments  will   focus   on  comparison of different methodologies for training; of  different  objective  functions,  optimization  criteria,  and  optimization  methodologies;  and of different methods of estimating  character  confidence.",
