While more commonly used techniques such as x-ray, neutron, and light scattering reveal much about the averaged structural features over these length scales, it is difficult to examine the range from nanometers to hundreds of microns with a single experiment or even a single scattering technique.  Imaging complex fluids and biomaterials with electron microscopy is a necessary complement to scattering studies, especially as microscopy directly addresses the main limitations of scattering.  However, high resolution imaging has its own experimental limitations: the fluid sample must be replaced by a solid, conductive, low vapor pressure version of the original material to be compatible with the requirements of electron or scanning tunneling microscopy.  Experience has shown that the best method of making samples for TEM of STM is by rapid freezing, followed by freeze-fracture replication.  In freeze-fracture replication, the rapidly frozen specimen is fractured at low temperature and high vacuum to expose the interior structure of the fluid.  The fracture surface is then replicated by evaporation of a metal shadowing film to provide contrast in the TEM image or conductivity for STM, followed by a carbon backing film to provide sufficient strength for subsequent processing and imaging.  The resolution in the technique is about 2 nm lateral and 0.5 nm vertical.  The technique has proven to be ideal for a range of complex fluids and biomaterials including polymer and surfactant gels, surfactant micelles and microemulsions, biomembranes, lamellar, hexagonal and cubic surfactant liquid crystals, vesicles, liposomes, themotropic liquid  crystals, etc. and can simultaneously resolve nanometer sized particles and their order, orientation and defects to 100 micron length scales.\r\n\r\nThis award provides support for a new Freeze-fracture System which will significantly improve the throughput of samples, decreasing the turnaround times from about 8 hours to about 1 hour per sample run.  In the new equipment, the samples are loaded through a vacuum airlock, and the electron beam evaporation sources can also be externally adjusted via airlocks.  Hence, the main vacuum chamber is never vented.  On our current instrument, vacuum must be broken to introduce the specimen, replace the evaporation sources, and to remove the specimen after processing.  Each sample run requires that the main chamber be vented at least 3 times, with the necessary pump down time in between.  The faster turnaround will allow us to examine more samples more efficiently and the better vacuum will give higher resolution and less artifacts due to contamination.  The evaporators on the new equipment are externally controlled to provide higher resolution replicating films with less down time.\r\n\r\nThe freeze-fracture equipment will be available to other researchers in the department and the University.  The instrumentation at the University of California at Santa Barbara is heavily used by a collaborative group of scientists studying complex fluids and biomaterials, and by industrial and academic collaborators in California (Depotech, Alliance Pharmaceuticals) and elsewhere (U. Delaware. Dow Chemical).\r\n%%%\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
