 "awd_abstract_narration": "9732516  Zhang    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Xi-Cheng Zhang,  Department of Physics, Applied Physics and Astronomy,  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, to pursue with Professor  Hyun-Shik Kang, Department of Physics Education, Chonbuk  National University, Korea, for 24 months, a program of  cooperative research on electro-optic field sensors and  their applications.  Much of the activity initially will  concentrate on learning from the Korean collaborator  techniques used for growth and fabrication of high quality  ZnTe crystals.  These electro-optic crystals then will be  used as broad band field sensors for the coherent  measurement of freely-propagating ultra wideband pulsed  terahertz electromagnetic waves (THz beams).    The present collaboration will add an international  dimension to Dr. Zhang's research presently funded under  NSF Grant No. ECS-9701486.  The U.S. researcher expects  this new collaboration to be beneficial to ongoing research  under his NSF grant.  The PI reports that the ZnTe sensor  is so sensitive that it eliminates the need for metallic  antennas and electrical connections that can interfere with  accurate measurement and characterization of the  electromagnetic environment.  Other benefits include  improved measurement accuracy by reducing susceptibility to  electrical noise pick up, thus, eliminating the  need for  electrical power at the sensor head; the sensor head can be  placed in hostile or remote areas; and the device's  compactness allows measurement in small cavities.  This  project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea  Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the  level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and  engineers through the exchange of scientific information,  ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on  problems of mutual benefit.  This project will provide  international training and experience for a U.S. graduate  student in a fundamentally and technologically significant  area of ph otonics and optoelectronics research..  Korean  participation is supported by the Korea Science and  Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  ***",
