In  these  states,  the  electronic  charge  and/or  spin  density  is  spatially  modulated,  with  a  wavelength  which  differs from that of the  underlying  crystal.  Many  of the anomalous properties, however, result from the  fact  the  Density  Wave  (DW)  itself  is  deformable,  and  that  its  deformations, which can be charged, interact with each other  and  with  other  charges  and defects in the  crystal.  This  project  focuses  on  the effect of such deformations in 1) modifying  the  elastic  properties of DW materials, 2) allowing  current  to  be  injected  into  the DW, and 3) driving materials into  glass-like  states  at low temperatures. Experimental techniques include:  1)  electromodulated   infrared  transmission   (to   study   charged  deformations that accompany polarization and current injection in  the  CDW in blue bronze); 2) ac calorimetry to study the specific  heat; and, 3) low frequency elastic measurements, which are  made  using  a radio frequency cavity in conjunction with small magnets  to  strain the small samples. The combination of these techniques  allows  a  search  for glass-transitions in CDW  materials.  This  research  program  is  interdisciplinary in nature  and  involves  several  graduate  students, who receive  excellent  training  in  preparation  for careers in industry, government laboratories  or  academia.  %%%  This  experimental research project is devoted to  properties  of  \"quasi-one-dimensional  conducting\" materials.  These  materials,  which  include  Tantalum  Triselenide  and  Potassium  Molybdenum  Trioxide, are often needle-like in their crystal forms and  allow  for   electrical  conduction  along  only  one  direction.  These  compounds in some cases undergo transitions at low te mperature to  unusal states in which the motion of electrical charge occurs  in  a  correlated way, in Charge Density Waves (CDW). A related state  is  called a Spin Density Wave (SDW). Such CDW and SDW states  in  quasi-one-dimensional conductors feature electronic charge and/or  spin  density  which is spatially modulated,  with  a  wavelength  which  differs  from  that of the underlying crystal.  Electrical  conduction  in  the  CDW state occurs as the  whole  wave  moves,  rather than by individual charge motion as in copper. Many of the  anomalous  properties, however, result from the fact the  Density  Wave  (DW) itself is deformable, and that its deformations, which  can  be  charged, interact with each other and with other charges  and defects in the crystal. This project focuses on the effect of  such  deformations in 1) modifying the elastic properties  od  DW  materials,  2) allowing electrical current to be injected  in  to  the  DW, and 3) driving materials into glass-like states  at  low  temperatures.
