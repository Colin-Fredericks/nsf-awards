 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neuroscience has had an enormous impact on the field of psychology.  Recognizing this, Lafayette College proposes to add expanded neuroscience laboratory experiences to its psychology curriculum.  These laboratory classes will afford students extensive application of contemporary methods and techniques in behavioral neuroscience and hone critical thinking skills while exploring open-ended problems.  In particular, our development plan seeks to: 1) enrich the neuroscience experiences in two psychology laboratory courses  (\"Cognitive Psychology\" and \"Perception\"), 2) add a new advanced laboratory course  (\"Advanced Behavioral Neuroscience'') so that students can better integrate knowledge derived from courses in biology, chemistry, and psychology, and 3) improve the capstone experiences in student-directed research courses.       In support of these laboratory experiences in behavioral neuroscience, we will add additional equipment to our undergraduate laboratory, including electroencephalograph recording equipment, a variety of software/hardware components, and a high-performance liquid chromatography unit.       Students pursuing each of the three majors offered by the Psychology Department  (A.B. Psychology, B.S. Psychology, and B.S. Behavioral Neuroscience) will be affected by this plan.   The scientific education of future scientists (especially women) and K- 12 educators, other college students in the region, and high school students will be advanced by the proposed laboratory improvements.       Our evaluation plan combines achievement testing and assessment of the scientific impact of the designed changes.   Our development plan represents an important advancement in the teaching of psychology and our approach could serve as a model for other institutions.  Thus we will actively share our findings through traditional means (journal articles, conference presentations), as well as through our web-site and video-conferencing facilities.",
