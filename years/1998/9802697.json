 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stephens  9802697    \"Foraging\" is the process of searching for, attacking,  and processing food and other resources. Scientists  study foraging in several ways: some investigators  address the psychological and neural apparatus of  resource-seeking behavior; others study the structures  and physiology of resource acquisition (for example,  mouth pads and digestive processes); still others focus  on how foraging influences the structure of ecosystems.  This diversity has meant that investigators working at  one level, seldom have opportunities to interact with  those working at another. This project supports an  international conference on foraging behavior that will  bring many of these investigators together. The  conference, at the University of California at Santa  Cruz, will consist of 18 invited presentations selected  to represent an array of approaches, and approximately  80 contributed presentations.    The conference seeks to promote an improved and better  integrated view of foraging behavior. This is both  practically and conceptually important. For example,  many scientists now feel that a deeper understanding of  the brain and nervous system will be a key challenge  for the next decade: analysis of animal foraging  behavior can provide clues to the types of cognitive  problems that neural processes were built to solve. At  a different level of biological organization, many  critical ecological relationships are, in fact, feeding  relationships, and so an improved knowledge of foraging  behavior can improve the decisions in the use and  management of natural ecosystems.",
