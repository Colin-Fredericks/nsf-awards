 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current theory does little to predict, explain or analyze  the empirically observed success of search and optimization  heuristics for some domains of NP-complete problem and their  failure for others.  Without such a theory, implementers of  heuristics have no guidance as to whether a particular  heuristic method is suitable for a particular problem  domain, what kind of performance to expect, or how to set  the various parameters for better performance.  Implementation is often done in a haphazard way based on  little more than guess-work or trial-and-error.  The  following inter-related lines of theoretical research will  be explored to address this gap: (1) Extending average-case  complexity to consider reductions to and between problem  distributions that arise naturally ( in real-life, testing,  cryptanalysis or combinatorics). (2) Extending average-case  analysis techniques to a more general characterization of  the relevant combinatorial properties of random problem  instances from naturally arising distributions.  In  particular, the properties of associated search spaces for  such problems. (3) For experimentally successful heuristic  methods, identify the combinatorial characteristics of  problem instances that determine their performance. (4)  Investigate more efficient worst-case algorithms for NP  complete problems, identify those NP complete problems with  nontrivial worst-case algorithms, and explore the connection  between lower and upper bounds.  Although the techniques  used are solely mathematical, the motivation and  justification come from the experimental literature.",
