A primary aim of the project to  investigate nonequilibrium effects on doping during MBE growth,  and to use the insight gained to improve doping. ZnSe and related  alloys (with mainly nitrogen doping) will be used as a test  system. A further aim of the project is to apply the resultant  understanding to improve doping in ZnBe, and possibly ZnCdBe  chalcogenide alloys, since these alloys are candidates for  potential improvements in device lifetimes of ZnSe-based  blue-green diode lasers. Specific aspects of MBE growth planned  for investigation are planar doping, changes in the  metal/chalcogenide ratio, and/or changes in crystallographic  orientation. A further objective is to study and possibly  eliminate DX centers by use of the planar doping technique.  Planar doping will be used with both the dopant and a different  chalcogenide (such as Te for ZnMgSeS) to modify the local  environment of such centers so as to eliminate them from some  systems where they now exist--it has been reported that  simultaneous Te/N planar doping gives not only almost an order of  magnitude improvement in hole concentrations in ZnSe, but also  changes the ionization energy to close to the ZnTe value.  Elimination of DX centers would be a major technological and  fundamental breakthrough. In addition to the study of growth, it  is also planned to coordinate growth with determination of  compensating species. Considering non-equilibrium aspects of  doping, different compensating species may dominate under  different conditions. Compensating species resulting from various  growth approaches will be studied, primarily via luminescence,  positron annihilation spectroscopy, and optically detected  magnetic resonance.  %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  materials science having high technological relevance. The  research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at  a  fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic  devices.  Experimental tools are now available to allow atomic  level observation of materials defects and their origins which  when better understood will allow advances in both fundamental  science and technology. The basic knowledge and understanding  gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving  the performance and stability of advanced devices by providing a  fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing  improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important  feature of the program is the integration of research and  education through the training of students in a fundamentally and  technologically significant area.",
