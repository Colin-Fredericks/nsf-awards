 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal No.: 9721378  PI:  Stormont  University: U of New Mexico      ABSTRACT    Eight undergraduate students from the Rocky Mountain and Southwest Regions of the United States will participate in a nine-week, comprehensive research experience at the University of New Mexico during the summer of 1998.  In the summer of 1998, in accordance with his/her interests, each student will participate as a team member in one of the following projects: 1) conduct nondestructive evaluation of structures; 2) investigate new waste containment technologies using geosynthetic materials; 3) perform research in the area of construction management,, 4) construct small scale models of hydraulic structures and test these models in an open channel flow facility; 5) use an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope to investigate degradation of structures; 6) use Geographic Information Systems to model contaminant transport; 7) develop an object-oriented computational mechanics toolkit; and 8) development of practical new techniques for the remediation of polluted ground water.  More than half of the students will be selected from applicants at institutions other than UNM, especially those without active research programs.  Women, minority, and handicapped applicants, and other groups generally underrepresented in engineering particularly will be recruited.  The students will become familiar with their projects through early contact with the research faculty.  Each student can expect to learn to work independently over the course of the summer, while participating in a loosely knit group of graduate and undergraduate students.  He/she will also attend weekly group meetings, present a final seminar on the research, and assist in writing a publication describing the work.    The Department of Civil Engineering at UNM was a recipient of NSF-REU site awards in 1990 through 1997.  We enjoyed very productive summers all eight years, with a total of 83 students participating in various research projects.  Over the eight ye ars we have made offers to approximately 105 students, and ultimately 83 students accepted our offers.  More than two times as many qualified students are applying for the program as are accepted, thus providing a good level of competition which enables us to make offers to the most highly qualified students.  Approximately two thirds of our participants have been minorities and/or women.",
