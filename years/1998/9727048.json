 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bowen  9727048      This research will use molecular genetic technology to investigate the  limits of dispersal for reef fishes among the four primary reef habitats of  the tropical Atlantic: Caribbean Sea, Brazil, mid-Atlantic ridge (Ascension  Island), and Gulf of Guinea (West Africa).  DNA sequences will be compared  among populations of French angelfish (Pomacanthus paru), blackbar  squirrelfish (Myripristis jacobus) and five other species to track patterns  of colonization and gene flow across the Atlantic Ocean.    Reef fish don't move much as adults, so dispersal is accomplished primarily  by drifting eggs and larvae.  How far can reef fish disperse as larvae?  This question is of fundamental importance for understanding the natural  recolonization of reef habitats damaged by anthropogenic factors.  Reef  habitats in Brazil and the Caribbean Sea are separated by 2000 kms of muddy  coastline (between the Orinoco and Amazon River basins).  West Atlantic  reefs are separated from African reefs by 4000 kms of open ocean.  Population genetic assessments at these two geographic scales should resolve  the limitations of reef fish dispersal.  A central focus of this research is  the role of Ascension Island on the mid-Atlantic ridge in facilitating  colonization between east and west Atlantic. If Ascension Island functions  as a stepping stone for colonization across the Atlantic, then this oceanic  island may play a substantial (and previously unrecognized) role in  enhancing the biodiversity of West Atlantic reef habitats.",
