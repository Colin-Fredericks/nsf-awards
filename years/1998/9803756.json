George  Institution:     University of Texas   Project:         Bayes and Empirical Bayes Model Selection    Abstract:    Bayes and empirical Bayes approaches for model selection are studied,   developed and enhanced for a variety of different settings.  First of  all, theoretical frequentist risk properties of recently discovered  empirical Bayes selection criteria are established for the canonical  linear model setting.   For graphical model selection, connections  between frequentist and Bayesian methods are investigated and used  to motivate new empirical Bayes methods.  For wavelet representations,  robust empirical Bayes selection procedures are developed which  accommodate heavy tailed noise distributions.  For Bayesian CART  modeling, new families of structured hierarchical priors are developed.  To facilitate and enhance model search, new MCMC algorithms are  developed which move across sets of models rather than single models.  These algorithms use new transition kernel steps, such as  transplantation, which can rapidly traverse the kinds of multimodal   model posterior distributions that arise in this context.  These  algorithms also incorporate stochastic heating and cooling to further  increase movement.    This research ultimately concerns the development of statistical  methods for discovering  systematic structure in large multi-variable  data sets. This general problem is of substantial importance because  of the explosive growth in the technology to collect and analyze such  data.  Indeed, such large data sets occur naturally in federal  strategic areas of national concern including telecommunications,  biotechnology, and climatology.  A standard statistical approach in  such settings is to search for \"promising\" statistical models within  some prespecified, large, flexible class of potential models.  Once  found, the challenge is to estimate the mod el and draw meaningful  inference.  These tasks can be especially difficult when the class of  potential models is huge, as is typically the case the number of  variables is large.  The main thrust of this work will be to develop  new methods to confront these challenges and broaden the scope of the   statistical approach.",
