 "awd_abstract_narration": "What happens when we pay attention to a complex, dynamically changing sound such as a sentence or a symphony? What makes some music and some speech easier to attend to than others? Previous research has shown that temporal structure (i.e. rhythm) is an important determinant of the ability to attend to auditory events. This collaborative research project addresses the question of why this is so. Briefly, our theory states that rhythm is important determinant of attention because attending is a fundamentally rhythmic process. More specifically, attentional oscillations entrain to the rhythms of complex events, allowing listeners to predict when important events will occur. Thus, rhythms whose structures facilitate entrainment should be easy to attend to, while events with irregular rhythms should be more difficult to process.  The current research project develops this approach along two fronts. First, we are developing mathematical models and computer simulations of auditory attending that make specific predictions about responses to different types of events. Second, we are investigating the response of listeners to the same auditory events, allowing us to evaluate the model's predictions. In particular, we test how people attentionally follow simple auditory patterns that contain unexpected changes in timing. Analyses of these behaviors, together with our mathematical models, will allow use to determine whether or not internal oscillations underlie the ability to attend to auditory events. If so we expect to be able to say, with mathematical precision, a great deal about how attending in time works.",
