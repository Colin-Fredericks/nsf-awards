 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Ronald Breslow, of the Department of Chemistry at Columbia   University, is supported by the Organic Synthesis Program for his studies   of organic reactions and synthesis in water solution.  In addition to the   environmental advantages of carrying out chemical reactions in water   instead of organic solvents, water can also influence the effectiveness   of organic reactions. Thus, for example, the Diels Alder reaction is   found to be both faster and more selective when carried out in aqueous   solution.  Professor Breslow explores the factors influencing such   chemical reactions, focusing on hydrophobic effects and on polarity   issues.  He also exploits the hydrophobic effect in designing   cyclodextrin-based catalysts and is developing additional   non-cyclodextrin-based synthetic binding agents which also rely on   hydrophobic binding.  His synthetic bifunctional catalysts permit the   determination of the preferred reaction geometries for such reactions as   the deprotonation of carbon during enolization.  With the support of the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor Ronald   Breslow, of the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University, explores   chemical reactions in water in place of traditional organic solvents.    While the use of water offers clear and significant environmental   advantages, it plays a central chemical role as well.  Thus, certain   chemical reactions are found to be greatly accelerated when carried out   in aqueous solution, and they often lead more selectively to specific   products.  These effects appear to be due, at least in part, to the   tendency of many organic molecules to aggregate in water so as to   minimize their interfaces with the water solvent.  Professor Breslow   exploits similar effects in the design and construction of molecules   which bind smaller molecules in solution and then carry out desired   chemical transformations of the bound molecules, mimicking in many ways   the function of enzymes.  These studies are leading to an understanding   of the factors controlling certain chemical reactions.",
