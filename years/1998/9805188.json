 "awd_abstract_narration": "9805188  Evans    This GOALI project will relate the results of quantum mechanical  calculations to macroscopic adhesion measurements made on the  same oxide/metal interfaces with the long range goal of  understanding and improving coatings for automotive applications.  Greater reliance is being placed on these coatings to serve  thermomechanical functions.  Functions such as thermal and  abrasion protection have already been realized, but the coatings  have yet to achieve their full potential because of limited basic  understanding about their cohesion and adhesion.  Most coatings  are non-equilibrium assemblages of metals and oxides, with their  interfaces exerting a dominant influence on performance.  Segregants have a dramatic effect on the adhesion of such  interfaces.  Segregant-free interfaces are typically ductile and  tough, whereas segregants of carbon, sulfur, etc. can lead to  weak, brittle interfaces.  The interactions that cause segregant  embrittlement have yet to be clarified and understood. The  research has two synergistic elements:  1) It puts in place the  linkages needed to connect the physics of bond rupture with  continuum level interface fracture mechanics. This would be done  through a combination of measurements performed on metal/oxide  interfaces relevant to coatings, in conjunction with first  principles bonding calculations, coupled with crack growth  simulations; and 2) The results would have direct relevance to  coating technology through the laboratory and field testing  conducted at GM in both their Research Laboratory and Powertrain  Division.  %%%  The GOALI research would exploit new capabilities in first  principles bonding calculations to develop a basic understanding  of the adhesion of interfaces having technological importance for  coatings used in the automotive industry.  It would involve a  collaboration between the PI and J. R. Smith of General Motors,  as well as with Hutchinson (Harvard) and Ruhle (Stuttgart).  The  GOALI collaboration will inclu de quarterly meetings involving the  industrial and academic researchers, the graduate student  spending time between semesters at the GM research facility, and  Dr. Smith acting as co-advisor to the graduate student.  In  addition, GM will provide a summer internship for an  undergraduate to conduct projects at GM.  This project is co-  funded by the Ceramics Program of the Division on Materials  Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the  Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.  ***",
