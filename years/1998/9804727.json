The  theme of the conference is \"Engineering the Future of  Healthcare in Tennessee\".  The theme was developed from a  recognition of the need to foster collaborative efforts  between industrial, academic, and clinical institutions that  are involved in biomedical engineering, and to increase the  awareness of biomedical engineering related activities in  the state of Tennessee.  Information about the meeting is  disseminated through an Internet WEB page at URL  http://bme.utmem.edu/~tnbme/.    The primary objective of the meeting is to initiate a  process to increase the awareness of biomedical engineering  activities in Tennessee on the part of industrial, academic,  and clinical institutions.  The organizers place special  importance on attracting students and industrial  representatives to the meeting.  The final report of the  conference will include conference proceedings, a report by  the Evaluation Committee concerning the feasibility of  holding future meetings, and the results of a survey of the  participants concerning their satisfaction with the meeting.  ***",
