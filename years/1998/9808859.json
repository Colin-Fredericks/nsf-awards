For an animal under sudden attack by a predator, quick reaction    is crucial. Even in the fastest evasive behaviors, integration of    information from different sensory modalities may also be    essential for behavior appropriate to the specific threat, yet    this multimodal integration has rarely been studied behaviorally,    and has never been examined in some seminal neuroethological    systems. Bats use ultrasonic echolocation to home in on insect    prey; some insects have evolved sensory systems and evasive    behaviors to help them escape capture. Praying mantises have a    cyclopean auditory system that is sensitive to ultrasound, and    ultrasonic pulses trigger a complex, short-latency response that    helps flying mantises survive bat attacks. We have recently shown    that 1) the mantis cercal system is extremely sensitive to wind;    2) mantises respond to wind puffs when flying; and 3) strong wind    accompanies bat attacks. Because it provides direction and    distance information that the auditory system cannot, we    hypothesize that the cercal wind detection system plays an    important role in determining the timing, strength and nature of    the mantis' evasive response. Using high-speed digital video,    laser/solar cell movement detectors, and electromyograms, we will    study the interaction of wind and sound stimuli in the evasive    behavior of tethered, flying mantises in an anechoic chamber.    Using electrodes implanted in a mantis tethered in a large flight    room, we will monitor sensory CNS responses to both wind and sound    as the insect is attacked by a flying bat. We will assess the    efficacy of evasive behavior when only wind, only sound, or    wind+sound information is available to the mantis CNS by staging    encounters between free-flying mantises and bats in a large flight    room. The results will provide the first data on CNS responses of    an i nsect during an actual bat attack, and the first behavioral    assessment of CNS integration of wind and sound stimuli in insect    predator avoidance.",
