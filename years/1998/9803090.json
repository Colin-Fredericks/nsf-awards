 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of the project is to give a complete analysis of the local dynamics of a one-dimensional holomorphic map near an indifferent irrational fixed point which is nonlinearizable due to the existence of small divisors.  In particular, we want to understand the topological and metric structure of the invariant sets of the mapping (Siegel compacta) and its stability properties. This will entail sharp geometric estimates for analytic circle diffeomorphisms, tools which will be used to study the boundary of Siegel disks.  A long range objective of this research is to obtain a geometric theory of small divisors applicable to higher dimensional problems and a refinement of KAM theory.       The theory of dynamical systems studies the evolution of solutions of a system of differential equations describing a physical system.  It is of fundamental importance in applications to determine the future evolution of the physical system.  Probably the most important problem is the question of stability: Will the system have a stable evolution forever or it is going to break down at some moment?  This is a common concern for engineers building planes or other moving devices, as well as with more complex situations.  Mathematicians study the simplest problems to develop the tools to treat the more complex. The theory of small divisors is a fundamental tool in the study of stability in conservative situations, where some structure (a volume, a conformal structure, ...) is preserved.  This work involves the study of conformal maps in the plane, that is, maps that preserve angles.  In this case, there are classical small divisors theorems which guarantee stability properties.  A large part of this research is devoted to the situation where the tools of small divisors fail to prove stability and the development of weaker forms of stability in that situation.",
