 "awd_abstract_narration": "9807562  CELEBI    During the design/analysis process for engineered structures, it  has been  assumed that the foundation of a structure is fixed to a rigid  underlying  medium. In the last four decades, however, it has been recognized  that  soil-structure interaction alters the response characteristics of  a  structural system. In important engineered structures, detailed  numerical  and closed-form-solution methods are applied to perform soil-  structure  analyses. To date, the earthquake strong-motion data from  instrumented  buildings are insufficient to confirm the validity of the soil-  structure  interaction analysis methods and procedures as applied to  structures other  than nuclear power plants.    During the May 1997 meeting of the Panel on Wind and Seismic  Effects of the  United States Japan Natural Resources Development Program (UJNR)  held in  Tsukuba, Japan, it was decided to hold a workshop on Soil-  Structure  Interaction (SSI). The purpose of this action is to provide  partial support  for the organization this UJNR workshop, to be held in Menlo Park,  California, September 1998.    The workshop will bring together experts in the field from Japan  and the  United States to discuss various topics, including: (a) current  methods of  SSI used in design/analyses processes in both Japan and the United  States,  (b) recent researches that are being carried out, (c) experimental  SSI  research arrays and/or facilities developed and that are in the  process of  being developed and (d) searching for ways to cooperate on future  SSI  research.    The benefits of the workshop will be to exchange detailed  information and  data on SSI and to provide avenues for the development of new  cooperative  research between Japanese and US researchers.",
