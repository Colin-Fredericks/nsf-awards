 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our overall goal is to develop a system for massively  parallel manufacture of materials, from the molecular level  up, which contains integrated functional nanostructures  (FNS). The system is biomimetic and is based on self-  assembly of rigid, rod-shaped proteins. Useful protein rod  units are redesigned genetically from their natural DNA  segments and produced biologically. They will self-assemble  in regulated stages, to predesigned shapes, with spacings in  the range of 5-100nm in length. We call this process  biomolecular carpentry.    With this grant we will prove the concept by producing the  natural rods and variants thereof and measure physical  characteristics such as the Young's Moduli of bending and  stretching in various environments, using atomic force  microscopy and chemical force microscopy. We will also  measure the diffusion constants, flexibility dimensions and  orientation of the individual rods in aqueous solution and  in the presence of AC electric fields of various  frequencies. In addition, we will examine the kinetics of  self-assembly of sets of rods to find the rate constant(s)  of this process in various environments to better understand  the process and to maximize it. Dynamic light scattering  will be employed to enable us to measure these properties in  a noninvasive way and to follow the reaction in real time.    The technology using these protein units has the potential  to form a basis for an integrated system for the design and  manufacture of novel functional nanostructures built into  new types of material from the molecular level up. In  addition this technology, which should help to supplant some  other outmoded and polluting systems, is environmentally  friendly and its products are recyclable. To accomplish  these goals a team of principal investigators from  Departments of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Electro-  optics and Chemistry and Chemical Biology has been  organized.",
