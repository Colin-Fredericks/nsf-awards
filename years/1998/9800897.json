 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800897    Peckarsky    The abundance and community structure of freshwater invertebrates is often different in habitats with and without fish predators. Objectives of the proposed research are: 1) to test whether fish predators or some other physio-chemical property determines habitat suitability for two insect taxa in Rocky Mountain beaver ponds, 2) to examine if differences in habitat quality produce a source-sink dynamic, or, alternatively, if increased invertebrate densities in \"fishless\" patches are the results of selective recruitment, and 3) to determine if different habitats can largely be considered as isolated as in a situation for a metapopulation or if there is substantial movement among habitats. Proposed methodology will employ: 1) whole-pond manipulations of fish densities combined with physio-chemical characterization of ponds to determine the factor(s) that influence patch quality, 2) mesocosm and field experiments to determine dispersal behavior and fitness in each habitat type, 3) field surveys of insect and fish densities and  oviposition rates in the two habitat types to test for the occurrence source-sink dynamics, and 4) a stable-isotope addition experiment to determine patterns of dispersal. Key contributions include an empirical test of source-sink models and examination of how dispersal interacts with processes in a patch to determine the dynamics of a population at a regional scale.",
