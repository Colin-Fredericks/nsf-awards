 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706720  Mitchell    This research involves the mapping of attenuative dispersion  along paths through the source zone of New Madrid earthquakes as  well as along paths outside of, but contiguous to, that zone.  Both theoretical and observational research has shown that waves  which have been attenuated by either intrinsic anelasticity or by  scattering processes also exhibit dispersion.  Attenuative  dispersion associated with regional seismic phases has been found  to be easily measurable in regions where those phases attenuate  rapidly with distance.  Abundant amounts of data obtained from  PANDA stations, as well as from USNSN stations, in and  surrounding the New Madrid seismic zone should be available for  these studies.  Relating the variation of Q to the properties of  the crust may provide new information on earthquake processes in  the New Madrid region.  This research is a component of the  National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***",
