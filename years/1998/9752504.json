 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biocomputing is a newly emerging interdisciplinary field which uses computational methods to analyze the fast-growing biological data.  As biological information continues to increase, there is certainly an increasing demand for biocomputing experts by industry and academia at all levels, from senior scientists with a Ph. D. degree to laboratory scientists with MS or B.S. degrees.  Currently, however, there are too few scientists who possess such cross-disciplinary skills in both biology and computer science to meet such demand. Therefore, this project is proposed to address this urgent problem. The overall goal of this project is to introduce biocomputing into the first two years of the undergraduate curriculum and to prepare undergraduate students for pursuing biocomputing-related careers. To help accomplish this goal, a new course entitled Introduction to Biocomputing is being developed.  The course format consists of core lectures, laboratory practices, group discussion, and a course project.  These components of the new course are carefully designed to promote student academic interest and success in the field of biocomputing.  A textbook and laboratory manual needed for the course, are also being prepared. The effort is being evaluated by an independent evaluator.  To aid dissemination, a virtual on-line course is being designed and provided on the World Wide Web.",
