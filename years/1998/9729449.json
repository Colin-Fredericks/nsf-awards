 "awd_abstract_narration": "Differences between men's and women's social and political attitudes were widely discussed in the press during the 1996 presidential election campaign because of the so-called gender gap in presidential candidate preference. As many journalists maintained, these differences in presidential preference likely reflect more general attitudinal differences between the sexes. For example, women tend to be more favorable toward welfare and other `compassion` issues, whereas men tend to be more supportive of the use of force in a wide range of situations. To understand these and other attitudinal sex differences, this research will examine the structure of these attitudes. Specifically, men's and women's attitudes should be differently elaborated, with more extensive beliefs underlying those attitudes that are typical of one's sex. Also, the attitudes typical of people of each sex should be linked to broader ideologies and values that also tend to differ between women and men. This research will examine these ideologies and values as causes of the attitudinal gender gap and also consider other potential causes including personality differences between the sexes and the advantages that policies are thought to produce for oneself and one's gender group. These causal factors should reflect in turn the differing responsibilities of women and men in family and occupational roles. Finally, research will examine how people perceive the attitudinal gender gap and whether their beliefs about it are accurate. In its focus on attitudes, this research will investigate an aspect of gender that has been little explored by psychologists. The findings should help policy makers understand why women and men often differ in their policy preferences and sometimes in their preferences for candidates for political office.",
