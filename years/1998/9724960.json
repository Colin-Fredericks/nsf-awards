 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program provides continued support for research on weakly coordinating   anions by Dr. Christopher A. Reed, Chemistry Department, University of   Southern California.  The goal of the project is to develop the chemistry   of carborane anions based on the icosahedral CB(11)H(12) anion.  The   anion will be functionalized, typically with halogens, to make it as   inert as possible to coordination with a cation.  Some synthetic work   with fullerenes is also proposed.  The basicity and redox properties of   the resulting species will be determined and compared with those of known   weakly coordinating anions.  New spectroscopic and electrochemical   methodswill be used to rank anion basicity.  The anions developed will be   used to carry out a magnetochemical investigation of an iron compound to   determine the extreme magnetic parameters for the S = 3/2 spin state.    New extremes of electrophilicity, coordinative unsaturation, oxidation   potential and electrolyte behavior are expected to be observed.   Negatively charged species (anions) usually associate tightly with   species bearing a positive charge (cations).  By preparing anions whose   shape and charge distribution prevents them from closely associating with   cations, highly reactive cations result.   Development of this chemistry   has implications for numerous chemical processes, including cationic   polymerization and battery technology.  It could lead to new chemical   reagents for use in synthesis and excellent catalysts.",
