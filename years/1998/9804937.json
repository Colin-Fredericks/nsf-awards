Since its inception in 1983, this now biennial conference has brought together American and   foreign investigators from a variety of disciplines to discuss current studies on this organism.   Chlamydomonas has been a favorite model organism to study such topics as cell motility,   organelle heredity, gamete differentiation, cell adhesion, signal transduction, and cell fusion.    Although Chlamydomonas investigators individually attend many other conferences, this   conference is the only meeting that brings together most of these investigators to focus on the   specific biological questions of their shared interest.  Interactions among these scientists at this   meeting, as in the past, should be particularly useful in providing rapid dissemination of new   information, technological breakthroughs, and developing, widely applicable methodologies.    The conference is also likely to be important in establishing fruitful collaborations and for the   exchange of mutants and molecular probes which should promote the rapid advance of research   on this organism.  Furthermore, the conference will provide an invaluable opportunity for   students and young investigators who attend to share in the excitement and new knowledge in   this field.  To promote this last aim, the award will be used specifically to support the attendance   of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and needy young faculty.",
