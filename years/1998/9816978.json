 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9816978  Blucher  The exploratory research is a plan to determine the feasibility of a newly discovered novel metal matrix composite (MMC) processing method for continuous fiber.  The aim is to investigate the implications of the interface reactions for various materials and size combinations of fibers studied. Test equipment will be designed and built to determine reliable viscosity, surface tension and friction data on the molten matrix materials in combination with the fibers as they are processed through orifices with special geometries.   This information is necessary for the modeling of the process. The influence of the fiber surface structure on the infiltration and interface formation will be studied and related to the mechanical properties of the composite. This experimental work will proof out the feasibility of a new method of controlled continuous fiber MMC production. This SGER has high potential for future industrial commercialization for the production of MMCs that can meet specific mechanical property requirements, if the designed orifice technique proves viable. It is expected that if successful, the data gathered and the preliminary model developed will advance the knowledge of MMCs and will lead to further process optimization.",
