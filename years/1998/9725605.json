The exhibit will consist of a set of twelve interactive exhibit stations presenting design tasks from various fields of engineering related to the human needs of a hypothetical community called \"Tech City.\"  The tasks will use engineering as an iterative process to meet design goals (e.g. building a structure strong enough to withstand an earthquake) while faced with constraints (e.g. a limited budget.)  The primary audience will be youth in their late elementary and middle school years with a specific emphasis on women and other groups traditionally underrepresented in engineering.  A broad menu of complementary activities will be developed that includes a hands-on program for visiting school groups, a teacher training technology unit, career speakers' bureau, \"Engineering Day at the Mall\" program, and activities especially created for families.  The Association of Science and Technology Centers will manage the national tour of the exhibit.  It is schedule to circulate for three years and reach an estimated one million individuals.",
