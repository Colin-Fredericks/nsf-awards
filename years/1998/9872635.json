 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n    Investment in crop genomic science is justified by the existence of genus, species and cultivar specific genes with no known function. A subgroup, within this group of genes, is expected to be genes of agronomic and economic importance such as disease resistance genes,  major yield determinates and genes that produce specific chemicals and components. Identification of members of the economically important gene subgroup has been painstakingly slow by conventional genetics and preliminary genomics. \r\n     The continuously enhanced productivity and international competitiveness of the US soybean crop will depend on applications of biotechnologies in genetic improvement Proposed is the development of a physical map of the soybean genome to accelerate the rate of economically important gene discovery 10-100 fold; to provide a framework for EST mapping; and to provide for the future sequencing of the whole soybean genome. \r\n\r\nMethods: \r\nThe primary method for physical map construction will be a modified restriction enzyme based polyacrylamide (sequencing) gel based fingerprinting (PAGFP) that enables the identification of overlapping BAC clones to form contigs. Microsattellite markers will be integrated with the contigs by DNA pool assembly and screening. Some gaps in the basic contig map (1-2 hundred from 2-5 thousand) will be filled by improving fingerprinting methods, developing microsattelite anchors from end-BACs or DNA sequencing of BAC end clones. Some RFLPs and ESTs will be hybridized  with contigs and anchored genomic regions. Some microsatellite, RFLP and EST anchored clones from other cultivars will be fingerprinted. Duplicated markers in separate contigs will identify homeologous regions of the soybean genome at high resolution.\r\n\r\nPotential Impact: \r\nThe proposed research will provide all soybean researchers with a powerful tool to:\r\no\tIsolate the mapped genes and QTLs important to soybean production,\r\no\tIsolate DNA markers for genes and QTLs that are well-suited for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in soybean breeding, \r\no\tMap most (80%) of the soybean  ESTs at a resolution of 200 - 2,000 kb within a few years.\r\no  Develop soybean genome chips with arrayed linkage groups from the mapped genes and contigs.\r\nThe ultimate goal is to significantly accelerate discovery, cloning, manipulation, and utilization of soybean genes and QTLs of agronomic importance for genetic improvement and agricultural production. Thereby, the profitability of the US soybean industry will be protected. \r\n\r\nDeliverables:\r\n1.   Fingerprint three soybean BAC libraries of 90-120 thousand BACs, equivalent to 12-16 x soybean haploid genomes (including 45-60 thousand BIBACs that are capable of direct complementation by soybean transformation) to form 2-5 thousand contiguous genomic regions (hereafter, contigs).\r\n2.  Integrate the BAC contigs with 500-1,000 microsattelite markers from the soybean molecular genetic map by PCR amplification or hybridization.\r\n3.  Test methods for assembling the fingerprinted BACs into the physical map contigs, analyze methods for gap filling and contig verification.\r\n4. Test the utilility of the contigs for identifying homeologous genomic regions of the duplicated \tsoybean genome and for the assignment of EST families to genomic regions . \r\n5.  Provide soybean researchers with electronic access to BAC clones encompassing regions likely to \tcontain genes and QTL of agronomic importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact Information:\r\nFor Contigs (mirror sites):\r\nhttp://www.siuc.edu/~pbgc/htmls/link.htm and\r\nhttp://hbz7.tamu.edu/homelinks/phymap/soybean/soy_home.htm\r\nhttp://www.siuc.edu/~meksem/htmls/link.htm\r\n\r\nFor Web FPC:\r\nhttp://hbz7.tamu.edu/homelinks/phymap/soybean/soy_home.htm\r\n\r\nFor the DAS enabled Soybean Genome Browser:\r\nhttp://www.siuc.edu/soybeangenome.info\r\nhttp://www.langin.com/soybean/gbrowse?source=soybean;name=A1\r\n\r\n\r\n",
