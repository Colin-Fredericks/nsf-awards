 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves a two part project to study a number of environmental policies to assess how these policies interact with pre existing distortions. First,  general equilibrium models of the economy with consumers, producers, factors of production, and government are constructed under various assumptions about market structure, tax instruments, and environmental policies. Second, an empirical analysis of production is undertaken in which pollution is treated as an input to production. In particular, the researcher focuses on measuring the elasticity of substitution between pollution and other inputs in production.  The first part will assess the importance of pre existing tax distortions in designing optimal movements from an unregulated environment towards reduced environmental emissions. It will also investigate the design of optimal policies in this second best world. The modeling approach used is quite flexible and allows for a variety of emissions technologies in production. In addition the importance of market structure is investigated in designing environmental policy. An important feature is the possibility of monopoly production of one or more goods in the economy. Many of the insights developed in the initial modeling have application in other areas of economics. In particular, the analysis   is extended to consider issues associated with second best pricing of common access goods (e.g. frequency bandwidths for radio, television, and cellular telephones) and of excludable public goods (e.g. a national park).  In the second part, production technologies are investigated empirically. Pollution is treated as an input to production which, thereby, measures the effect of pollution policies on the demand for other inputs such as capital, labor, energy, and other materials. This is done using micro level data from the Bureau of the Census Longitudinal Research Database along with two possible sources of micro level emissions data from the Environmental Protection Agency. With data aggregated to firm or state levels, cost functions are estimated using a flexible functional form. Also, the elasticity of substitution between purchased inputs and pollution is estimated.",
