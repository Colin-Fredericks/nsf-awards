 "awd_abstract_narration": "9808849  Kas     Eukaryotic cells reversibly assemble actin subunits into filaments which in the cortex of cells are often arrayed in an extensive three-dimensional network.  Cortical actin confers elasticity to the cell, although how molecular and intermolecular interactions among individual actin filaments influence this is not fully understood.  Previous research on solutions of reconstituted actin filaments in solution and in gels has led to conflicting results since molecular arrangements and interactions were not well defined.  The proposed research attempts to overcome these problems with two novel approaches.  For the first approach, measurements of the elasticity of actin networks in vitro will be correlated with the microscopic organization of individual actin filaments in these networks.  These properties will be investigated for actin networks that differ in the length of the actin filaments and in the degree to which they are cross-linked by various accessory proteins normally found as part of these networks in living cells.  In addition, the role of myosin as a dynamic cross-linker that could influence elasticity of these networks will be examined.  For the second approach, measurements of the elasticity of the cortical actin cytoskeleton of living cells will be correlated with whole cell elasticity.  These measurements will be made on various cells grown in culture that differ with respect to the extent of their cortical actin cytoskeleton.  Two novel instruments have been developed to achieve the aims of this project.  For the in vitro studies, a rheometer to measure macroscopic elasticity has been integrated with a fluorescence microscope to visualize single filaments.  For the experiments on living cells, a new optical tool has been designed and built which uses a dual-beam laser to stretch individual cells without harming them in order to measure their elastic forces.  Experimental measurements from both approaches will be used to test and refine recent theoretical models of a ctin filament dynamics.  The studies are expected to have wide applicability for our understanding of actin cytoskeletons under a wide variety of conditions in many cells.",
