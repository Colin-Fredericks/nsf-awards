 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in theoretical elementary particle physics  will include analyses of possible Higgs particle signals at  future colliders, studies of the interactions between  photons and neutrinos in situations of astrophysical  interest, and investigations of the utility and validity of  `effective field theories` intended for the simplified  treatment of low-energy reactions.  The Higgs particles are  related to the genesis of mass, and their number, as well as  their relative masses and charges, must be determined in  order to fully understand the origin of mass and the  underlying symmetry of elementary particle theory.  Photons  and neutrinos only interact appreciably under extreme  conditions such as those found in the early universe or in  compact astrophysical objects.  It is important to determine  if this interaction alters our view of such things as the  relic neutrinos in cosmology or the way in which heavy  objects loose energy.  Since effective field theories  provide a convenient description of the low energy behavior  of many processes, it is essential to check them against  exact theories which are accurate at all energies.",
