The funds will be used to cover travel and local expenses of the principal speakers as well as to support travel and local expenses of  other participants. The meeting will focus mainly on Fourier and oscillatory  integral operators, singular Radon transforms, oscillatory integrals, and their applications to partial differential  equations.\r\n\r\nHarmonic analysis, the subject of this conference, has historically had and continues to have a major impact in various areas of mathematics and its applications. Its methods have been applied in partial differential equations, probability, complex analysis, mathematical physics, and integral geometry. Harmonic analysis has also had a crucial role to play in the dramatic developments that recent years have witnessed in such concrete areas as numerical analysis, tomography, and image processing.\r\n",
