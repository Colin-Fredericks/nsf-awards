 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Frantisek Turecek, of the Department of Chemistry at the   University of Washington, is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular   Chemistry Program for his studies of the formation and properties of   transient intermediates in chemical reactions in the gas phase.    Molecules and radicals of sulfur oxyacids and nitroalkane radicals   relevant to tropospheric oxidations, and intermediates in the addition of   hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl radicals to nucleic bases, are generated by   fast neutralization of cations and anions and studied by   neutralization-reionization mass spectrometry.  These studies, combined   with complementary ab initio, density-functional theory, and RRKM   calculations, address the stabilities of these transient intermediates in   their ground and excited states and permit the analysis of their   energetics and the kinetics of their unimolecular dissociation.  Chemical reactions often proceed by consecutive elementary steps, each   generating a transient and reactive intermediate.  Characterization of   such intermediates represents a formidable experimental challenge given   their typically short lifetimes and low concentrations.  An especially   challenging class of transient intermediates to study is comprised of   those formed by high-energy processes such as those that occur in the   stratosphere and troposphere, in combustion, and in radiolysis by   ionizing radiation.  With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular   Chemistry Program, Professor Frantisek Turecek, of the Department of   Chemistry at the University of Washington, studies the formation and   properties of transient intermediates in chemical reactions in the gas   phase.  Professor Turecek uses neutralization-reionization mass   spectrometry, a `non-chemical` technique, for the production of the   desired intermediates from simple precursor ions, avoiding the structural   ambiguities which can result from their attempted production by other   means.  These studies, complemented by computational analyses, address   the stabilities and reactivity of these transient intermediates, shedding   light on the fundamental events which occur during high-energy processes.",
