 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolution was a central and guiding principal in the early days of what is regarded as the modern biological sciences. However as investigations in biology became ever more reductionist in their approach this focus was, to a large extent, lost. Indeed in the early part of this century the fields of development and genetics, the two underlying forces of evolution, went their separate ways and evolutionary considerations in these two fields were largely ignored.  Recent advances in both genetics and developmental biology have produced a renewed interest in evolution because researchers now have at hand the necessary tools to ask and more importantly answer critical questions. Scientists now have a firm picture of the molecular structure of eukaryotic genes and how they are regulated. Moreover, the burgeoning field of Developmental Genetics has provided real insights into the way in which genes control the ontogenic process. But perhaps the most significant finding of the last 10 to 15 years is that the genes utilized to regulate development are very highly conserved across a very wide phylogenetic spectrum.  Thus scientists have been driven to a new perspective of the evolutionary process and must ask \"How is it that the same underlying molecular machinery can result in such a broad spectrum of morphologies\".  On the face of it this question appears rather daunting, however as noted above the tools are available to actually gain real insights into the underlying mechanism of morphological change, and it is this possibility that provides the rationale for the proposed workshop on \"Evolution and Development.\" It is proposed that \"experts in the field\" be brought together and have them present what is ongoing in their laboratories. This should help to define the current status of the field scientifically. The second task of the workshop will be to try to gain some insight into where research is or should be heading. While it is always difficult to predict the future it is hoped that the selected group of scientists will be able to provide their views in this area and that a consensus can be achieved.",
