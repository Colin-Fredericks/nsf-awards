 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern techniques of plant identification via computer based expert systems can enrich undergraduate students' comprehension of the species concept by exposing them to the total breadth of seasonal morphological variation within plant taxa irrespective of the season in which they conduct their studies and actively engage them in inquiry based study of variation of character states within and between plant taxa as they contribute to the expansion and development of these expert systems. Such richness is lacking from our current pedagogical practices which primarily utilize season specific paper based dichotomous keys for training students in field based plant identification. Dichotomous keys are not conducive to inquiry based study of plant taxa because of the relative difficulty associated with their expansion and modification. The structure of computer based expert systems on the other hand are very conducive to contributions and development by student engaged in inquiry based activities. Specific objectives of this proposal are to: 1. Modernize the plant taxonomy curriculum by replacing paper based dichotomous plant identification keys with CD-ROM based multi-access plant identification expert systems. 2. Enrich the educational experience of students by encouraging them to develop an understanding of the nature of scientific inquiry as it relates to taxonomic decisions as they contribute to the continual refinement and expansion of the plant expert system data bases. 3. Develop students' process skills in the practical nature of hypothesis formulation and testing, with particular emphasis on the statistical techniques used in taxonomy. 4. Develop group learning and group responsibility skills and techniques. 5. Improve instructional effectiveness by engaging undergraduates in the creation and development of expert systems which will require utilization of their newly/simultaneously acquired knowledge and skills of plant taxonomy into a format that is both self reinforcing and beneficial to f uture students and the public at large. 6. Test the effectiveness of this method of learning compared to current pedagogical practices. Preliminary results from the ongoing Miami University Dendrology Expert System pilot project indicate that these objectives can be met by the proposed modification of our plant taxonomy curriculum.",
