 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Minority Starter Grant is on mechanisms underlying the  function of biological clocks.  Periodic timing of behavior is  often regulated by cellular activity that is considered to act as  a biological clock.  Recent work has identified some of the  proteins that are released as components of the timing mechanism,  but it remains unclear how these proteins exert their effects on  target cells elsewhere.  This project uses a system of cultured  tissue isolated from the fruitfly, Drosophila, which allows the  potential for powerful genetic analysis of physiological  mechanisms.  Biochemical analyses are used to identify the timing  of protein secretions and hormone secretions from this tissue.  Results will show how molecular rhythms of clock gene expression  can result in timed behavior patterns.     This independent research follows NSF postdoctoral support, and  will have a high impact on giving the PI a significant early boost  to her career.  This work also is likely to have an impact on both  neuroscience and endocrinology in further understanding the  cellular mechanisms that link brain and hormonal secretions.",
