 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to develop an urban groundwater laboratory at Queens College that will infuse modern technology and a hands-on problem-solving approach throughout the Geology Department's curricula. The beneficiaries of this initiative will be undergraduate Geology, Geoscience Education, Environmental Science, and Environmental Studies majors and a total of nearly 2000 students per year who enroll in departmental course offerings.  The urban groundwater laboratory will have several components. The centerpiece will be a network of six wells drilled into the Upper Glacial Aquifer that underlies our campus. In addition, there will be manual and digital field equipment for monitoring selected components of the hydrologic cycle, for measuring aquifer properties, and for conducting subsurface tracer tests. A set of computers will be used to interpret field data and access data from nearby weather stations.  Students will be involved at all stages of the development of the groundwater monitoring network. They will work with the driller to log the wells, to collect sediment samples, and to learn well-development procedures. Once the wells are installed, they will use associated field equipment and computers for a variety of experiments including monitoring climatic conditions, soil moisture and water table response to recharge events. Students will evaluate aquifer properties by conducting pump and slug tests, and obtain water samples for analysis in departmental laboratories. The hands- on experience gained by the students will be invaluable for those who enter the environmental consulting sector, and give all students first-hand knowledge of groundwater flow and subsurface transport. These projects using modern equipment and computers will replace current paper-based exercises, and will be a major improvement in pedagogy in courses at all levels of the curriculum.",
