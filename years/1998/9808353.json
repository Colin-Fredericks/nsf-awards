The  role of the olivocerebellar  system  in  cerebellar  functioning has been the subject of many  debates  and  several hypotheses. In order for the field to move forward  it  is  necessary  to  determine  which of these hypotheses,  if  any,  is  correct.  The proposed experiments will provide critical tests  of  the  assumptions  underlying  two  of  these  hypotheses  for  the  function  of the olivocerebellar system, namely the proposal  that  the  olivocerebellar  system acts as a  timing  device  for  motor  coordination  and the idea that it functions as  a  comparator  of  intended and actual movements.         The   motor  cortex  and  olivocerebellar  systems  are  both  critical  for  motor  control.  As such  their  activity  must  be  coordinated.  Yet most studies focus on the role  of  one  or  the  other.  The present experiments address this relatively  unstudied  question  of how these two motor systems interact by investigating  the  response  of  the olivocerebellar system  to  motor  cortical  activity  and the pathways that mediate these responses. In  doing  so  they  may  alter our conception of the how  the  motor  cortex  functions. Currently motor cortex control of movements is  thought  to be exerted primarily via the corticospinal pathway, despite the  fact  that  this pathway represents only a minority of  the  total  motor  cortical output. The experiments here begin to  investigate  the  significance of the other motor cortical outputs by  studying  how  the  motor  cortex  influences  the  olivocerebellar  system.  Understanding  the  function  of the cortico-olivocerebellar  axis  represents a step toward a more complete view of the motor cortex,  one  in  which the motor cortex is not viewed as simply  the  last   processing  stage of the motor command before leaving  the  brain,  but  rather  as  one of a series of interconnected  regions  whose  integrated activity underlies motor coordination.",
