 "awd_abstract_narration": "The numerical solution of large sparse linear algebraic equations\r\nrepresents a very significant portion of scientific computing.\r\nSuch linear systems arise from the discretization of partial\r\ndifferential equations as well as in many other contexts, such as\r\nthe numerical solution of nonlinear equations and optimization\r\nproblems. Over the past two decades, significant progress has\r\nbeen made in the development and analysis of iterative Krylov\r\nsubspace methods.  This project will address a number of theoretical\r\nand practical issues associated with the use of Krylov space\r\nmethods for solving linear systems.\r\n\r\nOne of the large remaining open problems in this field is the \r\ndevelopment of a clear method of choice for nonsymmetric problems.\r\nAnalysis of nonsymmetric Krylov space methods will be a component\r\nof this project.  It is also important to understand the effect of\r\nrounding errors on the performance of both symmetric and nonsymmetric\r\niterative methods and this topic will also be addressed.  Finally,\r\nfrom a practical point of view, it is most often the preconditioner\r\nthat has the greatest effect on the performance of an iterative \r\nmethod.  Ideas developed in this research will be applied in \r\nproblems involving neutron transport and ground-water flow simulation\r\nto test their practicality.  Parallelism will be a consideration\r\nin all of the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
