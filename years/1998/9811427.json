 "awd_abstract_narration": "9811427  Felbeck  Deception Island is a flooded caldera in the South Shetland  Islands, Antarctica.  The most recent eruption was in the  1970s causing the formation of new islands in the caldera  and various other structures.  It harbors many hot springs  and fumaroles submerged in the caldera and intertidally.  Sulfide and methane are prominent chemicals in the  outflowing waters.  Bacterial densities in the caldera reach  unusually high values probably due to the input of reduced  chemicals as energy sources.  The environment around the  springs resembles that found at hydrothermal vents where  whole communities are based on the input of chemical energy  by the hot waters.  Similarities to hydrothermal vent  environments include cold waters surrounding the hot springs  resulting in large distances to the next warm water habitat  and a lack of external food sources.  The latter is due to  ice cover during winter at Deception Island and the large  distance to the euphotic zone at the vent sites.  These  parameters encourage the evolution of alternative ways to  support life such as the establishment of a bacterial  symbiosis.  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research  project will focus on an examination of the warm springs  around Deception Island for the presence of marine  invertebrates with chemoautotrophic symbionts.  Maps will be  made of any submerged fumaroles and of warm and hot springs  in the intertidal zone.  If animals are found near the  fumaroles or in the hot springs, specimens will be  collected.  Collected specimens will be examined for the  presence of chemoautotrophic bacteria and other adaptations  to a hot sulfide- and methane-rich environment using enzyme  text experimental incubations to analyze metabolic pathways  and microscopic examination.",
