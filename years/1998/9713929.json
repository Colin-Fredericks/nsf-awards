 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of the Chemistry Division, Jackson will use crossed molecular beams to   measure electron energy distributions from delayed ionization of   fullerene metastable states as well as to study scattering between   fullerenes and metastable atoms.  Insight will be gathered on delayed   ionization processes in clusters, large molecules, and systems of   restricted size as well as on the formation of endohedral fullerenes, an   important problem in physical as well as organic chemistry.    Fullerenes comprise a class of chemical carbon compounds in which the   locations of the carbon atoms define a nearly spherically shaped geodesic   surface.  The 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the   discoverers of this new form of elemental carbon.  The generic term   `fullerene` now commonly refers both to atomic clusters of carbon atoms   located at the corners of pentagons and hexagons forming a closed surface   as well as to tubular structures, irrespective of the actual numbers of   composing atoms.  Fullerenes are found to be unusually stable and, even   though originally thought to be rare in nature, can actually be easily   made.  Due to the potential of technological applications, fullerenes are   the subject of intense investigations of their physical, chemical, and   material properties.  Their chemical reactivities are not well understood   and the purpose of this fundamental research project is to contribute to   the knowledge base of these systems and thereby help in their eventual   exploitation for technological applications.",
