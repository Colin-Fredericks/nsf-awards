These include polymer  brushes, whcih are employed in stabilizing emulsions and  dispersions.  A brush is produced when a polymer with a surface-  seeking end group or block is exposed to a solid-liquid or liquid-  solid interface.  Typical brush-forming macromolecules include  polyelectrolyte diblock copolymers, where a short hydrophobic  block drives the polymer to the surface from aqueous solution.  Since the hydrophilic, brush-forming segment of the molecules is  a polyelectrolyte, the conformation of the brush will be a strong  function of the nature and concentration of the counterion.  Since brushes will be exposed to a variety of ions when they are  applied to stabilizing dispersions, it is essential to determine  the effect of these ions on brush adsorption.  Focusing in  particular on the liquid/liquid interface - rarely studied yet  quite pervasive - brushes will be produced here using  radiolabeled polyelectrolytes.  The label permits accurate in  situ determination of the amount of polymer adsorbed to the  interface.  Using a suite of recently-developed radiometric  techniques, the surface coverage will be evaluated in the  presence of monovalent and divalent counterions, as well as other  charged polymers.  Questions of a fundamental nature that will be  addressed include whether the polymer is adsorbed in the  thermodynamically reversible, or irreversible (kinetic limited)  mode.  This project will also focus on ultrathin polymer films  made from the layer-by-layer deposition of alternately charged  polyelectrolytes.  These newly-discovered polyelectrolyte  structures are straightforward to prepare and have potential  applications as thin film conductors, light-emitting layers and  bioactive (enzyme-containing) thin films.  The mechanism by which  charge is balanced and distributed within these films is not  underst ood.  In the proposed work, the charge within the  multilayer films will be probed using radiolabeled counterions.  Conditions for producing multilayers with a range of counterion  concentrations will be established using novel electrochemically  active polyelectrolytes as building blocks.  These polyviologens  will be synthesized by a new method and will be tested for  application as electrochromic and electrocatalytic thin films.  %%%  This project will enhance our understanding of polyelectrolyte  multilayers, thin films, and interfaces, which have important  implications to colloids, adhesion, lubrication, and surface  science.  ***",
