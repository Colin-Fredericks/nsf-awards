The Departments of Computer Science and Astrophysics at Princeton University will purchase equipment for high performance graphics and for outputting of high resolution graphics in various formats (video, hardcopy and slides). The equipment will be used for several research projects, including in particular:  (1) work in walkthroughs of buildings and cities, (2) visualization of scientific data and (3) digital techniques in multimedia.  The equipment requested will be used by faculty, graduate students and undergraduates in both computer science and astrophysics to support individual  and cross-disciplinary research projects. An important consequence of the proposed projects is that they not only enhance the current faculty and student research and education but they also act as a catalyst for new collaborations between these two departments and other related science and engineering departments at Princeton.  The synergy created will thus make the whole significantly greater than the sum of the parts.",
