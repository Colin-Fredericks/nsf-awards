 "awd_abstract_narration": "DEB 9806779  DeVries     Resolving the higher level phylogeny of the diverse family  Nymphalidae is one of the most controversial problems in butterfly  systematics.  Independent of the type of data used (morphological or DNA  sequence) previous studies on the Nymphalidae have produced conflicting or  poorly resolved trees, possibly the result of inadequate taxon sampling.  Our work seeks to overcome this limitation through examining a large number  of species within four closely related nymphalid subfamilies, and using a  combination of early stage and adult characters.  By employing these two  protocols our study will be set apart from all previous systematic research  on this group.          A complementary objective of our higher level study involves a  phylogenetic study of the neotropical genus Morpho, obvious components of  all neotropical forests and well known to entomologists and the general  public.  Nevertheless, our ecological and evolutionary understanding of  these butterflies has been impeded by the lack of a well resolved  phylogeny, something that our work seeks to rectify.          To construct phylogenies for nymphalid subfamilies and the genus  Morpho, parsimony methods will be used to analyze data for early stages and  adults.  By including different hierarchical levels in our analyses  (species to subfamily), it will be possible to assess variation within each  character, and therefore our study will constitute the most complete  evaluation of character divergence ever performed for these nymphalid  subfamilies.  Preliminary results show the feasibility of our proposed  higher level and species level studies, and our results will make a  significant contribution toward understanding one of the best known  butterfly families.",
