 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project aims to shed some light on the basic  architecture and processes responsible for producing sentences.  More specifically, it is concerned with the processes involved in  the construction of a syntactic frame for a to-be-uttered sentence.  The three issues the project deals with are: (i) the input that the  language production system receives from the conceptual system;  (ii) the mechanisms responsible for building a syntactic structure  for a sentence; and (iii) the possibility to find feedback from the  processes responsible to build a phonological frame for the  sentence to the processes responsible for its syntactic encoding.  In a series of 19 experiments, speakers of Italian, French and  Spanish are required to produce completions for sentential  preambles or to rephrase sentences. The dependent variables in  these experiments are the proportions of agreement errors, between  the subject and the verb, the object and the verb (e.g., \"The time  for fun and games are over\"), in Italian, French and Spanish; or  the proportions of subject-predicate gender agreement errors in  Italian and French. The rationale for using agreement to address  the issues presented above is the fact that agreement can be  considered as a tool of the language system for expressing  conceptual relations through syntactic relations, that are then  translated into morpho-phonological regularities in the language.       The pursuit of these three interrelated research lines in a  period of three years will allow us to foster our understanding  of the processes involved in transforming a message into a  syntactically well-formed sentence, in real time. The Romance  languages targeted in the project provide not only a way to test  a number of hypotheses, but they also provide us with a tool to  explore phenomena that until now have not been addressed in the  psycholinguistic literature, such as the computation of gender  agreement, and object-participle agreement during production.",
