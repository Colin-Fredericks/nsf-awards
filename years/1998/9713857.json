 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9713857  J. Hoyt  A flow tracer suitable for turbulent flow visualization has been developed and tested by the P.I. for two-dimensional flows.  The tracer, composed of  shear-thickening and high extensional viscosity fluids, does not diffuse when the flow becomes turbulent like the previously used tracers do.  The extension of the visualization method to three-dimensional flows, with application to coherent structures in turbulent boundary layer, is proposed.  The new approach provides simultaneous viewing the flow three directions (called 3-D+), that allows for easier identification of the flow structures as projected on three different planes (side, top, and frontal to the flow direction).   The preliminary results on \"horseshoe\" vortices and large organized structures are very promising.  The experimental work will be performed in collaboration with Prof.  R.H.J. Sellin of the University of Bristol, where experimental facilities are prepared.    The method is expected to provide new insights into understanding and modeling of the spatial turbulent structures, including shear flows and wake flows.  The application of the technique to other complex flow, such as dispersion flows, sediment transport, turbomachinery, and for educational purposes also is envisaged.    ***",
