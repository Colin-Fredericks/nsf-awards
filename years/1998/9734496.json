 "awd_abstract_narration": "9734496  Good  This career program has two goals: (1) to further the  development of the study of biomedical engineering within  the chemical engineering discipline; and (2) to form a  partnership with secondary schools in the region to both  enhance the science skills of the teachers within those  schools and to increase the awareness by teachers of career  possibilities in engineering.  To meet the first goal, one  research project is to investigate the role of protein  aggregation in the mechanism of transmissible spongiform  encephalopathies.  An undergraduate and graduate course  under development is to use material obtained from this  project as well as other ongoing research projects.  To meet  the second goal, a four year project is to bring 24  secondary school science teachers to Texas A&M for an annual  five week teacher enhancement program.  Teachers are to  visit several manufacturing facilities and remediation sites  within Texas where engineering is practiced and attended  seminars on engineering career opportunities and engineering  research programs.  ***",
