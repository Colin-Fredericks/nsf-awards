The spin-off of the project will be to  identify  new thermoelectric materials for high-temperature  applications.  The project is a widely collaborative one, it  involves experts from several areas to study structure-  chemistry-property relationships.  The principal  investigator will carry out synthesis and structural  characterization of alloys, measurements of conductivity,  specific heat, Hall effect, and thermopower.  Other  collaborators will utilize optical conductivity, x-ray  spectroscopy, electron tunneling, and nuclear magnetic  resonance to probe electronic structure.  Effects of  structure on properties will be studied by advanced electron  microscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.  %%%  Physicists and materials scientists are interested in  unusual crystal structures because unusual atomic  arrangements in solids provide new challenges for  understanding organization and order in nature.  Equally  important, unusual physical properties are expected to be  seen in novel materials.  Our research project focuses on  comprehensive study and further exploration of electronic  properties of metallic alloys including those that exhibit  noncrystalline structures, known  as quasicrystals.  The  project is a widely collaborative one, involving several  groups world-wide to contribute to a variety of experimental  measurements.  It has been shown that some of the titled  alloy compounds based on metals can become nonmetals,  several of them even exhibit electronic phenomena similar to  those observed in semiconductors such as silicon and  germanium.  The re are indications that the new alloys are  potentially good thermoelectric materials.  ***",
