 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research addresses a recent debate about the precise timing of the debut of maize cultivation in the tropical lowlands of Veracruz, Mexico.  The conventional history, which asserts a date of approximately 3500 BP, is based on radiocarbon ages of macrofossils and bulk materials.  This history has been questioned recently because of methodological uncertainties and because of contradictory dates on domesticated squash that indicate ages of up to 9500 BP.  Accelerator-mass-spectrometer dating of pollen versus non-pollen organics contained in sediment layers corresponding to the deepest location of maize pollen will allow testing of two hypotheses pertaining to earliest age of maize domestication in this region and to the viability of the proposed methodology.  The broader context for this research lies in the question of whether sedentism preceded plant domestication in the New World (as in the Fertile Crescent) and the implications for theories of social and ecological change.  Contributions to our understanding of  the genetic origins of maize and the inter-relationships of the surviving germ plasm are also likely.",
