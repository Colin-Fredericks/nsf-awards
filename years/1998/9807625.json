 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anderson is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to   continue his studies of reactions of small polyatomic ions containing   from three to about fifteen atoms by mode-selected differential   scattering methods, using a high-resolution guided-ion beam scattering   instrument.  The goal is both to probe detailed reaction mechanisms for   these complex systems, and to provide insight into the effects of   different types of reactant nuclear motion on chemical reactivity.    Mass-analyzed threshold ionization (MATI) and multiphoton ionization   (MPI) will be used to develop routes to prepare vibrationally   mode-selected reactant ions, and then to carry out experiments with these   ions.  The information gained from these studies will advance the   understanding of reaction dynamics in complex systems, and thus may aid   in developing approaches to optimize chemical reactions.  When ions and molecules collide with one another, changes in their   chemical bonding arrangement can occur under certain circumstances.    These studies seek to improve the detailed understanding of how internal   molecular motions affect the outcomes of collisions in which bonding   changes occur.  Such knowledge is central to attaining useful insights   about the nature of chemical change.",
