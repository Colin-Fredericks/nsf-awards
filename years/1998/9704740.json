 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract/Wyngaard  ATM-9704740      Large-eddy simulation (LES) has become t he modeling method of choice  in micrometeorological research.  Nonetheless its performance in the  surface layer suffers because of inadequate numerical resolution and  heavy reliance on the precision of the subgrid-scale (SGS) model there.   Until recently, little attention has been focused on these deficiencies in  the surface layer, probably for two reasons.  First, experimental  limitations make it difficult to produce data for thorough testing of LES.    No direct measurements of the resolvable-scale fields that LES predicts  have been reported, for example.  Second, the weaknesses of the  traditional SGS models in the surface layer have not been documented in   much detail.    Measurements of resolvable- and subgrid-scale atmospheric turbulence in  the atmospheric surface layer for the purpose of testing and improving  SGS closures for LES are proposed here.  Recent studies indicate major  weaknesses of the widely used Smagorinsky SGS model near the surface.   A new experimental technique is proposed whereby a lateral array of  sensors is used to measure two-dimensionally filtered turbulence variables  in the atmospheric surface layer.  The preliminary studies presented here,  which demonstrate the potential of the technique, will be extended  in  the proposed studies.  Resolvable and SGS variables will be measured in  the surface layer over a range of ABL states, from nearly neutral to highly  convective, and shall be analyzed to study resolvable and subgrid-scale  dynamics in detail.  The resulting data and new physical insight will be  coupled with parallel program using direct numerical simulation and LES  data to provide the necessary impetus for the development of improved  SGS models for surface-layer turbulence.    The proposed program is part of a coordinated effort in a multi-  disciplinary research group at the Penn State University directed at  analysis and improvement of SGS modeling through combined  numerical  simulation and field measurement.  The present studies will provide  benchmark data for the development of remote sensing techniques for  the measurement of filtered turbulence in the surface layer.",
