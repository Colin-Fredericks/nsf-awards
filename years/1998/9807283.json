The  conference aims at broadening content and improving teaching  methods in materials science and engineering education.  The  title of this conference is \"Innovations in College Teaching  of Materials Science\"; the focus is on innovations in  teaching approaches and in content of college level  introductory courses in materials science and engineering  (MSE) for both general students and science and engineering  majors. The conference will be held at Plymouth State  College, Plymouth, NH, on July 26-29, 1998.    The conference comes at a time when there is keen awareness,  both nationally and internationally, of the importance of  materials education. The conference organizers emphasize the  participation of undergraduate and community college  faculty, and of graduate students with interest in teaching  materials science through financial assistance with  attendance expenses.  %%%  ***",
