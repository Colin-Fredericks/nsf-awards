Despite the importance of this problem, little actual data has been collected of surface fluxes under high wind conditions (>15 m/s).  \r\nThis research project will utilize data collected during the Fronts and Atlantic Storm Tracks Experiment (FASTEX) to document the relationship between mid-ocean surface fluxes and boundary layer structure and the structure and evolution of the mid-oceanic extratropical cyclones.  FASTEX is an international research field program whose objective is to understand the mid-oceanic development of extratropical cyclones.  Its field phase was conducted in January-February, 1997.  This research will focus on ship-based surface-flux measurements collected in a high wind-speed marine environment, the associated sea state measurements, and the quasi-continuous measurements of the mid-oceanic boundary-layer structure.  It is unknown to what extent present flux and boundary layer parameterizations represent these environmental conditions.  Despite the significant fluxes likely to be present under these conditions, very few such measurements have been obtained previously.  More than 130 hours of data were collected during FASTEX by the RV Knorr under these conditions, representing a multi-fold increase in the amount of data available in this wind speed range.  The measurements will be used for the validation/modification of current marine flux and planetary boundary layer parameterization schemes used in forecast models.  Because the FASTEX flux and boundary layer measurements were obtained within and in coordination with a larger field program with extensive downwind mesoscale validation data, these measurements will also be able to provide a clear demonstration of their impact on marine extratropical cyclone development and forecasting. \r\n***\r\n",
