The meeting was the 10th of a highly successful series of specialized international assemblies that began in 1978 in Aachen, Germany.  The United States hosted 3 of the 10 conferences, which serve as an important forum for the exchange of information about recent developments in mechanics and medicine. Participants are from biomedical engineering, the life sciences, and medicine.\r\n\r\nThe 10th meeting included some 87 presentations in 24 sessions encompassing a wide range of topics at the forefront of biomechanical engineering. Presentations in areas of importance to National Science Foundation program objectives included biomaterials, biotechnology, bone structure, cardiac mechanics, imaging, implant design, rehabilitation, and tissue mechanics. A number of young investigators attended the conference.\r\n\r\nThe conference proceedings are to be made available to a wide audience through BITNET, which is the major distributor of information about biomedical engineering using the Internet.\r\n***",
