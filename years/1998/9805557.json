 "awd_abstract_narration": "9805557    The award provides partial support for a FASEB Conference that focuses on the multidisciplinary   area of post-transcriptional RNA processing, transport and targeting.  The importance of this area   has become evident as a result of the convergence of information from studies focusing on a   variety of molecular, cellular and developmental questions.  During the past fifteen years over   seventy intracellularly localized RNAs have been identified in a diversity of cell types in both   vertebrates and invertebrates, ranging from oocytes to epithelial cells to neurons and glia.  In   addition, diverse classes of proteins are encoded by localized RNAs, including transcription   factors, RNA binding proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, intracellular signaling molecules and   secreted growth factors.  It is now clear that the targeting of mRNAs to particular intracellular   locations plays a key role in biological processes that include the establishment of oocyte   polarity, early embryonic differentiation, somatic cell polarization and function, synapse growth,   and plasticity in the vertebrate nervous system.  The goal of the conference is to build upon two   similar and successful conferences held in 1994 and 1996 by bringing together researchers and   students with a wide range of perspectives and backgrounds in this area.  The conference will   explore common themes and questions that include (1) the role of RNA localization in   establishment of embryonic cell lineage and cell polarity, (2) cis-acting signals and trans-acting   factors that target mRNAs to specific intracellular locations, (3) the delivery systems responsible   for this targeting, (4) the mechanism that anchors mRNAs at target locations, (5) the   characterization and extent of targeting sites, (6) the involvement of extracellular and intracellular   signaling systems in mRNA transport and targeting, (7) transport of RNA across the nuclear   envelope,  and (8) the effects of RNA sorting on cell functions.  A significan t portion of   conference resources will be used to support the attendance of graduate students and young   investigators.",
