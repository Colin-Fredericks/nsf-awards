 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental and Applied Problems in Granular Flow   Michael Shearer/David Schaeffer    This project focuses on three aspects of the flow of granular  materials: an investigation of fluctuations, flows and stresses in  industrial silos, and liquefaction of soils.  The various issues will  be addressed using an interdisciplinary approach involving analysis,  computation and experiment.  The latter two parts will also involve  input from industrial and geotechnical experts.  Details of each  subproject follow.  Subproject 1, fluctuations in sheared granular  materials: Recent work has shown that fluctuations of forces and to  some extent velocities can be very large for moderate scale systems.  The experimental part of this project will provide additional  quantitative characterizations of these fluctuations for modest scale  slowly sheared systems.  In addition, new experiments will be  constructed of a Couette type that will probe force fluctuations on  larger length and time scales.  These experiments will be integrated  into ongoing work to model force fluctuations by lattice type models,  and computations using novel hybrid molecular dynamics  and finite  element codes. Subproject 2, flow in industrial silos: In collaboration  with engineers at the firm Jenike and Johanson, Inc. the co-PI's of this  project will analyze flows in a spatial region that corresponds to the  shape of a typical hopper.  This analysis will be based both on Coulomb  materials and on  critical state soil mechanics (CSSM).  Some of the aspects  under study will  include an investigation  of the relationship between  CSSM and  Coulomb  models, shock and rarefaction wave solutions, boundary  value problems for  hopper flow, and stability of such solutions.  An  important application  is the design of flow corrective devices.  Subproject 3, liquefaction of soils: This phenomenon corresponds to the  abrupt  loss of load-bearing capacity of a loose, water-saturated soil,  possibly leading to a massive landslide. Real world s oil  failure/liquefaction will be investigated in collaboration with  G. Gudehus and his associates.    This project will combine experiments, mathematical analysis, computer  simulation and industrial/geotechnical expertise to better understand  the flow of granular materials.  The area of study is of considerable  importance to technical processes involving all types of granular  materials, including but by no means limited to chemical process  industries, and to the handling of coal, ores, food grains, and  pharmaceuticals.  Many aspects of the above processes are not fully  understood, leading in some cases to enormous financial losses. Also  under consideration are geotechnical issues such as the stability of  embankments,  as well as the stability of soils under earthquake conditions.  The project will involve the application of existing theories for granular  materials to such fundamental  problems as flows in hoppers and stability  of soils in landfills.  New models will be developed in order to take into  account some important aspects  of granular flows such as fluctuations of  forces. Recent experiments in this lab have shown that fluctuations,  which are not accounted for in existing models,  can be very strong and  may well be necessary to provide safe and reliable design criteria for  industrial devices involving granular flows. The models will be tightly  linked to the experimental data, on the one hand, and, on the other hand,  will be the basis of computer solutions for relevant technical problems.",
