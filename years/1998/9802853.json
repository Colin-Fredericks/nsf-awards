 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802853  Mays  This award is for the purchase of a state-of-the-art size  exclusion chromatography (SEC) instrument for use in  characterizing polymers that are synthesized at the  University of Alabama at Birmingham.  To maximize the  utility of this instrument for accurately and rapidly  characterizing a wide range of synthetic materials, we will  equip the instrument with superior flow rate stability and  with multiple detectors:  refractive index, ultraviolet  (photodiode array), and multi-angle laser light scattering  (MALLS) detectors.  The dual concentration detectors are  useful in examining compositional variations in many  copolymers, while the MALLS detector allows determination of  absolute molecular weights without reliance on calibration  curves (standards of the same type as the polymer being  analyzed are often not available).  SEC/MALLS also allows  conformational characteristics of polymers to be determined.  Use of the MALLS detector along with the differential  viscometer that is already available in our laboratory will  allow for rapid detection and quantification of long chain  branching in polymers.  The combination of these various  detectors is especially useful in our work with graft  copolymers, which combine copolymer character with  branching.  %%%  This project supports equipment used in the development of  advanced polymeric materials leading to better paints,  improved ceramics, lighter faster electronics, and low cost  biodegradable plastics from renewable resources.  It will  involve the integration of education and research through  the participation and training of students, including  students from under represented groups through participation  in the NSF Alliance for Minority Participation  Program.  *  *  *",
