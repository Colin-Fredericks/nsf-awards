New problems   of mathematical physics require new special functions and   suggest new approaches to studying special functions.  The Gauss hypergeometric function is an example of a classical   special function.  The Gauss hypergeometric function  satisfies the remarkable hypergeometric differential equation.   The hypergeometric differential equation is connected with   representation theory of   affine Lie algebras.  The monodromy properties of the   Gauss hypergeometric function lead to the theory of quantum groups.     Modern field theory and statistical mechanics suggest a new point of   view on the Gauss hypergeometric function, namely, one considers  the hypergeometric differential equation as a special example of   the differential equation for conformal blocks  on the Riemann sphere and the Gauss hypergeometric function as   a special conformal block on the Riemann sphere.  Thus,  a new   class of special functions arises - the conformal blocks on Riemann   surfaces. To describe algebraic properties of conformal blocks   one will need new algebraic structures. Namely, the algebraic structure   underlying the properties of conformal blocks on the Riemann sphere  is the standard quantum group structure. The algebraic structure underlying   the properties of conformal blo cks on the torus is the recently  discovered dynamical quantum group structure. One can  expect that to describe properties of conformal blocks on Riemann   surfaces of a given genus, one will need the corresponding  to this genus variant of the quantum group theory.   The aim of this project is to develop the theory of special functions   associated with Riemann surfaces of an arbitrary genus and study   algebraic structures associated with these special functions.",
