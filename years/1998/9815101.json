Through a combination of teachers and  college faculty, half attending the on-site conference in Orlando  and half attending the remote linkages to Illinois, Iowa and  North Carolina, at least 140 teachers will participate.  Two  follow-up meetings are to be held in each state.  The sessions  are presented from Orlando or from the participating state  teachers, and are anticipated to deal primarily with  computational science and the integration of technologies into  mathematics and science education.  Data is collected on the  impact of the conference through an online survey administered to  each participant.    The educational portion of the conference overlaps the main  conference, as will some of the other activities this year.  It  will include presentations by teachers and teacher educators on  using HPCC tools in schools, poster sessions, exemplary programs,  best uses sessions, shared lessons, and samples from implemented  curricula.  A secondary theme deals with the medium, examining  how one establishes a virtual community that can interact and  share freely.    Cost sharing is 77%.        Michael R.
