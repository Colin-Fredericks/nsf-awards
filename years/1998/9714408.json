 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program supports research by Dr. Joseph W. Kolis, Chemistry Department,   Clemson University, for the study of novel synthetic methods for   transition metal-main group solids.  The relatively low reaction   temperature of supercritical fluids permits isolation of kinetically   stabilized phases not otherwise easily obtainable.  Solids of the general   formula AxMyEz, where A=alkali metal, M=Cu, Ag, and E=S, Se, will be   prepared in supercritical ammonia or ethylenediamine.  Attempts will also   be made to use bismuth and tellurium.  The resulting compounds are   expected to have low dimensional structures and potentially interesting   electronic properties.  A dominant strategy for the synthesis will be to   replace monovalent alkali metals with divalent cations, or replacement of   monovalent coinage metals with open shell transition metals such as   manganese (II) or iron (II).   In addition, new techniques will be   developed for some unusual aqueous solvents.  Hydrothermal brines with   high concentrations of halides, sulfides or carbonates will be used to   synthesize new metal chalcogenides under conditions similar to those   under which naturally occurring gems and minerals form.  Solid state compounds are useful in electronic devices, so development of   new materials and new methods to prepare materials are important areas of   research.  The new methods to be developed with the support of this award   not only are novel and may result in useful new solids, but may have   implications for understanding formation of minerals in nature as well",
