 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stewart  IBN 9870382      Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) is the final  enzyme required  for synthesis of the stress hormone epinephrine. Recent  studies indicate that the PNMT gene is expressed in  mammalian lymphoid organs, such as spleen, thymus and lymph  nodes, but it is unclear what types of cells in these organs  produce PNMT and whether the PNMT in these areas has other  functions in addition to synthesis of epinephrine.  Similarly, PNMT and epinephrine are found in the brains of  vertebrates, but the functions of epinephrine in the brain  have never been clarified. The goals of the proposed project  are to (1) identify cells that express the PNMT gene in the  central nervous system and lymphoid tissues of rats and  mice, (2) investigate the regulation of PNMT and epinephrine  in these areas and (3) explore model systems for studying  the function of epinephrine in these tissues.  These studies  will increase our understanding of the role of PNMT and  epinephrine in both the nervous system and the immune  system.  Because epinephrine is present in the vertebrate  brain and in immune cells of organisms as diverse as  primates and molluscs, the findings will have broad  implications for regulatory mechanisms in many species.",
