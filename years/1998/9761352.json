 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9761352    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel optical sensing system for real time measurement of dissolved carbon dioxide in the cell culture medium for bioreactor systems.  The concentration of carbon dioxide in the bioreactor medium is an important indicator for respiratory and bioactivity of microorganisms and a useful parameter for controlling cell metabolism in reactors.  Carbon dioxide accumulation in the bioreactor medium has a variety of influences on microbial morphology, and inhibition of cell growth and product formation.  With the lack of reliable sensing devices, dissolved carbon dioxide in the bioreactor medium is not currently monitored.  We propose an optical sensor which will provide rapid and continuous determination of carbon dioxide concentration in the cell culture medium for various fermentation processes.  The proposed technique is based on trapping carbon dioxide in a polymer membrane which repels liquid, and spectral measurement of carbon dioxide specific absorption in the infrared region.    The probe to monitor dissolved carbon dioxide in reactors will have significant value to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical markets.  The field of human therapeutics requires close quality control of materials such as recombinant bacteria.  Development of a dissolved carbon dioxide sensor is important, since there is no sensor currently available.  ***",
