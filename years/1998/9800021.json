 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Institutionalization of Project Smart\" is designed to test, refine, and disseminate the activities and  strategies developed over the past three years.  The goals of the project are: (1) to promote positive and  permanent changes in the educational environments of New Jersey school districts to ensure full  participation and inclusion of children in the learning of science and mathematics, so that all students,  especially children with disabilities, have the knowledge and skills necessary to meet challenging  standards and prepare for inclusion into general education classrooms; (2) to establish a professional  development model for educators; (3) to provide training to counselors and other educational  professionals, and parents of youngsters with disabilities; (4) to make the professional development model  and accompanying support materials available regionally and nationally; and (5) Establish an Educational  Resource Center (ERC) for all stakeholders at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)'s Center for  Pre-College Programs.    To meet these goals, staff will evaluate, refine and disseminate model materials that will:  . provide training and resources for centers of staff development that serve elementary/middle grade  school teachers in New Jersey who will have students with disabilities in their classrooms;  . provide training and resources for families of children with disabilities, so they can provide the proper  support for them;  . acquaint guidance counselors with resources and procedures for assuring full access and needed support  in science and mathematics education to children and youth with disabilities;  . create an atmosphere of collaboration among educational professionals, parents and others interested  in building effective schools for all children.    The project will establish partnerships with state and regional organizations and agencies to develop a  network by which services and resources will continue to be provided to educators and serve as a regional  mo del.    Focus will be placed on classroom implementation of state content standards in science and mathematics  for all children by addressing:  classroom implementation of a standards-based curriculum in science and  mathematics in inclusionary and special education settings; refinements of a training model that includes  practicum experience; translation and implementation of the professional development model to provide  training and support at the school district level; development and testing of guides and manuals to use  in support of professional development and classroom implementation; implementation of demonstration  sites for classroom implementation models; dissemination of the professional development model and  resources, including guides and manuals regionally and at other sites across the country.    Efforts will be made to develop educational resource centers at schools.  The professional development  model includes a practicum experience and intensive in-service training in the implementation of content  standards and instructional planning that allows for accommodations and adaptations for students with  special needs.  It will be modified and translated to the school district environment.  Selected participants  in Project SMART will be trained as professional developers to expand on the impact of the project.",
