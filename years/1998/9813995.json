This  is a familiar concept if one thinks of the effects of 'street' drugs  on  the  brain,  or  the  way one feels in response  to  a  jolt  of  adrenaline.  Both  adrenaline and serotonin are  known  as  biogenic  amines.  But, how do brain chemicals work to regulate the production  of  a  particular mood or behavior? What causes specific nerve cells  to  release  their  chemicals  for  the  production  of  appropriate  behavior, and what are the neural targets for such chemicals? At the  level  of  individual nerve cells, answers to such questions  remain  far  from complete. The aim of this proposal is to understand better  how the biogenic amines work to regulate nervous system function and  ultimately  the generation of behavior. A simple invertebrate  model  nervous  system  has been chosen for study because individual  nerve  cells (neurons) can be readily studied, especially ones that contain  either  serotonin or the adrenaline-like compound called octopamine.  The  electrical  activity  of amine-containing  neurons,  and  their  connections  with target nerve cells can be followed  in  much  more  detail  than  is  currently possible using more  complex  vertebrate  systems.  One  important component of this research is  based  on  a  recent  finding  in  Dr. Mesce's lab where it  was  found  that  the  combination  of  two  biogenic amines can result  in  behaviors  not  induced  by  either  substance alone. Because  the  actions  of  the  biogenic  amines  are  fairly conserved  across  species,  including  humans,  such  studies  will contribute to an understanding  of  how  single and multiple neural chemicals can orchestrate the release  of  various   kinds   of  behaviors  ranging  from  the   activation   or  inactivation  of locomotion, alteration in motivational  state,  and  possibly, behavioral disorders in humans.",
