 "awd_abstract_narration": "9816490  Clark  Hyperthermophilic microorganisms may be suitable models for ancestral, and possibly extraterrestrial, biosystems because their extraordinary adaptive capabilities allow them to colonize a wide range of subsurface volcanic areas on Earth.  Deep sea hydrothermal vents and terrestrial hot springs support highly diverse ecosystems without access to solar energy, harboring autotrophic microorganisms and their dependant heterotrophic micro and macro communities in geochemical conditions similar to those that may exist below the surface of Mars or Europa.  Hyperthermophiles also dominate most of the deeper branches of the universal phylogenetic tree, suggesting that ancestral microorganisms may have been thermophilic.  The environmental limits for growth and survival of known hyperthermophilic species, as well as newly isolated strains will be established, using a combination of bioengineering, microbiology and molecular biology.  This collaborative project with Dr. Frank T. Robb of the University of Maryland, Baltimore (Award MCB-9809352) emphasizes molecular adaptations to high pressure and high temperature, with the following objectives: 1. To determine the effects of supraoptimal temperatures and pressures on the survival and growth rates of existing hyperthermophilic microorganisms; 2. To utilize pressurized continuous fermentation systems for isolation and culture of new hyperthermophilic microbial strains and; 3. To examine physiological adaptations and genetic regulation of gene expression in response to transient challenges by heat and high pressure.  The hypothesis being tested is that hydrostatic pressure may greatly extend the upper temperature limits of growth and survival of hyperthermophiles.  Ongoing studies by these researchers have established that many enzymes from thermophiles display enhanced thermostability under pressure.  Further, the growth rate of Methanococcus jannaschii accelerated five-fold and its maximum temperature for methane production rose by 6 degrees C in response to pressure, and the growth rate and ATP production of a newly characterized abyssal hyperthermophile, Pyrococcus horikoshii, were elevated under pressure.  Novel equipment for incubating hyperthermophiles in continuous culture, under pressure and with thermal cycling, will be combined with molecular biology to explore the adaptive responses of hyperthermophiles in extremis.  Gene expression, membrane lipid composition and morphology will be examined.  The genes that are induced under conditions approaching lethality, will be identified by subtractive cloning and transcriptional assays.  Upper survival limits of the abyssal hyperthermophiles as a function of pressure, using isolates from a shallow terrestrial sampling site to provide control data for pressure responses, will be determined.  Enrichment cultures of hyperthermophiles from the vent systems of the back-arc region of the Northwest Pacific (Okinawa Trough and Uzzon Caldera on the Kamchatka Peninsula) will be incubated at temperatures and pressures exceeding those tolerated by known strains, thus using survival rather than rapid growth as the criterion for selection of new isolates.  The phylogenetic positions and physiological requirements of the new strains will be determined.  ***",
