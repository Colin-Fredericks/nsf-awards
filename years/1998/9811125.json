 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Rice Genome Sequencing Initiative has been  formed to promote collaboration in sequencing rice genomic  DNA.  The proposed workshop will address the U.S. response  to this initiative.    As a member of the Graminae and a crop plant, a wealth of  fundamental information about important aspects of plant  biology can be learned from the genomic sequence of rice.  Rice is a model for learning about yield, hybrid vigor,  single and multigenic disease resistance.  Different races  of rice are adapted to a wide variety of environmental  situations, from tropical flooding to temperate dry land, so  it is a model for real life adaptive responses.  Because it  shares colinear genomes, rice is a key to knowledge of the  genomic organization of the other grasses.  Comparison of  the sequence of the dicot,  Arabidopsis thaliana, with that  of rice, a model monocot, will tell us what genomic  structures these two different groups of angiosperms have in  common and how they differ.    The purpose of the proposed workshop is to promote and  coordinate U.S. activities in rice genomic sequencing with  the International Rice Genome Sequencing Initiative.  Topics  to be discussed would include:  1)   Inform interested parties about decisions taken on    behalf of the International Initiative and to provide a    level playing field for all parties interested in rice    sequencing.  2)   Plan U.S. response.  3)   Engage and help U.S. funding agencies in planning their    activities.",
