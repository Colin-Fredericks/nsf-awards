 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this Major Research  Instrumentation proposal is to create a science and  technology infrastructure that fosters the development and  integration of functional genomics and information  technology at Texas A&M University (TAMU). The requested  cluster of genomics instrumentation will automate DNA  library construction, DNA purification, liquid handling, DNA  sequencing and genetic marker analysis. The infrastructure  will support NSF's Plant Genome Program, an A. nidulans  genome sequencing project recently started in collaboration  with industry at Texas A&M University, and a growing number  of research and teaching activities in the area of genomics.  In addition, the instrumentation will accelerate progress on  the construction of integrated genetic and physical maps for  numerous organisms, provide access to DNA microarray  technology for analysis of whole genome expression, and  facilitate studies of gene expression in differentiated  cells. The requested instrumentation will also provide tools  required to integrate the power of genomics, GIS, and remote  sensing for the study of plant function in natural micro-  environments.       Genome projects are generating tremendous amounts of  new DNA sequence information and creating novel tools, such  as DNA chip technology, for genome wide analysis of gene  function. In 1996, the sequences of several bacterial  genomes and the yeast genome were completed. For plants, the  A. thaliana genome (120 Mbp) is scheduled for completion by  2000 and a rice genome project is being planned as pan of  NSF's Plant Genome Program. Even more impressive is the  scheduled completion of the 3,000 Mbp human genome by 2005.  The rate of DNA sequence information generation currently  surpasses the scientific community's capacity for  utilization. A surprising 30% or more of the genes  discovered in the sequencing efforts currently have no known  function. Therefore, one overall goal of this proposal is to  develop an infrastructure t hat connects gene discovery  through sequencing to the analysis of gene function at  molecular, cellular, tissue, and organismal levels.",
