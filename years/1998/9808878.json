 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacillus thuringiensis (BT) is a Gram positive sporulating bacterium that produces a variety of biopesticidal proteins that are active against (toxic to) major crop pests and disease vectors.  Depending on the organism, these pesticidal proteins accumulate in the cytoplasm of cells during late exponential phase, stationary phase, or sporulation, to form crystalline inclusions.  Typically, inclusion proteins are formed inside the vegetative or sporulating cell and either secreted or liberated at the end of the autolysis stage of sporulation.  Exceptions to this rule have been noted in only a few strains of BT and in certain other related Bacillus species.  In the case of the BT subspecies finitimus, two crystalline inclusions are formed.  The major proteins comprising each of these two inclusions are similar in size but have unique antigenic determinants, are formed at different temporal stages of sporulation, and accumulate at different sites in the cell with respect to the exosporium.  One, a minor inclusion, forms outside the exosporium and is released into the environment independently of the spore.  The second, major, inclusion and the spore itself are together surrounded by the endospore's exosporium.  The inclusion and the spore are released together, and the inclusion remains attached to the spore after autolysis.   Of the thousands of known strains of the bacterium, such exosporium enclosure of the parasporal inclusions is a rare event.  The mechanism for targeting parasporal inclusion proteins within an exosporium is not known, and is the subject of this research project.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to use the parasporal inclusion proteins of subspecies finitimus to determine the relative contribution of the intrinsic properties of inclusion proteins and the environment in which the protein is expressed upon exosporium enclosure.  Cloning techniques will be used to isolate the genes for exosporium enclosed and free parasporal inclusion proteins.  The genes will be sequenced and the regulatory regions of the two genes will be identified and compared.  Molecular techniques will be used to exchange the regulatory regions on the two genes and then monitor the site of inclusion and accumulation as a measure  of the relative effects of time of synthesis on exosporium enclosure of inclusion protein.  The cloned genes will be introduced into alternative cell environments (sporulation+, inclusion- variants) by electroporation and the site of inclusion accumulation with respect to the exosporium will be monitored to determine the relative contribution of the cell environment on targeting of parasporal inclusion proteins.  Regions of the coding sequences will be exchanged and site directed mutagenesis will be used to alter the coding sequences to determine if targeting is sequence specific.\r\n\r\nBiopesticides based on parasporal inclusions are commercially produced to control economically and medically important pests.  The biopesticide is either distributed as a dried powder or the toxic component of the inclusion protein is expressed in transgenic plants.  The effectiveness of the biopesticides is limited by environmental availability and continued use has selected pest resistant strains.  Increased availability and decreased selection of pest resistant strains will improve the effectiveness of the natural pesticide. In particular, exosporium enclosed parasporal inclusions are less susceptible to environmental degradation than free inclusions.  The exosporium bestows hydrophobicity on the spore-inclusion complex, and protects the enclosed inclusion from degradation.  The exposporium thus prolongs the availability of the inclusion-spore complex in the environment, causes the complex to concentrate at the air-water interface of an aqueous environment, and creates a natural \"time-release\" effect. Understanding the mechanism of exosporium enclosure of parasporal inclusions thus has economic and agricultural significance as a means of improving the delivery of the natural pesticide to the environment and controlling its expression.  \r\n",
