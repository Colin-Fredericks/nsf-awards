 "awd_abstract_narration": "Motivated by problems in several applied areas, such as computer  graphics, robotics, computer vision, computer aided design, image  processing, and geographic information systems,  computational  geometry emerged as a discipline about twenty years ago. Numerous  efficient geometric algorithms and sophisticated algorithmic  paradigms have been developed, and computational geometry is by  now a rich and mature discipline.  The link between computational geometry and application areas  is, however, still not as strong as one would have hoped for.  The purpose of this project is to narrow the gap between geometry  and the related applied areas. The project will address the  issues beyond the traditional framework of algorithmic design,  and simple algorithms will be developed and implemented that work  well in practice. Geometric problems motivated by various  application areas, including visualization, robotics, data  mining, and metrology will be studied.  The algorithms will be developed and analyzed in a more realistic  model of computation and will be implemented and tested on  ``real'' inputs.",
