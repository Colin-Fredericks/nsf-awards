 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727613  Manning  The enzyme, D-amino acid transaminase (DAT), has intrinsic  interest for its enzymological and its bacteriological  properties, which are related. This research will focus on  its stereochemical relationship to an enzyme that acts only  on L-amino acids. The investigators have both structures  (which are remarkably similar overall) on their Silicon  Graphics workstation and they have compiled tables of  sequence homologies and differences, which will be used for  site-directed mutagenesis studies in order to convert one  enzyme specificity to the other.  The bonding between the  subunits will be studied by a new procedure using very high  resolution gel filtration. Studies on enzyme-catalyzed side  reactions, coenzyme binding, and the stabilization of a  reaction intermediate by mutant enzymes will be continued.    This is a project to study the stereochemistry and structure  of D-amino acid transaminase (DAT), a vitamin B6 (pyridoxal  phosphate or PLP) containing enzyme. DAT supplies the  building blocks for biosynthesis of peptidoglycans,  constituents of bacterial cell walls. It has unusual  features, such as inactivation by substrate under certain  conditions.  Understanding how physiological compounds  mediate substrate inactivation could be predictive of in  vivo regulation of the enzyme. Using this enzyme to  understand how to alter stereospecificity in enzymic  reactions is a potential payoff.  The mechanistic studies  proposed should be generalizable to other enzymes in the  transaminase family.",
