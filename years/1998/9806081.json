 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award of the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program funded by the Division of Chemistry supports the research and educational activities of Professor Jean Chmielewski of Purdue University.  The research aims to study self-reproducing, autocatalytic as well as cross-catalytic systems in which four peptide fragments will be used to produce four potential coiled-coil products.  Amplification of one product over the other will be accomplished by using cross-catalytic peptide templates and by modulating the environmental conditions within the reaction, such as pH or salt concentration.  The coiled-coil studies will be extended into the area of self-replicating helix-turn-helix peptides.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity afforded through the POWRE program will enhance Professor Chmielewski's research potential as well as her educational mentoring of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scientists.  The results of this research will allow the PI to pursue a new line of inquiry which falls within the framework of her present research area, self-replicating peptides.  Investigation of the self-replicating capabilities of molecules other than DNA and RNA should result in new advances in a wide range of biotechnology disciplines.\r\n",
