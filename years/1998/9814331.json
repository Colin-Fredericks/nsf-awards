The conference intends to recognize Robert Plemmons' outstanding   contributions to core, applied, and computational Linear Algebra on   the occasion of his sixtieth birthday.     The major themes of this conference will be: matrix analysis and  nonnegative matrix theory; large, sparse least squares problems and  parallel algorithms; applications of linear algebra in signal and  image processing.  The primary purpose of the meeting is to bring  together scientists researching in these diverse, yet related areas,  to explore greater commonality.  There will be four invited long  presentations, and twenty-five invited short presentations.  In order  to facilitate interaction between researchers with varying interests,  there will be no parallel sessions.  Contributed papers will be  solicited for informal poster presentations, and new investigators  will be especially encouraged to participate.  The conference will be  held in an intimate setting to encourage interaction between  researchers, and between senior scientists and new investigators.  Research results presented at the meeting will be published in a  special issue of the journal Linear Algebra and its Applications.",
