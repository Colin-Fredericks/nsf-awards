 "awd_abstract_narration": "Logic forms a basic framework for artificial intelligence,  including machine learning and knowledge discovery in  databases. Predicate logic, which is used by several machine  learning systems, poses both open problems of learning  complexity and questions that do not arise in other  approaches to learning. There are algorithmic approaches to  knowledge discovery in databases that suggest several open  problems for propositional and predicate logic, and  complexity theory. Some of the learnability issues specific  to predicate logic that will be studied are the role of  background knowledge, the efficiency of the algorithmic  techniques of logic learning, such as least general  generalizations, the complexity of learning multiple  predicates, and types of noise that either are specific to  predicate logic, or appear to behave differently for  predicate logic. The first two issues will be studied using  the producthomomorphism method.  This technique, introduced  by one of the PI's and developed further by both PI's,  enables the use of combinatorial tools in constructing  learning algorithms.  One extension to be studied is  learning certain broader classes of logic programs, which  are useful for practical applications.  The complexity of  the general product-homomorphism problem will also be  investigated. In the area of noise-tolerance, one topic to  be studied is the complexity of learning Boolean  conjunctions in noise models that are more difficult for the  learner than random classification noise.  This could lead  to extensions of previous work of the PI's on learning noisy  logic programs. Expanding the scope of learning problems  studied in learning theory, the project will construct  algorithms for relations definable in a finite model by  restricted classes of formulas, such as formulas with a  bounded number of variables.  This continues the model  theoretic approach to learning, studied earlier by one of  the PI's.  Another, related family of problems involves  classes of atomic f ormulas satisfying first-order  constraints. In knowledge discovery in databases, a logic-  based approach is to find the theory of the database, which  means identifying all interesting statements that hold in  the database, using an appropriate notion of interesting  statement.  Algorithmically, this requires polynomial-delay  listing algorithms for different classes of objects, such as  the maximal frequent sets of a 0-1 matrix.  The project will  study the possibilities of gaining efficiency by taking into  account the structure of the database.  This leads to  questions about restricted classes of threshold circuits,  and generalized versions of the minimal hitting set listing  problem. The methods to be used are primarily combinatorial,  such as products and homomorphisms of graphs, and model-  theoretic games. This project will contribute to the  understanding of the limits of efficient learnability in  predicate logic.  It will also develop new algorithms that  may be useful for practical machinelearning systems, and  contribute to the methodology for tolerating noisy data.  The overall goal of this work is to gain a better  understanding of the computational complexity aspects of  learning using logic.",
