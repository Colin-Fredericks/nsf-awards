 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728338  Sosinsky      This project is to study the detailed structure of gap junctions and their role in intercellular communication.  Gap junctions are formed between the plasma membrane of apposed epithelial cells and other animal cell types.  The junctions provide a direct aqueous channel through which ions and small molecules can pass between the cells.  A gap junction is composed of paired connexons (one from each cell) each of which is a homohexamer made up of protein subunits called connexins.  There are several connexin isoforms (16 in human cells) that constitute the connexin family.  All connexin isoforms share a basic conformation when assembled in a connexon.  However, not all connexons can pair and form functional channels with all the other connexons composed of dissimilar connexin subunits. This may allow different cell types expressing specific isoforms to form junctions selectively with only cells of the same type.  Studies that are proposed will test an hypothesis for the molecular basis of connexon pairing that could account for this selectivity.  Preliminary evidence from cryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstructions using two isoforms indicates that the surface contours of the extracellular face of different connexons are different for the two isoforms.  The hypothesis is that during pairing there is a reciprocal fit of the apposed faces that accounts for the specificity of pairing.  To test the hypothesis, the high-resolution connexon structures that result from four other isoforms will be analyzed.  In addition, correlative light and electron microscopy will be used to detail the steps of gap junction assembly and disassembly.  A final portion of the project will involve the characterization of specialized intracellular gap junctions (\"reflexive junctions\") that form within Schwann cells of the nervous system.  The studies are highly significant in that they would likely provide important insights into the structural and functional differences among the g ap junctions that form in different tissues.  ***",
