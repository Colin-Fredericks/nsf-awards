 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726789  Ojima    This award supports a three year collaborative research  project between Professor Iwao Ojima of SUNY, Stony Brook,  Professor Keiji Morokuma of Emory University and Professor  Eiichi Nakamura of the University of Tokyo in Japan.  The  researchers will be undertaking experimental and theoretical  studies on structure and catalytic activity of di- and  polynuclear metal complexes.  Professor Ojima has been  designing and developing new and efficient homogeneous  catalytic reactions promoted by heterobimetallic catalyst  systems, that provide useful synthetic methods for organic  synthesis.  He has discovered silylformylation and various  silylcarbocyclizations and has been trying to elucidate the  most plausible mechanisms for these catalytic processes.  His collaborations with theoretical chemists, who have  experience in analyzing the problems in homogeneous  catalysis and di-/polynuclear metal complex systems, will  provide insight into the theoretically predicted pathways.    This project brings together the efforts of three  laboratories that have complementary expertise, research  capabilities and equipment.  Professor Ojima's expertise is  in organometallic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis.  Professor Morokuma is a theoretical chemist who can uniquely  deal with the catalytic cycles of transition metal catalyzed  processes.  Professor Nakamura has a wide range of expertise  in experimental as well as theoretical research.  It is  anticipated that this trilateral collaborative research will  disclose novel mechanistic aspects of the catalysis of di-  and polynuclear metal complexes, which are very likely to  imply new organometallic species in the catalytic cycle.  This information will stimulate the exploration of new and  significant organometallic transformations and help in the  design of highly regio-, stereo- and enantioselective  catalyst systems with applications in industrial processes.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project  will broaden o ur base of basic knowledge and promote  international understanding and cooperation.  ***",
