 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physics and chemistry departments at Harvey Mudd College are enhancing their capability for interdisciplinary instruction and student projects with a scanning probe microscope (SPM). The equipment allows students to perform atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements in a non-contact mode and magnetic force microscopy measurements (MFM). It is used for teaching laboratories and for student research.     There are two aspects of this project that involve teaching laboratories. First, a new interdisciplinary course is being developed, a Materials Characterization Laboratory. This course is expected to attract 10 physics or chemistry majors a year. It represents a continuation of the departments' joint ventures and a significant integrative experience for the students. Students make samples and then characterize them using a number of different techniques. The unique information provided by SPM is essential to an analysis of the magnetic and structural properties of the samples.     Second, there is an AFM experiment in the sophomore physical chemistry laboratory. This course involves 20-30 chemistry students per year and introduces them to sophisticated data acquisition and analysis. Having the ability to use SPM early both makes it easier for them to understand concepts clearly represented by SPM data as well as trains them in the capabilities of this experimental technique.     The remaining component of this project addresses the use of SPM in the student research in the two departments. The non-contact mode of the AFM allows the students to make forefront measurements on the polymer systems under study in Prof. Baker's laboratory. Students working with Profs. Sparks and Eckert can use the MFM both to characterize and guide the design of samples involving the giant magnetoresistance of silicon/cobalt structures and to investigate the micromagnetics of iron films. Research involves approximately 10 students per year.",
