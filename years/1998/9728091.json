This project employs integrated field and laboratory  approaches to investigate the development of vocal behavior  in a common songbird, the Brown-headed Cowbird.  Major  emphases are elucidation of the ecological conditions that  limit or enhance learning processes and the concordance  between (1)  the development of female recognition of male  song and (2) the development of male song production.  Goals  will be pursued by studying wild birds under different  ecological conditions and by bringing birds into captivity  for short periods to study song structure and function.      The cowbird is important to the study of animal behavior and  ecology for several reasons.  The extensive amount of prior  work on it has made it a model for studies of vocal  development in songbirds, which is remarkably similar to  speech development in humans.  However, much of the prior  work has been limited to captive birds and may not reflect  learning processes that occur in nature.  In addition, this  species is a brood parasite whose young are raised by a host  species but nevertheless overcomes this early behavioral  deprivation and learns only cow-bird vocalizations.  Besides  serving as a model for behavioral development in the face of  early deprivation, the cowbird is also significant to  endangered species and to the preservation of biodiversity.  Other species may divert so much of their parental effort  towards raising cowbirds that they sometimes raise too few  of their own young to ensure the persistence of host  populations.  The basic knowledge gained in this study may  lead to improvements to the extensive and very costly  management efforts currently employed to ameliorate the  impacts of cowbird parasitism.",
