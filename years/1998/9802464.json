These are unified by a stochastic\r\ncalculus methodology.\r\n(1) Callable convertible bonds.  This is a two-person game, played by a\r\nbond-holder, who can convert the bond for stock, and the issuing firm,\r\nwhich can call the bond and thereby force conversion or surrender.\r\n(2) Contingent claim replication under portfolio constraints.  A\r\nfinancial institution takes a position in assets which produce a risky\r\ncash flow, and wishes to offset this risk by taking opposing positions. \r\nHowever, there may be constraints on its actions, or the offsetting\r\npositions mandated by the model employed may be too unstable to actually\r\nimplement.  The effect of such constraints can be studied via a dual\r\nproblem.\r\n(3) Passport options.  A passport option entitles its owner to actively\r\nmanage a fund, receive any profit which accrues, and be forgiven any\r\nloss which occurs.  The institution selling this option must observe the\r\ntrading activity of the option owner and solve a stochastic control\r\nproblem to determine how to react to the owner's trading so as to be\r\nable to cover losses the owner incurs.\r\n(4) Credit derivatives. Financial institutions sell a variety of\r\ncontracts designed to pay off in the event of default of corporate\r\nbonds.  Default cannot be perfectly predicted, and this element of\r\n'surprise' requires that models reach beyond the standard\r\nBrownian-motion framework. \r\n(5) Energy derivatives.  Deregulation of natural gas and electricity has\r\ngiven impetus to derivative securities in energy markets, and models for\r\nsuch derivatives are under development.\r\n\r\nThe United States has a tenuous lead in the financial services industry\r\nin large part because of the whole-scale integration of mathematical\r\nmodelling and computer technology into this industry.  The maintenance\r\nof this lead requires continued fundamental research and redoubled\r\ntechnological educational efforts.  This proposal is part of a long-term\r\nproject to develop an educational and research enterprise which is\r\ndoubly connected to the finance industry.  The first connection is\r\nthrough the provision of human resources.  The proposed work would\r\nsupport a successful interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in Mathematical\r\nFinance.  Carnegie Mellon also has a professional Master's degree\r\nprogram in Computational Finance, and an undergraduate option in finance\r\nis under development.  These programs have a substantial synergy.  The\r\nsecond connection with industry is through research projects which use\r\nadvanced mathematics on fundamental problems drawn from the industrial\r\ncontext.  Among these are energy derivatives, which have become\r\nimportant with the deregulation of natural gas an electricity, and\r\ncredit derivatives, which are a form of insurance against default of\r\ncorporate bonds \r\n",
