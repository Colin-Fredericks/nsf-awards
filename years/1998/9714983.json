Marc Mangel                           OPP97-14983    Antarctic krill represent the largest harvestable population  in the ocean, with annual biomass production about three  times the global fish catch.  In addition, most organisms in  the Southern Ocean are one or two trophic levels from krill.  At the broadest level, a fundamental question is:  What  sustains krill and allows it to be such a phenomenally  successful organism?  A secondary question is:  What is the  effect of krill harvesting by humans on krill-dependent  predators?  Although the maximum krill harvest by humans is  small compared to that of other predators, the Convention  for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources  explicitly calls for an ecosystem-based approach in which  such indirect effects are considered.  Of particular concern  is the potential overlap of the foraging ranges of predators  with the spatial distribution of harvesting activity.  The  proposed research has two directions.  The first is the  continued development of models for krill predator and krill  fishery interactions.  The fishery models will be of clear  significance to the Scientific Committee for the Commission  for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources,  and consequently, to the U.S. Antarctic Program.  The model  will also examine indirect food web effects at the level of  the individual and the population.  The second direction is  the development of life history models for krill, using the  methods of dynamic state variable modeling.  These models  will address the highly variable developmental patterns of  krill, and therefore have the potential for examining the  nature of bimodal size distributions and age-size  relationships, both of which influence small scale  population processes and fishery-predator interactions.",
