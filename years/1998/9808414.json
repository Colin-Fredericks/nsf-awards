 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Protein Information Resource (PIR), established at the  National Biomedical Research Foundation (NBRF) by Margaret  Dayhoff, collaboratively collects and publishes the PIR  International Protein Sequence Database, the oldest database  of biomolecular sequences and annotation. As part of its  effort to produce a protein sequence database that is  comprehensive, accurate, precise and consistent, the PIR  maintains a number of auxiliary annotation databases. RESID a  prototype auxiliary database was constructed for modified  amino acid residues annotated as features in the PIR Protein  Sequence Database. Consulted by annotators and outside experts  the RESID Database provides      more detailed chemical information than is possible in the  protein sequence database,      appropriate annotations to accompany features in the Protein  Sequence Database, and      a means to calculate correct molecular weights for modified  peptides.    It is also used as the standard for automatic checking of  syntax and vocabulary in feature records. It is the only  publicly available, human- and computer-readable database  comprehensively documenting protein structural modifications,  and has been recognized as a resource useful in identifying  post-translationally modified peptides by mass-spectroscopy.    The objectives of the proposed two-year effort are:       to  undertake  the  enhancements necessary  to  make  RESID  accessible on the Intemet,      to construct molecular descriptions for the database that    will enable graphical presentation and assist researchers    in generating molecular models of post-translationally    modified peptides, and      to   integrate  software  that  will  display  the  chemical    structure  of  modified  residues  with  existing   sequence    database access programs.    When this project is completed, the enhanced RESID Database  will provide users of ATLAS and the PIR World Wide Web Site  with visual display and molecular modeling information not  previously available,  a comprehensive collection of protein  post-translational modifications. It will also support  interoperability between the PIR and other biomolecular  structural databases such as the Brookhaven Protein Databank.
