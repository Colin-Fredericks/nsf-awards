 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cheverud   9726433     The effects of genes may differ depending on which genes are present at other loci. This phenomenon is known as epistasis. The collective effect  of epistatic interactions on gene effects is referred to as the effect  of genetic background. An important problem in microevolution and  speciation revolves around whether this genetic background itself  evolves, thereby changing the effects of the genes placed in them.  Whether a particular genetic variant is favored or not depends on which  genetic background it is expressed in. In previous studies, we have  found substantial epistasis among genes affecting adult body size in the  cross between Large (LG/J) and Small (SM/J) mouse strains. Thus, whether  a gene makes an individual larger than average depends on which other  genes are present (the genetic background). We have also found  differential effects for jaw characters, meaning that whether a specific  gene affects both overall jaw size and local jaw traits depends on  either the genetic or environmental background. The presence of  epistatic interactions facilitates the evolution of the genetic  background.    In the proposed work, we will examine the opportunity for genetic  background evolution in two experiments. First, we will test for genetic  interactions between specific loci affecting the size and shape of the  jaw and their varying genetic backgrounds, represented by 200  independent full-sib families. This will allow us to determine whether  differential effects on sets of jaw characters are due to genetic or  environmental backgrounds. If the differential effects are due to  genetic background, then it is possible for the multiple effects of  single gene loci (pleiotropy) to evolve. Second, we will prepare a  series of replicate recombinant inbred lines from the cross of Large and  Small mouse strains. With epistasis, it is expected that these  recombinant inbred lines will evolve different genetic backgrounds. This  will be tested by mating males from sever al inbred strains into each of  the Large x Small recombinant inbred lines. If the effect of these  \"migrant\" males differs depending on which recombinant inbred strain it  is mated to, the genetic background of the recombinant inbred strains  has evolved. The effect of mutations, or migrants, entering each strain  will vary, depending on the genetic background. The evolution of genetic  background during population divergence and/or speciation can result in  the same gene (introduced by migration or mutation) having a different  effect in different subpopulations resulting in the evolutionary  divergence and even reproductive isolation of the populations, even  under similar selection pressures.",
