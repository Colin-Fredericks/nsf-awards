 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616290  Raymond, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology  \"Boundary Layer Quasi-equilibrium and Tropical Atmospheric Circulations\"          Dr. Raymond will explore the idea that moist convection over the  tropical oceans is controlled by the entropy balance of the sub-cloud layer  of the atmosphere.  This hypothesis, known as the boundary layer quasi-  equilibrium (BLQ), will be examined through a series of modeling  experiments with a recently developed cumulus ensemble model and  with the principal investigator's equatorial beta plan primitive equation  model as well as through analysis of TOGA COARE data.  Dr. Raymond also  will explore the consequences of this hypothesis for tropical atmospheric  circulations in general.    Simply stated, this hypothesis asserts that the boundary or sub-cloud layer  rapidly adjusts to the inflow and outflow of moist entropy in such a way  that inflow balances outflow on time scales of half a day or greater.  In  the moist tropics, the primary elements in this process are sea-air fluxes  and convective and mesoscale downdrafts from moist convection,  although dry entrainment into the boundary layer can be important in  instances where very dry air exists just above the boundary layer.  The net  result is that sea-air fluxes (and in some case, dry entrainment) exert a  strong control on convective activity.          In pursing this hypothesis, Dr. Raymond will focus on three issues:   (1)  the scales of motion over which the BLQ applies, (2) how variations in  middle level atmospheric moisture, wind-shear and related conditions  affect the ratio of updrafts and downdrafts and thus the boundary layer  balance, and (3) the implications of BLQ with respect to large-scale tropical  circulations.            This work has important implications for the treatment of  convection in global climate and weather models.",
