These advances in miniaturization of integrated circuits have been made possible by the use of plasmas (ionized gases) in the etching of fine features in semiconductor chips and the deposition of insulating and conducting layers into small spaces.  Up to now the problem has been to generate high-density plasmas (HDPS) that can produce a uniform flux of positively charged ions over a 12-inch diameter silicon wafer, on which hundreds of chips, each containing millions of transistors, can be made simultaneously.  To help fulfill this need, one of the new \"inductive\" plasma sources, the helicon source, was intensely studied by the UCLA group under NSF sponsorship for six years.  Plasma production is no longer a primary concern of the industry.\r\n\r\nAmore urgent problem has arisen, however, and that is charge-induced damage to thin insulating layers, usually silicon dioxide, that are used to insulate the input terminals (\"gates\") of transistors.  As designers make the transistors ever smaller, the gates have to be ever thinner in proportion, reaching thicknesses of less than 50A (or 5 nm).  These thin gates are subject to damage during plasma processing.  Electrical charges can build up on them and cause internal defects that can render the entire transistor useless.  This is a serious problem in maintaining a high yield of good chips on a wafer.  Though the statistics of oxide damage has been documented, the cause of the damage is not yet well understood.  Originally, it was thought that magnetic fields and plasma nonuniformities were the causes of the charge imbalance.  More recently, it has been suggested that the \"electron shading\" phenomenon, in which electrons are blocked from reaching the bottoms of deep trenches in patterned wafers, is a much more serious effect.\r\n\r\nFew basic experiments have been performed, especially outside of Japan, to elucidate the causes of charge damage, leading to ideas for its prevention.  This proposal is to design and perform experiments to measure charging effects in high-density RF plasma sources.  In particular, we plan to tackle two aspects of charge buildup which are not being examined elsewhere: 1) pulsed charging which occurs only in certain phases of the RF cycle, and 2) charging due to low-frequency instabilities occurring in magnetized plasma sources.\r\n\r\n",
