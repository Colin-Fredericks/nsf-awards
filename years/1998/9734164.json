 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of the research activity is developing new tools  and techniques for attacking fundamental problems in  computational complexity theory. One thrust is the search  for adaptations of the probabilistic method of Paul Erdos to  uniform complexity theory.  A second thrust is the  investigation of the connections between various questions  in complexity theory and various structural and algorithmic  questions concerning robust error-correcting codes, and  related algebraic and geometric structures.  In addition to  contributions to complexity theory, this research has the  potential for making contributions to the probabilistic  method; derandomization and coding theory. The educational  activities are centered around the broader goal of designing  an undergraduate curriculum in theoretical computer science  for the new millennium.  The motivation stems from the  growing importance of program correctness, and from the need  to design theory curricula relevant to and reflecting the  changing role of computer science.  The educational activity  integrates and unifies discrete mathematics, automata and  formal language theory, program verification and  correctness, and computational complexity theory.  A  highlight is a novel application of automata theory as an  effective playground for teaching program correctness. The  educational activities also include developing a curriculum  in algorithm engineering, with a vision to integrate  research, education, experimentation and training in  algorithm design and implementation, and with specific goals  to develop ultra-efficient implementations of fundamental  algorithms for massive data sets.",
