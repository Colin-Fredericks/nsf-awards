 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Romberg Tiburon Center for Environmental Studies is a  marine laboratory operated by San Francisco State University  (SFSU), a predominantly undergraduate institution (M.A.)  highest degree awarded) with a 57% minority enrollment.  The  Romberg Tiburon Center (RTC) is the only academic research  facility on San Francisco Bay, one of the largest estuaries  in the US It is primarily a graduate facility with a tightly  focused research mission aimed toward gaining fundamental  understanding of the physical and bilogical processes of San  Francisco Bay and its surrounding environments. Research  scientists at RTC have trained and supported over 45  students in the last five years and have extensive  collaborations with fellow university, and federal and local  environmental agency scientists.  RTC initiated in 1996 its annual Visiting Scientists  Program, which supports a visiting scientist at the  Center, and 2 other visiting scientists will be in  residence in 1997-1998 as well.  Fundamental aspect of  RTC's research and educational program involves the use  of the Research Vessel, the R/V Questuary.  This 38  foot vessel was acquired in 1991 and underwent major  renovations costing approximately $90,000 in order to  be re-engined this year. Although the Questuary is now  a modern, sea worthy vessel, it is capable of limited  oceanographic sampling and database development due to  its out-of-date navigational and scientific sampling  equipment.  The primary objective of this project  is to upgrade the scientific capabilities of the  Center's primary research vessel by acquiring an  integrated instrument package to collect environmental  data with high spatial and temporal resolution and  state-of-the-art data acquisition and storage.",
