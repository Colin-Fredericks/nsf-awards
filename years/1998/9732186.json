 "awd_abstract_narration": "Normalization, i.e., the simplification of expressions with  respect to a set of rules called a rewrite system, is a  fundamental computational step found in virtually all symbolic  computation and computer algebra systems. Applications of this  operation include functional, equational and logic programming  languages, abstract data type specification and verification,  automated deduction, code generation, type inferencing, and  computer algebra. This proposal addresses both algorithmic and  foundational aspects of this important problem in symbolic  computing and computer algebra. The project involves the  development of algorithms which use preprocessing and static  analysis for matching and normalization with respect to static  rules, and incremental algorithms for matching and normalization  with respect to dynamic rule sets.  Algorithms which learn  efficiently from their history will be designed for normalization  with respect to several important and useful classes of rewrite  systems. The practical performance of our algorithms will be  investigated.  Techniques and sufficient  conditions for the  important unique normal form property for nonlinear rewrite  systems and conditional rewrite systems will be devised. Abstract  Church-Rosser properties will be investigated for hierarchical  combinations of rewriting modulo equational theories. Existing  sufficient conditions for the Church-Rosser property of nonlinear  hierarchical combinations of ordinary and conditional rewrite  systems will be generalized. Hierarchical combinations are the  way in which most specifications and software are written. The  project is expected to:  (i) be useful in enhancing the  efficiency and power of symbolic computation and computer algebra  systems,  (ii) provide understanding of the inherent/complexities  of the involved operations, and (iii) yield new results,  techniques and insight into two fundamental issues of rewrite  systems, viz., uniqueness of normal forms and the Church-Rosser  property.",
