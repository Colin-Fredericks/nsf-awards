 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physical and biological processes are historically  considered to be the most  important  factors affecting the  carbon cycle in the ocean. Specific processes  include  air-  sea CO2 exchange, surface mixing, venting  of  deep waters,  carbon  fixation,  respiration, calcium carbonate  formation  and sedimentation. Recent   studies now suggest that   light-  initiated (photochemical)  processes also strongly impact  carbon cycling  at  the  sea surface,  particularly with  respect to the photodegradation  of  dissolved organic  carbon (DOC)  and  the production of  bacterial  substrates.  The evidence for the importance of photochemical oxidation  of aged, biologically refractory DOC includes: 1)  irradiation of sterile-filtered seawater results in  high  production rates of COz, CO and biologically  utilizable substrates, 2)  low productivity central gyres  appear to be net  heterotrophic  (i.e., bacterial  C  utilization rates often exceed primary productivity rates),  3) bacterial C  utilization rates are estimated to be about  the  same as  the production  rate of biologically labile  substrates from DOM photodegradation in  open oceanic  surface waters, and 4) a significant fraction of the carbon  assimilated  by open ocean bacteria in surfaces waters is  isotonically old. Despite  this  strong evidence the  quantitative importance of photochemistry in the oceanic  carbon cycle is still unknown.            Studies will focus on: (1) the photochemical  production of CO2 and CO from  marine DOM, (2) the  photochemical loss of DOC, and (3) the microbial uptake  and  remineralization of photooxidized DOM. Results will  assess  the  impact  of  photochemistry on carbon fluxes and organic  carbon  mass balances   in   the      water column, including  primary    and   bacterial  productivities,   microbial  respiration  and,  at   the  BATS  station,  particulate   carbon   fluxes.   We  expect   Bacterial  utilization of photooxidized,  aged  DOM  may largely  explain  the appare nt discrepancy between  high  bacterial C  utilization rates and low primary productivity rates  that  have  been  frequently observed for low productivity  waters. Another  important goal of this study is to develop  algorithms,  based  on action   spectra,  DOM  absorbance  and surface  irradiance,  to  predict  photochemical rates  in surface waters. These algorithms  in  combination with remotely sensed DOM fluorescence to Predict  CO2 and CO photochemical production  and DOC  photodegradation rates over large areas of the ocean.  Previous successes in studying photochemical processes in  a  variety  of marine environments  gives  a  strong  foundation  for assessing the  importance of these processes in the oceanic carbon cycle.",
