 "awd_abstract_narration": "9808120  Moerland  This three year project by Dr. Moerland is a comprehensive study of the effects of temperature on intracellular diffusion, which is a process of fundamental importance to all cells.  Diffusion of small water-borne molecules, including those with key roles in energy metabolism, will be examined in muscle by PFG-NMR, a technique that is closely related to clinical magnetic resonance imaging.  The sensitivity of diffusion to naturally relevant changes in temperature will be measured.  Diffusion measurements will be compared with the internal structure of muscle cells, as measured by electron microscopy, to identify those feature of the cellular architecture that determine patterns of intracellular diffusion.  Experiments will be performed on select muscles that represent a range of cell structure from fish and invertebrates.  This project will make a threefold contribution: First, it will contribute to our basic understanding of the effects of temperature on intracellular diffusion in all cell types.  Second, it will contribute to our overall understanding of the mobility of energetically important compounds in muscle.  Third, it will provide fundamental information about the structural properties of the living cytoplasm.  Further, this project will contribute to the training and development of scientific investigators, including undergraduate and graduate students.",
