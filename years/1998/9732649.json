Ross\r\n\r\nAbstract: In this project, Ross plans to investigate the shift operator (i.e., multiplication by the independent variable) on various spaces of analytic and harmonic functions. Specifically, he plans to look at the lattice of invariant subspaces of the shift operator on the Hardy space of a \"slit domain\" in the complex plane. Invariant subspaces of Hardy spaces on other types of domains such as the disk, the annulus, and \"crescent\" domains  were examined by Beurling, Sarason, Hitt, Aleman, Richter, Olin, and Yakubovich. Ross also plans to look at the 1 and 2 invariant subspaces of the (formal) shift operator on spaces of harmonic functions on the disk (e.g., the Bergman and Dirichlet spaces) and, in particular, to examine (via duality) how complications in one space are realized in the other. \r\n\r\nThis work combines two fields of mathematics, harmonic function theory and operator theory, both of which stem from classical problems in physics (such as heat diffusion and electrostatics) which are still active areas of research today.  It is the hope that a better mathematical understanding of the functions and operators involved will shed new light on the physical processes themselves. Investigations of the mathematics generated by the above physics problems goes back to 18th and 19th century mathematicians such as Fourier, Dirichlet, Kelvin, Weierstrass, and von Neumann and continues today with ground breaking work of mathematicians from all over the world.\r\n",
