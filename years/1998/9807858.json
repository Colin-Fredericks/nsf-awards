 "awd_abstract_narration": "9807858  White           Neuroscientists have long wished they had the means to    switch different types of brain cell off and back on again in    experimental animals. By doing so, they could investigate    quite specifically how each type of brain cell helps the    brain perform its various functions. The aim of this project    is to develop just such a technique in genetically engineered    mice. The technique makes use of a kind of protein called a    potassium channel, commonly used by cells to carry electrical    signals. The potassium channel in this case has been altered,    however, to act as a current shunt and to effectively short-    circuit the cells that express it. By directing the    expression of this \"shunt channel\" to specific classes of    brain cells and by controlling its expression with a drug it    can be transformed into a cell-type specific switch. When the    \"shunt channel\" is expressed, the brain cells that express it    will be \"off,\" or electrically silent; when it is not    expressed, the brain cells will be \"on,\" and functioning    normally.       Techniques for regulating protein expression in the manner    described are being developed in mice, specifically for a    class of brain cell thought to be essential in memory    formation. These cells, called hippocampal pyramidal cells,    will be the first target for testing the \"shunt channel\"    switch. The hope is to demonstrate that these hippocampal    pyramidal cells can be turned \"on\" and \"off,\" using the    technique described, and that their role in memory formation    can be better defined. In particular, it will be interesting    to see if the ability to form memories can be switched \"on\"    and \"off with these brain cells. If the technique is    successful, it should allow not only a more detailed    dissection of the process of memory than has been possible so    far, but also provide the general method for studying brain    cell function that brain scientists have long sought.",
