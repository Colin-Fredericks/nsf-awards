The project is a theoretical one which uses  extensive numerical calculations and addresses issues  related to properties of electrons and their interactions  near the so-called metal-insulator transition.    An important example of disordered systems with interactions  between particles is that of Anderson-localized systems with  Coulomb interactions.  For such systems Anderson showed that  a metal-insulator transition (MIT) ensues as the magnitude  of disorder increases in relation to the quantum mechanical  overlap energies between nearest neighbor particles.  In the  original discussion the effects of electron-electron  interactions were neglected.  Numerous studies have been  made of Coulomb effects on the metallic side of the MIT.  While effort has gone into how interactions affect the  insulating side of the transition, this problem has been  more resilient to progress.  Electron-electron interactions  energies on the insulating side are often of the same order  as other energies of the system and, hence, cannot be  neglected.    Many aspects of disordered systems with electron-electron  interactions are still poorly understood.  This grant will  focus on the question of how long-range electron-electron  interactions affect the degree of electron localization on  the insulating side of the MIT.  The method to be used is a  theoretical/computational approach which starts with  electronic states corresponding to the well-localized limit.  Using these states as a basis, one then computes the states  as lattice spacing decreases.  Those states and the energy  spectrum are then analyzed by comparing various measures of  the degree of delocalization for systems with and without  long-range interactions.  The research will investigate such  questions as the effect of system size on the results, as  well as that of dimensionality, density of sites, strength  of the disorder, and the effect of boundary condit ions.  %%%  This is an award for Research at Undergraduate Institutions  (RUI).
