The REU site will compliment the department's Senior Departmental Honors Program, which requires seniors to complete a research project and write a senior thesis.  All of the activities will focus on the various aspects of research: problem formulation, experimentation, analysis, publication and presentation.  The participants will be challenged intellectually and will learn to work independently.  The one-on-one contact with faculty and interaction with graduate students will also introduce these students to the opportunities in graduate education and the career options in research and academia.    The research projects will span the areas of thermal and fluid science, mechanical and manufacturing systems, engineering mechanics, and materials.  Students will work intensively on a prearranged research project which matches their interests with that of a departmental faculty member.  In addition, they will attend lectures on research ethics, graduate education, teaching as a profession, and professionalism.  Workshops will be conducted on written and oral presentation.  The program will culminate in the preparation of a written report, by each student, of their work and a poster session in which they will describe their work to interested parties from the university and regional engineering community.",
