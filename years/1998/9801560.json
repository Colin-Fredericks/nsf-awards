He will investigate the structure of the algebraic K-theory of fields by analyzing the associated motivic cohomology from a geometric perspective, with an eye to the relation with etale K-theory.  He will study the analogous decomposition for the negative K-theory of singular varieties using Adams operations, and see how much of the known structure for K-theory is present in cyclic homology. Finally he will attack Berger's conjecture for curves by means of a reduction to differentials on finite-dimensional algebras.\r\n\r\nWeibel proposes to do research on three types of invariants:  algebraic K-theory, motivic cohomology and cyclic homology.  These measure properties of both algebraic objects like rings and fields, and geometric objects like varieties.  Recent developments indicate that there is a strong interplay between these invariants.  Weibel will attempt to use geometric methods, appropriate to motivic cohomology, and homological methods, appropriate to cyclic homology, to relate the structures found in these three invariants.\r\n",
