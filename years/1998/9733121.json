More specifically, they form the heart of the Power Electronics Building Block (PEBB).  The objective of the proposed research is to develop a new class of power semiconductor devices, the emitter-controlled thyristors (ECTs) for the PEBB.\r\n\r\nThe approach taken in developing the ECTs will include rigorous numerical modeling and analysis, as well as experimental verification through layout design and clean room fabrication.  Optimization of the ECT will also be done to assess its potential as a commercially viable power industry (Harris Semiconductor) and other universities (Stanford).\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of an education plan are : 1) to teach students the fundamental principles of semiconductor devices and their applications; 2) to develop a novel and innovative Web-based Virtual Technology CAD (VTCAD) system for semiconductor device education and research; 3) to renovate and enhance existing courses with new materials directly from research covering advanced power semiconductor devices and power integrated circuits; 4) to continuously improve teaching skills by attending advanced teaching short courses or seminars, and by consulting students and peers on a regular basis; 5) to supervise graduate students and reach out to society.  The significance of planned educational activities is to provide graduates who are not limited to a specific job function, but who are equipped to learn new intellectual skills and knowledge and to make technological innovations that will serve our societal and national goals.  \r\n***  \r\n",
