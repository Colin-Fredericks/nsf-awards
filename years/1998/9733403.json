 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Todd Martinez of the University of Illinois is supported by a   CAREER grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to   develop theoretical tools that address nonadiabatic effects on gas- and   condensed-phase chemical reaction dynamics.  Photochemical cis/trans   isomerizations and ring opening/closing processes will be investigated   using calculations of potential energy surfaces, their couplings, and   multiple electronic state nuclear dynamics.  Improved continuum models   for predicting electronic structure in solution and quasi-ligand   approaches for reducing the number of electrons explicitly considered   will be employed.  Novel educational ideas include incorporating organic   photochemistry examples  and modern computational chemistry software into   undergraduate and graduate physical chemistry courses.   Photochemical processes are important in vision and biosynthesis of   vitamin D as well as synthetic organic photochemistry.  A detailed   understanding of the electronic structure and dynamics of these reactions   will increase our ability to design new photochemical synthetic routes or   control known photochemical reactions.  Incorporating these research   topics into college chemistry courses allows students to see the   relationship between concepts and real-world applications.",
