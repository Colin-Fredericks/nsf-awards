 "awd_abstract_narration": "9871991  Ward  Center for Technology-Based Business Development  The University of Maine will create a Center for Technology-Based  Business Development to address Maine s shortcomings in the  creation of technology-based businesses and net exportation of it s  science and engineering graduates, as well as university based R&D.  Strong, decisive action will be taken to provide opportunities for  Maine-based technologies and students to develop companies in  Maine. This strategy is consistent with the state s Science and  Technology Plan and the state s economic development strategy .   The Center will build on the University of Maine s successful  industrial activity, and the practical experience of many other  research institutions. The Center will develop the necessary  organizational structure including: (1) an entrepreneurial  environment for faculty, student and industry interaction, a pro-  active technology transfer office with business development  expertise; shared labs; (2) equipment and incubation space for  small technology-based start-ups; and (3) new programs to educate  and encourage graduate-student and faculty entrepreneurs. The  multi-disciplinary activity will be directed at the state s and the  university s five targeted technology areas. This activity will  establish a critical piece of business development infrastructure  currently unavailable in Maine and allow the University of Maine to  take a leading role in technology transfer related economic  development.",
