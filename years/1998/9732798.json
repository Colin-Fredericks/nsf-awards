 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry   Program and the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry   (GOALI) program, addresses the molecular level mechanisms of the direct   synthesis of silicone precursors from silicon using copper catalysts, the   Muller-Rochow process.  The research combines UHV adsorption studies   carried out at Temple University under the direction of Professor   Strongin, with STM measurements of the reactant surface carried out by   Professor Hinch and coworkers at Rutgers University.  Scientists at Dow   Corning Corporation are involved in the evaluation of reaction kinetics   and selectivity of the catalysts designed by the group based on the   results of the molecular level investigations of reaction mechanism.    Understanding gained from these studies is applied directly in the   predictive design of catalysts for the Muller-Rochow process.  The   information gained from this work will have a direct impact on the   commercially important silicones industry.     The investigation of the molecular level mechanism of the direct   synthesis of silicone precursors on Cu/Si surfaces is the focus of this   research project.  A combination of basic studies of copper catalyzed    adsorption, morphological studies of the reacting silicon surface, and   kinetic studies of operating catalysts will provide information about   this technologically important process.  Researchers at Temple   University, Rutgers University, and the Dow Corning Corporation all   contribute to this research project.",
