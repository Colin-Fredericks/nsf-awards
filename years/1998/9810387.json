 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ultraviolet radiation is recognized only recently as an important  environmental parameter for marine animals. The strong scattering  properties of UV light in the sea create unique opportunities for signal  detection. It is now known that UV-A radiation (320-400 nni wavelength) is  present in a biologically useful intensity up to 400 m deep in clear  oceanic water. UV radiation on shallow tropical reefs can be a destructive  agent and many reef organisms produce special, UV-absorbing compounds to  protect their tissues against radiation damage. Many animals have  UV-blocking compounds in their eyes to reduce chromatic aberration and  radiation damage and are blind to UV radiation. Recently it was realized  that many reef animals lack UV-blocking compounds in their eyes and are  sacrificing focusing precision and risking potential damage to their eyes  in exchange for the advantages of UV vision. Unique UV-sensitive visual  pigments have evolved for the purpose of UV perception. Science knows  little about the distribution of this perceptual ability or the form of the  UV-perceptual world that may be very different from our own.       This study will explore the UV visual world of reef fishes - a world  that is denied to human visual senses. It will examine the hypothesis that  the phylogenetic origins of UV vision in fishes centered on detection of  pelagic objects such as zooplankton. UV vision while present for food  detection, would likely be evolutionarily co-opted for other functions such  as communication. Work will proceed on three fronts. Spectrophotometry will  indicate species that lack UV-blocking compounds in their eyes and thus  likely have UV vision.  UV vision will be confirmed by  microspectrophotometry. Using the comparative method, work will study  families that include zooplanktivores and other feeding guilds. Species  that use UV vision for food detection will likely have other functions such  as social communication. Field work with a UV-sensitive underwater video  system will describe the fixed and changing UV colorations of fish and  their background. Pilot studies have indicated various types of coloration  that are not evident in the human-visible spectrum. Some include a complete  reversal of the bright/dark reflecting areas that humans perceive. Imaging  will concentrate on reef sites such as cleaning stations that are visited  by many species that undergo coloration changes during cleaning. Both  visible and UV contrast of the colorations that are found will be  quantified to explore hypotheses as to the use of UV for close range social  communication and longer range broadcast signals. Thirdly, when species are  found with interesting UV coloration, field and aquarium studies will  establish the likely communication functions of the UV colors.       Understanding both the uses, and phylogenetic distribution, of UV  vision and coloration will help us understand the evolution of UV vision  and better predict the responses of organisms to changes in UV radiation  incident on our oceans. This understanding will also result in better  appreciation of the signal detection/transmission value of UV radiation in  aquatic media. Knowledge of the existence of unsuspected UV color patterns  in the fishes will greatly improve the validity of future studies of the  ecology and behavior of these species. At this time, we may literally be  `calling black, white!` For species important to commercial and sport  fisheries, knowledge of their visual world will impact the design of visual  lures as well as visual barriers intended to exclude unwanted `bycatch`. It  is hoped that the total benefits will rival those that resulted from  appreciation of the UV-visual world of terrestrial insects. As an  additional benefit, the survey of fish coloration will also result in  knowledge of the UV-absorbing characteristics of corals and algae in the  environment on a scale that was heretofore impossible. This knowledge may  lead to improvement of our understanding, management and conservation of  our sustainable shallow reef environments in a world of increasing UV  radiation.",
