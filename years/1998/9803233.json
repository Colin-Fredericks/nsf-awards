 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803233  Frohman       Frohman and his students will pursue the study of the Kauffman  bracket skein module as a means of relating quantum and classical  invariants.  They will continue to develop lattice gauge field theory  based on quantum SL(2,C).  This will lead to a general description of  the Kauffman bracket skein module of a 3-manifold as invariant  functions of the quantized flat SL(2,C) connections on a spine of the  three-manifold.  The goal is an intimate understanding of the  relationship between configurations lying in a manifold and the  algebraic structure of the Kauffman bracket skein module.  It should  also lead to a rigorous derivation of Witten's asymptotic expansion of  quantum invariants in terms of the representation theory of the  manifold.  A hyperbolic structure on the complement of a knot induces  a similarity structure on the peripheral torus.  It is their intention  to carry out an analogous construction in the noncommutative  setting.  They will derive a noncommutative analog of the A-polynomial,  which will in turn allow the relationship between the A-polynomial and  the colored Jones polynomial to be explicated.  This work will uncover  that part of the Jones polynomial that is related to the hyperbolic  geometry of the knot complement.  Finally they will see how the  Kauffman bracket skein module of a knot induces a geometry on the  noncommutative torus.       The best way to understand topology is as an extension of  elementary geometry.  Recall that two triangles are congruent if there  is a rigid motion of the plane that takes one to the other.  Rigid means  that the motion preserves all distances and angles.  The geometric  classification of triangles states that two triangles are congruent if  their sides are of the same length.  In topology, a larger collection  of congruence transformations is used, specifically any motion of the  plane that sends near points to near points (although the  transformation may distort distances).  Sometimes topology is refer red  to as rubber sheet geometry, as congruence transformations may stretch  the plane arbitrarily.  Under this notion of geometry, any two  triangles are congruent, and in fact they are all congruent to a  circle.  The topological study of circles embedded in 3-space (knots)  is much more subtle.  A major problem is how to make ``topological''  measurements.  That is, associate numbers to a knot that are unchanged  by topological congruence transformations.  In the 1980's, work of Jones  and Witten heralded a new age of knot theory with the introduction of  quantum invariants.  These invariants are derived from techniques in  operator theory and quantum mechanics.  Frohman and his students will  study these invariants from a viewpoint that allows them to be related  to invariants of knots coming from more classical techniques.  These  investigations will enrich topology, quantum mechanics, and operator  algebras by adding deeper connections between standard constructions  in each field.  ***",
