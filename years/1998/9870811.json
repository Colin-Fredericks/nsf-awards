 "awd_abstract_narration": "98-70811    BRONSON, F.H.    The brain monitors body fatness by assessing the amount of  leptin in circulation.  Leptin is the protein product of a  gene that is expressed only in fat cells.  It has been  hypothesized that leptin acts as a metabolic gate for  puberty in females.  That hypothesis stems from correlative  studies and relates to an older and quite controversial  hypothesis, namely that the pubertal ovulation cannot occur  until energy stores are adequate to support pregnancy and  lactation.  A worry about both of these hypotheses is that  they stem from experiments done in conditions that are  exceptionally benign compared to those in which the  relationship between leptin, fatness and ovulation actually  evolved.  The first specific aim of this proposal is to test  these two hypotheses using wild house mice that are exposed  to conditions that mimic those that wild animals experience  in nature.  The alternative hypotheses being offered here  are (a)  that a young female must be in positive energy  balance in order to ovulate but that energy reserves per se  are important only indirectly in that they are a component  of the energy balancing process and thus (b) that leptin  does not act as a metabolic gate for puberty. Numerous  studies in a variety of laboratories have shown that  circulating levels of leptin are important in regulating  feeding behavior. The worry here again is that these studies  have been done in oversimplified conditions and that the  relationship between leptin and feeding behavior is much  more complex that now thought.  The second specific aim of  this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the the effect  of leptin on feeding behavior is actually only one component  of its role in regulating the economics of foraging  (calories gained vs. calories lost while foraging) This  hypothesis will be tested using wild house that are exposed  to the kinds of complex foraging conditions they would  experience in the wild. Overall, the object of this proposal  is  to greatly clarify the relationship between energy  balance, foraging behavior, leptin and puberty.",
