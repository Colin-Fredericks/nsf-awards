 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to allow physics majors at Grinnell College to work with fundamental concepts of solid-state physics through the application of modern experimental techniques to problems of interest to practicing physicists. This project is a logical extension of earlier efforts that culminated in the acquisition of a flexible materials testing instrument, which has been used to integrate solid-state physics experiments into the department' s sophomore- and senior-level lab courses. The department is using several upgrades to enhance the capabilities of this instrument. Thus enhanced, the materials testing instrument makes possible three significant curricular developments. First, it permits the introduction of heat capacity measurements into the curriculum in both the sophomore- and senior-level lab courses. Second, it allows the modification of existing experiments in these courses to explore anisotropic phenomena in a two-dimensional electron gas and in high-temperature superconductors. Third, it enables students contemplating independent research projects in solid-state physics to choose from a wider range of options. The success of this project is evaluated by assessing student competence in these solid-state physics topics both before and after the implementation of the changes. Once these labs have been developed and tested, they will be disseminated through publications in appropriate journals and through presentations at relevant conferences.",
