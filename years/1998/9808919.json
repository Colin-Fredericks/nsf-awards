In particular, electrical activity  can influence the development of mechanisms involved in regulating  the internal calcium concentration ( Ca++ i) of nerve cells.  The  regulation of  Ca++ i is very important since internal calcium  regulates a broad spectrum of events ranging from neuronal growth  during development, to communication between neurons in the adult,  to cell death in the aging nervous system.  Recent findings show  that activity-dependent changes in calcium regulation influence  the growth and degeneration of axons (the elongated portion of the  nerve cell that forms connections with other cells).  The growing  tip of the axon, the growth cone, controls the extent and  direction of axon elongation and, thus, allow the formation of  appropriate connections during development and nerve regeneration.  The actions of growth cones are regulated by changes in  Ca++ i  resulting from calcium entry through channels and calcium removal  through its binding to calcium-buffering proteins, uptake into  organelles, and extrusion across the outer cell membrane.  Moderate changes in  Ca++ i can influence the rate of growth, and  large increases in  Ca++ i can produce axon retraction and  degeneration.  Increased electrical activity strengthens calcium  removal, influencing the response of the growing axon to  environmental cues as well making it more resistant to  degeneration.  Dr. Lnenicka has planned experiments to identify  the calcium-removal processes that are strengthened by increased  electrical activity, and to determine whether altered activity  produces changes in the sensitivity of the growth cone to  Ca++ i.  He will also examine the effect of increased electrical activity  upon the structure of growing axons.  Finally, the mechanisms  through which electrical activity produces these neuronal changes  will be explored.  These st udies are possible by utilizing the  relatively simple nervous system of the crayfish, where large  identified cells with differences in activity and growth cone  properties can be directly examined.  Dr. Lnenicka has previously  developed a cell-culture system of identified crayfish neurons,  and in these studies, he will use time-lapse video-microscopy to  follow the developing growth cones in the cultures under various  treatment conditions.  Calcium removal processes will be examined  by measuring the changes in  Ca++ i in growth cones with the  fluorescent calcium indicator, fura-2.  Axon and growth cone  structure will be examined with light and electron microscopy.  These studies will advance our knowledge of the basic mechanisms  of nerve regeneration and the influence of experience on the  formation and plasticity of the nervous system.",
