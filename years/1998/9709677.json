 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the relation of positive and negative mood states to people's ability and willingness to attend to and process negative information about themselves. Most current theories of mood and cognition predict that positive mood, relative to negative mood, makes people less likely to attend to and process negative information. For example, many theories predict that people are motivated to maintain good moods and so should avoid any information that might jeopardize their good mood. If this is the case, the psychological implications of positive mood are striking: what makes people feel good, also makes them less likely to pay attention to potentially useful but negative information. Failing to attend to negative information and to use it in related judgments can have serious costs in contexts such as education, health, work, and interpersonal relations. In contrast to recent findings, however, the PI has found that positive mood and beliefs can increase one's attention to and more effortful processing of negative information when the information is self-relevant or important. This suggests that positive moods and beliefs may bolster people's ability to attend to negative information, but little is understood about this  process. The current research includes nine experiments to test the processes through which positive mood may facilitate attention to and use of specific kinds of negative information in judgments. The goal of the research is to increase understanding of the factors that affect people's willingness and ability to confront negative information and to highlight the role of positive feelings and beliefs in the management of negative events and information.",
