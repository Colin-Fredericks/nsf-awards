The research will target the lead content in the air in the city of Cairo with the purpose of assessing its level, testing remedial procedures to reduce it, and assessing the results of several procedures..  Specifically the scientists plan to study point sources such as lead smelters to assess the dispersion from these sources and how they contribute to the ambient air using experimental and dispersion models using a K-e based turbulence approach; then pilot-scale testing of one or more filtration devices, along with the post-remedial measurements of the particulate lead concentrations along the emitted plume will be carried out.     Scope:  The US scientists are an experienced researchers in the area of environmental sciences and technology.  They have participated with the Egyptian collaborator in a major project in Egypt to develop a Center for Environmental hazard Mitigation (CEHM) at Cairo University.  The CEHM is a national undertaking, with support from the Egyptian and US governments, which has extensive facilities for the type of research proposed here.  The Egyptian collaborator has extensive experience in fluid dynamics and in energy systems.   the problem to be addressed is a major problem in Cairo and in many of the world's largest cities in the developing countries.  Successful results could be applied in other situations.  This proposal meets INT objective of supporting US-foreign collaboration in areas of mutual benefit.  The project was generated as a result of a workshop on environmentally clean technologies that was organized, in 1996, by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Egyptian Government.  EPA was  involved in the evaluation of the project and in recommending its support.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, administered by the US Department of State, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out cooperative activities.  ***",
