 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is motivated by interest in the outcome of competition among national and global financial exchanges and by an enduring desire to understand the evolution of American capital markets and their relationship to long term economic growth.  As an endeavor that combines economics, finance, and history, it uses the financial history of the United States in the nineteenth century as a laboratory to study competition among stock exchanges.  The project gathers evidence on the relative importance of the Boston, New York, and Philadelphia stock exchanges; assembles information on internal and external changes that affected the evolution of these markets; and tests plausible hypotheses about factors that influenced their relative success.  The goal is to explain why New York emerged as the nation's dominant exchange in competition in other regional markets.  The findings will interest economic historians who seek to understand the connection between financial exchanges and economic performance; economists who study competition across markets, and policy makers who seek to improve America's competitive position in international financial markets.",
