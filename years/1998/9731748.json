The lead institution is Johns Hopkins University in partnership with Carnegie Mellon University and Shadyside Hospital, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Brigham & Women's Hospital.  The award funds the first five years of effort under a new cooperative agreement, with a potential duration of ten years.  The vision of the ERC is to advance knowledge and technology needed to develop a new generation of minimally invasive surgery techniques for the 21st century, which will dramatically impact health care in the U.S., reaping substantial economic and social impacts.  Critical to the vision are two core concepts:  1) Computer-assisted surgical planning/computer assisted surgical execution systems will integrate accurate patient-specific models, surgical plan optimization permitting the plans to be carried out accurately, safely, and with minimal invasiveness; 2) Surgical Assistant Systems will work cooperatively with surgeons in carrying out precise and minimally invasive surgical procedures.  The center's research program is multidisciplinary and designed to produce fundamental advances in core technologies of modeling and analysis and interfacial technologies for surgical systems.  These will be integrated into a robust, modular family of systems and subsystems promoting rapid prototyping of multi-surgical testbed applications, as well as facilitating transfer to end use within commercialized systems.  A multidisciplinary educational program will facilitate the training of engineers, scientists, and clinicians to advance all phases of this work from basic research to deployed systems.  Practitioners and industry will be actively involved in the center.  NSF funds will be used for the fundamental research needed to explore and advance these concepts, clinical work will be supported through other sources.    This award is the outcome of the entry of  this ERC's preproposal in the FY 1997-98 Engineering Research Centers Competition under the ERC Program Announcement, NSF 97-5.",
