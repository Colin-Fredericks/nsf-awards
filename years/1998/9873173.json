 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular Information and Computer Modeling in Cardiac Electrophysiology\r\n>\r\n> Simultaneous with the explosion in computer speed and ability,\r\n>the biological sciences have been undergoing a revolution.  There has \r\n>also been an explosive increase in the quantitative understanding of the \r\n>fundamental building blocks of life.  The emergence of molecular biology \r\n>has defined biology with mathematical precision through the genetic \r\n>code. We now have the tools to study and manipulate biology at the level\r\n>of individual molecules.  This has resulted in an explosion of data.  This \r\n>project examines how one class of molecules, ion channels generates, \r\n>controls and coordinates normal and abnormal electrical activity in the \r\n>heart.  Recently developed techniques in molecular biology can tell us the \r\n>tissue distribution of an ion channel type over the entire heart, down to \r\n>microscopic resolution.  Previous techniques could only provide \r\n>resolution down to a few millimeters and the currents from only a few \r\n>cells could be measured within this space.  Thus, molecular biology has \r\n>provided us with a several orders of magnitude increase in information \r\n>concerning the density, cellular and tissue distribution of the excitable \r\n>elements in the heart.  This is a several orders of magnitude increase in \r\n>information over that available only a couple of years ago.  It is a major \r\n>computational challenge to organize, display, interpret and utilize this \r\n>new information.  This project will develop the computational tools to \r\n>analyze this molecular information from a systems point of view.  This \r\n>proposal seeks to develop the mathematical and computational tools to \r\n>integrate this emerging data from molecular to organ function in cardiac \r\n>muscle.  It will develop efficient methods to look at how patterns of \r\n>electrical activity in individual cells are coordinated across the entire \r\n>heart and how slow molecular processes, i.e. memory, influence events \r\n>which occur on millisecond time scales during regular beating of the \r\n>heart.\r\n> Ion channels are found in all living cells.  Coordinated ionic \r\n>responses arising from multicellular interactions are an integral part of \r\n>the physiology of many organs.  Chaotic behavior and abnormal electrical \r\n>activity is not only a problem in the heart where it may underlie fatal \r\n>arrhythmias, but also plays a role in neurological disorders such as\r\n>seizures. Action potentials and electrically coordinated activation of ion \r\n>channels occurs across  a wide variety of species.  Similar mechanisms \r\n>govern the leaf closing touch response of the Mimosa, heliotropism and \r\n>solute transport in root systems.  Thus, the mathematical formulation of \r\n>coordinated ion channel activity in heterogeneous systems is of wide \r\n>application across biology.\r\n",
