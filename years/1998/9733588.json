Key  research activities include: 1) Integrating research findings in  software reliability engineering and software measurement to  assess and improve software quality over extended development  phases and application domains. 2) Developing analysis techniques  and tools to effectively analyze diverse measurement data. 3)  Practical implementation of this integrated approach and  adaptation of it to a wide variety of software development  environments in collaboration with several industrial partners.  (4) Developing or enhancing several graduate and undergraduate  level courses in software engineering and computer science.  The  key benefits of this research project include: (1)  a systematic  technique to measure software quality early in development and to  identify early problems for effective quality improvement, (2)  construction of support tools that can help the implementation  and deployment of these techniques in industry, and (3)  educational opportunities for students to work on leading edge  research projects that solve practical problems.  ***",
