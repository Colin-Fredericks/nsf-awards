 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the utilization of allene oxides and   cyclopropanones as synthetic intermediates for the synthesis of a wide   range of carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring systems occurring in natural   products.  The thermal rearrangement of fulvene endoperoxides gives rise   to the desired intermediates. Intramolecular  McMurray reactions, claisen   condensations,  enol lactone formation and sigmatropic shifts are among   the reactions to be explored.   The investigations will be carried out   with the help of undergraduate coworkers.  With this Research in   Undergraduate Institutions award, the Organic and Macromolecular   Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational activities   of Dr. Ihsan Erdan of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at San   Francisco State University.  Professor Erdan, with the help of   undergraduate participants, will focus his work on using the synthetic   intermediates obtained from the thermal rearrangement of cyclic   peroxides, fulvene endoperoxides,  for the synthesis of a wide range of   natural products.",
