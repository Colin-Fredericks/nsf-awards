Partial differential equations (PDEs) is the language of much of  science and engineering so that advances in PDEs and their  approximate solution are of continuing importance to applications.  The  general themes of the conference are recent advances and trends   in the theory and computation of PDEs, focusing on nonlinear models, algorithms,  and theoretical and computational results that are of importance in  applications. Interdisciplinary cross-fertilizations will be featured. This  aspect of the conference will especially benefit junior mathematicians who  will be exposed to the great variety of approaches and models that the  general PDE community has developed. A distinguished list of speakers will  be invited to the conference; there will also be ample time reserved for  young researchers to present their results. The featured speaker at the  conference will be Professor Olga Ladyzhenskaya of the Steklov Institute in  St. Petersburg, Russia. A discussion, led by notable researchers, about the  important trends that have been recently established and problems that the  PDE community should be addressing will take place. The conference should  be especially attractive to minorities and women. Speakers from these  groups, including the featured speaker, will be prominent at the conference  and help will be provided to junior participants representing these groups  for their expenses.",
