 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802445  Hall  This application requests partial funding for a FASEB Summer Research Conference on Renal Hemodynamics: Integration of Endothelial Epithelial and Vascular Control Mechanisms to be held on June 27-July 2, 1998 at Vermont Academy, Saxton's River, Vermont under the auspices of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB).  The conference will assemble investigators from multiple disciplines who use diverse approaches (cell and molecular to integrative whole animal) to understand the regulation of the renal circulation.  The format consists of nine major sessions, five morning and four evening sessions, with daily pre-dinner poster discussion sessions.  There will be approximately 75 invited speakers who, after brief overview by the session chairs, will address current unresolved issues and recent ongoing research directed at their resolution.  Each speaker has been asked to present their most recent unpublished work and to focus on identifying the major unanswered questions in the field and the experimental approaches to answering these questions.  Each presentation is followed by discussion and there is a large amount of time available in the afternoons for informal discussions among the participants.  Previous conferences in 1989, 1992, and 1995 were very successful and conducive to the exchange of ideas among the participants.  Given the rapid developments in this important area, we expect that the 1998 conference will foster further exchange and interaction among investigators working at different levels within this complex integrated system.  To stimulate future investigative interests in the area, attempts have been made to identify young investigators from active, contributing laboratories as speakers (including fellows and trainees) with special attention given to minorities and women.",
