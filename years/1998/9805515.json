The models consist of linear and\r\nnonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations.\r\nApplications of the research are made to the following projects:\r\n(1) population models of the blood production system and the\r\ncontinuous maturation-proliferation of precursor stem cells; (2)\r\npopulation models of the pathogenesis of HIV infection of the\r\nhuman immune system and the depletion of CD4 T lymphocytes during\r\nthe stages of AIDS progression; (3) population models of\r\nreplicative histories of cell lines as indicated by shortening of\r\ntelomere fragment lengths on the ends of chromosomes; and (4)\r\npopulation models of cell loss processes specific to the position\r\nG1, S, G2, M, or G0 in the cell cycle.  In these models the\r\nprincipal investigator studies the behavior of cells at the\r\npopulation level and the dynamic processes of cell division, cell\r\nmaturation, cell mortality, naive cell sources, and cell\r\ntransition to and from quiescence.  The principal investigator\r\nutilizes differential equations theory, operator theory,\r\nfunctional analysis, numerical analysis, and computational\r\nsimulation.\r\n     The significance of the research is in the development of\r\nmathematical methods to analyze the qualitative behavior of\r\nsolutions to the differential equations that describe cell\r\npopulation processes.  The principal investigator applies these\r\nmethods to the qualitative and quantitative understanding of cell\r\npopulation problems.  In this research the mathematical theory of\r\npopulation processes is applied to analyze normal and abnormal\r\nblood cell production systems, the depletion of CD4 T cells in\r\nthe HIV infected immune system during HIV progression to AIDS,\r\nand the growth of tumors.  The principal investigator studies\r\nthese biological phenomena as dynamic processes described by\r\nmathematical models of population behavior.  The research combines\r\ntheoretical mathematical analysis and numerical computer\r\nsimulations of the models.  The goal of the research is to advance\r\nunderstanding of normal and abnormal cell proliferation\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n",
