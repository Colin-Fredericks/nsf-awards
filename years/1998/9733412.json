 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award in the Inorganic,   Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research and   education on phosphorus chemistry by Dr. John D. Protasiewicz  in the   Chemistry Department, Case Western University.  The focus of the project   is synthesizing  multiply bonded phosphorus compounds, specifically for   the purpose of utilizing the reactivity of these species for development   of catalysts and materials.  Specific targets for synthesis are   diphospenes and polymers having two or more PX(X=C,N,P) multiply-bonded   sites.  The mechanism of formation of these compounds would also be   investigated.  Educational efforts would concentrate on development of a   project-based thematic undergraduate laboratory course.   As part of the   research-based, team-oriented approach, students would be introduced to   computer uses in literature searching, data storage and analysis, and   molecular modeling.  Extensive use is made of Internet capabilities.  Polymeric materials have wide utility in molecular devices and materials.    This research is aimed at  finding more effective routes to polymeric   materials that contain phosphorus, potentially widening the range of   properties currently available in materials.  The research is integrated   with undergraduate education not only in specific research projects but   in `discovery-based` laboratory courses.",
