 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810588  Storm    In light of recent progress in the design and manipulation  ceramic materials using processing-microstructure-property  relations, the theme of the 1998 Gordon Research Conference  on Solid State Studies in Ceramics is \"Tailored Ceramics-  Fundamental Challenges in Processing-Microstructure-Property  Relations.\"  The goals of the GRC in 1998 are two-fold.  First, to explore the current status of  processing-microstructureproperty relations as a means of  determining what is missing.  The problem is to explore at  what level of interrogation do we understand processing,  microstructure and properties.  The second goal of the  meeting is to explore basic science advances and needs over  the full spectrum of technical ceramics like ferroelectrics  and optical ceramics.  Although properties are established  by different physics, the underlying  processing-microstructureproperty themes are similar.  The  overall goal is to explore these common themes, discover new  opportunities, develop synergy and to cross-fertilize the  fields.  %%%  The invited speakers at the 1998 Gordon Research Conference  on Solid State Studies in Ceramics on \"Tailored Ceramics-  Fundamental Challenges in Processing- Microstructure-  Property Relations\" will be challenged to answer the  question of what scientific questions are still outstanding  in regards to tailoring ceramics.  Time is allotted to fully  explore the thoughts and visions of the speakers and the  audience.  In this manner the conferees will explore in  depth the current status of the technical ceramics field  which will allow us to project what type of research is  needed to make significant progress in designing and  producing tailored ceramics.  ***",
