 "awd_abstract_narration": "The applications that will be implemented on future high-bandwidth  networks of processors will be significantly more ambitious than  the current applications (which are mostly involved with  transmissions of digital data and images). This project attempts  to develop an object-based model of concurrent programming for  these applications, that permits the programmer to employ a  largely sequential style of programming for concurrent threads.  Concepts developed for databases, object-based programming and  reactive systems form the basis of this model.  The model is  minimal: no specific communication or synchronization mechanism,  except procedure call, is built into this model. The traditional  schemes for communication, synchronization, interfaces among  processes and accesses to shared memory are encoded by objects.  Concurrency is transparent to the programmer; the programmer  believes that the program executes in a sequential manner whereas  the implementation employs concurrent threads to gain efficiency.  The project plan is to solidify the theoretical foundation of the  work, and extend the basis of the model to make it more useful in  practice, introducing real time, dynamic object creation, more  general forms of parameter passing among object instances, and  recursive calls among concurrent threads.",
