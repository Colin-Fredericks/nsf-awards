 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9733124  Kasarda  Active magnetic bearings are a proven technology in turbomachinery applications, but their use in manufacturing equipment has received surprisingly little attention.  These bearings are feedback mechanisms that support a spinning shaft by levitating it in a magnetic field.  They increase operating efficiencies, improve control of rotor dynamics, and reduce equipment maintenance and waste associated with the replacement of used lubricants.  The feedback nature of the magnetic bearing also allows for the use of the bearing as a load cell to measure shaft forces.  The research plan of this CAREER project will investigate a new and innovative use of the force measurement capability of active magnetic bearings to supply information for statistical process control in manufacturing applications to improve the process/quality control of such products as textile fibers and photographic films.  Research tasks include the investigation of the design of active magnetic bearing systems for optimum shaft force measurement, development of on-line system calibration procedures, and the design and construction of an active magnetic bearing test rig for experimental verification. Components of this research are linked to the educational portion of the career development plan to promote the integration of engineering practice and engineering science.  This is accomplished partly through the development of a new \"hands-on\" undergraduate course in predictive/preventive maintenance with an innovative utilization of the resources at the Virginia Tech Power Plant.   The impact of this career development plan includes improving the design of active magnetic bearings for use in manufacturing equipment and enhancing the ability of US manufacturers to improve process/quality control.  This plan also impacts education by the incorporation of engineering practice into engineering education, resulting in the increased effectiveness in the preparation of graduating engineers for industry's needs.",
