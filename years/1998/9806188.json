 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST-9806188  Zita    Research quality astronomy observations by students and staff at Evergreen State College will be carried out  at the University of Washington at Seattle's (UW) Manastash Ridge Observatory (MRO).    The first step is to train observers  to use the telescope and work at MRO.   Observations, analysis of data, and upgrading the telescope will be carried  out. The MRO telescope will be upgraded  so that observations may by made remotely.  The facility will be with shared with other observers from other institutions.  Undergraduate students will take active part in the research, and they will be the first generation of students doing astronomy research at the Evergreen State College.    The  ongoing theoretical work strongly motivates the establishment of an Evergreen astronomy research program.  The  testing of new stellar dynamics models will guide the longer-term directions of  the future observational work.   At the present, astronomy observations at MRO will provide needed experience in observational research, and will facilitate improved communication with other observational astronomers, whose data presently relate to the  theory.   These activities will lay the groundwork for future theoretical and observational research.    A mechanism for the previously unexplained sound waves in magnetic, rapidly oscillating peculiar A stars is being examined.  The model extends the basic theory of force-free plasmas and describes how oscillations about a minimum in magnetic energy can drive magnetosonic modes. which appear as sound waves in the stars.   The energy, wavelength, and frequency for  the theoretical test case is consistent with observations.  The model can be tested further by making more detailed calculations and observations.   It is planned to learn enough observational astronomy to design a future research program to help test the model.   This is a key goal of the future activities.    The University of Washington will be involved in the training of  Evergreen faculty  and students to use the Manastash Ridge Observatory telescope.   The telescope will be  upgraded so that it can be operated remotely.    Students will work at the observatory in the summer and be involved in theoretical research  with Evergreen faculty.   Students will be able to participate in remote observations at MRO throughout the academic year.  They will  use software such as that developed by the University of California -Berkeley's Hands-On Universe project and UW's IRAF astronomical data processing system.    The  activities will build on new working relationships with local colleagues; enhance Evergreen students' education as well as research; and enable staff and students  to share remote astronomy observations with teachers and students throughout Washington state.  ***",
