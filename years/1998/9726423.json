 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. John W. Faller, Chemistry Department, Yale University, is supported   by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for   studies related to asymmetric and regioselective synthesis and catalysis   using metal complexes. New strategies will be developed for asymmetric   synthesis based on the use of readily available racemic ligands followed   by treatment with an inexpensive chiral poison to selectively deactivate   one enantiomer of the racemic mixture. The remaining ligand enantiomer   will be employed to prepare chiral metal catalysts. This general strategy   has been demonstrated for asymmetric hydrogenations and will be extended   to a number of other systems including a series of titanium-alkoxide   catalyzed reactions. More effective poisons will be developed and will be   applied to the preparation of chiral catalyst for a broad range of   asymmetric reactions that have conventionally used noble metal catalysts   prepared from enantiomerically pure phosphine ligands. In reactions where   dimers are active species, the conventional approach has involved the   dimerization of enantiomeric monomers. The possibility of enhancing   enantioselectivity through the use of pseudo-enantiomeric complexes,   which are composed of bimetallics containing different chiral ligands,   will be explored. Hemilabile ligands will be used to control the   stereochemistry in catalytic intermediates and to provide stoichiometeric   reagents for preparation of homoallylic alcohols by allyl addition to   aldehydes.  An object which is not the same as its mirror image (e.g. a left compared   to a right handed glove) is said to be chiral.  Many pharmaceutical and   agricultural  chemicals are chiral and often only one of the two mirror image molecules   is desired. Since it is difficult to obtain a single mirror image, the   production of such molecules is an important goal in contemporary   chemistry. In this project new strategies toward solving the problem of   `asymmetric synthesis` will be applied to a broad range of reactions and   new, more economic preparations of important molecules will be developed.   In addition to the chemical research, this project has the important   objective of training young scientist in the areas of metal catalysis and   asymmetric synthesis.",
