 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marsha Lester of the University of Pennsylvania is supported by the   Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in her ongoing studies to   characterize the intermolecular potential, inelastic scattering and   reaction dynamics of vibrationally activated entrance channel complexes   composed of a hydroxyl radical and a reactive molecular partner (carbon   monoxide, nitric oxide, water).  Infrared excitation will provide   sufficient energy to overcome the activation barrier to reaction while   intermolecular excitations will orient the reactants such that the   structure of the complex approximates that of the transition state.    Prof. Lester will use double resonance techniques to record the mid- and   near-IR spectra of the OH stretch as well as intermolecular bending   levels of the OH complexes.  Spectral measurements should yield   information on the potential energy surfaces in the entrance channel to   reaction for ground state and vibrationally excited reactants.    The hydroxyl radical plays a pivotal role in the chemistry of the lower   atmosphere.  It is known as the `atmosphere's detergent` because its   reactions prevent the accumulation of most trace gases in the atmosphere,   many of which would act as air pollutants and greenhouse gases.  For the   majority of hydrogen-containing molecules emitted into the troposphere,   reaction with the OH radical is their major, if not sole, chemical loss   process.  Thus, reaction with OH radicals leads to the removal of these   compounds from the atmosphere and limits their atmospheric   concentrations.  Much experimental work has already been performed to   evaluate the OH radical kinetics and reaction mechanisms under the   conditions encountered in the atmosphere.  In these studies, Prof. Lester   will use techniques developed in her laboratory to take a much closer   look at the reactions dynamics of OH radicals with molecular partners of   atmospheric relevance such as carbon monoxide, nitric oxide and water.",
