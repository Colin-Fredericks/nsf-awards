 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:  CTS-9802610    Principal Investigator:  van Egmond    This is a grant to develop a better understanding of the coupling between rheology and the development of structure, especially in soft materials that undergo phase transitions and other morphological changes.  These materials include polymer systems such as compatible and incompatible blends, solutions, and gels.  Other important materials include liquid crystals (LC's) with applications such as polymer dispersed LC droplets for LC display screens and micellar systems with a wide variety of applications in controlled drug delivery, as drag reducing agents in pumped fluids, and as templates for the manufacture of mesoporous silica-based sieves of unprecedented selectivity.  Further, it is also important that real-time, on-line instruments that can measure structure during processing be developed.  This technology would be of immense value in assuring product quality and reducing waste through a combination of simulation and model-based control schemes.    Two key objectives are addressed by this research: (1) the development of novel optical instruments that are crucial for the detection of real-time three dimensional structure and stress in flowing multicomponent polymeric materials; and (2) the characterization of mechanisms through which rheology interacts with phase transitions, structural fluctuations and fluid mechanical instability in model multicomponent polymer and micelles systems.  These objectives will be achieved through a combination of non-intrusive optical techniques (birefringence, dichroism and light scattering) to measure molecular and mesoscopic structural evolution, mechanical rheometry to measure macroscopic stress, and modeling.  This array of instrumentation will be used to study flow instabilities that occur in complex materials such as polymer solutions that undergo apparent \"flow-induced phase separation\".  According to preliminary results, the driving mechanism for these instabilitie s is the coupling between viscoelastic stresses, convection, and stresses associated with anisotropic meso-structure.  The relevance of this work rests on the need to understand instabilities and heterogeneities that occur during the processing of complex materials such as polymer blends.  2      1",
