 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators are implementing Calculus on the Web (COW), an interactive electronic learning system for basic mathematics. It is accessible through the internet from any platform capable of running a standard web browser, at http://cartan.math.temple.edu/~cow/. The system presents in modular form units for study, practice and \"hands-on\" experimentation for each of the great variety of topics in a number of courses. Some key features of COW which distinguish it from the current generation of mathematics learning software are: (i) the system is not a canned, multiple choice question environment, but requires the student to compute and enter a numerical or mathematical expression; (ii) the system algebraically analyzes answers and has the flexibility to detect partially correct responses and create individually tailored replies. For the current project, the system will be developed for a complete treatment of calculus, for precalculus and linear algebra.        The educational objectives of COW are: 1. To create an interactive platform for mathematics skill development and intellectual exploration without the overhead of supervision and technical training of students in specialized software. 2. To provide an on-line version of assigned, graded homework, particularly useful for large or multi-section courses without graders. 3. To offer the electronic equivalent of mathematics tutoring, at home or any campus workstation. 4. To make the system available for all calculus classes at local high schools, and to all other US universities that wish to use it. 5. To do all this with a low maintenance, simple-to-use system exploiting existing university facilities and internet technology.",
