 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803461  Swenson       First, Swenson will continue his collaboration with Martin Dunwoody  on the algebraic torus theorem.  Much of the work done in the field of  geometric group theory has been generalizing results from 3-manifold  theory to the setting of finitely generated groups.  The first result  to generalize was the sphere theorem, which was generalized by Stallings  to the Ends Theorem.  When the most general versions of the annulus and  torus theorem for three-manifolds were proven by Scott in 1980, he  conjectured that there should be a purely algebraic analog to these  theorems.  The first step in that direction was a proof of the algebraic  annulus theorem for word hyperbolic groups by Scott and Swarup in 1995.  The algebraic annulus theorem for finitely generated groups was proven by  Dunwoody and Swenson in 1996.  These two will extend this result to an  n-dimensional algebraic torus theorem for finitely generated groups.  In  addition, Swenson will continue his investigations into the boundaries of  groups.  The study of group boundaries was begun in the theory of Kleinian  and Fuchsian groups.  The first person to apply these ideas to abstract  groups was Gromov.  He defined the visual boundary both of a word-hyperbolic  group, and of a CAT(0) group.  It was shown by Bestvina and Mess that these  boundaries carry considerable cohomological information about the group.  Swenson has two different projects in this area.  First, he wishes to  determine the relationship between the local and global homology in the  visual boundary of a word-hyperbolic group.  Bestvina began the work in  this area, after which Swenson made a contribution.  There are, however,  certain important questions that remain open.  The second project concerns  the existence (or non-existence) of cut points in these boundaries.  It  has been shown by Bowditch and Swarup that the visual boundary of a  word-hyperbolic group cannot contain a cut-point.  Swenson will try to  \"extend\" this result to the nonpositive ly curved or CAT(0) setting.  He  will also look for consequences of boundaries' not having cut-points  (semistability at infinity, for example).       Years ago it was said that infinite group theory consisted entirely  of counter-examples.  Geometric group theory has done much to remedy this  situation.  Thurston's work towards the classification of all 3-manifolds,  spaces which look locally like 3-space, was the origin of geometric group  theory.  Z. He, Cannon, and others noticed the amazing correlation between  the group theoretic properties of the fundamental group of a geometric  3-manifold and the geometric properties of its universal cover.  Much of  the work done in geometric group theory has been to translate techniques  and sometimes even theorems from the setting of 3-manifolds to the  seemingly much more general setting of simply connected 2-complexes,  spaces formed by gluing triangles along their edges (often with more than  two triangles sharing a common edge).  The torus theorem for 3-manifolds  says that any time there is an essential map of a 2-torus (an inner tube)  into a 3-manifold M, either M is very simple and well understood, or there  is an embedded 2-torus along which M can be cut to yield simpler pieces.  Swenson is working with Martin Dunwoody to extend this result to apply  to any essential map of a torus of any dimension into a simply connected  2-complex.  In the second part of the project, Swenson will investigate  non-positively curved 2-complexes, using techniques transferred over from  differential geometry by Gromov and others.  ***",
