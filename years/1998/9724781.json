 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724781  Branson    This is a cooperative research project between U.S.  principal investigators Thomas Branson and Palle Jorgensen  of the Department of Mathematics, University of Iowa, and A.  Rod Gover of the Queensland University of Technology School  of Mathematics and D.W. Robinson of the Australian National  University School of Mathematical Sciences.  The U.S.  investigators will spend a total of approximately 105 person-  days in Australia working with their counterparts on  invariant elliptic and subelliptic operators and their role  in geometry and representation theory.  Among the goals is a  deeper understanding of the conformal and tangential Cauchy-  Riemann geometrics.  They will proceed on the basis of a new  method with the common feature that control of the spatial x-  variable as well as the dual frequency x-variable is  required.  In this sense, the proposed work is connected on  a fundamental level with modern problems in wavelet theory,  and may in the long run shed light on the underlying  geometric structure of wavelets.",
