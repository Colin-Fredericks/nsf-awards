The workshop will provide a forum for academic and industry experts in machining to present the latest research results on modeling of machining operations and to discuss research needs and critical research issues for the future. Funds are requested to pay for the travel of three invited keynote speakers, to assist the travel of eight junior faculty members and post-docs, and to support the publication of the workshop proceedings.  The workshop has a good mix of invited speeches, paper presentations, and discussion sessions. The identification of the future research needs and issues will be valuable to the research community and NSF.",
