 "awd_abstract_narration": "Specific interactions between complementary macromolecules play a    critical role in most biological processes, from signal transduction, to    gene regulation and motor activities. Although such interactions have    been studied with many biochemical and biophysical methods, a direct    examination with single molecular pairs was only realized recently with    the advent of the atomic force microscopy (AFM). However, our ability to    study intermolecular interactions or recognition at great detail is still    severely limited at present, because with the AFM technique, only a    single rupture force, which is related to the maximum binding force, can    be directly measured, due to the lack of control of the cantilever    position and movement. The relationship of such measurements to those    measured thermodynamically can only be inferred and is often far from    clear.             It has been recognized that this limitation may be technical in    nature and might be eliminated with a properly designed apparatus. The    primary objective of this project is to develop a force measuring    apparatus based on the AFM, but incorporating a magnetic force to the    force sensing cantilever, in order to control its position and motion. In    this system, the cantilever should remain during the approach/retraction    cycle of the measurement, allowing the determination of both the    interacting force and the distance between the two molecules. Because the    position of the cantilever does not move during the entire measurement,    other problems due to the lateral swing of the cantilever which has the    potential of introducing artifacts are also eliminated. To further    improve the precision in position, the thermal motion of the cantilever    will be compensated with a fast response coil, branched from the main    feedback.             When this technique is fully implemented, the entire force-    distance curve of a molecular pair can be measured at sub-A intervals    under physiolo gical conditions. A simple integration will yield the    potential curve that can be directly compared with the parameters    obtained with thermodynamic measurements, such as the binding free    energy. This will provide unprecedented details of intermolecular    interaction, which will be invaluable for our understanding of this    important process, especially when carefully selected mutant proteins are    studied in comparison.",
