 "awd_abstract_narration": "9812211  Baker    The aim of this research is to explore whether the vacancy-  hardening model that explains the yield strength anomaly in  FeAl is applicable to other B2 compounds that show a similar  temperature dependence of yield strength.  The model is  general and could be applicable to a wide variety of crystal  structures, which show a yield anomaly.  The research  involves single crystal growth, mechanical testing and  slipline analysis, and transmission electron microscopy  (TEM) of single crystals of CoTi, CoHf and CoZr.  Measurements of vacancy concentrations are made for  different annealing temperatures using the Simmons/Balluffi  method, whereby the density measured by dilatometry is  compared to that measured by x-rays.  The activation  enthalpies for both vacancy formation and vacancy migration  are determined and compared with values obtained from the  vacancy-hardening model.  In order to determine the  dislocation/vacancy interactions associated with the yield  strength anomaly, TEM in-situ straining experiments are  performed both as a function of temperature and on crystals  containing different quenched-in vacancy concentrations.  Mechanical testing includes determination of the  tension/compression asymmetry of the yield stress as a  function of temperature in single crystals of different  orientations.  The compression tests are performed in a wide  range of strain rates with the very high strain rate tests  being performed at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  Specialized mechanical tests using a Gleeble test machine,  which allows very rapid heating and quenching, are performed  at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  This apparatus enables  yield strength measurement to be performed at the yield  strength peak temperature with different vacancy  concentrations present.  TEM examination of slip-plane-  sectioned specimens rapidly-cooled after testing in the  Gleeble allows dislocation structures truly representative  of high temperature testing to be examined.  %%%  Intermeta llic alloys exhibit unique mechanical properties  that could enable their use in high temperature structural  applications.  This research should advance understanding of  the mechanical behavior of this important class of metal  alloys.",
