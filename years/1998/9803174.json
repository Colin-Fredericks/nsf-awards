 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in theoretical elementary particle physics,  astrophysics and cosmology will include studies of possible  new particles predicted by `supersymmetry` (which relates  the constituents of matter to the basic forces), the origins  of the highest energy cosmic rays, the nature of the Dark  Matter which makes up most of the mass of the Universe, and  problems of interest concerning the four basic forces of  nature. Attention has focussed recently on several ways in  which supersymmetry may be hidden from discovery because the  new particles related which it predicts, although light  enough to be produced in existing accelerators, have very  subtle signatures.  Thus it is extremely important to find  ways to infer their existence.  The properties of the  highest energy cosmic rays suggest they may in fact be new  particles, whose understanding could shed light on  supersymmetry as well as quasars.  Quasars are objects which  were especially populous in the early universe and are  thought to be enormous black holes accreting the surrounding  galaxy. The studies to be undertaken are important to  furthering our understanding of both the cosmos and the  basic forces.",
