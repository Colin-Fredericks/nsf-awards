 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of transgenic mice has been instrumental in the  characterization and understanding of the genetic basis of  mammalian development and physiology.  The genetics group at  Yale University in particular has utilized transgenic mice  to study the evolution of the HOX genes that are essential  for normal development, the role of the transcription factor  AP-2 in vertebrate morphogenesis, and the role of T-cells in  immune system function and development, among other  projects.  This proposal requests funds to augment the  transgenic mouse facility at Yale University.  The facility  presently has one old transgene injection set-up and one  modern set-up for blastocyst injection of stem cells.  The  transgene apparatus is now 20 years old and despite  mechanical wear and tear is used at capacity.  This project  proposes to add a new transgene injection station, to repair  and upgrade the existing apparatus, and to add ancillary  equipment that will generally support the overall program in  transgene research and education.  As transgene techniques continue to expand, the facility  comes under even greater use by the faculty and students at  Yale.  The sheer volume of experimental studies necessitates  the acquisition of new instrumentation.  New instruments  will enhance the efficiency of both research and teaching  activities.  Additional equipment will also make possible  the development of new techniques such as the controlled  expression of transgenes, fluorigenic reporter constructs,  and the modification of endogenous genes by \"knock-in\"  procedures.  The requested equipment will be accessible to a  broad spectrum of investigators and students both within and  outside of Yale University.  Access if facilitated by  housing the equipment in an Animal Research Facility managed  by a consortium of faculty investigators rather than within  a single investigator's group.  The facility is self-  contained and integrates both animal care and housing and  transgene laboratory space.",
