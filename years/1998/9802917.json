 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802917  Porter    This award provides support for the acquisition of an ultra-high  vacuum system with the capability of multiple techniques for the  controlled deposition of many types of thin conducting films.  The deposition system will have a rare combination of techniques  and attributes that will allow for the growth of a variety of  conducting films, ranging from ultra-pure elements to refractory  compounds, in a highly controlled environment.  This system will  permit leading research involving studies of the physics and  electrical, chemical, and microstructural properties of materials  at conducting-to-semiconducting interfaces.  Some of the existing  and planned research programs include an NSF-supported study of  thermally stable contacts to SiC and GaN for high temperature  electronic applications and the development of contacts for both  SiC-based solar probes and SiC-, GaN-, or BN-based radio isotope  batteries.  Additional programs that will benefit include  \"Surface Phase Transitions in Alloys\", \"Stability of Fine  Microstructures in Thin Films\", and the \"Mesoscale Interface  Mapping Project\".  %%%  While all of these research programs involve the fabrication of  conducting contacts on semiconducting or insulating substrates,  the nature of conducting films varies in terms of the techniques  which are most appropriate for depositing the films.  The system  addresses these differences in its inclusion of two sources for  dc sputtering, a multi-pocket electron-beam source for  evaporation, and the future capability for the addition of an ion  source for ion-beam assisted deposition.  The sputtering and  evaporation techniques will allow for easier deposition of most  types of the films which are being studied, while the ion-  assisted process will be used in the future to introduce more  control over the parameters for depositing compound materials.  ***",
