The studies will identify research needs and provide scientific advice on the hydrologic aspects of multi-disciplinary U.S. national programs and U.S. contributions to international programs related to climate and biogeochemical cycle research.  The initial focus will be on the role of hydrology in the climate system, and the implications of climate and water and land cover change for the hydrologic system.  It will cover the observational (both long-term and short-term) aspects, measurements, and analysis components of these programs.\r\n\r\nThe activity is proposed for duration of 36 months initially, with the likelihood that further authorization and funding will be sought as additional activities in the hydrologic sciences are identified.  The initial phase of this study will result in a report providing an overview of the general hydrologic content and an assessment of research priorities for the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) based on the committee's work during the first 12 months.  At the end of three years, a second more detailed report of the analyses undertaken in years 2 and 3 will be provided.  It is expected that the reports will help better focus the work of hydrologists and global change researchers so as to produce maximum value and information to the USGCRP.\r\n\r\nThe estimated total cost of this activity over the 36-month study period of July 1, 1998 through June 30, 2001 is $472,000, of which 150,000 will be required for the first year, July 1, 1998 through June 30, 1999.  This request is submitted to the National Science Foundation, which is requested to serve as the administrative lead for several federal agencies (NSF, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Geological Survey and others) in supporting the proposed activity.\r\n",
