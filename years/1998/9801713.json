 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Li    The ``classical'' theory of theta series and reductive dual pairs   in the symplectic group has become a standard part of representation   theory and automorphic forms, and continues to attract a great amount   of interest and activity. The analogous theory for exceptional groups   was begun just a few years ago, and is going through rapid development.   In previous NSF sponsored projects, the proposer fruitfully studied   some basic questions in the theory, such as  the correspondences of   infinitesimal characters, and developed new methods to determine the   discrete spectrum of exceptional dual pairs. Here he proposes to   continue his study of the remaining fundamental problems, and to apply   the results to specific problems such as cohomology of arithmetic   manifolds and unipotent representations. He plans to combine his own   methods with those of Burger and Sarnak, and hopes to establish close   relations  between discrete series of certain non-symmetric  homogeneous spaces and the spectrum of reductive dual pairs.         The theory of Lie group representations is concerned with the study of   certain kinds of symmetries. When two groups are embedded in a larger   ambient group in a interesting way, one could ask how the symmetries   of the larger group would behave upon restriction to the two embedded   groups. Frequently this leads to deep information which plays   important roles in both representation theory and number theory.   Building upon earlier work by the proposer and other mathematicians,   this project  aims to settle  several fundamental questions in   the study of such restrictions of symmetries, and apply the results   to the study of geometry and arithmetic  of various interesting   spaces associated to the groups in question.",
