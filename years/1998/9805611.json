 "awd_abstract_narration": "Branching morphogenesis, the creation of a hollow tree of\r\nbranched ducts from an initially simple structure, is a robust,\r\nimportant, and widely studied model system in developmental\r\nbiology.  There is a large body of experimental results on what\r\nis and is not required to generate the glandular structures, but\r\nthere is as yet no single theory which ties together all that is\r\nknown about branching morphogenesis.  The two main existing\r\ntheories hypothesize that the origin and direction of branching\r\nactivity rest solely in, respectively, (1) the epithelium, and\r\n(2) the mesenchyme.  This study proposes a new hypothesis, that\r\nactivity in (3) both tissues is essential.  This study will\r\ndevelop a mathematical model of the forces and deformations\r\ninvolved in branching morphogenesis, using a multiphase for\r\nmulation to track changes in the density of cells, extracellular\r\nmatrix components, and interstitial fluid.  The model will be\r\nanalyzed, using asymptotics, perturbations, bifurcation analysis,\r\nparameter estimation, and numerical simulation.  The first task\r\nwill be to evaluate the agreement of the model with experimental\r\nfacts, and the second will be to help answer some long-standing\r\nquestions, specifically the relative mechanical roles of the\r\nepithelium and the mesenchyme.  Specific predictions will be\r\nmade, that others may test them experimentally.  The primary goal\r\nof this project is to distinguish between the three major\r\ntheories of branching morphogenesis mentioned above.  It is very\r\nlikely that the insights gained from this modeling study of\r\nbranching morphogenesis will lead to a better under standing in\r\ngeneral of the physical forces in confluent (epithelial) and\r\nsparse (mesenchymal) tissues, both in homeostasis and in\r\ndevelopment, with applications and insights in other contexts\r\nsuch as somitogenesis, tooth and hair formation, angiogenesis,\r\nhealing, and tumor growth.  The study will also lead to an\r\nimproved understanding of the multiphase models of biological\r\ntissues which have been developed in other contexts, through\r\nextending these passive models to tissues which are actively\r\ngrowing and remodeling.\r\n     The formation of branched tubular structures occurs\r\nthroughout an organism, in many different tissues, and is\r\nessential to the very existence of large organisms which need to\r\ntransport fluids more than a short distance.  Branching\r\nmorphogenesis is a widespread phenomenon in animal development,\r\ngenerating the form of such organs as the lung, mammary gland,\r\nsalivary gland, and kidney.  Although nearly every technique of\r\ncellular and developmental biology has been applied to it, and\r\nmuch has been learned from these experiments, there is still\r\nuncertainty as to the mechanism of branching.  The overwhelming\r\nmajority of experiments on branching have concentrated on\r\nbiochemical aspects, following the dominant paradigm in\r\nbiological research of the last few decades.  Yet the essence of\r\nmorphogenesis is that tissues grow and move and change shape, and\r\nthis requires physical forces to emerge from the molecular\r\nbiology.  Hence the next logical step in morphogenesis research\r\nis study of the biomechanical aspects, which are what create and\r\nmodify form.  A mathematical model will be developed of the\r\nmechanical forces and resulting material deformations of the\r\ntissues involved in morphogenesis.  Analysis of the model will\r\n(1) allow a comparison of the biomechanical aspects of the\r\ncurrently competing theories of branching morphogenesis, (2) lead\r\nto greater understanding of the relatively new modeling\r\nmethodology itself, which is useful in many other biological\r\napplications, and (3) suggest new interpretations and experiments\r\ntowards the goal of understanding one of the most important\r\nphenomena in developmental biology.\r\n\r\n",
