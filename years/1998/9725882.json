 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725882  Raymond  This award is for support for a program of surface-based  radio echo sounding to examine the geometry of the internal  layering and the presence or absence of thawed zones outside  the margins of active Ice Streams B and E and across the  flow band feeding Ice Stream D.  Melting in the marginal  shear zone and/or on the bed outside an ice stream relates  to the amount of support of the ice stream from the sides  compared to the bed and the conditions that limit expansion  of its width.  Radar observations will be extended over the  crest of adjacent inter-ice-stream ridges (B/C and D/E) and  areas next to the flow band in the onset of D.  The purpose  is to examine internal layering indicative of the histories  of these areas adjacent to ice streams and to determine  whether ice streams have expanded into these  presently  stable areas in the past.  These goals concerning the  physical controls and history of ice stream width relate to  how the discharge of ice streams has changed in the past and  could change in the future to affect sea level.",
