The goal is to achieve a  quantitative understanding of the interactions of atoms and  molecules with surfaces by treating conditions where highly  complex problems can be separated into more manageable  pieces.  The research subjects include the structures and  dynamics of atomically thin layers and the dynamical  processes coupling the layers to the supporting substrate.  Examples are chosen from recent inelastic helium scattering  and sliding friction experiments.  There continues to be a  strong connection to the more traditional electron and X-ray  diffraction experiments on adsorbed layers.  %%%  This is a theoretical research grant on dynamical processes  in physical adsorption.
