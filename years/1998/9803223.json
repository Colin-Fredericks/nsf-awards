 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific tools used by Slemrod in his research on finding\r\nmulti-scale models for constitutive relations for gases, fluids, and \r\ngranular materials are kinetic theories for these materials   \r\nand singular perturbation limits. These singular perturbation limits \r\nallow him to recover models on large space and time scales. However \r\nthe linking of the large and small scales in unified models will be \r\naccomplished by a new technique developed by Slemrod and motivated \r\nby the procedure used by physicists in the study of critical phenomena. \r\nSlemrod calls the  method\" generalized rational approximation\". \r\nIt provides a stable way of extrapolating from small scale to \r\nlarge scale models of materials. \r\n\r\nIn the study of the dynamics of liquids, gases, and granular materials  \r\nit is important to have good mathematical models to aid in the prediction \r\nof physical phenomena. It is also important to have these models to be \r\nvalid on a whole range of length and time scales. For example the motion \r\nof the atmosphere (a rarefied gas) far away from a plane or a space shuttle \r\nre-entering the earth's atmosphere uses a large scale model different \r\nthan that used to model the small scale dynamics of a shock layer near \r\nthe plane or shuttle.  However for computational efficiency one unified \r\nmodel valid on a large range of length and time scales is desirable.  \r\nSlemrod  in his research will formulate a method for finding such models \r\nfor fluids, gases, and granular materials.\r\n \r\n",
