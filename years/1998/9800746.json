 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical Advanced Study Institute for high  energy physics graduate study will be held for four weeks  each year in June/July at the University of Colorado,  Boulder during the period 1998-2002.  The Institute will  focus on one or two broad topics of theoretical elementary  particle physics every summer, the topics chosen being  timely both from the experimental and theoretical point of  view.  (The title for the 1998 TASI is `Neutrinos in Physics  and Astrophysics: from 10-33 to 10+17 cm`.  The topics  covered will include aspects of neutrino properties in  particle and astroparticle physics.)  The annual program  consists of eight to ten lecture series, and several  seminars on topics of current interest.  Each lecture series  consists of five to six lectures, each of 75 minutes, all  allowing for questions from students.  Each lecture series  starts with introductory material and ends with the current  status.       This summer program of graduate study is extremely  important to the education of our future elementary particle  physicists.  It complements in a very constructive way what  graduate students learn on their home campuses.",
