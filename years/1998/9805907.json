 "awd_abstract_narration": "9805907  Wang  Deformed swept volumes are defined as the volumes swept by deforming objects undergoing general motions. Development of fast and accurate sweep generators, which can represent and analyze swept volumes generated by general three-dimensional objects undergoing general motions, has been an important research area in solid modeling and computer-aided design and manufacturing technology. Research on swept volume has potential for advancing existing manufacturing technologies, thereby resulting in an increase of manufacturing productivity, product quality and cost reduction. The objective of this POWRE project is to develop a new theoretical framework for the representation and analysis of deformed swept volumes. This analysis will greatly expand the range of application of the deformed swept volume approach to computer-aided design and manufacturing and will establish the P.I. as a significant contributor to this field. The recently developed sweep differential equation approach for rigid objects will be modified and used for the first time to represent, compute, and analyze the swept volumes of deformed 3D objects. Advanced computer programming tools will be utilized to design graphical user interfaces and develop computer software for the visualization and integration with commercial software.   This technique will be used to construct modules used in the computer-aided design software and then applied to the computer-based dynamic NC (Numerically Controlled) simulation and verification. This work will be of interest and value to industry, once the fundamental issues are successfully addressed.",
