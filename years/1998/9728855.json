 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728855  Waller             Small populations face many hazards including the loss of genetic  variation and the genetic effects of inbreeding.  Most populations   experience moderate to severe inbreeding depression which occurs when   accumulated deleterious mutations are exposed via inbreeding.  Populations   with a prior history of inbreeding, however, may experience less inbreeding   depression if their load of mutations has already been expressed and   selected out of the population.  Some scientists argue that such selection   can effectively eliminate inbreeding depression, allowing opportunities to   purge threatened populations of their load via intentional inbreeding.   Others argue from theory that purging will be weak and ineffective under   most circumstances and may actually increase the number of mildly   deleterious mutations fixed in small populations.  This project will explore   just how effectively selection can purge real populations of their   inbreeding depression.  To save space and allow rapid progress, the   investigator will use strains of a small plant in the cabbage family   (Brassica rapa) that has been bred to grow quickly in the laboratory.   Multiple lines will be subjected to maximal inbreeding via   self-fertilization, while other populations of various size will experience   alternating selfing and outcrossing or pure outcrossing for six generations.    The investigator will then estimate how much inbreeding depression has   declined in each treatment by comparing the size and performance of   seedlings derived from self- and cross-fertilized seeds from the first,   third, and sixth generations.  In addition, he will examine whether the high   fitness expected in seedlings derived from crosses among the inbred lines is   maintained over subsequent generations of random mating (a result suggesting   that purging was effective) or deteriorates (reflecting the decay of   temporary hybrid vigor).  To address another controversy, the investigator   will also compar e the amount of inbreeding depression observed when plants   are grown under different growing conditions.          These experiments should demonstrate how quickly and completely  inbreeding can purge populations of their genetic load.  Empirical results   like these should help to resolve the controversy over how effective   purging can be and how quickly it can operate.  Such results will help us   to understand how mating systems that involve a mixture of selfing and   outcrossing evolve.  They will also illuminate the genetic hazards faced by   small populations and demonstrate whether intentional inbreeding can   provide a useful breeding strategy for small populations in threatened or   endangered species.",
