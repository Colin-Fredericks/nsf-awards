 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the capability for resonant-sonic technology to enhance and/or enable homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical processes and establish the resonant-sonic operating conditions that cause the observed chemical reaction enhancements.  The project will characterize resonant-sonic machine design and operational features, as well as associated process(es) for continued development in Phase II, where the application of a resonant-sonic process on one commercially important chemical process will be demonstrated at intermediate scale. The technology has  already been  demonstrated in the laboratory to produce highly energetic cavitation in liquids and slurries at low frequencies.  It can be applied for industrial scale homogeneous and multiphase processing, and has the potential to greatly increase reaction rates, decrease reaction temperatures and pressures and/or reduce reagent concentrations to affect a wide range of chemical reactions.   The market potential for this technology is immense, and includes the pulp, food, petrochemical, chemical, waste processing, manufacturing, mining, and metals refining industries.  The technology can be used to greatly reduce the cost and environmental impact of industrial scale heterogeneous chemical processes.   This award is supported by the Small Business Innovation Research Program and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).",
