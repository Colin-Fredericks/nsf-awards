 "awd_abstract_narration": "A projected shortage of information technology workers may impede the successful integration of new information technologies as the captial investment in information technology proceeds at its current growing rates.  A key and neglected area of research is the professional development of young Information Systems (IS) professionals who will provide critical knowledge and technology transfer, and will form the core of tomorrow's human infrastructure for information technology industries.  This study is a contribution to understanding how best to develop these human resources in information systems and services, which will be critical to effectively implement and apply new information technologies. The project longitudinally investigates the communication patterns and work activities patterns of young (IS) professionals to determine how they seek information---new technical knowledge, user requirements---as well as  how they coordinate that information with the tasks they are trying to accomplish and how their job performance is affected. The study will identify the role of supervisors and mentors as well as the effect of social ties in influencing information seeking and job performance.  It breaks exploratory new ground by examining these patterns for young (less than five years' experience) IS professionals, and by using an empirical approach focused on daily work activities of its subjects and on there their information seeking behaviors.  Without an effective strategic approach that integrates both technology develpment, the dissemination and practical integration of cutting edge IT knowledge, and human infrastructure development, the full promise and impact of IT research cannot be reached.  This proposal addresses fundamental concerns of the latter two areas.",
