Each year one teacher and three students from each school  will work together with a scientist at PNL for 8 weeks. This working partnership will continue during the academic year in a research course which each district has committed to and with ongoing support of the scientist mentor. In the senior level research course the teacher-student teams will mentor other students. Teachers will participate for two years each. Students in the eleventh grade will participate in the 8-week summer research experience once. During the second year of the project another teacher from the same school but from a different discipline will begin  their participation along with their team of three students. The six school represent a blend of 4-school districts near PNL, one district 70 miles away, and the sixth district is 240 miles away. Over the life of the project 12 teachers and 72 students will participate",
