The program goals are to  increase student enrollment and success in courses in mathematics  and science and to encourage continued study through higher  education toward careers in science, mathematics, and engineering.    To accomplish these goals, the Little Rock School District has  built a partnership effort among leading institutions in the  central Arkansas area.  Program partners include:  higher education  - the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, Philander Smith  College and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences; the  Arkansas Museum of Science and History; municipal agencies - the  City of Little Rock and Little Rock Housing Authority; the Central  Arkansas Library System; and the Little Rock Alliance for Our  Public Schools, a business/community association dedicated to  excellence in public education.    The LRPMSA program focuses on curriculum revision and staff  development programs to increase the capacity of educators to  motivate students and provide more effective instruction.    Program goals include:  o    Prepare 100% of graduates to successfully complete Algebra.  o    Increase the number of students who successfully complete       upper-level mathematics and science courses.  o    Adopt a Board policy to require that students in AP courses       take the AP examination.  o    Revise the mathematics curriculum to limit the number of       topics for each grade level and subject and to increase the       depth at which each topic is taught.  o    Implement standards-based modules in each elementary/middle       school mathematics and science classroom.  o    Provide the support programs for students in upper level       mathematics and science courses.  o    Increase the knowledge and involvement of parents in the       mathematics and science programs.  o    Prov ide targeted staff development to assist staff in       facilitating the above stated objectives.",
