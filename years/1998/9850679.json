 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational Chemistry (Molecular Modeling) has gained increased importance in chemical industry and in academia over the past decade. It is quite appropriate that undergraduate students be introduced to this emerging field. Furthermore, Molecular Modeling can be a great pedagogical tool to use with all chemistry students, For these reasons, a multi-purpose computational chemistry laboratory is being established. The facilities are being used for visualization, mathematical calculations and molecular modeling experiments. Molecular modeling is being integrated into our chemistry curriculum such that modeling techniques enhance learning for our chemistry majors and for the large number of students in service courses taught in the Chemistry Department.  The program is tailored to the unique needs of students on a commuter campus such as Kennesaw State University (KSU). A web-site is being created which makes available modeling software and data bases for at-home and in-lecture use by all chemistry students and faculty. The modeling laboratory is available for on-campus lecture and laboratory use. Specific modeling exercises being introduced into the Organic, Physical and Biochemistry sequences have been identified from the chemical education literature and from research projects at KSU. Many of these exercises have an experimental component. The exercises include novel uses of the World Wide Web, recent scientific advances and emerging new methodologies.  An upper level Molecular Modeling course is being developed which focuses on the theory, underlying assumptions and equations of molecular mechanics, semi-empirical and ab-initio quantum mechanics, and molecular dynamics/Monte Carlo methods. Advanced problems such as the multiple minimum problem with flexible peptides are being explored by calculation and correlation with experiment. Students are expected to build a sense of which method is most applicable to any given problem.",
