This conference offers a unique opportunity for  basic scientists and those involved in science policy from a broad group of disciplines with an interest in folic acid, vitamin B12 and one-carbon metabolism, to interact both formally and informally. The last five conferences have been fully subscribed and participation at this conference will be limited to 180 individuals. This award will enable graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the meeting. The program includes well-established scientists along with those just entering the field. The topics include areas of the most sophisticated biochemical and biophysical research. Session topics include the enzymology and regulation of one-carbon metabolism; homocysteine metabolism and regulation; methionine and folate cofactor synthesis/regulation; methyl transfer and DNA repair; cellular and epithelial transport of folate and vitamin B12; and folate dependent enzyme reactions. In addition to the formal presentations, the program will be complemented with poster sessions and workshops. These offer many opportunities for informal discussions and allow graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, as well as established scientists, an opportunity to present and discuss their work. As in the past, the most interesting new research presented at the conference will be disseminated to a much wider audience in the form of one or more \"state-of-the-art\" reviews in the FASEB Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
