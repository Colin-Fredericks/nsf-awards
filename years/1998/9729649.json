 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729649  PHILLIS       Dr. Phillis's research focuses on the role  of the \"motor protein\" dynein in neuronal development and the  establishment of the mature anatomy of neuronal axons.  Although  dynein is well known to be involved in the movement of  intracellular components along microtubules, Dr. Phillis's  analysis of the gene for cytoplasmic dynein light chain, Cdlc1, in  the fruitfly Drosophila has suggested a role for this molecule in  shaping the growing tips of axons.  This research encompasses  three projects, each designed to investigate specific aspects of  the cytoplasmic dynein light chain with respect to axon anatomy.  The first project involves the analysis of when Cdlc1 mutations  affect axon projections during development.  Using a set of  genetic markers, Dr. Phillis and his colleagues will label  specific sensory neurons and their axons as they undergo  pathfinding in the central nervous system during development.  They will then characterize the development of these axons in  Cdlc1 mutants, and compare them with observations of wild type  development.  This analysis will help determine the timing of  onset of axon defects caused by Cdlc1 mutations.  In addition, Dr.  Phillis's group will create a mutant form of Cdlc1 that can be  activated by temperature shifts.  With this inducible gene, it  will be possible to determine the specific time in development  when Cdlc1 function is required for the establishment of proper  neuronal anatomy.  In a second project, Dr. Phillis's group will  characterize the effects of Cdlc1 mutations on neurons grown in  primary cell culture, using a microtubule labeling system that  allows the analysis of microtubule dynamics in live cells.  These  experiments will resolve the effects that Cdlc1 mutations have on  the growth dynamics of individual neurons, and on the dynamic  changes in cytoskeletal architecture that underlie the growth of  axon projections.  Finally, Dr. Phillis's group will perform a  genetic screen for mutations that either enh ance or suppress the  effects of Cdlc1 mutations on axonal growth.  Subsequent genetic  and molecular characterization of genes identified in this  analysis will provide a detailed understanding of a series of  genes that function with Cdlc1 in neural development.",
