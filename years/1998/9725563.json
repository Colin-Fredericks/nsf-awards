 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725563  Freymueller    This project is aimed at understanding the details of the collision  between two continental plates - India and Asia. GPS (Global  Positioning System) geodesy will be used to measure the motion of  some 100 points distributed throughout parts of the collision zone,  between the northern plains of India, and the Tarim basin north of  Tibet.  In particular, the P.I.s are interested in the unique  processes that occur beneath southern Tibet and the Greater  Himalaya because these appear to be close to the nucleation  zone of great earthquakes whose future recurrence will be  disastrous to the populations of northern India and Nepal.  The  study builds on their 1997 finding that the Himalaya are  contracting north-south at a rate of 21+-3 mm/year, but that this  contraction is largely concentrated in a zone less than 100 km  wide.  It appears that Tibet may also be contracting at 5-10  mm/year.  Observations indicate it is probable that Himalayan  contraction is largely elastic (strain energy developing for future  great earthquakes), and that Tibetan contraction at depth is  largely plastic (driving east-west expansion of  the plateau and surface seismicity).   The measurements the P.I.s  propose are designed to provide constraints on the physics  underlying these processes, and details of the transition zone  between them.  ***",
