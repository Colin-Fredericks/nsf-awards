 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research, carried out in an undergraduate setting,  is   the development of synthetic methodology for the preparation of   porphyrins and porphyrinoids. The `3 + 1` method, wherein a monocyclic   dialdehyde is condensed with a tripyrrolic structure, will be used to   gain a wide range of structural variation.  The scope of the protocol   will be explored with the goal of producing a number of new and novel   compounds.  With this renewal Research in Undergraduate Institutions   award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the   research efforts of Dr. Timothy D. Lash  of the Department of Chemistry   at Illinois State University.  In collaboration with his undergraduate   participants, Dr. Lash will focus his work on the preparation of   substituted porphyrin and porphyrinoid structures.  The chemistry and   spectroscopic properties of the the latter will be insightful and there    the possibility exists that practical applications could ensue",
