 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to determine the cellular interactions and behaviors that underlie the        morphological sub-division and structural transformation of the Zebrafish Organizer Region, from the midblastula transition to late-gastrulation.\r\n\r\nPrior work has shown that the dorsal marginal zone (DMZ) of late-blastula stage zebrafish embryos differentiates into two spatially-distinct domains of cells that can be distinguished on the basis of cell behavior.  These domains are (1) the dorsal involuting marginal zone, or DIMZ, and (2) the non-involuting endocytic marginal (NEM) cell cluster.  The more superficial NEM cell cluster occupies a location homologous to the Organizer Epithelium of Xenopus, and accurately predicts where the zebrafish embryonic axis will form at the onset of gastrulation.  NEM cells express unique endocytic activity, and can be selectively labeled by applying membrane-impermeant fluorescent probes to the intact zebrafish embryo.  The onset of this unique endocytic activity in the NEM cell cluster occurs 1-2 hours before early-acting dorsal marker genes become spatially-restricted to the Organizer Region.\r\n\r\nPreliminary evidence has been obtained that the NEM cell cluster represents a derivative of the putative zebrafish Nieuwkoop Center, which initially constitutes a syncytial cytoplasmic domain on the presumptive dorsal side of the mid-blastula stage embryo.  During the mid- to late-blastula period, this region of the embryo sub-divides into (1) a cellularized domain composed of dorsal marginal blastomeres (NEM cell precursors), as well as (2) a syncytial cytoplasmic domain, the dorsal-YSL.  In this study, detailed confocal time-lapse imaging of the DMZ will be performed to determine the sequence of morphogenetic cell behaviors involved in the structural transformation of the Zebrafish Organizer Region during this time period.\r\n\r\nThe progressive morphogenesis of the Zebrafish Organizer Region, from the midblastula transition to late gastrulation, will also be examined using (i) wild-type, (ii) mesoderm-deficient, as well as (iii) dorso-ventral mutant embryos.  By studying Organizer morphogenesis in mutant embryos with specific genetic deficiencies, altered patterns of cell behaviors may be identified and linked to failed cell fate specification during Organizer formation.  The results of the above project should reveal (1) the sequence of morphogenetic cell behaviors that underlie the formation of organ-forming domains within the zebrafish dorsal marginal zone, and (2) whether the activities of the dorsal-YSL and associated NEM cells play early roles in organizing zebrafish morphogenesis.",
