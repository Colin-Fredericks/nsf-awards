 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT      This project will facilitate the transfer of the collection of  parasitic mites of birds (feather mites) from the University of  Georgia to the University of Michigan.  The collection, the most  extensive of its kind in the New World, is in danger of being  orphaned.  The project will also provide for the improvement of  collection storage facilities associated with the collections of  ectoparasitic and commensal arthropods of the Insect Division of  the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology (UMMZ). This existing  collection of ectoparasites is one of the largest and most diverse  in the country, with over 120,000 slide mounted specimens and  16,000 lots of parasites, primarily from mammals, birds and insects  from around the world. Of particular importance are the large  collections obtained through collaborations with vertebrate  biologists conducting faunal surveys in poorly known and endangered  parts of the world such as Madagascar and the Philippines.  The  project will additionally assist in the preparation of slide  mounted specimens from the large backlog of accumulated alcohol  lots in both the Georgia and UMMZ collections.  Because most  researchers either require or prefer to receive parasite specimens  mounted on microscope slides rather than unprepared in alcohol  lots, reduction of the backlog of unprepared specimens is essential  for the collection to serve the community. Accomplishment of these  goals will save the Georgia collection from potential loss and  greatly enhance the accessibility of the combined collection to the  scientific community.",
