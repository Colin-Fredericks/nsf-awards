The  objectives of the project are to better understand: (1) the  expectations that public and stakeholder groups have concerning  likely earthquake impacts on the built environment; (2) the  importance they attach to the survivability and performance of  various elements of the built environment, including  infrastructure systems (bridges, highways, utility lifelines);  and (3) their policy preferences with respect to mitigation and  other loss-reduction strategies, with a particular emphasis on  understanding what are considered acceptable levels of  performance, loss, and disruption.  The project uses two  methodologies to investigate these issues: (1) a community survey  of randomly selected residents in the Oakland/Alameda County area  of California; and (2) small group exercises of prominent members  of four constituency groups--engineers, local government  officials, representatives of the business and financial  community, and city and county residents--in that same area.  ***",
