 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    NCR-9730162  Eric Friedman   Rutgers University with a subcontract to  Scott Shenker  Xerox PARC  Learning and the Design of the Internet    This project will study some foundational issues in the application of game theoretic ideas to the design of the Internet and other decentralized networks. Many researchers apply game theoretic ideas to the analysis of the modern Internet and in particular assume that Nash equilibria will arise in this setting.  Based on recent theoretical analyses and simulations, the PIs on this project have found that convergence to Nash equilibrium is not guaranteed in Internet-like environments, due to limited information, noise, and asynchrony.  This calls into question the application of the Nash Implementation\" on the Internet and makes the design of  mechanisms, which are robust to learning by adaptive agents, much more problematic.    The goal of this project is to understand precisely what kinds of mechanisms are learnable on the Internet and use this to design protocols and price mechanisms that implement socially desirable outcomes under this constraint.  For example, preliminary results show that the FIFO queuing protocol is not learnable while fair queuing can be learned quite easily by adaptive agents.    In particular, the PIs previous work has begun to identify the set of outcomes that are attained by adaptive learners.  This set contains the Stackelberg undominated actions and is contained within the serially unoverwhelmed set. Several important mechanisms work in these settings, e.g. fair queuing, the uniform mechanism, fixed path methods, and also many problems with enough players and capacity, in addition the PIs have just begun to analyze the general implications of these results for general design problems.  For example only strictly coallitionally strategy-proof social choice functions are implementable on the Internet. However, there still remain many open questions, which this project will attempt to resolve.    This project also has i mplications for Economics and Game Theory.  Besides the Internet, there are many decentralized systems in Economics for which we believe these results are applicable.  In particular, oligopolists, joint producers, and polluters operate asynchronously with limited observability and often with little knowledge of the underlying payoff matrix.  This project should increase our understanding in these settings.    This project will utilize three complementary methodologies: i) A continuing theoretical and analytical study of these issues ii) this  will be complemented with computer simulations, and  iiii) experiments with human subjects who will be studied under settings designed to mimic the scenarios faced by actual users on the Internet.  The interplay of these three approaches should help create a robust and realistic theory for designing learnable mechanisms for the Internet.",
