 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Wierdl    This proposal for research concerns questions of almost everywhere  and mean convergence in ergodic theory, and their connections with   harmonic analysis and probability theory. Also considered are   spectral questions for matrix-coefficient transfer operators.  Some of the convergence questions which will be addressed by Wierdl   concern the mean convergence of averages of measurements made on a   stochastic process at a random sequence of times that is chosen in   advance. Other questions concern subsequence ergodic theorems for   subsequences coming from members of Hardy fields, along bases for the   integers, and along sequences with big gaps. Results obtained by Wierdl in the previous grant periods suggest that in the context of Hardy fields, a meaningful characterization of the ``good'' sequences of measurements is possible.         Campbell and Wierdl will jointly consider another group of convergence   questions concerning upcrossings and related oscillatory behavior of   the ergodic averages. This line of research was initiated by Bishop,   Bourgain, Kalikow, B. Weiss and others.  Wierdl and his collaborators   discovered a fundamental connection between Ergodic Theory and   martingales.  This discovery---which often manifests itself as a   squarefunction of the difference between ergodic averages and certain   martingales---allows one to translate many of the results of   Martingale Theory, such as squarefunction, large deviation or   upcrossing inequalities, to ergodic theoretical results.         The so called Ergodic Theorem (ET) is a theoretical description of a   certain statistical behavior of matter.  Loosely speaking, the ET   makes it possible to make a large class of physical measurements in   two entirely different ways, but arrive to the same result.  It is useful to have an illustration: suppose we want to find out the average speed of the water particles in a cup of water.  Well, we would have to measure the speed of each particle separately, and then  take the average of these measurements.  This method of calculating the average speed is called  averaging in *space* since we go to different points (particles) in space to make the measurement.  But the ET says, that we would arrive to the same result if we pick a *single* particle, and start measuring its speed at 1 second, at 2 second, at 3 second, etc, and after a long enough period of time take the average of these measurements.  This method of calculating the average is called averaging in *time*.      So the above is two very different ways of calculating average speed,   and the method to be chosen depends on the circumstance.  Having  two possibilities gives great freedom in experiments.  The problem with the ET is twofold: 1) It does not specify exactly *how many* times are we supposed to   measure the speed of the single particle; the ET just says \"eventually\" the time average gets close to the space average.  2) The measurements in time has to be made *exactly* at 1s, 2s, 3s, etc.  But in practice, one cannot make measurements so promptly.  The ET says nothing if the measurements are made at, say, 1.1s, 2.8s, 3.2s, ...Our proposal addresses the above two problems:   1) we propose various ways to determine how many times does one need   to make measurements in time to get close with prescribed accuracy to   the space average.  2) We examine various randomly generated times at which measurements made will still give an average approaching the space average.  (Note Randomly generated times are much more likely to model practical   situations.)",
