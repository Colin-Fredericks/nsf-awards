The  researchers intend to study the molecular basis and  evolution of the plant,  Lacandonia schismatica.  Lacandonia is a unique endemic  plant from Chiapas,  Mexico, whose flower is the only known example of a  functional spatial inversion  of the reproductive whorls, that is, stamens in the central  whorl and carpels in the  third one.  Dr. Meyerowitz has been a leader in developing  models for the  molecular mechanisms of flower development, models which  have been  corroborated by studies in other flowering plants, including  Arabidopsis.  The  researchers now plan to establish the phylogenetic  relationships by using rDNA  sequences as sources of characters, to clone and  structurally characterize the  genes similar to the ABC genes of Arabidopsis and to test in  other ways the  similarity or differences in the genetic control of flower  development in the two  genera of plants.    Because of its functional uniqueness, Lacandonia provides  the necessary exception  to the pattern of flowers in angiosperms for a rigorous  testing of molecular models.  The two laboratories have complementary skills: the U.S. lab  provides the expertise  in molecular technology, while the Mexican lab brings to the  collaboration its  expertise in phylogenetic and population biology.  ***",
