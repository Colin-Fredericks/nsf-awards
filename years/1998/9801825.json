An entirely  new  domain  of  behavior  relating to phase  transitions,  model  systems  for high temperature superconductors, and vortex  motion  will  be made accessible in three dimensional arrays, rather than  the   previously  studied  two-dimensional  arrays  of  Josephson  Junctions. The steps in fabricating the novel device arrays  will  include  the deposition of multilayers, e-beam writing  and  mask  fabrication  at the Cornell University Nanofabrication  Facility,  and electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) etching at PlasmaQuest  in  Richardson Texas. In measurements on the arrays, focus will be on  three-dimensional critical fluctuations in the conductivity,  the  susceptibility, and  the critical field. Other topics of interest  are modeling the three-dimensional XY Hamiltonian, the nature  of  frustration   in  3-d  spin  systems,  and  2-  to  3-dimensional  crossover  effects  in the phase transition.  The  research  will  involve  graduate student and postdoctoral researchers  who  will  receive excellent training beneficial to their future careers  in  industry,   government  or  academic  research.  This   work   is  interdisciplinary  in  nature and is supported  in  part  by  the  Office  of  Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical  and  Physics Sciences Directorate at NSF.  %%%  This  experimental research project is in the category  of  Grant  Opportunities  for Academic Liaison With Industry (GOALI),  which  fosters    collaboration   between   academic   and    industrial  researchers. This project is concerned with entirely new,  three-  dimensional  arrays  of Josephson junctions. Josephson  junctions  between  superconducting  electrodes are highly non-linear  device  elements  whose  behavior  is  strongly  influenced  by  magnetic  fields, even at the level of the single \"flux quantum\". For  this  reason Josephson Junctions are in fact used in sensitive magnetic  field detectors. Arrays of Josephson Junctions  are model systems  for  the motion of  magnetic flux in superconductors and also for  studying  phase transitions. An entirely new domain  of  behavior  relating to phase transitions, model systems for high temperature  superconductors,  and vortex motion will be  made  accessible  in  three dimensional arrays, rather than the previously studied two-  dimensional   arrays  of  Josephson  Junctions.  The   steps   in  fabricating  the novel device arrays will include the  deposition  of  multilayers,  e-beam  writing and  mask  fabrication  at  the  Cornell   University  Nanofabrication  Facility,   and   electron  cyclotron  resonance (ECR) etching at PlasmaQuest  in  Richardson  Texas.  Because  the systems to be studied are models  for  other  types  of physical systems, the information that will be obtained  may  be  of  value in other branches of science, for  example  in  engineering  where  coupling  of non-linear  oscillators  may  be  important.  The  research  will  involve  graduate  student   and  postdoctoral  researchers  who will  receive  excellent  training  beneficial  to  their future careers in industry,  government  or  academic  research. This work is interdisciplinary in nature  and  is   supported   in  part  by  the  Office  of  Multidisciplinary  Activities  in the Mathematical and Physics Sciences  Directorate  at NSF.  ***",
