 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerical simulations have fundamentally changed the way science is done. The change has occurred within our lifetimes and has mirrored the exponential growth of the performance-to-price ratio for computer hardware. Today's high-performance desktop machines are computational platforms the equals of the first generation of supercomputers. As a result, computationally intensive simulations are now an option for any working scientists. For centuries, students of the physical sciences have learned their disciplines through theory, observation, and laboratory experimentation. To this list we may now add numerical simulation, and we must update the traditional undergraduate curricula to reflect the new order.    This project is using a Computational Physics Lab (CPL) with 11 high-performance PC workstations and software. The CPL is the focal point of the new emphasis on computational physics. In the new curriculum, the CPL is an instructional resource used in both lower-division and upper-division courses.  Specifically, the CPL allows the development of the sophomore-level course Computational Physics, and it is used by students enrolled in the senior-level courses Undergraduate Research I & II. In Computational Physics, students learn the tools of numerical experimentation and apply them to current topics in physics and astrophysics. In addition to serving the majors of the department, the CPL is also used by students in the SARA NSF-REU Summer Intern Program, and by local K-12 teachers as part of an outreach program. It will be in use 12 months a year. Finally, although the Computational Physics course is intended primarily for departmental majors, the course content is sufficiently comprehensive that students in any SME&T program may find it to be a useful elective course for their degree programs.",
