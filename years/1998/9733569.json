 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733569  More than ever, society relies on software systems that operate  correctly. Modifying software systems to insure their reliability  poses major technical and economic challenges. The difficulties  that face software engineers include absent or incorrect  documentation, poorly structured code, and the effort required to  understand handed-down systems. To maintain software, one must  recover, understand, correct, and maintain the design-level  structure of the software. The goal of  this research is to develop techniques and implement tools to  simplify software maintenance.  The proposed tools support three  activities: first, design recovery to extract structural  information from systems; second, design visualization to  facilitate the viewing of recovered software structures; third,  design maintenance to determine the quality of designs, identify  problematic areas, measure the impact of software modifications,  and so on. Central to our design maintenance approach is  a formalism for specifying constraints on software structures.  From these specifications, the design maintenance tools are  automatically generated to detect violations of such  constraints. Currently, in the absense of such tools, designers  have difficulty preserving the structural integrity of systems  that undergo continuous modification. The outcome of this work  should benefit software practitioners and inspire educators to  integrate software maintenance techniques and tools into their  curricula.***",
