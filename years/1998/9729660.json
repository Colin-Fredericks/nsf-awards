 "awd_abstract_narration": "Light-harvesting for photosynthesis within leaves depends on  pigment concentrations as well as the light transport  properties of mesophyll cells.  Despite the fact that the  light transport properties of leaves are an integral part of  their form and function, there is little quantitative  information about the biophysics of light transport through  leaf tissue.  One of the most important biophysical  parameters is the average pathlength that a photon travels  within a leaf, which indicates the time over which a photon  resides inside that leaf.  The longer the lifetime, the  greater the probability of absorption for photosynthesis.  The wide variety of leaf anatomy and the striking changes  that occur when leaves develop under high vs. low light may  be adaptations that are directed toward the control of light  capture by modification of light scattering properties of  the leaf tissues.  This project proposes to construct instrumentation that  utilizes ultrashort laser pulses to measure the average  transit time and transit time distribution of the light  scattered and transmitted through thin leaves of various  plant species and through leaves grown under different light  environments.  The average transit time represents the  average lifetime a photon resides in the leaf.  This  instrumentation uses a wavelength of light not absorbed by  photosynthetic pigments so that the light scattering effect  can be measured exclusively.  The proposed instrumentation  will allow sensitive photon transit time measurements with  femtosecond (10-15 second) temporal resolution; thus  allowing measurements on typical leaves.",
