One principal aim of the work  is to find ways to allow derivation of surface fluxes over larger areas than the characteristic scales  of 10 m to 100 m imposed by currently available measurement technology. Better characterization  of these quantities is needed for many reasons, not least of which is the need for improvement of  global climate models. The work is to be carried out at the DoB ARM/CART site in the Southern  Great Plains at the border between Kansas and Oklahoma. The site is highly instrumented and is  probably the best site in the world for the planned research, and several focused special observing  periods will occur during the next three years while the research is being carried out. The synergy  that will be achieved as a result of this cooperation will be excellent. The results will he of  considerable value in dynamic climate modeling and hydrological applications.",
