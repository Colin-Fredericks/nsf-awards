 "awd_abstract_narration": "9732442    This REU Site will train highly qualified students in  biology through participation in undergraduate research.  The program will enable students to develop skills in  effective experimental design and execution, oral and  written communication, and critical thinking.  In doing  so, outstanding students will be encouraged to pursue  careers in biological research.  Working with their  faculty mentors, students will formulate working  hypothesis, design and execute experiments, collect and  analyze data, and present their findings in both oral and  written forms.  In addition, the program will include  seminars by visiting scholars, weekly group research  meetings, journal clubs, and workshops in ethics,  scientific writing and career development. Students will  also visit three types of institutions that represent a  range of research environments different from the  university: institutions that combine research with public  education, traditional research institutions, and  industrial research-and-development divisions.  Students  will participate in a broad range of projects, which will  help students understand the interrelationships within and  between the various levels of biological organization.  The REU Site at Towson University will offer ample  opportunities to each participant through well-equipped  research laboratories, numerous field sites, and the  availability of highly specialized facilities at allied  institutions.  Towson University's commitment of financial  and human resources to the proposed project demonstrate  institutional support for undergraduate research.  Special  efforts will be made to involve minority students and  women in the program. The Site will train 48 undergraduate  students over a three year period, one-third of whom will  be fully supported by Towson University.",
