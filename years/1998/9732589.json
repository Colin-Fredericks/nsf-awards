Both conventional and nontraditional materials will be addressed as well as the performance of conventional materials in innovative applications.  Related work in materials and life-cycle simulation from other fields will also be considered.  The workshop will 1) define objectives for infrastructure-based research that exploits accelerated testing and computational simulation methods to determine life-cycle performance; 2) assess the state of the knowledge base to identify gaps and overlaps in research activities; 3) establish outcome-oriented metrics for setting research priorities; and 4) identify potentially promising lines of research and collaborations.",
