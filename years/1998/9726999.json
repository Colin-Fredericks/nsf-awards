 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program provides continued support to Dr. James N. Demas of the Chemistry   Department, University of Virginia, for research on use of luminescent   transition metal complexes for sensors and molecular probes.  Dr.   Benjamin DeGraff of James Madison University will collaborate on this   research which will involve undergraduate as well as graduate and   postdoctoral students.  New complexes containing Ru, Re, Os, and Ir will   be synthesized and tested as sensors for oxygen gas, carbon dioxide, and   acidity.  Heterogeneous behavior in solution (e.g., soluble polymers,   vesicles) and in solid supports (e.g., polymers, silicas) will be   examined in order to understand microheterogeneous interactions that   affect sensor probe performance.  Many methods will be used to determine   the photophysics and photochemistry of the new systems and how they are   perturbed by interaction with surfaces, including time resolved emission   spectroscopy, transition absorption spectroscopy, steady-state   luminescence, global luminescence decay analysis, gas solubility and   oxygen diffusion measurements, dynamic polarization anistropy   measurements, solvatochromic probes, temperature dependence studies,   crystallography and molecular modeling.      Oxygen, carbon dioxide, and acidity levels change during many common   biological and industrial processes.  By monitoring the levels of these   chemicals, the amount of reaction products or impurities can be   determined.  The goal of this research is to develop stable, durable   sensors that could be used in many industrial, medical, and environmental   applications.  The luminescent compounds investigated are potentially   useful in biomedical monitoring, fluoroimmunoassay, industrial process   control, wind tunnel sensors, biological oxygen demand, bioreactors, and   environmental monitoring.",
