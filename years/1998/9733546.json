 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award to Dr. Bo Hong at the University of California-Irvine   is supported by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division.   The focus of the research is the synthesis and photo- and redox-active   behavior of novel types of molecular rods and macrocyclic molecular   squares with rigid sp carbon chain spacers.  Systematic synthetic   approaches will be applied to a series of rigid rod spacers with   cumulenic and acetylenic carbon chains which will be used in the   construction of molecular rods and squares which contain photostable   organometallic moieties with donor and acceptor properties.  These rigid rods and squares will have defined structures with   controllable distances between donor and acceptor sites and controllable   cavity sizes. These features are important to molecular electronic and   photonic devices, light to energy conversion, molecular recognition and   host-guest chemistry.  The redox properties and photophysics of the novel   constructs will be investigated, particularly electronic communication   between multiple redox centers and directional photoinduced   electron/energy transfer across sp-carbon spacers.  The teaching aspect of the CAREER award will emphasize the training and   retention of women students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels   and the integration of teaching and research at the undergraduate level.   A `Women in Science` discussion group, organized by Dr. Hong,  will be   expanded to include outside speakers addressing issues such as dual   careers, interviewing, coping strategies, childcare, outreach programs   and history of women in science. The goal of this activity is to provide   practical solutions to real world problems and concerns of women    students.",
