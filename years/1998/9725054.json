 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Prof. Stephen Leone   of the University of Colorado at Boulder in his continuing studies of   alignment and wave packet chemical dynamics.  In these experiments, he   will prepare atoms in specific excited states and probe the orbital   alignment of two colliding excited state atoms.  From these studies he   will measure 3- and 4- (and possibly 5-) vector correlations.  In   addition, he will investigate wave packet focusing and alignment in   diatomic and polyatomic molecules using ultrafast laser techniques.  Here   he plans to measure photoionization cross sections vs. internuclear   separation, select time-dependent photofragment pathways, and study   polyatomic wave packet dynamics of fluxional molecules (pseudorotation in   lithium trimer molecules, e.g.).    Ultimately the objective in the field of molecular reaction dynamics is   to control and/or be able to predict the outcome of elementary chemical   processes.  The experiments proposed by Leone easily satisfy both   objectives and nicely lead us into the chemistry of the next millenium   when it may become possible to manipulate routinely which products are   formed in a reaction and the states in which they are formed.",
