 "awd_abstract_narration": "The digital Computer Science Teaching Center (CSTC) is an internet-based repository of peer reviewed reusable teaching resources for computer science educators. It will be implemented as a compelling web site with intuitive navigation and powerful search capabilities. This clearinghouse of teaching resources is endorsed by the Association of Computing Machinery and will provide a trusted avenue for the dissemination of quality materials. The CSTC will foster collaborative efforts as faculty are brought together by their common interests.    Outcomes will include a framework for developing and distributing peer reviewed reusable teaching resources. This framework can be used for a variety of resource centers that specialize in teaching resources such as curriculum development, test banks, lecture notes, and syllabi. However, the first three Resource Centers will be for visualization tools, computing laboratories, and NSF Education Innovation (EI) projects. The Visualization Resource Center contains tools and techniques to use visualizations in the classroom. The Computing Laboratories Resource Center contains peer reviewed laboratory materials designed for reuse. The EI Resource Center contains courseware, tools, and other educational resources resulting from NSF EI projects.    An open solicitation and peer review process will be developed to collect, critique, rate and refine submissions. By preserving traditional standards from an Editorial Board and peer review, the CSTC provides an avenue for professional recognition and reward for the scholarly contribution of reusable teaching materials. Accepted materials will be available to download from the CSTC. User profiles and survey results on the adoption of materials will be used to enhance the value of the CSTC. The mission and existence of the CSTC will be disseminated widely.    This project is supported in part by the ACM Education Board.",
