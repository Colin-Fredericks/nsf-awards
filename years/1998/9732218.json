The focal point is the development of the next generation of engineered wood composites for construction applications.  The disciplines involved include structural engineering, mechanics, composite materials, and wood science.  The educational paradigm will be one of combining hands-on laboratory work with training in fundamental science and engineering principles.  Previous experience with REU sites indicates that many students become interested in graduate research when they are able to see the fruits of their work used in some application.  Thus the basis of this REU site is to provide students with projects and a research environment where they may, with reasonable diligence, complete a small research project that is a clearly defined piece of the greater research and development program.  Ten students will work at U Maine for a ten-week period during the summer.  Prior to arrival on site, the advisors will contact their students to discuss the nature of their projects and to provide written background material.  During the summer, each student will be involved in four types of activities: their own individual project, work with others in their sub discipline, weekly group seminars, and group field trips.  Faculty will work closely with their students, especially during the early part of the summer.  Weekly seminars will include discussions of research techniques, ethics, graduate schools, as well as three presentations made by the students.  Group field trips include trips to major field test sites, government agencies, industries, and social events.  Follow-through after the students leave the site will consist of advisors working with their students on a technical paper based on the research and on applying to graduate school.",
