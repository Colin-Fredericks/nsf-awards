The short-format series consists of 780 daily, 2-minute programs designed for commercial and public radio stations and delivers timely information on a full spectrum of seasonal natural phenomena, drawing supportive scientific background from biology, earth science, astronomy, and cultural anthropology.  The series will make extensive use of ambient sound and interviews with scientists and knowledgeable spokespersons to present a \"daily almanac\" of events taking place on the day of broadcast.     The series will be developed and produced by Jim with additional production support from the American Museum of Natural History.  The Science content Director will be Michael Templeton and an advisory committee of eleven scientists and educators will assist in selecting specific topics for the daily programs and assure the scientific accuracy of program content.",
