 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Theodore Cohen, of the Department of Chemistry at the   University of Pittsburgh, is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular   Chemistry Program for his studies of metallo-ene cyclization reactions.    Both the insertion of titanocene into allyl phenyl sulfides and the   tandem additions of homoallyl and bis(homoallyl) metals to dienes afford   substrates for titana-ene cyclizations.  These are carried out   stoichiometrically, but may be adapted for the cyclopolymerization of   conjugated dienes through the use of excess diene, affording robust   ladder polymers.  This work is complemented by Professor Cohen's   investigation of allyl phenyl sulfides as substrates for the preparation   of allyl Grignard reagents, which in turn permit the synthesis of a wider   variety of substrates for metallo-ene cyclizations.  Reductive lithiation   of phenylthioethers affords homoallyl- and bis(homoallyl)lithiums,   offering access to anion-accelerated ene cyclization reactions through   their addition to dienes.  With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program,   Professor Theodore Cohen, of the Department of Chemistry at the   University of Pittsburgh, is developing new and efficient methods for the   synthesis of cyclic organic compounds.  Through the discovery and   exploitation of new reactions of particular classes of organometallic   compounds (compounds containing bonds between metal and carbon atoms),   Professor Cohen readily accesses complex cyclic structures of utility in   the synthesis of natural products and fine chemicals.  These reactions   may be readily adapted to permit the synthesis of `ladder` polymers which   display important physical and chemical properties, such as heat and   chemical resistance, imparted by their unique structural features.",
