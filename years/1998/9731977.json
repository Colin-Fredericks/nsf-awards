 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the problem of reconstructing a two-  dimensional surface, such as the outside of a real object, from a  collection of sample points.  The problem is important for  building models in computer graphics, and in other areas of  science and engineering. A new algorithm has been developed  which is provably correct and efficient, based on the Delaunay  triangulation of the samples.  An innovative aspect of the  algorithm is that the samples do not have to be evenly  distributed over the object - detailed areas can be sampled  densely and smooth areas can be sampled sparsely. The basic  algorithm will be tested in various applications, each requiring  different extensions or modifications, and the application  of the theory to other problems in geometric modeling will be  studied.",
