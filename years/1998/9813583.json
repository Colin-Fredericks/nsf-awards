 "awd_abstract_narration": "The TRSI project seeks to implement systemic reform principles and to improve instructional practice in science and mathematics in schools in impoverished rural districts in Texas.  The principal arena upon which the initiative will provide intervention is the local district.  The initiative will operate through four direct and indirect support strategies focused at local districts:\r\n\r\no\tdistrict and community leadership development\r\nThe initiative will require all participating districts to establish a systemic leadership team composed of teachers, administrators, parents, community members, and students.  The initiative's role will be to guide the formation of these teams, and provide assistance in gaining community support for the reform.\r\no\tdistrict teams' development of systemic reform understanding and capacity\r\nThe initiative will hold periodic 3-day institutes to increase the leadership team members' understanding of actualizing systemic reform in their districts, as defined by the NSF Drivers and the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills.\r\no\tprincipals' academies\r\nThe initiative, in recognition of the crucial role the principal plays in instructional practice in a school, will hold leadership-development forums specifically to enhance the capacity of the principals in the participating districts.\r\no\tteacher partners' academies\r\nThe initiative will work with site-identified lead teachers to guide the reform in their schools.  The role of the teacher partners will be that of a resource, model, and coach, but not that of professional development deliverer.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the four strategies listed above, the initiative will provide support to the participating districts to foster their adoption of systemic reform principles, and to implement classroom instruction in science and mathematics that is in line with the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills\r\n",
