 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731221  Bryant    This  award provides funds to permit Dr. Michael D. Bryant,  Mechanical Engineering Department, University of  Texas  at  Austin,  to  pursue with Dr. Chung Kyun Kim, Department  of  Mechanical  Engineering, Hongik University,  Seoul,  Korea,  for  36  months,  a  program  of  cooperative  research  on  improving   friction  brakes  by  eliminating  tribological  problems and reducing wear.  The collaborators will seek to  improve  high  speed  brake systems  through  complementary  efforts,  with each researcher working to improve different  aspects of disc brakes, later to be combined.  The combined  effort  could result in efficient, long lasting  brakes  on  high  speed  trains, airplanes, automobiles, and industrial  machinery    Dr. Kim will contribute a new disc design and will analyze  nonlinear thermal behavior of the disc and brake pad system  using the Finite Element Method.  He will redesign  materials and geometry on the disc to optimize removal of  heat and minimize thermal expansion problems that lead to  brake noise and premature brake wear.  Dr. Bryant will  contribute new brake pad and disc designs that incorporate  patented techniques that reduce brake pad wear and extend  (double) life.  Cooperative research issues will focus on  problems that arise when combining the two designs: (1)  necessary redesigns of both systems, (2) solving any  problems that would prevent the two systems from  functioning in a combined manner, (3) extensive testing of  the new brake system, and (4) technology transfer to  industries in both countries.  Doubling brake life and  eliminating other tribological brake problems could save  both societies billions of dollars.  This project is  relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative  Science Program which seeks to increase the level of  cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and  engineers through the exchange of scientific information,  ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on  problems of mut ual benefit.  This project provides an  international research experience for a U.S. graduate  student.  It also will add an international cooperative  dimension to ongoing research under NSF Grant No.  CMS-9713942, supported under the Surface Engineering and  Tribology Program.  Korean participation is supported by  the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  ***",
