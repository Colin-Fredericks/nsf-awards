 "awd_abstract_narration": "Process engineering is critical to virtually all modem products used by society. In addition, process engineering spans many disciplines including chemical, petroleum, biochemical, environmental, food, materials production and manufacturing. Society is requiring these products to be produced in an environmentally benign manner which necessitates the infusion of new and emerging process engineering concepts. Many faculty do not have the experience in novel process engineering required to teach this information to students. For example many new faculty from engineering, science, mathematics and technology are hired with no industry experience and only have a highly specialized knowledge of one particular field. Faculty should have experience in emerging process engineering technologies such as environmental processing, hazard evaluation. materials engineering, particle processing, bioprocessing and novel unit operations.    The thrust of this proposal is to conduct two hands-on, industry integrated workshops that have a major impact on lower level engineering, technology and science instruction as well as having a secondary impact in the preparation of future teachers. Two workshops are planned for Summer 1998 and 1999 with participants actively recruited from underrepresented groups in science and engineering. Participants in these workshops will gain experience in process engineering through hands-on laboratories, industry experts, site visits and interactive demonstrations. Through industry involvement, faculty are given an initial networking base for process engineering. Participants are required to use the given methodology to integrate novel processing into their curricula and develop an action plan for their home institution. Active learning methods is employed in the workshop and participants are encouraged to incorporate this experience into their teaching style. This state-of-the-art workshop in process engineering facilitates the integration of engineering practice into the undergraduat e curriculum.",
