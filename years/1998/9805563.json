Troyano DiBartolomeo,  Universidad de Oriente, Puerto La Cruz, Venezuela.  The  focus of the project is to develop increasingly  sophisticated electro-thermal cell models and finite element  codes for the simulation of aluminum reduction cells (ARC).  The increasing speed and storage capacity of massively  parallel computers and clusters will play an important role  in this effort, as will also improved algorithms in  (ARC)  computations.  The goal of the project is to develop and to  implement in computer codes state-of-the-art methods for  simulating the physics of ARC.  The program would provide a  needed research tool for efforts to increase the safety and  energy efficiency of aluminum production.   The updated  models and codes will be made available to university and  industrial experts in the field in the US and Venezuela.    The development of increasingly sophisticated electro-  thermal cell models and finite element codes for their  simulation should be of interest to major aluminum producing  countries such as the US and Venezuela.  Results of the best  runs of the research code as well as the code itself will be  made available to US and Venezuelan industrial research  groups.      ***",
