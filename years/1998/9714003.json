 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences will replace its aging  liquid scintillation counter with a state of the art  instrument capable of counting dual labelled samples with  very low levels of radioactivity.  This instrument will be  available for general laboratory use by Bigelow scientists,  faculty and studenrs from the University of New England,  Bigelow's affiliate, and by visiting scientists.  The  present counter places severe limitations on current  research activities,its age and heavy usage result in  frequent down time due to instrument failure, and its  limitations in terms of flexibility, sensitivity and storage  capabilities hamper research efficiency and innovation.  Acquisition of the HP Tricarb 2770A liquid scintillation  counter will allow for the first time, the examine action of  dual-labelled samples at very low levels of radioactivity  (at levels incorporated by a single cell),to use a variety  of sampling containers, to store and transfer data in a  computer environment, and to accommodate multiple users  simultaneously.  These improvements will enhance greatly on-  going research projects at Bigelow and allow the development  of new research initiatives.  This will be of use to  resident scientists, visiting and students and will be an  additional incentive for increased use of Bigelow facilities  by potential visitors.",
