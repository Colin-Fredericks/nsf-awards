 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9760351  Dean    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will prove the feasibility of smart, responsive-gel actuators for variable-volume sockets.  The comfort, walking efficiency and security of lower-limb prostheses are related directly to the fit of the socket.  Yet, a consistent, precision socket fit is often not achieved because of natural fluctuations in the volume of an amputee's residual limb.  Chronic discomfort and an expensive, often endless search for a comfortable prosthesis result.    To correct this basic defect, we will innovate a Smart Variable-Volume Socket (SVVS) whose main feature will be intrasocket, responsive-gel-filled actuators whose volume can be varied electrically.  Associated pressure sensors will provide feedback to an on-board controller.  The socket will sense and automatically compensate for volume variations of the residual limb.  It  will create a consistently precise fit which should lower the need for and cost of rehabilitation and improve greatly the quality of life of amputees.  The smart gel actuator also has important applications for orthoses and splints.    Widespread utilization of the SVVS concept is expected among the 220,000 U.S. lower-limb amputees.  A worldwide business of tens of millions of dollars should develop.  Savings of over $100 million/year in U.S. rehabilitation cost are projected.  ***",
