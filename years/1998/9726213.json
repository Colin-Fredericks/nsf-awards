 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on the   identification of underwater objects using scattered sound.  The project involves the   underwater acoustic group at the University of Delaware, led by Robert P. Gilbert, and    the Laboratory for Mechanics and Acoustics of the French National Center for Scientific   Research (CNRS), led by Armand Wirgin.  They will study a class of acoustic inverse   problems in a shallow sea.  These problems are concerned with the identification of   passive, undetermined objects.  The unknown parameters of these objects are its location   and with respect to some reference frame, its shape.  The investigators will use an incident   acoustic wave, which is scattered off an object and emits a signal.  The detected signal will   be analyzed, with the help of a computer, by means of a suitable inversion algorithm.  The   US research group has investigated successfully a case of a homogenous two-dimensional   object in a reflective seabed.  In this collaboration, their goal is to identify in real time a   three-dimensional object in a non-homogenous sea.  This collaboration takes advantage of complementary expertise of US and French   investigators.  The results may eventually be applied to searches for mines, navigational   obstacles, wrecks, polluting waste deposits, and submarines.",
