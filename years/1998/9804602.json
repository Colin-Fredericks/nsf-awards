 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dispersion management is the technique of concatenating two or \r\nmore optical fibers with different dispersion parameters to form a system \r\nwith periodically varying dispersion.  This technique makes it is \r\npossible to have both high local and low average dispersion in \r\nthe system.  The high local dispersion reduces four-wave mixing \r\n(an effect that distorts signals and produces intersymbol \r\ninterference in transmissions), while the low average dispersion \r\nreduces the net cumulative effects of dispersion over long \r\noptical fiber spans.  Overall, therefore, dispersion management \r\nreduces effects which are detrimental to the performance of \r\noptical-fiber based communication systems, thus allowing transmission \r\ncapacity to be increased.  In mathematical terms, what must be \r\nstudied are nonlinear wave equations with rapidly varying \r\ncoefficients. The theory of these equations is currently not well \r\nunderstood and will be advanced with support from this award. \r\n\r\nThe theme of this research is the development of new mathematical \r\ntechniques with which to model the propagation of optical pulses \r\nin nonlinear optical fibers.  It is important to properly \r\nunderstand the dynamics of such pulses in optical communication \r\nand information processing systems so that new techniques can be \r\ndevised to increase their overall capacity.  In particular, new \r\nmathematical methods for dealing with dispersion management\r\nwill be investigated, in order to predict and improve the performance \r\nof such systems.\r\n\r\n",
