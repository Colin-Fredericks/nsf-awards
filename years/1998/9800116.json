 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sensory system of touch is highly sensitive to skin  deformations during applied constant pressure or vibrational  stimuli.  It is not yet clear just how the activity of nerve cells  encode these micromechanical forces.  This project utilizes a  bioengineering approach with a novel preparation of an isolated  patch of skin, to precisely control the stiffness of the material  used for underlying support, the skin temperature, and variables  such as skin indentation, load, and frequency of a vibrotactile  point stimulus, while physiologically recording activity from  single nerve fibers. The tensile measurements are important  because skin in soft areas may respond quite differently from skin  over stiff areas, and result in quite different sensory  perceptions to exactly the same external stimulus.  These  experiments directly test the relative role of the physical  components of compressive and tensile stresses and strains, and  how these may be encoded in the neuronal activity.     Results will be important not only to the physiology of tactile  responses, but to understanding the perception of tactile stimuli,  and so will have impact on studies of neuronal coding in general,  on bioengineering studies of micromechanics of complex biological  tissues, and may have potential application in areas such as  tactile reading aids.",
