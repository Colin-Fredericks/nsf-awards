 "awd_abstract_narration": "Weis  9728405    Symbiotic associations between two or more unrelated organisms are found  throughout every ecosystem. These relationships encompass a spectrum of  lifestyles, from mutualistic to parasitic, and from extracellular to  intracellular. Among the most significant marine mutualisms are those  between corals and their algal symbionts, which together form the  foundation of the entire coral reef ecosystem. A great deal is known about  corals on a macroscale level, such as their global distribution and  ecology. However, microscale processes of inter-partner communication and  regulation that occur during the initiation, establishment and maintenance  of these symbioses remain largely unexplored. A lack of basic knowledge of  these processes has hampered efforts to understand the global phenomenon of  coral bleaching, which is the result of the breakdown of the symbiosis.  Widespread bleaching, which leads to coral death and reef degradation, is  considered a serious environmental threat. This study will take a  multileveled approach to the examination of the initial events surrounding  the onset of symbiosis between corals and their symbiotic algae. The PIs  will examine when and how the symbiosis is established during the natural  life cycle of corals. Secondly, the PIs will investigate the effects that  the establishment of the partnership has on the biochemistry and molecular  biology of the host coral.",
