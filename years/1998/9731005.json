 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731005  Vogt    Hormones control many changes in the nervous systems of humans and other animals throughout life, yet relatively little is know regarding the actual mechanisms by which hormones regulate nervous system development.  Dr. Vogt will examine how steroid hormones control the birth of sensory nerve cells during the sexual maturation phase of adult development, using an insect olfactory system as a model.  The study system is well characterized, is accessible to experimental analysis and manipulation, and has close parallels with other animal models.  A great deal is known about the genetics of sensory nerve cell formation, but as yet little is known about the mechanisms of hormone action on nerve cell formation. Dr. Vogt has previously shown that steroid hormones present during development can control the timing and patterns of nerve cell birth, as well as the expression of genes which themselves control sensory neuron development.  He will now identify specific mechanisms by which steroid hormones control the birth of new nerve cells.  The results from this project will enrich our understanding of basic cell biological processes at work in sensory development.  Further, because of the use of an insect model, the project will provide insight for the design of new strategies for insect control in olfactory-based predation of crop plants and olfactory-based host seeking and mate seeking behaviors.",
