 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this project is to identify genes that work together when plants respond to and develop tolerance for environmental stress. Although gene networks have been treated theoretically, biologists have never before been in a position to define the components of a network. Microarray technology, together with the increasing availability of cDNA and genome sequences, now makes it possible to identify groups of genes whose expression patterns change coordinately. However this technology is still in need of development to make it a more sensitive detection system that is also economically accessible to individual academic investigators. This team of investigators plans to develop new types of highly sensitive nucleic acid microarray detection systems, using colloidal gold particles to amplify detection of nucleic acids on a gold surface. While the overall concept represents a new approach with potential for both high sensitivity and low-cost detection, parts of each component have been demonstrated. This project will combine these elements and test two different detection schemes; one based on gold colloid-enhanced microwave mixing and the other on gold colloid-enhanced surface plasmon resonance.\r\n\r\nThe initial biological focus will be on genes whose expression levels are altered by biotic and abiotic stress. The specific stressors to be used in creating a model system for evaluating the new microarray detection schemes are ozone and pathogen attack. These stressors are the focus because of the parallels between some aspects of plant responses to ozone and to pathogens. Ozone can evoke formation of rapid necrotic lesions that mimic the pathogen-induced hypersensitive response. However, the response to both ozone and pathogens depends on the mode and duration of exposure, as well as the genetic constitution of the plant. Microarray technology will make it possible to analyze the differences and similarities between these physiological stress responses at the molecular level. This will permit the identification of gene sets whose activation is common to the stressors, as well as gene sets whose activation is unique to each. The results will facilitate studies on developmental, tissue-specific, and temporal differences in molecular stress response patterns and the combinatorial effects of multiple simultaneous stresses. It is well known that there are genetic differences among plants in the capacity to develop tolerance to stress and resistance to pathogen attack, that tolerance can develop in response to stress and that the ability to develop tolerance varies with age. The proposed experiments will pave the way for identifying and analyzing gene sets required for the development of stress tolerance and pathogen resistance.\r\n\r\nA Microarray Facility is being developed at the Pennsylvania State University. This will initially make use of existing technology for DNA chip construction and two-color fluorescent probe hybridization. The microchip arrayer will then be used to create microarrays of PCR-amplifled cDNAs on a gold surface. Current fluorescence detection techniques will be used to develop a baseline for evaluating the new detection techniques. The broadest possible range of potential members of stress-response gene networks will be used for the construction of microarrays, beginning with candidate genes selected from results of published studies, as well as database searches for homologs. Existing Arabidopsis ESTs will be screened for additional candidate differentially expressed genes through the Monsanto Arabidopsis microarray program.\r\n\r\nAlthough Arabidopsis will be used in these studies, the proposed research will be directly relevant to agronomically important plants because of the high degree of protein sequence conservation among different species. Moreover, there is a high probability that gene networks identified in Arabidopsis will have counterparts in other plants, facilitating their identification and, eventually, their manipulation to improve agronomic traits. The microarray research will benefit plant researchers by reducing cost and increasing the availability of the technology.\r\n",
