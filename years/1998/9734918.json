 "awd_abstract_narration": "The final goal of research in complexity theory is to classify  the complexity of real-world computational problems by providing  lower bounds on the resources required to solve them.  To date -  in spite of impressive lower bounds for restricted types of  circuits  - almost the only useful progress toward this goal has  come via the tool of reducibility which allows to show that a  problem is complete for a complexity class.  Thus the complexity  class has become the fundamental object of study in complexity  theory, and the basic questions in the field concern the  relationships among complexity classes.  Until these  relationships are clarified, many important activities in  computing ( in particular: public-key cryptography) will rest on  uncertain conjectures. Many of the most important complexity  classes can be characterized in terms of boolean circuits of  restricted size or depth, etc.  Recently, it has become apparent  that arithmetic circuits are also very useful in this regard.  The relationships between Booleau and arithmetric circuit  complexity are still only poorly understood, although there has  been significant progress on this front recently.  This project  will work to clarify these relationships further, and will seek  to exploit the algebraic characteristics of arithmetic complexity  classes to devise new approaches to prove lower bounds. Most of  what we know about the complexity of real-world problems comes  from the surprising fact that the overwhelming majority of such  problems are complete for well-studied complexity classes, under  very restrictive reducibilities.  Recent progress has shown that  these sets are actually isomorphic to each other, under very  simple isomorphisms.  Up to now, the work on isomorphisms has  been primarily of theoretical interest.  This project will work  to see if the isomorphism theorems can be used to derive  practical information about the complexity of real-world  problems. More generally, this project will attempt to clarify  the rel ationships among complexity classes, and the various  notions (nondeterminism, unambiguity, symmetry, Boolean and  arithmetic circuits, etc.) that define models of computation  characterizing important complexity classes.",
