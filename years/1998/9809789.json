The PI is using historical analysis  of the variation of epidemic disease prevention strategies to determine the factors that influence national approaches to AIDS.  The project has two goals.  First, to analyze the reasons for national variations in the legislation and regulation applied to AIDS and thereby to determine, by comparative analysis of several nations, what the crucial determining factors have been in the evolution and development of preventive strategies.  Second, it will evaluate the historical trajectory and tradition influencing legal structure and policy debates that appear otherwise to be concerned largely with contemporary issues.  Data are being collected in Germany, Britain, Sweden , and France.  The results will advance scientific understanding of the legal and procedural strategies to epidemics.",
