 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on elucidating the chemistry of organic radical   anions and cations that are considered to be key intermediates in a   number of chemical and biochemical transformations.   The rates of decay   of these transient intermediates, generated  chemically,   electrochemically, or photochemically from selected precursors, will be   measured as functions of precursor structure, solvent polarity and   counter ion.   Corresponding thermodynamic data, principally the free   energy change associated with the ring opening of cyclic radical anions   and cations, will be determined electrochemically by means of appropriate   thermochemical cycles.   Using selected precursors that have been or will   be synthesized during the course of the experiments, and correlating the   kinetic and thermodynamic data obtained for the corresponding radical   anion or cation, structure-reactivity relationships of these short-lived   intermediates will be developed.      With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   supports the research and educational activities of Professor James Tanko   of the Chemistry Department at Virginia Polytechnic University.      Professor Tanko's research will focus on elucidating the   structure-reactivity relationships that define the chemistry of reactive   cationic and anionic radical intermediates.   Although well known as   intermediates in a number of organic transformations, these   highly-reactive, short-lived intermediates are now thought to be   intermediates in a number of pharmacological and enzymatic   transformations.   Professor Tanko's educational activities involve the   education and training of postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate   students.",
