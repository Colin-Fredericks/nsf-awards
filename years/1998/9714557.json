 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will analyze the performance of concatenated coding systems and modulation schemes operating over the additive Gaussian channel (AWGN) and various fading channels by examining the loss of capacity resulting from each of the encoding and decoding steps.  This information will then be used to guide the design of new coding systems.  The techniques described in this research allow the separate evaluation of codes and decoders and thus the identification of where loss of capacity occurs.  Knowledge of this capacity loss is important for the overall design of a communications system, e.g. for evaluating the benefits of inner decoders that produce information beyond the maximum likelihood estimate.  First a general technique for calculating the composite capacity of an orthogonal code and the AWGN channel in isolation has been developed.  Then the composite capacities of an orthogonal code, the AWGN channel, and various inner decoders including the decoder estimating the bit-by-bit probability of a one, as in turbo codes, has been developed.  The calculations in these examples show that the maximum likelihood decoder introduces a large loss in capacity.  Some of this capacity loss can be regained by using only slightly more complex inner decoders, e.g. a detector for M-ary frequency-shift-keying that outputs the two most likely frequencies and the probability that the ML estimate is correct gives substantially less degradation than one which only outputs the most likely frequency.  This project extends these results to other codes and other channels.  Practically useful results should be short codes that come close to the sphere packing bound for the Gaussian channel and improved conventional and parallel concatenated codes for fading channels. Experimental studies will be included in the work.",
