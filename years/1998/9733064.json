 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award supports research on measurement of three-dimensional deformation patterns and flow characteristics within a soil continuum. Such measurements are usually limited by the fact that soil sensors do not provide a continuous image of the measured continuum.   Additionally, soil sensors exhibit static and dynamic characteristics that are different form those of the surrounding soils, and therefore can change the response of the measured continuum.  Tests conducted with a transparent material which has properties that closely model the geotechnical properties of natural soils can potentially circumvent these experimental problems if the response of a model transparent continuum can be measured using non-intrusive optical visualization techniques.  The Principal Investigator has established methods for production and customization of a transparent synthetic soil that will meet model test requirements in terms of strength, deformation, and permeability.  This project will develop the technology (equipment and methodology) for performing optical tomography within soil continua.  Cross sections of the transparent soil mass will be illuminated using laser light and line scan cameras will be used to capture the reflected light.   Computer based digital image processing will be used to analyze the reflected light and construct continuous images of the spatial deformation patterns and flow paths within the transparent model soil mass.  This new technology will result in: better analyses and improved reliability of three-dimensional soil structure interaction and multiphase flow; and test results that can be used for the difficult validation of three-dimensional numerical analysis codes.  The project will also include development of advanced educational experiments to visualize the performance of infrastructure and environmental projects.  These low cost experiments can also be used to vitalize recruitment  efforts of high school students into civil engineering programs.",
