There is also experimental  collaboration with the University of Wisconsin.  The central  objective is to perform large scale simulations based on the  order-N  O(N)  non-orthogonal tight-binding molecular  dynamics (NOTB-MD) to predict accurately the structural,  electronic, and bonding properties of Si-based materials.  Very recently an O(N) technique for the calculation of both  total energy as well as atomic forces has been developed by  two of the PI's in the context of a NOTB Hamiltonian.  The  importance of the O(N) technique is that it overcomes the  bottleneck present in the conventional total energy and  atomic force calculations by reducing the scaling of  computational time from N3 to N, where N denotes the size of  the system.  The advantage of NOTB Hamiltonian is that it  incorporates a quantum mechanical description of the  electronic structure and it is best suited for situations  with arbitrary coordination encountered in MD simulations.  Hence, the O(N) NOTB-MD scheme provides an excellent means  to investigate systems with realistic sizes that are  currently outside the scope of first-principles molecular  dynamics simulations.  Furthermore, using innovative local  measures and the method of real space Green's function in  conjunction with the O(N) NOTB-MD technique, a powerful tool  is now in place to analyze the vast amount of information  obtained from a MD simulation.  The twin theme of performing  large scale simulations, and predicting properties  accurately at the microscopic level, is one of the unique  features of this research.    The research is comprised of four projects.  The first  focuses on the initial stages of growth of Si and Ge  depositions on a Si(100) surface.  The second is concerned  with the study of the onset of the transition from a two-  dimensional to three-dimensional growth for Gen films  d eposited on the Si(001) substrate.  In project three,  equilibrium and electronic structures of Si nanoparticles  from a few hundred to a few thousand atoms will be  investigated with the aim of understanding the effect of  quantum confinement on the properties of these nanosystems.  Finally, project four looks at issues related to the  fabrication of nanoheterostructures (SixGe1-x) and the  effect of strain on their properties will be explored.    The scientific outcome of this study is expected to lead to  the understanding of the link between the adsorption of  monomers and the formation of growth structures in Si and Ge  depositions on the Si(100) substrate, the formation of  islands, alloy ordering and surface segregation, equilibrium  shape of nanoparticles, the effect of quantum confinement on  the properties of Si nanoparticles, etc.  %%%  This is a theoretical research project, largely  computational, involving the University of Louisville and  Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
