Examples of recently discovered materials  that have generated great activity include: the compund Sr14-  xCaxCu24O41, which has Cu-O chains and ladders but no  layers, yet superconducts for a narrow range of x in a  specific range of pressure; the class of spin-1/2 layered  vanadates CaVnO2n+1, which show spin-Peierls behavior (n=3)  or spin-gap behavior with a wide range of gaps (n=2 and  n=4); the Fe-Si system FenSim, for which the n=1, m=2 and  n=2, m=1 members are rather standard metals whereas the  n=m=1 member is a very unusual `Kondo insulator' with an  energy gap of 60meV; and the filled skutterudite systems  such as Ce1-xLaxCo4Sb12 which show superb thermoelectric  behavior for heat management applications.  The high  temperature superconducting cuprates, of course, continue to  cause fascination due to apparent d-wave order parameter,  the complex flux lattice behavior arising in part from their  short coherence length, and in no small part due to the  continuing elusiveness of the microscopic pairing mechanism.  A widespread fascination has arisen from the so-called  `colossal magnetoresistance' manganite materials which show  numerous charge, spin, and structural orderings, and unusual  field-driven reentrant behavior.  In several cases the  development of novel materials has resulted from close  interplay between theory and experiment, with not only  interpretation of properties being the role of theory but  also the direct indication of what promises to be  interesting, where to look for it, and so on.     Features that are common to many of these novel materials  are: (1) they are multicomponent, with properties being  strongly dependent on stoichiometry; (ii) their crystal  structures have low symmetry, indicative of unusual chemical  bonding patterns; (iii) their properties are unconventional,  and often vary considerably wit h small changes in material  parameters (doping level, temperature, pressure, even ionic  size is sometimes crucial); and (iv) they involve the  interplay of itinerant carriers and states which are in some  sense localized.    It is this last feature, in concert with the other  complications, that provides the peculiar behavior.  Complexity of the unit cell alone usually does not cause  fundamental difficulty for theorists trying to descibe the  systems.  Complex intermetallics, quaternary semiconductors,  and semiconductor superlattices can usually be handled well  by a combination of phenomenological methods and the local  density approximation within density functional theory.  Likewise, localized atomic states in simple cell lattices  (viz. NiO in the rocksalt structure) may lead to very  interesting correlated electron behavior, but they simply do  not possess the degrees of freedom that are present in more  complex lattices.    In many of these systems model Hamiltonians will continue to  be required to address their thermodynamic and spectral  properties.  There is however serious need to address the  complexities of the unit cell concomitantly with the  correlated electron behavior that arises in combined  itinerant/loccalized carrier systems from first principles.  The work proposed here will apply a combination of methods -  parametrized tight-binding Hamiltonians, precise local spin  density calculations, `beyond LDA' innovations, and exact  diagonalization methods - to such complex compounds with the  expectation of simultaneously increasing understanding of  the observed behavior and extending the capabilities of  first principles methods.  %%%  This theoretical research will investigate complex materials  of current interest which display a competition between  electrons which are localized, i.e., fixed to atoms or  molecules, and ones which are not.  This competition, along  with other materials properties such as temperature,  pressure and concentration, can produce highly unusua l  effects which are of fundamental interest and which may lead  to technological applications.  ***",
