When chaos is dominant important consequences, such as the equal likelihood of all distinct solutions, result.  These, in turn, revisit many unanswered questions in our understanding of the long-time behavior of statistical theories of nature.  Even this simple view of chaos does not carry over well to the microscopic or quantum world, which is dominated by wave effects.  Interference and diffraction effects suppress the classical sensitivity to initial conditions and result in preferred configurations.  Collectively referred to as quantum chaos, these effects multiply on including the feature that non-uniformities exist even in the classical description.  In general, chaotic and regular or stable regions coexist and the quantum consequences of this `mixed space' dynamics are poorly understood.  This regime is also pertinent to a recent, and unusual, confluence of experiments in a variety of novel contexts.  The proposed study continues with ongoing work on the characterization of the mixed space quantum coherences as well as a detailed analysis of their robustness to environmental noise.  The combination numerical and analytic method specifically targets atom optics as the experimental test bed for the findings.  It is anticipated that the findings will help clarify the conditions under which the classical and quantum descriptions can be reconciled.\r\n***\r\n",
