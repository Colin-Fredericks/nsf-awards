 "awd_abstract_narration": "9805036  Levine  This is a renewal grant which puts forward an ambitious plan  for making substantial progress on interface structure and  motion in spatially-extended non-equilibrium systems.  The  primary focus is on the disordered interfacial structure  (sometimes with fractal scaling) seen in diffusion-limited  growth, unstable viscous fingering and related processes.  Interfaces which arise in non-equilibrium chemical reactions  and interfaces that arise in simple models of of biological  evolution will also be studied.  One recurrent theme is that  in all of these cases, one has both deterministic effects  and stochastic ones; the stochastic effects typically enter  as multiplicative noise acting on a set of reaction-  diffusion equations describing the \"mean\" structure.  These  studies will use both computational techniques and  analytical methods; formulations will be investigated in  terms of stochastic partial differential equations, or  alternatively in terms of coupled correlation functions.  The goals include a better understanding of the origin of  scaling, a more quantitative approach to the calculation of  the overall probability distribution of the growth patterns  and a deeper appreciation of exactly which changes at the  microscopic level can drastically alter macroscopic  structure.  If successful, our efforts will provide a firmer  basis for applications of interface dynamics to systems  ranging from enhanced oil recovery and alloy solidification  to diffusion-controlled chemical reactions and  microbiological evolution.  The lessons learned here will  also have a significant impact on the understanding of non-  equilibrium spatially-extended dynamical processes, one of  the frontiers of modern physics.  %%%  This theoretical grant will support research on interface  structure and motion in spatially-extended non-equilibrium  systems.  The analysis will include both deterministic and  random effects.  Results will provide a foundation for  applications of interface dynamics  to enhanced oil recovery,  alloy solidification, diffusion-controlled chemical  reactions and microbiological evolution.  ***",
