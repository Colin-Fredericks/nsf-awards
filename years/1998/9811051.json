 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9811051\r\nBarmish\r\nThis is a proposal to set up a three year research project. The motivation for this proposal is derived from the recent results in the newly emergent area of Probabilistic Robustness. It is felt that a successful project would have an impact on many fields which rely on Monte Carlo simulation, The critical point distinguishing this proposed research from existing literature is as follows: Unlike classical Monte Carlo simulation, the new approach being considered requires almost no apriori information about the probability distribution for the uncertain parameters. In this new framework, the given data is exactly the same as in classical robustness theory with real parametric uncertainty; i.e., only a mathematical input-output model and upper and lower bounds for each uncertain parameter are assumed. This raises the following questions: What probability distribution makes sense to use in a Monte Carlo context? Is there a meaning way to 'prograrn\" the random number generator for Monte Carlo simulation when no probability distribution is available? In the body of the proposal, these questions are examined in greater detail and the proposed research aimed at their resolution.\r\n\r\nPreliminary results motivating the proposed research suggest that sampling of uncertainty should often be carried out in a way which is quite different from classical Monte Carlo schemes. For example, in the body, a case study involving a 2-stage amplifier is described. The sampling distribution turns out to require truncation of the probability distribution for the two uncertain capacitors. Such a distribution is not one which would normally be used in a Monte Carlo circuit analysis. The end result is that a prediction of the 'probability of successful operation\" using a traditional Monte Carlo scheme is subjected to challenge. One of the main objectives of the research is to demonstrate applicability of the new ideas to many application areas and compare 'old style Monte Carlo\" results with the results obtained using the new approach. It is felt that classical Monte Carlo analysis often leads to predictions which are unduly optimistic.\r\n\r\nThis situation (the availability of bounds but no statistics) is quite typical in the Systems Science area when one approaches a problem in a robustness context or via interval analysis methods. In summary, the proposed research concentrates on problems for which a reliable probability distribution is unavailable. Whereas Monte Carlo theory assumes a distribution as input to the theory, the proposed work involves finding the 'appropriate\" distribution as the output of the theory; i.e., the theory first determines the appropriate distribution, and, only then is computer simulation carried out.\r\n\r\nThe starting point for the proposed research is a new type of paradigm to describe uncertainty - developed by the Principal Investigator in collaboration with his graduate student. Consistent with the example above, this new paradigm requires only apriori bounds on the percentage errors for the random variables. The only other assumption required is that large deviations from the mean are less probable than small deviations.  \r\n***  \r\n",
