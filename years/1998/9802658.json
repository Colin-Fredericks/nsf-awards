 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST 98-02658  Osmer    The PI is undertaking four projects related to production of and use of large area multicolor surveys.  The development of high quality, large format CCDs and cameras with multiple CCD detectors has been important to observational cosmology.  It is now possible to survey many square degrees of the sky with 4 meter class telescopes to limiting magnitudes greater than or equal to 25 mag (back to epochs when the universe was less than 10% of its present age).    The PI proposes four projects:   (1)  to search for quasars at redshift>5 to determine when they first become visible, how rapidly their space density evolves, and how they relate to the formation of galaxies.  (2)  to investigate the luminosity function of quasars at redshift=2 down to absolute magnitudes similar to those of nearby AGNs, thereby constraining their evolution between the present and the epoch when more luminous quasars reach a peak in the evolution of their space density.  (3)  to study the evolution of the optical properties of galaxies at redshifts up to 3.5, and   (4)  to study the observational relationship between quasars and galaxies over the same range in redshift and absolute luminosity.      The PI has begun three surveys:  Two of the surveys target objects with redshift >5. The first one covers 1000 deg2 of sky, the second one covers 50 deg2 of sky.  This second survey is multicolor and uses B, V, I filters down to a limiting magnitude of I = 24 mag.  The third survey is also multicolor and uses B, R, I filters.  It covers 8 deg2 of sky down to a limiting magnitude of R = 25.7 mag.  This third survey searches for quasars with  3.3<redshift<5.0.  The PI is adding to the third survey observations in U,V over 3 deg2.  ***",
