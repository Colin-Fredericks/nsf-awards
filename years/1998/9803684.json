In a crossover design each of several subjects receives  multiple treatments, one at each of several time periods. The design  problem consists of selecting the sequences of treatments to be used,  and of deciding how often to use each of these sequences. While  practical considerations play a major role, answers based on  statistical considerations differ depending on the assumptions about  the statistical model for the measurements. This research involves  finding efficient practical designs under various realistic model  assumptions. We use these results to identify designs with good  properties for most models. Concerning orthogonal arrays, this  research provides new methods for the construction of mixed  orthogonal arrays, as well as an extensive library of such arrays.  In addition, compound orthogonal arrays are studied for their  properties when used in a factorial experiment to detect location   and dispersion effects simultaneously.    Designed experiments are an integral part of scientific research  and of product development and improvement in industry. Crossover  designs and orthogonal arrays play a particularly prominent role.  Crossover designs are best known for their role in medical research  and in clinical trials, where they are used in studies to compare  two or more treatments, possibly including a placebo. Orthogonal  arrays play a crucial role in quality improvement and assessment  studies in all of manufacturing. They are, among others, used in  studies to determine the possible effect that changes in a  manufacturing process have on the quality of the final product.  This research helps to  improve the efficiency of such trials  and studies by identifying better designs and by making such  designs widely available.",
