 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9801506  McAlindon  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project submitted by McAlindon Enterprises, Inc proposes to develop a new alphanumeric input device (AID) to address the ergonomic and efficiency needs of users who suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and also of users with other physical disabilities.  This AID would allow a new approach to typing.  It uses a pair of devices; each comprised of a dome upon which the hands comfortably rest.  Its typing methodology entails creating a keystroke via a combination of positions of the two domes called 'chording.'  Phase I research investigated how ergonomic, biomechanical, and typing performances on this new device compared to an ergonomically designed keyboard and the flat QWERTY keyboard.  Phase II research will focus on optimizing dome travel and actuating force, optimizing character layout, and extended testing of the AID-CTS prototype including skill acquisition.  Using keyboards is a ubiquitous fact of the modern workplace.   Within this context, CTS is a growing problem.  If successful, the project proffers a keyboard with significant implications for human comfort and uninterrupted productivity as well as for the reduction of insurance claims.   ***",
