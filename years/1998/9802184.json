A  general elastoplastic constitutive model will be developed.    In particular, three aspects of this extremely complex  behavior will be  addressed.  The first one concerns the modeling of the  response of both  normally consolidated and overconsolidated clays.  For this  purpose,  the elastoplastic theory which will be employed is not the  classical  one but a new one, which is based on loading-unloading  irreversibility  and on a shift of the emphasis from the concept of yield  surface to the  concept of the elastic range.  The new theory has the  capability to  describe both conventional and unconventional patterns of  elastic-plastic behavior, in addition to being very  attractive from a  computational point of view.    The second issue to be addresses deals with the modeling of  the  influence of soil anisotropy, both initial and stress  induced, in the  observed response.  The last issue to be addressed is that  of  localization of deformation, the determination of the  orientation and  the width of the localized zone, as well as the associated  mesh  sensitivity.  This is a very important issue, since crack  initiation  and propagation play a significant role in the  serviceability and  behavior of structures.  ***",
