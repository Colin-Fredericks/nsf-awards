Mays Hoopes, after 5 years as Vice President and Dean of the College at Pomona College, to join the Biology Department faculty at Pomona College.  She was appointed with tenure in the Biology Department, but as a full time administrator, has had little time to be involved in the teaching and research that a faculty member is expected to carry out.  The laboratory of Dr. Judith Campbell at California Institute of Technology is providing a place where Dr. Hoopes can develop a project concerning the DNA2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, including learning the techniques for studying DNA transactions in yeast.  In addition, it will be possible to audit Dr. Campbell's class and  attend numerous lectures on state-of-the-art molecular biology.  This project is particularly suited for a POWRE award because Dr. Hoopes will be returning to the laboratory and learning new techniques and approaches while working in Dr. Campbell's laboratory.  In the six months following Dr. Hoopes' return to Pomona College, she will set up her own laboratory to study the genetics and biochemistry of yeast proteins that act on DNA and teach a new course on The Molecular Genetics of Eukaryotic Regulation. \r\n",
