 "awd_abstract_narration": "State-of-the-art virtual environment technology immerses individuals in illusory physical and social environments which are under the complete control of the virtual environment creators. People act relatively unrestrictedly and in real time within such virtual environments.  This fact has broad implications for basic and applied research in the behavioral, educational, and social sciences. This project focuses on immersive virtual environments as a basic research tool in four substantive areas:  Learning, visual perception, social interaction and social influence, and spatial cognition. The research will help to answer basic theoretical research questions, and will establish the validity and reliability of immersive virtual environments as a research tool.\r\n\r\nThe project will use immersive virtual environments to understand learning of scientific systems, including: presence (i.e., the feeling of immersion or being in a virtual representation of the scientific system such as a heart or a lung); guidance (i.e., free vs. guided exploration within a three-dimensional representation); realism (i.e., abstract vs schematic virtual representation); and verbal augmentation (i.e., audible narrative).  The project will also use immersive virtual environments to investigate basic perceptual mechanisms underlying distance perception, perceptual-motor transformations (i.e., perceptual correction of visual distortions caused by external factors such as prisms), and perception of lightness and shape. Immersive virtual environments will also be used to explore and identify nonverbal communication characteristics that are essential to meaningful social interaction within and outside of virtual environments, and to conduct studies on fundamental social influence processes (i.e., social facilitation/inhibition, group risk taking, and ostracism) within virtual environments. Within the area of spatial cognition, the project will investigate how individuals aggregate local cognitive maps into global ones, and to investigate basic properties of alignment effects (i.e., how an individual's body orientation affects acquisition of spatial knowledge).\r\n",
