The instrumentation grant funds the purchase of a 32-processor workstation cluster built from commodity microprocessors and networking components. The equipment is to be used to set up a Parallel Computing Laboratory in the Department of Computer Science at New Mexico State University. The workstation cluster will be used as a distributed memory parallel computer dedicated to support application-driven parallel computing and high-performance scientific computing research on low-cost commodity-based systems.    Results from this research are to be made available in the form of libraries, tools and applications software for researchers interested in low-cost commodity-based parallel computing. The equipment also supports an interdisciplinary educational program in computational science.",
