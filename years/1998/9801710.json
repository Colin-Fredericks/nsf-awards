 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI:David Ingerman  DMS-9801710    This project is concerned with discrete and continuous inverse  boundary problems. These are the problems of obtaining information about a   surface or a graph, given some measurements on the boundary of  the object, and the problems of characterizing possible boundary measurements.   An example of such a problem would be the recovering of conductivity (or genus)   of a surface given its Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (the map from boundary   potential to current). Our results show that the graphs can provide an   efficient way for computer modeling of continuous medium behavior.   We are also interested in approximation of solutions   of continuous inverse boundary problems by the discrete ones.      The main subject of this project is understanding of the connection between   continuous and discrete inverse boundary problems. These are problems of   obtaining information about interior structure of a body from some   measurements made on its surface. The problems take their  origin in the oil exploration industry from attempts to non-invasively determine  earth deep structure by inducing and measuring electromagnetic fields on the   surface. We made a good progress in understanding of the discretized versions   of the problem. Our goals in this project are modeling of continuous medium   behavior using the discrete analogs and approximation of solutions   of continuous inverse boundary problems by the discrete ones.",
