 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728893  Morton    This Americas Program award will fund a short-term visit to  Medellin, Colombia, by Dr. Robert Morton, University of  Texas, Austin, to plan an international cooperative research  project in collaboration with Dr. Ivan D. Correa,  Universidad EAFIT, Medellin, involving coastal geologic  research focused on the San Juan delta area, Pacific coast  of Colombia.    The Pacific coast of Colombia is a region of significant  geological interest because active tectonic forces coupled  with extremely high rainfall, a moderately high tide range,  and moderate wave energy have constructed a coastal plain  with diverse depositional environments and associated  ecosystems.  An analysis at geological and historical time  scales is necessary to understand its evolution of the coast  and to predict future changes.    This visit is intended to specifically address research  responsibilities of the collaborators, such as sediment  budget analysis and tectonic influences, as well as  tentative schedules for completion of phases of the project,  and the level of involvement by undergraduate and graduate  students of the US and Colombia.  After traveling to the  field area to examine river-bank exposures, observing wave  and tidal processes and beach morphologies,  they will  return to Medellin to discuss final plans for collaboration,  assignment of responsibilities and schedule for proposal  preparation.    ***",
