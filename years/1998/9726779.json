The target of the research is GABAB, a receptor of y-  aminobutyric   acid   (GABA),   the   brain's   main    inhibitory  neurotransmitter  known  to  exert a  powerful  influence  on  the  occurrence  of  long-lasting  synaptic  plasticity  changes   that  subserve learning. Our interest in the GABAB receptor emerged from  the  earlier  findings  that selective  antagonism  of  the  5-HT3  (serotonin)  receptor  subtype in awake  behaving  rats  causes  a  reduction   in  the  firing  rate  of  a  subset  of   hippocampal  interneurons,  thereby  facilitating  the  induction  of  synaptic  plasticity and causing a robust memory enhancement (Staubli &  Xu,  1995;  Reznic & Staubli, 1997). Our hypothesis is that  the  final  mediator in the above cascade of effects appeared to be the  GABAB  receptor.    The  proposed  experiments will use a selective  GABAB  receptor  antagonist  with  a significantly higher affinity  for  post-  vs.  presynaptic  receptors. The immediate goals are four-fold:  1)  to  characterize  the  different roles of pre- vs. postsynaptic  GABAB  receptors  in modulating synaptic plasticity, thereby  reconciling  the  apparently  contradictory findings  mentioned  above;  2)  to  establish  the  concentration range over  which  GABAB  antagonism  promotes the formation of different forms of memory; 3) to  assess  whether  GABA8  antagonist  administered  systemically  to  freely  moving  rats  facilitates the induction of long-term  potentiation  (an  intensively studied form of synaptic plasticity suspected  to  be  the substrate for certain forms of memory) in hippocampal area  CA1; 4) to examine whether bil ateral intrahippocampal infusion  of  GABAB  antagonist  facilitates  both  long-term  potentiation  and  memory in the same animal, at the same time.    The  knowledge  obtained from this work will be  invaluable  for  extracting  key  neurobiological principles  towards  a  rationale  design  of compounds directed at memory disorders associated  with  aging and disease.",
