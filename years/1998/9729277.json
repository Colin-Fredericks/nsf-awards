 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the preparation of chiral oxazolidinone   auxiliaries suitable for attachment to polymer supports.  These systems   will then be used to induce chiral induction in aldol and Diels-Alder   reactions.  The ease of recycling the auxiliaries will offer advantages   over current methodology and the potential for synthesizing small   molecule libraries will be exploited.  The research will be carried out   with the help of undergraduate participants. With this Research in   Undergraduate Institutions award, the Organic and Macromolecular   Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational activities   of Dr. Brian J. McNelis of the Department of Chemistry at Santa Clara   University.  Professor McNelis, with the help of undergraduate coworkers,    will focus his work on developing new methods for solid-phase synthesis.    The methodology has the potential for application in the pharmaceutical   industry for the preparation of compounds with important biological   properties.",
