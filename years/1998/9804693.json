 "awd_abstract_narration": "Until approximately 2,000 years ago South Africa was inhabited solely by `San` (`Bushman`) foragers who lacked pottery and domestic livestock and subsisted solely by hunting and gathering. This picture changed with the appearance of both livestock and ceramics, introduced by other Bushman/Hottentot groups. In the parts of South Africa such as the Karoo these two groups and lifestyles interacted for almost a thousand years until the appearance of the Boers in the 1700s. The goal of Dr. Sampson's research is to understand the interactions between hunter-gatherers and pastoralists over this extended period of time.  The work focuses on culture contact and adaptation and sets these processes within a shifting environmental context. How do peoples with originally distinct lifestyles interact with each other. To what extend do they divide space in a mutually exclusive way? What cultural elements such as pottery are shared? To what extent are interactions fashioned in mutually beneficial ways? Does competition for limited space lead to antagonistic relations? As environment changes, either as a result of overgrazing or climate change how do these factors shift through time? These are the central issues which Dr. Sampson's project addresses.  With prior NSF support Dr. Sampson and his colleagues have conducted extensive archaeological survey and excavation in the Upper Zeekoe Valley, a 5,000 km. square region in South Africa. All surface sites have been mapped and stratified caves have been excavated. With this enormous data base it is possible to examine spatial relations between hunter-gatherers and herders and to analyze changes in site distribution over time. During the current NSF project, Dr. Sampson will expand this work. He will obtain a large series of radiocarbon dates to fix the sequence more precisely in time. Analysis of fossil pollen will provide insight into fluctuating environmental conditions. A detailed study of ceramics will shed light on patterns of production and exchange. Trace element analysis of both pottery and clay sources will reveal the extent of local production and provide information on broader regional interaction. The work will provide an unprecedented and detailed picture of a cultural interaction which extended over a millennium.",
