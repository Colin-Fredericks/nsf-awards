 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Physics, the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the College of Education at Washington State University (W. S. U.) are developing a new educational/training paradigm that prepares students for high-technology careers in the area of optoelectronics.  In particular, a new M.S. degree specialization that draws on the strengths of these two units.  The M.S. is designed to fill the need for educating and training students for an industry that requires more preparation than a traditional bachelor's degree, yet does not require the theoretical rigor of Ph.D.  The proposed program will provide an accelerated curriculum that will train the next generation of scientists and engineers who will play a significant role in the optoelectronics revolution.\r\n\tThe high-tech industry, particularly small- and medium-sized companies, has realized that the new global environment demands that scientists/engineers easily adapt to rapid technological changes by drawing on a solid problem-solving-oriented educational background.  The main objective of the proposed work is to integrate cutting edge research and technology into the education of young scientists and engineers by exposing them to real hands-on problems.  The overall philosophy of the new M.S. is to educate and train students through a series of laboratory-based research experiences in which the student will be required to participate actively as a member of a team.\r\n\tThe planned curriculum combines courses in basic science and technology including Electromagnetism, Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Electronics, Nonlinear optics (which are taught in the Physics Department), Optical Signal Processing, and Optoelectronics (which are taught in the Department of Electrical Engineering).  In addition to these traditional courses, students will have a two-semester hands-on laboratory course that will include peer instruction and team work.  The laboratory course is designed to give students a solid introduction to optics and experimental techniques in followed by challenging laboratory projects. \r\n",
