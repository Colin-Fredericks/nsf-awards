The motivation for  the project comes from several sources: (i) perturbative Chern-Simons  theory, (ii) generalizing the notion of Vassiliev invariants of knots  in the 3-sphere, (iii) separating the quantum group invariants of knots  and 3-manifolds into elementary pieces and reassembling them.  One of the  goals of the theory of finite type invariants of knots and 3-manifolds  involves understanding the role and the strength of these invariants  in the classification of knots and 3-manifolds.       Thirteen years ago, Vaughan Jones discovered a simple yet remarkably  useful polynomial associated to every knot in 3-dimensional space.  Shortly afterwards, Edward Witten studied a 3-dimensional gauge field  theory that generalized the Jones polynomial to knots in arbitrary  3-dimensional space.  Gauge theories in 3 and 4 dimensions are intimately  related to the high energy description of our physical world (in the  energies and the distances that we currently perceive).  In addition, knots  appear naturally as supercoiled forms of DNA (an important ingredient of  life), as well as being trajectories of some elementary particles at high  energies.  Thus, the current research project has potential applications,  yet to be fully understood, in biology and in high energy physics.  ***",
