 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9761465  Tuchinskiy    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will attempt to develop a new kind of self-lubricating anti-friction ceramic/polymer composite with high mechanical characteristics and low coefficient of friction.  The structure of the composite comprises a ceramic matrix and fibers of lubricating phase oriented perpendicular to the friction surface.  The fibers are formed in situ, their diameter may vary significantly from a few microns to a few millimeters, while a uniform distribution is provided automatically within the process.  The content of the solid lubricant may vary over a wide range.  The objectives of the Phase I research are to develop a method for production of anti-friction composites comprising Si3N4 and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), investigate their characteristics and define the compositions and structures providing optimum combinations of mechanical and tribological characteristics.  If successful, the method could be applied to production of many tribological as well as structural composites.  The research may thus result in creation of a new generation of high effective anti-fiction materials.    There are numerous potential applications for self-lubricating ceramic materials, including a large market in the propulsion systems and machine tool industry.  Application areas in the machine tool industry include extended life spindles, high speed head options, ultrahigh speed machining centers and high speed grinding spindles.  The end benefit to the customer from high speed machine tool bearing applications probably exceeds that of the aerospace application.  Other applications for self-lubricating ceramic bearings are in the chemical processing and semiconductor manufacturing areas.  This includes screw pumps, reactors and vacuum systems.  Additional applications are for air valve control systems or material conveying equipment in hot environments.  ***",
