 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on two general themes; the effect of molecular   structure on localizing photonic excitation energy, and the selectivity   of the resulting reactivity.   The temperature dependence of the quantum   efficiency of intramolecular hydrogen abstraction will be measured for a   series of structurally related ketones to distinguish processes   controlled by changes in energy from those controlled by variations in   surface crossing probabilities.   The temperature dependence of the ratio   of photoinduced cyclization in biradical arising from intramolecular   hydrogen abstraction, relative to other competing processes, will be   correlated with theoretical computations of biradical structure to   elucidate the role of structure on intersystem crossing.   Graduate and   postdoctoral students will be trained in organic synthesis and   mechanistic organic photochemistry.  With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   supports the research of Dr. Peter Wagner of the Department of Chemistry   at Michigan State University.   The absorption of light causes an abrupt   increase in a molecule's energy thereby enhancing its reactivity.   Dr.   Wagner will focus his research on elucidating the processes by which the   excited molecule localizes the energy needed to achieve a specific   reaction, and identifying the structural parameters that affect this   energy localization.   Dr. Wagner's educational activities involve   training graduate and postdoctoral students in organic synthesis, and the   measurement and characterization of excited-state processes.",
