Two of these domains have yet to be adequately characterized for their osmium isotopic composition. In order to address this, osmium isotope studies will be conducted on ocean island basalts (Pitcairn and Christmas Islands) thought to be derived from the EM1 mantle domain and on refractory chromites in abyssal peridotites (MORB domain) from all of the major spreading ridge systems of the world. Several of Earth's mantle domains are thought to be a result of lithospheric recycling, yet the lithologic expression and melting dynamics of this material are not understood. These issues will be explored via two avenues. Ion microprobe studies of the Pb isotope composition and trace element signatures of mineral (phenocryst) melt inclusions from various ocean island basalts will shed light on the melting lithologies and melt transport networks involved. The second approach will utilize Th and Ra isotope data in conjunction with melt inclusion studies for a series of historic lavas from the Galapagos Islands. The apparent derivation of a number of these islands by a wide range in degree of melting from a single mantle source will allow constraints to be placed on issues of batch versus fractional melting, percolative versus focused melt transport, continuous melt re-equilibration versus escape in high velocity conduits, and homogenous source lithology versus small-scale (veined) heterogeneities.\r\n",
