 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:  9811611      PI:  Pepperberg, Irene M.      Humphrey (1976) proposed that intelligence derives from  selection processes favoring animals that remember and act  upon knowledge of detailed social relations among group  members, i.e. complicated social systems and long lives  correlate with intelligence.  Tests of this idea have  concentrated on primates.  This project extends studies to  birds. Comparing social species and their ecological and  social selective pressures will provide insight into the  evolution of cognition and complex communication systems.  Grey parrots Psittacus erithacus are ideal subjects; they  are among the very few avian species for which sufficient  cognitive and communicative laboratory data exist.  This  project will provide behavioral data from nature to test  Humphrey's hypothesis.  The objectives are to: (1) combine  conventional observations (including video and audio  recordings) and VHF radio-tracking with novel techniques  using Global Positioning System data; and (2) apply these  techniques to determine Grey parrot ranging patterns, social  organization, and vocal behavior to address hypotheses about  ecological explanations for cognitive abilities Greys  exhibit in the laboratory, the role of sociality in the  evolution of intelligence, and processes resulting in vocal  variation in birds.      This project will impact animal research technologies with  the development of hybrid GPS/VHF tracking.  Results will  benefit conservation efforts, and shed light on the  evolution of intelligence across diverse species and provide  insights concerning vocal learning in birds.",
