 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI:  Thomas C. Bruice  9727937  Bruice  A promising approach to the question of the contribution of the force field of the enzyme structure to the rate of the enzymatic reaction involves the use of a combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methodology, to simulate the minimum energy surfaces, reaction pathways and transition state structures.  The choice of enzymes for investigation is based on simplicity of the reactions catalyzed,  high resolution of the necessary crystal structures, and relatively small size of the proteins themselves.  Using a simple organic model for the enzymatic reaction, minimum energy reaction profiles will be computed by both semiempirical and ab initio methods in both the gas phase and polar dielectric.  Comparison of semiempirical and ab initio structures and energies must be favorable in order to have confidence in the use of any particular semiempirical method to represent QM atoms in the QM/MM program.    By characterizing the structural, electronic and energetic effects that an enzyme has on the intrinsic chemical properties of the reacting species, it is hoped that the project will provide answers to the question of why enzymes are such excellent catalysts.  Particularly, this approach enables the evaluation of the environmental effects due to the enzyme on the energetics of an enzyme catalyzed reaction.",
