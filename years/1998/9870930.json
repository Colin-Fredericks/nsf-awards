 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870930  White  This investigator plans to study `stripes' which are  patterns of holes and spins observed in neutron scattering  experiments in some high temperature cuprate superconductors  using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)  developed by White.  The PI plans a large number of  \"numerical experiments\" on doped t-J ladder systems as large  as 16x8 that are aimed to answer questions such as: Does a  stripe have strong superconducting pairing correlations  along its length? At what dopings do stripes appear in two  dimensions? At low doping, what is the natural linear hole  density of a stripe?  How easily do pairs tunnel between  stripes? Does pair tunneling greatly enhance pairing? Do  stripes attract or repel each other? What does the Fermi  surface look like in a striped state? Are (1,1) stripes  stable?  The PI plans to enhance the DMRG and develop a method for  calculating dynamical quantities. Also extensions to three  band Hubbard models and one dimensional coupled electron-  phonon systems is planned with the aim of applying the DMRG  to organic conductors.  %%%  This award involves research on electronic properties of  materials in which strong electron-electron interactions are  important.  The focus of this effort is on high temperature  superconductors and related materials.  A method developed  by the PI that holds promise for significant advance will be  used and refined in this project which contains strong  computational components and algorithm development.",
