 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Nathanson will continue his investigations of gas-liquid interactions.  In this research a monoenergetic beam of atoms or molecules is directed at a liquid surface in vacuum, and the identity, translational energy and direction of the scattered products is monitored using time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS).  Information on energy transfer, reaction probability vs. impact energy or direction, and the identity of the desorbed reaction products is obtained.  Nathanson will study liquids spanning 35 decades in acidity.  In one set of experiments involving azeotropic sulfuric acid, polyphosphoric acid, neutral and basic solutions of glycerol or molten sodium hydroxide, he will investigate the dependence of energy dissipation and trapping on incoming trajectory of a gas molecule and the fate of the molecule as a function of acidity.  He also plans to examine the role of monolayers and their effect on energy transfer and penetration of the surface.\r\n\r\nChemical reaction dynamics at liquid-vapor interfaces is of direct relevance for understanding many different gas-liquid reactions, including ozone-hole formation important in atmospheric chemistry,  industrial processes using catalysts, and respiration in living organisms.\r\n",
