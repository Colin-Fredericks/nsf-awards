The emphasis and style of these techniques depends largely on the field of expertise of its developer(s). This Workshop is aimed at bridging the gap between the camps. The workshop program, themes, and sessions are organized on the fundamental premise that MCDM has emerged as a philosophy that integrates common sense with empirical, quantitative, normative, descriptive and value-judgment-based analyses.   The workshop will consist of parallel sessions featuring invited and contributed sessions.  The final day will be reserved for a Workshop with panels on emerging MCDM topics in research, methodologies, theory, and applications.  The Workshop, will provide a forum (mechanism) to identify prospective collaboration between U.S. and non-U.S. scientists.\r\n     The Workshop will serve as an excellent medium for the exchange of knowledge among U.S. and non-U.S. scientists and engineers interested in the planning, design, and operations of technology  (and non-technology) based systems where decisions are made under conditions of risk and uncertainty.    We expect a large number of participants from the Republics of the former Soviet Union and other third-world countries.\r\nThis broad participation of international scientists and engineers as well as selected international Ph.D. students will enable the establishment of international collaborations and networks.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
