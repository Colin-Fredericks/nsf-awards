 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 97-34125 PALLANCK. This is a CAREER award that has both a research and educational component.  In his research, Dr. Pallanck will investigate the mechanisms of regulated release of neurotransmitters at neuronal synapses.  He will use the powerful genetic and molecular approaches to available in the fruit fly Drosophila to define cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this process.  Neurons communicate with each other and with targets such as muscle cells with neurotransmitter signaling molecules, which are released when small vesicles inside the synaptic terminal fuse with the outer membrane of the cell.  Recent biochemical work has identified candidate molecules that are involved in recruiting vesicles to the cell membrane at precise locations, promoting fusion, and allowing the vesicle to reform when cell membrane is pinched off towards the inside of the cell.  Dr. Pallanck's research will ask which of these steps are carried out by which of the previously identified molecules, and whether there are components of the release apparatus that remain unidentified by the previous biochemical studies.  In previous work, Dr. Pallanck and his collaborators has identified in Drosophila two different forms of one of the key candidate release molecules, N-ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Fusion protein (NSF).  One goal of the current research is to test the hypothesis that multiple NSF proteins are involved in the targeting, fusion, and/or recycling of synaptic vesicles.  Molecular, electrophysiological and anatomical studies as the electron microscope level will all be employed in these studies.  To address the second goal, Dr. Pallanck's laboratory will carry out classical genetic screens to identify novel components of the vesicular release apparatus.  The properties of neurotransmitter release appear to be similar at synapses in all animals, and to share mechanisms with the vesicular release of other substances such as hormones.  Thus, the results from this study will contribute to a general understanding of this process.\r\n\tDr. Pallanck's educational objective is to incorporate a research perspective into the undergraduate genetics curriculum at his university.  He will be teaching the core genetics course taken by most undergraduate biology majors, and will use this forum to emphasize the experimental basis of scientific knowledge and to introduce students to current research opportunities in his department.  He will also serve as undergraduate research coordinator, and will develop an undergraduate research seminar course.  Through these three avenues, Dr. Pallanck will be instrumental in preparing undergraduate students for a career in research at a critical stage in their educational development.\r\n",
