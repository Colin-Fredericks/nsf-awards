 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project deals generally with the analysis and development of reliable \r\nand suitable approximation schemes for mathematical models of complex \r\nphysical phenomena such as damped elastic structures, processes with \r\ndelays, coupled structures (including models of smart materials), etc. A \r\nstandard approach to analyzing and solving problems for such systems is \r\nto instead consider an approximate system, which ideally is both finite \r\ndimensional and rich enough to retain properties of the original (infinite \r\ndimensional) system. But it is well known that some approximate systems \r\ndo not retain important properties of the original system, such as growth \r\nrate, stability robustness, etc. (In fact, it is well known that some models \r\nof elastic structures with boundary damping have an energy decay rate that \r\nis not preserved by standard \"finite element\" or \"finite difference\" \r\napproximate systems). This project focuses on how and why certain \r\nproperties are retained or lost under approximation, and on developing a \r\nsystematic method for constructing \"property-preserving\" approximation \r\nschemes. The key is analyzing the geometry (inner product) under which \r\nthe original system is projected onto the approximating system, and one \r\nthrust is that changing geometries can improve approximations so that \r\nimportant properties are better preserved. This is a recent idea on which \r\nthe PI has demonstrated successful implementation for some preliminary \r\nexamples. This project will extend in significant ways the method and the \r\napplications.\r\n\r\nThere are many practical applications in science and engineering that \r\ninvolve elastic structures, such as large antennae, fluid flow over an \r\nairfoil, vibrating buildings, etc. In the presence of evolving \"smart \r\nmaterials\" and actuator technologies, these lead to complex mathematical \r\nmodels that cannot be fully resolved on even the most powerful \r\ncomputers. A standard strategy for overcoming this difficulty is to instead \r\nconsider a simpler model (an \"approximation scheme\") which is a \r\nreasonably good approximation of the original complex model, and which \r\ncan also be solved on a computer. There are typically many approximation \r\nschemes for any given model, and since something is always lost in the \r\napproximation, some important questions are - how good is a 'reasonably \r\ngood approximation'? and - which important properties are lost or \r\npreserved? Further, since these computer models are used to better \r\nunderstand and control these complex systems, high-fidelity \r\napproximation schemes are essential. This project will focus on these \r\nquestions, with the goal of developing a systematic methodology for a \r\nbroad range of applications, and of developing software based on the \r\ntheory.\r\n",
