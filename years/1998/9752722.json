 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) will enhance undergraduate education in satellite meteorology by means of a project centered on a comprehensive, two-week faculty course for university faculty, to be held 1-12 June 1998 at the Cooperative Program for Operational Meteorology, Education and Training (COMET~) classroom facilities in Boulder, Colorado. This will help fulfill the need to upgrade satellite meteorology education, which at present receives very limited treatment in undergraduate programs, despite recent advances in meteorological satellite capabilities. As a result of the program, participants will be able to exploit new technologies to improve their knowledge of satellite meteorology through enhanced understanding of remote sensing principles and applications to weather forecasting and research. Participants will engage in a follow-up project to develop on-line instructional materials which, along with the faculty course materials, will be made widely available via the World-Wide Web.",
