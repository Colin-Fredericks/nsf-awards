 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marked changes in global environments such as increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and ultraviolet radiation are rapidly occurring as a result of man's actions. Explorations of changes in global environments and determining how species may function and adapt under such changes are two fundamental areas of physiological ecology with theoretical and practical applications. The Biology Department at San Jose State University has a conservation and ecological emphasis in its undergraduate and graduate curricula which can be enhanced with studies exploring the effects of changing global environments on plant growth. The environmental growth chambers in this department are over 25 years old and are subject to frequent breakdowns. Many of our students are first generation students who do not have English as their first language and are likely to benefit from \"doing\" science activities that are relevant and interesting. The environmental growth studies proposed here which explore Future predicted climatic changes on plant growth will give students the opportunity to explore, in a meaningful way, concepts of global changes while using advanced technological equipment. The growth chamber experiments will provide assessment modes which do not rely solely on language skills. A major program in this department is the preparation of undergraduate science students for science teaching at the pre-college level. One of the major goals associated with science instruction in this department is to ensure that students develop positive attitudes to doing science and become comfortable with the use of scientific equipment. Growing plants in different climatic environments will stress the integrated approach to learning science and will allow students to explore natural phenomena in controlled environments.",
