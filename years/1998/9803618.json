 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803618  Gross    This award supports research at a predominantly  undergraduate institution to study equilibrium structures  and structural dynamics in magnetorheological fluids.  In a  magnetic field, chains of micron-sized particles form. On  longer time scales, the chains may bind into thick  `columns.' Of particular interest are: (1) how do columns  form in the low volume fraction region where the  interactions between chains appears to be repulsive, and (2)  what is the internal and external equilibrium structure of  columns.  %%%  The PI will carry out research at a predominantly  undergraduate institution into a class of `complex fluids'  that consist of micron-sized particles and respond to  magnetic fields, for example, the viscosity of the fluid can  dramatically increase with the application of a small  magnetic field from the consistency of motor oil to that of  peanut. In an applied magnetic field, the small particles of  the fluid will form structures.  A better understanding of how these structures form is an  objective of the proposed research.  These `magnetically  active' fluids are used in numerous applications such as  vibration dampers,  brakes, and controllable clutches.  ***",
