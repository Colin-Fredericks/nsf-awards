This project is particularly suited  for a  POWRE award because it will allow exploratory work to  determine the feasibility of a new line of inquiry.  Sufficient metabolic fuels are necessary for successful  reproduction in female mammals.  Because metabolic imbalance  initiates physiological and behavioral responses that  restore energy homeostasis and allocate available fuels for  life-sustaining processes, high-energy activities such as  reproduction are often impaired.  While decreases in  reproductive hormone secretion during energy deficits  reflect hypothalamic gonadaotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)  dysfunction, the neural mechanisms that link substrate fuel  homeostasis with neuroendocrine function are not clear.  Recent studies show that intracerebral administration of the  glucose anti-metabolite, 2-deoxy-glucose (2DG), inhibits  plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations, thus  implicating central glucoprivic receptors in the regulation  of reproductive hormones.  Reports that circulating LH is  inhibited by infusion of 2DG into the fourth ventricle  suggest that interoreceptors of functional significance for  reproductive function occur within a diffusion range of this  delivery site, but the specific location(s) of these  receptors in this part of the brain are unknown.  Glucose-  sensitive neurons may exist more rostrally within the  ventromedial hypothalamus nucleus (VMN) and lateral  hypothalamic area (LHA), but the role of these loci in  compensatory reductions in reproductive hormone secretion  during glucose substrate imbalance has not been studied.  This proposal seeks to characterize the neuroanatomical  distribution of central glucoprivic receptors that inhibit  preovulatory LH secretion in intact female rats, and to  identify hypothalamic structures that contain neurons  critical for reproductive endocr ine responses to glucose  substrate imbalance.  The PI proposes to identifity the  origin of central glucoprivic signals that inhibit phasic  gonadotropin secretion by investigating the effects of site-  specific infusion of 2DG into discrete brain loci on the  onset, magnitude, and duration of the preovulatory LH surge  in intact, adult female rats.  She will also investigate  whether the functional integrity of several discrete  hypothalamic structures is critical for glucoprivic  inhibition of the reproductive neuroendocrine axis by  examining whether reversible pharmacological inhibition of  local cellular function by colchicine attenuates inhibitory  effects of glucose anti-metabolites on gonadotropin  secretion.  Other experiments will determine if specific  neuropeptide neurons are critical for gonadotropin responses  to 2DG.",
