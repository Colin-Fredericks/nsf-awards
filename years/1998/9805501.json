The model for the\r\ncilia and flagella axoneme incorporates discrete representations\r\nof the individual dynein arms, a mechanical model of the\r\naxoneme's elastic structures such as the microtubules and nexin\r\nlinks, and a continuous description of the surrounding fluid\r\nmechanics.  The model for limb bud outgrowth and patterning\r\nconsists of a fluid-mechanical description of the limb bud\r\ntissue, a reaction-diffusion-advection component that governs the\r\nspatio-temporal distribution of growth factors and morphogens\r\nproduced in specialized regions such as the apical ectodermal\r\nridge and the zone of polarizing activity, and a moving elastic\r\nboundary that represents the limb bud ectoderm's viscoelastic\r\nproperties.  In the three-dimensional model, the limb bud ectoderm\r\nis modeled as a network of nodes connected by linear elastic\r\nelements.  The investigator also develops an algorithm for\r\nimposing the appropriate boundary conditions in solving the\r\nreaction-diffusion-advection equations.  Because each of these\r\nmodels includes a fluid-mechanical representation, the\r\ninvestigator uses a similar computational approach based on the\r\nimmersed boundary method and the computer codes share many of the\r\nmajor subroutines.\r\n     The purpose of this research project is the development of\r\nmathematical models and computational methods for studying moving\r\nboundary problems in complex biological systems.  The investigator\r\ndevelops two types of models: one for the motion of eukaryotic\r\ncilia and flagella and the second for the growth dynamics of\r\nmulticellular biological systems.  Both of these models involve\r\nnew approaches to the modeling of viscoelastic materials in\r\nbiology and share a common computational point of view.  The\r\nobject in the first project is to develop a three-dimensional\r\nmodel for the individual cilium or flagellum.  Although a great\r\ndeal has been discovered regarding the biochemistry,\r\nultrastructure and movement of eukaryotic cilia and flagella, the\r\nmechanisms governing the control of oscillatory motion and\r\nbending are not well understood.  The goal of the cilia and\r\nflagella modeling is to develop a three-dimensional model that\r\ncan serve as a platform for studying the mechanochemical\r\nmechanisms that control the waveforms.  Growth plays an important\r\nprocess for multicellular organisms as well as communities of\r\nsingle cell organisms.  The investigator develops a model of\r\nvertebrate limb development that incorporates the growth and\r\nmovement of cells and tissue within the developing limb bud, the\r\ntransport and production of growth factors within the limb bud,\r\nand a moving boundary that represents the mechanical and\r\nbiochemical properties of the limb bud ectoderm.  The development\r\nof this model and the computational methods for solving the\r\nassociated mathematical equations has application to the study of\r\na variety of multicellular systems where growth is an essential\r\nfeature, including growth and pattern formation in developmental\r\nbiology, the growth of bacterial colonies, as well as tumor\r\ngrowth.  An important aspect of this project is the development of\r\nnumerical methods for studying the models; advances in this area\r\ncan be used in a variety of problems in the field of\r\ncomputational biofluids.\r\n",
