 "awd_abstract_narration": "9734472  Eggleston    Populations  of  animals and plants  often  fluctuate  in  a  seemingly  chaotic  manner. Fundamental  challenges  include  formulating  population  models that  can  tease  apart  the  precise   effects  of  different  environmental  forces   on  population dynamics, and determining the interaction between  biological  feedback mechanisms and the  environment.   This  project   addresses  processes  that  determine   population  dynamics  in  the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus)  in  North  Carolina,   through  comprehensive  and   integrated   field  observations and experiments, population modeling  of  long-  term  abundance data, and computer visualizations  of  water  currents.   The  overall  hypothesis is  that  environmental  perturbations,  primarily in the form of tropical  cyclones,  will   markedly   alter   biological  feedback   mechanisms,  producing  large fluctuations in abundance of  juvenile  and  adult  crabs.   The  overall  goal  of  the  student/teacher  enrichment  program is to enhance scientific  literacy,  and  involve students and teachers in the scientific method  that  have  traditionally been under-represented  in  science,  by  linking  public  schools,  state,  and  academic  scientists  together with a common research goal.  Fisheries species are  an  ideal focal point since they are of significant cultural  and  economic importance to coastal counties, and lie at the  center of such critical issues as overfishing, water quality  degradation, and habitat loss.",
