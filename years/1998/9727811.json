 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727811  SPICER   This project will examine the mechanism of action of the bacteriophage T4 translational repressor, regA protein. The regA protein is a uniquely promiscuous translational repressor, which specifically recognizes and binds to at least 15 different T4 early mRNAs and blocks their translation. How regA protein distinguishes these mRNAs from the 150 other T4 mRNAs present in the cell at the same time is not clearly understood and is the subject of this project. The overall goal of this work is to assess the participation of individual regA residues and specific functional groups in a model RNA substrate (i.e. the T4 gene 44 RE) in inter-molecular interactions that lead to specific complex formation. The specific objectives of this study are: 1) to identify specific residues in regA that participate in RNA binding and quantitate their contribution to the free energy of RNA binding; 2) to assist the efforts in Dr. Chul-Hee Kang's laboratory to solve the crystal structure of a regA protein:RNA complex; 3) to determine the hierarchy of regA binding affinities for four T4 mRNAs; and 4) to characterize the repression sensitivity of synthetic recognition element RNAs in vivo. To accomplish the first of these objectives, site-directed mutagenesis will be used to test the role of specific residues predicted to participate in RNA binding from earlier biochemical studies. In addition, random mutagenesis coupled with an in vivo screen will be used to identify new functional residues. To better understand how regA-sensitive mRNAs are recognized and distinguished from other T4 mRNAs, the hierarchy of regA binding affinities for defined RNA sequences will be measured in vitro. The recognition elements defined by these in vitro studies will be tested for regA repression sensitivity in vivo, using a lacZ fusion gene as a reporter gene. By determining relative repression ratios for RNA sequences, it should be possible to determine if in vitro RNA binding affinities correlate with mRNA repression sens itivities in vivo.   In all cells, a variety of macromolecular interactions occur that govern the specific functions of the cell. Many of the critical biochemical functions that occur within the cell involve specific interactions between proteins and nucleic acid molecules (DNA and RNA). The work carried out in this project seeks to understand better how proteins recognize and selectively interact with RNA to regulate translation, the process by which proteins are synthesized using the information encoded in the RNA.   The model system being studied offers the opportunity to gain novel insights into this type of molecular recognition process. Ultimately, these insights should have implications for better understanding of a variety of cellular processes, including the replication of RNA viruses, the control of gene expression and the synthesis of proteins.",
