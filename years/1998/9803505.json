 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software distributed shared memory (DSM) may support various  existing networks of workstations and distributed memory machines  built from commodity or customized microprocessors and networks,  without any hardware added. In order for DSM to be employed in  long-running applications or high-availability situations,  reconfiguration in response to processor failures or resource  changes is crucial and inevitable. From the performance  standpoint, a software-based DSM system ought to minimize its  coherence traffic overhead, because such a system is especially  sensitive to the traffic amount over the network.This research  proposal focuses on reconfiguration and performance issues in  software DSM under release consistency, aiming to render such DSM  a favorable computing paradigm.The key objectives of this research  include: (1) pursuing efficient algorithms for identifying target  structures in distributed systems under reconfiguration,  (2) investigating process migration by taking advantage of  multiple disjoint paths, (3) developing a recoverable software DSM  system based on fast checkpointing, (4) investigating into  aggressive implementations of release consistency  for software DSM, and (5) pursuing efficient barrier and  lock techniques for software DSM.",
