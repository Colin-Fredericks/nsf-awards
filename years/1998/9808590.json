 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current design for compilers typically includes optimization  modules in order to provide the performance required in today's  application programs. The extensive research performed on code  optimization in the last 25 years has focused on developing the  necessary data flow and code improving algorithms for particular  optimizations.  Although these efforts have been enormously  successful, a number of problems with the optimization models that  are currently used are surfacing. One problem relates to where  optimizations are applied in the program code. Another problem is  that the optimization models that have traditionally been used are  inflexible and simplistic in that they do not take into account  the available machine resources or characteristics.  This  research is exploring techniques which address these problems  through the development of a framework for path and resource  sensitive optimizations.  The machine characteristics, the  available resources and the most beneficial paths of a program to  optimize, including interprocedural paths, are factors  in the  path and resource sensitive optimization algorithms. The data flow  analysis used by the optimization algorithms is being enriched  with  capabilities to exploit machine characteristics and  profiling information in a systematic fashion.",
