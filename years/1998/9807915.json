 "awd_abstract_narration": "Greenfield  9807915      In mate choice, females select mates from which they may                             obtain  1) resources that directly enhance their reproductive success  and/or 2) \"good\" genes that are expressed in their offspring.  While these two mechanisms are not incompatible, their  relative contributions to sexual selection are not known.  Moreover, female choice based on genetic factors assumes  substantial genetic variation underlying certain male  trait(s), but the maintenance of such genetic variation is  poorly understood. These problems remain because sexual  selection has often been studied in species that are not  amenable to controlled laboratory experiments and genetic  analyses. Previous work by Dr. Michael Greenfield indicates  that an unusual pyralid moth, Achroia grisella, is an  excellent subject for studying mate choice. Female choice in  A. grisella is based on discrimination of male ultrasonic  signals. In this project Greenfield will employ a variety of  breeding experiments, and field observations to 1) test  potential sources of the genetic variation in selected male  traits, and 2) determine the relative importance of the two  mechanisms.         Findings will contribute to our basic knowledge of  acoustic signaling and perception and provide a uniquely  thorough assessment of the ways in which traits used for mate  choice evolve. Because A. grisella is a minor pest of  honeybees (its common name is the lesser wax moth), such  information should also prove useful in the management of  this and other more harmful insect pests.",
