University of  Colorado  ATM-9714221  Title: Studies of Rotating Fluids    The objective of this research is a critical examination of theories and modeling techniques relevant to atmospheric dynamics, by means of laboratory experiments on mechanically driven rotating fluids. Detailed measurements of velocity fields in single-layer and two-layer systems will be made using high resolution particle image velocimetry and laser doppler anemometry.  The data will test theories of baroclinic wave chaos, Reynolds stress closure models of turbulence, and subgrid scale modeling methods currently used in meteorological large eddy simulations. Most of the experiments will take place in a rotating cylinder, with fluid motions being driven mechanically by a differentially rotating lid. This system has advantages of simplicity, the presence of a homogeneous direction, the ability to study a large range of Reynolds numbers (l03 to order 106), the suitability for use of particle image velocimetry, and the relative ease of comparing model predictions with the experimentaldata.    Experiments on two-layer flows will focus on asymmetries in the baroclinic instability and chaos problems.  An extensive set of experiments on single-layer flows will provide a categorization of instabilities on the sidewall, as well as data on separation and instability in the top and bottom boundary layers. Preliminary work has shown that this three-parameter system has numerous instabilities, mixed in with vertically erupting horizontal boundary layers.  These phenomena are important for understanding the behavior of boundary layers under atmospheric vortices.   Detailed characteristics of the flows will be compared with results from axisymmetric numerical simulations and linear instability theory.    Fundamental studies such as these underlie future improvements in numerical models of atmospheric motions.",
