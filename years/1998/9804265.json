This  fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain  additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue innovative and imaginative research into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular, cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled interactions  among herbivores introduced for the biological control of  weeds.  The research is concerned with how interactions  among herbivores influence their spatial distributions,  abundance, and impacts on plant populations. Interactions  representing 3 feeding guilds are being studied among four  insect species which were recently introduced into North  America for the biocontrol of purple loosestrife (Lythrum  salicaria). At the scales of both the individual plant and a  patch of plants, residency by one species is being studied  on  the effects of the rate of colonization, survivorship,  and impact of an additional species. Of particular interest  is whether prior occupancy confers a competitive advantage,  a phenomenon that has been little studied in the field.  Records of past and current weed control projects maintained  by the Oregon Department of Agriculture are also being  analyzed. The data set contains yearly updates on the status  of 59 biocontrol agents introduced against 29 target weeds  across 36 Oregon counties.  The research has important  implications for biocontrol introductions, biological  invasions, and herbivore interactions in general.",
