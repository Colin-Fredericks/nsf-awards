 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9710666  Arms    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at the development of a network of miniaturized, intelligent, addressable sensing modules (ASM's), that can be embedded within a composite structure, remotely powered, and interrogated by a personal computer through a non contacting inductive link.  The inductive link is used for power and bi-directional communications.  A computer based interrogation system transmits a data request to a specific ASM on the network.  The data request is encoded on the AC waveform that delivers power to the embedded electronics.  Once addressed, the embedded ASM powers its sensors and data conversion components.  Data are sampled and encoded as pulse code modulated data; this modulates an RF carrier for transmission out of the material, back to the interrogating computer.  This versatile system was designed to allow a wide variety of sensors to be networked interchangeably.  In Phase II, ASMs will be enhanced by the development of specialized nodes, rigorous environmental testing, and software improvements, and working demonstrations.  Data will be collected during and after composite cure of a composite sonar dome.  The system will be used for model verification, dry dock inspection, and reduced cost at-sea testing.  Successful demonstration of the technology will greatly enhance market potential.    Structures with a broad variety of capabilities may be developed by embedding sensing networks of strain, crack propagation, acceleration, pressure, magnetic fields, etc.  Applications include health monitoring of thick composite structures, bridges, dams, and buildings.  Military and commercial market potential for these systems is significant.    ***",
