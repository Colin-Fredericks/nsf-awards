 "awd_abstract_narration": "DEB 9801342  Hopson      Based on a rich fossil record, the reptile-to-mammal transition has long  been considered the best-supported example of the origin of a major  vertebrate group.  This study will examine several prominent hypotheses  concerning the tempo and directionality of pre-mammalian synapsid  evolution.  Using phylogenetic estimates based on recent cladistic analyses  and a battery of morphometric techniques, my research will address  analytically previous assertions of: (1) the prominent role of  morphological convergence, including (2) the prevalence of independent  progressive trends towards the mammalian grade of structural organization.  The evolution of synapsid morphological disparity (i.e., the range of  anatomical variation) from \"pelycosaurs\" to basal mammaliaforms will be  examined using qualitative character descriptions, quantitative  measurements, and morphometric outline methods.  Results derived from the  three methods will be contrasted, and then (1) compared to the pattern of  diversification observed among other higher taxa, and (2) examined for  significant (i.e., non-random) directionality.  The research outlined above  integrates aspects of cladistic analysis and biostratigraphy with  morphometrics and the quantitative analysis of morphological disparity.  It  will shed light on the dynamics of synapsid morphological diversification,  as well as on important issues such as the recognition of evolutionary  trends and the distribution of convergent evolution.",
