 "awd_abstract_narration": "9816232  Cannon  This is a high risk, high potential project to investigate a novel method to reduce volatile organic compound ( VOCs) emissions in green sand metal casting. This pollution prevention would be accomplished by exploring the chemical reactions that take place when the sonoperoxone process for the binders in green sand molds is integrated with plasma processing techniques. In the metal casting industry, a major problem arises when chemical reactions take place between the liquid metal and the mold sand/binder. During shakeout, the collection and handling of the used sand and the airborne particulates constitutes a major waste-stream expense. This proposed process is aimed at reclaiming much of the waste sand for reuse, with significant reduction of the VOCs to be controlled by the integrated process.   This addresses the decarbonization issues identified in the current Metal Casting Roadmap under construction by the American Foundrymens Society, the Cast Metals Coalition, et al under the sponsorship of the Department of Energy. It is significant that it is a GOALI project as well, with an industrial collaborator coming to the academic campus to collaborate in the experimental work.",
