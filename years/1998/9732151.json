 "awd_abstract_narration": "9732151    The Whitney Laboratory is an Institute of the University of  Florida.  It was established in 1974 as a center for basic  biological research, particularly in those areas in which  marine organisms serve as experimental models.  Marine model  systems have had a long and successful history of use in  fundamental research, and their value remains undiminished.  However, fewer and fewer scientists are likely to exploit  the research potential of marine animals, because costs have  limited the laboratory experience with these animals  provided by most universities to their undergraduate  students, who have not been encouraged to explore the  biological diversity of marine models.    In response to these problems, the Whitney Laboratory began,  in 1985, to offer undergraduates the opportunity to become  full participants in experiments on the physiology, anatomy,  biochemistry, and molecular biology of marine animals.  This  REU Site enables 10 students each summer to select and carry  out research projects in consultation with faculty mentors.  The academic experience of the students is further enriched  by participation in the seminar programs of the Laboratory  and by informal interaction with undergraduate and graduate  students, postdoctoral fellows, and established scientists  who visit from the United States and other countries.",
