 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is directed towards introducing cultural diversity into the Microbiology curriculum while at the same time establishing a model for such efforts in other scientific fields. This involves the creation of a casebook that provides alternative examples to biological concepts, the use of these case studies as a pedagogical tool, and dissemination of both the case studies and methods for using them. For example, fermentation is illustrated by the  manufacture of soy sauce, a product that is consumed by half of the world' s population and is the basis for a multi-billion dollar industry. There are two principal objectives in preparing this material: To show the relevance of biology in different cultural contexts, and to familiarize students with the idea of appropriate technologies (defined as the choice of a product/process that will fulfill a specific need in a manner that is appropriate to a particular cultural and economic environment).  Undergraduates were involved in the research and writing of these case studies in the context of honors seminars. Dissemination of the book and the use of case studies is being accomplished through collaboration with professional organizations in developing faculty workshops.",
