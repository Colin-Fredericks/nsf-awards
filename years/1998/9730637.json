 "awd_abstract_narration": "9730637  Bangs  this award will support a seismic reflection, refraction and  passive seismicity program to study underthrusting of oceanic crust  along the Nankai Trough off the east coast of Japan. The primary  feature to be examined in this experiment is the subduction thrust  fault from its aseismic zone in the Trough (trench) to a depth of  at least 15 kilometers beneath the continental margin where the  thrust is marked by significant seismic activity. The goal of the  study is to examine changes in physical properties along the thrust  as it changes from aseismic to seismic expression. Understanding  this transition from compaction and aseismic slip to brittle  failure is a major unknown in understanding lithospheric  consumption and earthquake dynamics. This Nankai seismogenic zone  marks the location of major destructive earthquakes along the  Japanese margin. The project is a collaborative experiment. United  State scientists will be responsible for acquiring and interpreting  3-dimensional seismic reflection data from the thrust fault and  accreting margin. Japanese colleagues will be responsible for  deploying ocean bottom seismometers for seismic refraction and  passive seismicity studies. In addition t the basic scientific  interpretation to be derived from the data, the experiment is  critical to the development of the MARGINS initiative and will  provide necessary site location data for future drilling by the  international Ocean Drilling Program.  ***",
