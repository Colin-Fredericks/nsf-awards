 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726100  Rakov        While the phenomenon of lightning has been observed for some time, many  aspects are unknown.  The overall objective of this research is further improvement  in the existing knowledge of the physical processes comprising the lightning  discharge. Both experimental and theoretical studies are planed.  The experimental  studies will be conducted at the International Center for Lightning Research and  Testing at Camp Blanding, Florida, and at the Lightning Observatory on the  University of Florida campus in Gainesville.  Camp Blanding contains unique  facilities for artificial lightning initiation (triggering) from overhead thunderclouds.          For both triggered and natural lightning discharges, electric and magnetic  fields will be measured. Channel-base currents will be additionally measured for  triggered lightning.  Optical images of lightning channels will be obtained with a  variety of video, still, and streak cameras, and with a digital optical system.  GPS  timing will allow the correlation of these measurements with the National Lightning  Detection Network reports and to the occurrence of Schumann resonance transients.   Attempts to initiate and characterize more energetic and potentially sprite-producing  positive lightning will be made.  Detailed mechanisms of lightning initiation from an  ungrounded object and of lightning attachment to ground will be studied.   Measurements of electric and magnetic fields at eight stations, seven of them  between 5 and 500 meters of the triggered-lightning channel, will be used to infer  the distribution of charge density and current on the lightning channel and to  validate or refute existing lightning models.  The first attempt to study  experimentally the lightning energy in order to resolve the long-standing controversy  on its magnitude will be made.          Overall, the results of the proposed research will provide new insights into  the physics of various lighting processes with implications for other areas of  Atmosp heric Sciences, including atmospheric chemistry (energy available for trace  gas production by lightning) and the interaction of lightning with the upper  atmosphere (in particular, the production of sprites by positive lightning).  ***",
