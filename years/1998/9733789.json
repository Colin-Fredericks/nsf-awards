 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733789  Hamilton    The research goals are focused on understanding the origin and evolution of micron to millimeter sized dust in the solar system.  The current distribution of dusty material around planets and in interplanetary space is a result of the delicate balance of many dynamical processes.  Micron and millimeter sized dust grains are created, their orbits evolve, and they are destroyed on very short timescales.  Insight into these fundamental processes can be gained by analyzing, interpreting, and modeling the detailed impact data from the dust detectors aboard the Ulysses, Galileo, and Cassini spacecraft.  In particular, the objectives of this research are to use these unique data sets to: 1) discover the source of the intriguing dust streams near Jupiter; 2) modernize and strengthen dynamical arguments which suggest that dark dust from Saturn's distant satellite Phoebe coats Iapetus' leading hemisphere; and 3) characterize the distribution and dynamics of dust in distant circumplanetary orbits.  A multipronged approach, which includes data analysis, analytical calculations, and numerical simulations, will be applied to these and other related problems in dust dynamics.  This study will lead to an improved understanding of many fundamental features of the solar system, and will highlight the important processes active in shaping our solar system today.  Moreover, since most of the processes currently acting on dust were also important in the early solar system, the results of this investigation will help clarify aspects of planetary formation.    The educational component of this proposal describes innovative ways to bring the exploration of orbital dynamics into the undergraduate classroom.  The orbital motions of the planets, their moons, artificial satellites, and planetary spacecraft are topics that continue to fascinate students of all ages.  Students are also intrigued by the use of computers and the information on the Internet and the World Wide Web.  The intrinsic appeal of t hese topics will  be used to interest  students by designing and implementing easy-to use interactive computer programs to teach the fundamentals of orbital motion.  Drawing upon previous experience in setting up and using several of these interactive programs in a classroom environment, and upon the proven principles and methods of' active learning, innovative class exercises for undergraduate students at all levels will be designed.  Exercises for upper level undergraduate Astronomy majors will be designed to expose students to the methods of scientific inquiry and to aspects of  ongoing research.  The exercises will also provide ways for students to test and to better appreciate important analytic derivations, and will allow them to explore their own interests in orbital dynamics independently.  Exercises intended for large introductory Astronomy classes will emphasize the spirit of scientific inquiry and will be designed to address concepts that students traditionally have difficulty grasping.  The programs will be available on the World Wide Web, which offers unbeatable access for students.  In addition, the programs will be computer platform independent, which will allow students to focus on astronomical issues rather than on computer languages and/or operating systems.  These highly desirable properties will allow the PI to design effective teaching tools for use in undergraduate classrooms.  ***",
