 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT    Proposal Number 9805571    PI: Creel, Scott        This study will clarify how social status affects behavioral  and physiological responses to stress in free-living wolves.  In studies of captive rodents and primates, social  subordinates often show long-term increases in the secretion  of adrenal glucocorticoids, a primary constituent of the  stress response.  Recent studies of social birds and  mammals, conducted in the wild and captivity, show that  glucocorticoids are sometimes higher in dominant individuals  than in subordinates.  It is not yet clear what variables  determine these differences among species.  This research  will collect non-invasive measurements of glucocorticoids  from fecal samples collected from free ranging wolves, and  will quantify rates of aggression and other social  behaviors, to determine relationships between dominance,  aggression and the glucocorticoid stress response.    All animals, including humans, face a variety of stresses,  ranging from physical conditions like cold or hunger to  psychosocial stress due to aggressive interactions.  The  primary physiological response is an increase in the  secretion of glucocorticoids, regardless of the specific  stressor involved.  This response is beneficial in the short  term, but is harmful if prolonged (e.g. energy metabolism  becomes inefficient, the immune system is impaired, and  neurons in the brain atrophy).  Because glucocorticoids have  strong effects on reproduction and immunity, the study of  social stress has broad ramifications for disciplines  ranging from evolutionary biology to human stress  management.",
