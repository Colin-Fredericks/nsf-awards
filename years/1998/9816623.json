The\r\ncourse lasts for six weeks and aims to rapidly introduce\r\nstudents, postdocs, and more senior investigators to a range of\r\nbiology, mathematics, and computation.  The goal is to bring them\r\nquickly to the point where they can begin effective\r\ncollaborations with investigators of complementary expertise on\r\nbiology problems of mutual interest.  Innovative aspects of the\r\nproject include its immersion in the subjects, thematic\r\norganization, modularity of content, interdisciplinary teaming\r\nduring the course, and planned multi-year involvement of\r\nparticipants, including students.\r\n     The richness of biology and the deeper understanding offered\r\nby mathematical analyses and modeling require concerted nurturing\r\nto foster the continuation and growth of collaborations at this\r\ninterface.  The investigator and his colleagues organize an\r\nintense interdisciplinary course on modeling of biological\r\nsystems, aimed to provide the necessary common background for\r\nstudents and researchers in biology, mathematical sciences, and\r\nengineering.  The goals of the course include: (a) training\r\nbiologists in the use of fundamental and sophisticated modeling\r\noaradigms and tools, (b) training mathematical scientists in a\r\nbiological arena, including laboratory experience, (c) bringing\r\ncomputational and experimental biologists together in considering\r\ncertain specific research areas, (d) establishing a common\r\nframework for addressing quantitative analysis and understanding\r\nof biological systems, (e) serving as an interdisciplinary\r\ntraining and resource venue for addressing questions of modeling\r\nof biological systems.  In addressing these goals, the course\r\nfosters the development of the shared language and skills\r\nnecessary for scientists, mathematicians, and engineers to\r\ncollaborate in solving key problems.\r\n",
