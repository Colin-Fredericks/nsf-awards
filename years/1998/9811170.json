 "awd_abstract_narration": "9811170  Crowe    This award supports the development of new instrumentation for in  situ laser microprobe analysis of d34S with 0.1-0.3 permil  precision and 20-30 micron spatial resolution.  The proposed  second generation instrument differs from current laser  microprobe instruments in three ways.  First, a pulsed  ultraviolet laser rather than a continuous-wave infrared laser  will be used for combusting samples.  The UV laser will improve  the spatial resolution of combustion from the current >100 micron  scale to 20-30 micron while minimizing thermal alteration in  zones surrounding the combustion pit.  Second, samples will be  purified using a flow-through interface with oxidation and  reduction reactors and gas chromatography rather than via  cryogenic distillation.  This will provide better control of the  chemical speciation of combustion products and will facilitate  efficient transfer of analyte to the mass spectrometer.  Finally,  the mass spectrometer will be upgraded to allow isotope-ratio-  monitoring rather than dynamically-switched microvolume inlet  techniques, thereby reducing sample size requirements by two to  three orders of magnitude.  The mass spectrometric portion of  this project will include development of new algorithms to  calculate the isotopic composition of sulfur from the molecular  spectrum of SO2.  Upon completion, the proposed instrument will  be applied to projects in high-temperature geochemistry, economic  geology and isotope thermometry for which the spatial resolution  of the current laser microprobe is inadequate. Foremost among  these projects are (i) fundamental investigations into the  effects of metamorphism on isotope thermometry, and applied  studies focusing on (ii) sulfur transport in shallow hydrothermal  systems, (iii) coupled biogeochemical cycling of carbon and  sulfur and metal mineralization in salt-dome cap rock  environments, and (iv) the sulfur isotope geochemistry of  Australian gold deposits.  ***",
