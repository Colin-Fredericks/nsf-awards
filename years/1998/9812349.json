 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most valuable product of field stations is the  information generated on site.  Modern data management and  communications technology allows the accumulated knowledge  garnered from years of research at a particular site to be  preserved and made easily accessible to scientists,  students, policy-makers, and the public on site or anywhere  else.  Information obtained at great cost (e.g., research  datasets, site descriptions and history, and programmatic  experience) should be available for more complete use.  Yet  this vision is not easily realized.  A principal obstacle to  modernizing data management at field stations has been the  absence of a consensus on metadata standards, retrieval  methodology, and appropriate operational procedures.  Recent  work led by the Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS) has  generated a common approach to these issues for Neotropical  field stations.    OTS will implement a model program to develop on-line  accessibility to the data resources of its three biological  stations in Costa Rica--Las Cruces, and Palo Verde.  This  requires moving to minimum functional standards for power  supply, communication links, servers, local area networks,  work station conformation, back-up units, and relevant  software, as well as for training, operational procedures,  and rescue of key datasets.  The new data documentation  standards, on-line search software, and operational  protocols are currently being tested at La Selva.  OTS will  expand implementation to the rest of La Selva as well as to  Palo Verde and Las Cruces, eventually impacting over 300  research projects, 120 field courses, and 5,000 scientists  and students who use the stations each year, not to mention  those who access the system from outside.  This will entail  not only training programs aimed at staff and users alike,  but also efforts to capture information being produced  currently and older databases identified as particularly  valuable. These sites will be used to train data managers  from oth er tropical field stations so as to foster expansion  of the ILTER network and enhance interaction with its  collaborators in several countries.",
