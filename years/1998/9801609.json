 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Yuan Lou\r\nDMS-9801609\r\n\r\nThe investigator plans to study three classes of problems: \r\nfirst, the perturbed Gelfand problem and its related ones from \r\nCombustion theory. The emphasis will be on the complete \r\ndescription of the exact number solutions of these nonlinear \r\nelliptic partial differential equations and the understanding \r\nof more complex combustion models; second, the investigator \r\nwants to pursue a better understanding of the classical \r\nLotka-Volterra models with diffusion. These models, though \r\ndeceptively simple-looking, involve tremendous mathematical \r\ndifficulty. The investigator has been trying to introduce \r\nnew ideas and develop new methods to solve some open problems in \r\nthis field; The third class of problem that the investigator \r\nwill study is the cross-diffusion system, which is a \r\nstrongly-coupled nonlinear parabolic system. The investigator, \r\nin a series of joint work with Wei-Ming Ni, has introduced  \r\npowerful new methods that can yield very detailed information \r\nabout the steady-states of these systems. The investigator plans \r\nto study the global time existence of this cross-diffusion \r\nsystem, along with the stability of various steady-states.  \r\nThe investigator hopes that the work on this cross-diffusion\r\nsystem can be instrumental in understanding  general strongly-coupled \r\nreaction-diffusion systems. \r\n\r\n\r\nMathematical problems from  biology and combustion theory are\r\nnot only mathematically challenging, but also practically important. \r\nTo be illustrative, let us consider the following ecological problem: \r\nsuppose that two different species originally live in two separate \r\nregions and both of them can survive. Now if we connect these two\r\nregions and let these two species be mixed  together in the new region. \r\nBesides the existing competitions among the same species, there appears \r\nthe new competition between two different species. A basic questions is: \r\nhow can these two species manage coexistence under such new situation? If \r\nassuming that these two species are moving randomly, then the problem can \r\nbe modeled by the classical Lotka-Volterra model, and this model is \r\ncovered by  the second class of problems which the investigator proposes \r\nto study. On the other hand,  when two species are competing for \r\nresources to survive, it is not very reasonable to just add diffusion to \r\nthe model since individuals are not moving around randomly. Instead,  \r\nthey are moving to places to their advantage, e.g., species prefer places \r\nwith less population pressures created by competitors. Based on this \r\nsecond assumption, some biologists  proposed the cross-diffusion system, \r\ni.e., the third class of problems  which the investigator will pursue. The \r\ninvestigator hopes that such mathematical work not only yields interesting \r\nmathematical results, but also strengthens the understanding of real\r\nworld phenomena in various branches of science.\r\n",
