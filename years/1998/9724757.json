Dr. Recchia  will work with Dr. Masashi Takigawa, Professor  of Physics at the Institute of Solid State  Physics, on a research project entitled, \"NMR  Studies of LowDimensional Correlated Electron  Systems.\"    The proposed research will focus on the use of  nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to probe a new  class of materials related to hightemperature  superconductors.  These new materials, known as  \"ladder compounds,\" may provide researchers with  important clues as to the mechanisms that are  responsible for exotic superconductivity.  It is  determined that the crucial structural elements  in high temperature superconductors are two  dimensional planes of copper and oxygen.  Electronic spins placed on copper atoms causes a  short-range magnetic order coupling, a basic  fluctuation that is thought to be the key to  superconductivity.  Controversy remains  regarding the detailed nature of this electronic  coupling and how it gives rise to  superconductivity.  In an effort to resolve  these issues, researchers are now investigating  samples that contain finite width \"ladders\" of  copper and oxygen, but the finite width  appropriate to ideal superconductive activity  remains unclear.  The primary goal of the research is to use  recent advances in NMR techniques to identify  the idealwidth of these \"ladders\" and, thus,  provide a far deeper understanding of the  electronic coupling process in novel  lowdimensional materials.  ***",
