 "awd_abstract_narration": "Variables in social science studies often are measured on categorical scales.  Many studies have multiple response variables in the form of repeated measurement of the same or similar variables.  One example is in longitudinal studies, which measure a response variable repeatedly over time.  Another is the measurement of various facets of an opinion or attitude in a battery of related questions, such as in the annual General Social Survey.  This research deals with the development of statistical methods for modeling and analyzing repeated categorical responses.  The investigator will develop and apply generalized linear mixed models for binary, multiple-category, and count data.  Mixed models extend ordinary linear models by adding random effects, which are unobserved terms that can account for subject heterogeneity, sample clustering, omitted explanatory variables, or measurement error.  Random effect terms provide a mechanism for explaining the correlations typically observed among the repeated responses.  This research will deal both with technical aspects of model-fitting and with formulating and interpreting new models for a variety of social science problems.  An important application is the modeling of responses to similar items in a survey having the same categorical scale, both in terms of comparing responses to the items for different groups of interest and modeling how each response depends on a set of covariates.  Another potential application is accounting for subject heterogeneity in estimating population size in census work using capture-recapture experiments.",
