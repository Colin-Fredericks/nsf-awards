Bobrow,  Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,  University of California - Irvine to pursue with Dr. Frank  C. Park, Department of Mechanical Design and Production  Engineering, Seoul National University, Korea, for 36  months, a program of cooperative research on optimal design  and control of multibody systems, a parallel manipulator  case study., Using techniques from modern differential  geometry, compact, closed-form equations for the dynamics of  such systems have been developed in prior research by the  collaborators.  The goal of the present research is to  integrate various mathematical methods, developed  previously, into a single unified design methodology for  multibody design and control.    These previously developed equations have led to the  development of gradient-based numerical optimization  algorithms for optimal design and motion planning  applications.  The collaborators expect to validate their  proposed approach with a case study, by applying the  methodology to the design, construction, and control of a  pneumatically actuated parallel manipulator for use as a  vehicle simulator.  The practical goal of this project is a  low-cost vehicle simulator whose performance is optimized  using efficient and robust design optimization algorithms.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea  Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the  level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and  engineers through the exchange of scientific information,  ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on  problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation is  supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation  (KOSEF).  ***",
