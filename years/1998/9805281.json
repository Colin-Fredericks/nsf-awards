In production-scale  deposition processes, these cannot now be monitored and adjusted in real time. We will overcome the problem with a dual-light-source, fiber-optic, thickness and composition monitor operating simultaneously as an interferometer (measuring growth rate) and as a reflectometer (measuring composition and total thickness). A major advantage of such an instrument is its ability to provide the data needed to make instantaneous composition changes during growth to compensate for the effects of diffusion. Diffusion is an important factor when very thin adjacent layers of dissimilar composition must be deposited at relatively high temperature, as is the case for multiple quantum well devices.                      Phase I will combine laser and white light sources in a single diagnostic instrument compatible with high-temperature processes, immune to electromagnetic noise (a byproduct of rf wafer heating), and free of the  requirement for precise optical alignment. The basic concept of the fiber-optic monitor has been demonstrated in rudimentary pulsed laser experiments on a silicon nitride reactor at Brown University; the principal investigator has successfully extracted real-time layer composition from white-light reflectance spectra. Phase I will extend this earlier work to a practical dual-source configuration fast and accurate enough to track thin-film growth at rates typical of advanced devices.                         Feedback control is key as new optoelecelectonic devices place greater demands on growth processes; the annual market for reasonably priced, easy to use thickness and composition monitors will be several million dollars. A         less capable version would compete with quartz deposition gauges, with a market  of tens of millions per year.    ***",
