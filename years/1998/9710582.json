 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Research Phase II  project is directed to development of a method for disinfestation of raw agricultural products.  Insect infestation is a universal problem in produce storage, processing and shipping that must be effectively addressed to minimize health concerns and to maintain an appetizing appearance, shelf life and marketability.  Cargoes that cross state and national boundaries are also generally subject to stringent regulations for the same reasons as well as to prevent the importation of harmful agricultural pests.  Containerized cargo transport in which containers carry a dedicated refrigeration unit (\"reefers\") employs controlled-atmospheres (CA) for preservation of' perishable products.  Giner, Inc. has developed a system for active continuous removal of oxygen leaking into \"sealed\" reefers to controlled low oxygen levels, and extend CA technology from food preservation to disinfestation applications.  The oxygen level must be lowered sufficiently for disinfestation but not below the tolerance level of the respiring produce.  The Giner, Inc. Electrochemical Oxygen Removal (EOR) system is uniquely suited for adaptation as an Electrochemical Oxygen Control (EOC) system.   In Phase I a prototype FOC system suitable for disinfestation was designed, built and tested, and a feasibility demonstration with fresh produce was Successfully concluded.  Phase II of the program will optimize the electrochemical reactor and refine the control system of the prototype EOC.  The unit will be field tested more extensively with a variety of produce for effectiveness in disinfestation.    Anticipated benefits of this development include greater availability of' fresh,  healthy,  agricultural products without the loss of quality associated with disinfestation by heating or freezing or the chemical residues from pesticides.  There should also be substantial cost savings associated with the prevention of losses for producers, shippers and consumers.  This technology may also open to sh ip transport more distant markets that are now only accessible by expensive air transport.  The technology developed is anticipated to find application for disinfestation in many other environments where insect infestation is a problem.",
