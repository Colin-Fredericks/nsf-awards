This project will design a new observation  protocol for use at GLOBE schools in order to detect the  annual waves of plant green-up and senescence that occur as  photosynthesis becomes active and then dormant with the  cycling of the seasons.  These waves are important because  they can be directly related to global carbon fixation, and  they are observed to respond to long-term global change.  It  is expected that they also respond to shorter-term phenomena  such as El Ni=F1o.  The greenness index measures reflectance  related to photosynthesis and plant cellular structure, and  is derived from satellite data.  Each satellite sensor is  calibrated for spectral reflectance before launch, but these  calibrations drift with time, and therefore the measurements  lose accuracy as the instrument ages. Combined with changes  in viewing angle and sun-angle, the index estimates have low  precision.  Ground-based observations of spring green-up and  fall senescence can therefore contribute greatly to the  validation of satellite estimates of growing seasons.  The goal of the project is to improve math, science, and  technology in K-12 classrooms by providing an opportunity  for scientists and students to collaborate in a research  project of real significance to scientists who are tracking  plant phenological changes as indicators of global change.  Students, teachers and scientists will benefit from this  project.  Students will take part in an authentic learning  project where they will have the chance to apply what they  are learning to create new knowledge.  Teachers will have a  new and interesting tool with which to teach basic  principles of math and science.  Scientists will have access  to global plant phenology data -- data which are currently  very rare and are needed for validation of global remotely  sensed estimates of plant phenology.  %%%  In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global  Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program  (GLOBE) this project is designed to meet GLOBE goals and  objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren in a  global information network with the ultimate goal of better  understanding Earth's environment and changes that take  place within it.
