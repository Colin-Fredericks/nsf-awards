 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725403  Ricchiazzi  The discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole in the early  1980's focused concern on whether enhanced ultraviolet (UV)  surface irradiance levels due to ozone depletion would have  a negative impact on the Southern Ocean ecosystem. While  subsequent photobiology research has shown negative effects  on photoplankton, zooplankton and fish larvae due to  increased UV radiation, it is difficult to extrapolate  localized studies to a broad spatial scale. Satellite-based  UV and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) mapping  techniques, developed through prior research support, offer  a way to extend the results of photobiology point-  measurement to large spatial scales. The mapping algorithm  uses specific satellite images of cloud and ozone  distribution to estimate UV and PAR irradiance levels of  large geographic areas. The goal of this research is to test  and improve performance of the UV and PAR mapping algorithm.  Since a significant fraction of the overall biological  productivity occurs in near-coastal waters, this project  will focus special attention on improving the performance of  the mapping technique near the coast. Simulations made with  Monte Carlo radiative transfer models suggest that these  coastal regions are subject to significant surface  irradiance enhancement. The field study will deploy a newly  modified surface radiometer with spectral sensors selected  to optimize the retrieval of cloud optical depth and surface  albedo.  The improved retrieval performance of this system  should significantly enhance the ability to test the  accuracy of the mapping algorithm. This project will also  investigate how the new AVHRR-3A satellite sensor can be  used to improve the algorithm. Initial analysis indicated  that information from this new sensor could be useful for  obtaining much more frequent and accurate surface albedo  maps, information that is a necessary ingredient for the  mapping algorithm. These new approaches to interpreting  satellite and surface mea surements will provide information  critical for an interpretation of the effects of ozone  reduction on the biological communities in Antarctica.",
