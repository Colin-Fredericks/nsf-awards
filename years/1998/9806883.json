 "awd_abstract_narration": "9806883  Paschal  The goal of this proposed research is to devise  computational techniques that will allow the successful  application of fractal analysis and other signal  characterization methods to the assessment of pulmonary  perfusion as measured by magnetic resonance angiography  (MRA).  Fractal analysis quantifies the self-similarity of a  signal over a range of observational scales to determine if  the patterns in a small volume scale up to match the  patterns in a large volume.  Lungs have already been  demonstrated to have a fractal nature in both their tree  structure and flow distribution.  The application of fractal  analysis to three-dimensional pulmonary perfusion  information obtained with modern MRA techniques should  provide a unique quantitative descriptor of flow patterns in  normal and pathologic conditions, Issues to be researched  include how to perform fractal analysis on an irregularly  shaped three dimensional volume, the effect of flow  distribution on fractal dimension, appropriate metrics to  characterize regional flow, and effect of MR imaging  technique on fractal analysis.  An irregularly shaped volume  presents a problem in that the typical fractal analysis  involves division of the volume into parallelepiped  elements@ depending on element size, some voxels containing  lung tissue may be omitted from the analysis and some voxels  outside the lungs may be included.  Both cases will result  in errors that diminish the accuracy of the computation of  fractal dimension.  To address this issue, tests will be  done comparing fractal dimension computed from: (a) a  parallelepiped volume that fits completely within a lung  volume, (b) a parallelepiped volume that completely  encompasses the lungs, and (c) the entire volume treated as  a sequential list of data points.  The effect of flow  distribution on fractal dimension will be tested by  comparing the results for healthy volunteers and patients  with lung pathologies and also by applying the analysis  techniques to  a normal date set altered, for example, by  removing a large sector of flow as might result from a large  pulmonary embolus or by removing many small sectors of flow  as might result from many small emboli.  ***",
