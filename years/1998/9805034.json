 "awd_abstract_narration": "Price  9805034    Planet earth is graced with over 250,000 species of flowering plants, most of which rely for pollination and seed production on visits by insects and other animals.  Pollination and seed production have been the focus of intense scientific study over the past few decades, but there still are gaps in our knowledge.  For example, biologists have assumed that the success of plants in attracting pollinators will translate not only into more seeds produced, but further down the line into more offspring plants flowering in the next generation.  But there are no experimental data to confirm this assumption, and some good reasons to expect that the assumption is too simplistic.  For example, biologists know (and any person tending a garden can confirm) that most seeds perish before they germinate, and most germinated seedlings perish before they reach adulthood. Furthermore, mortality of seeds and seedlings is higher when they are crowded.  So plants in nature enjoying higher pollination success might not enjoy the anticipated edge in surviving offspring, because of crowding and mortality of their seeds and seedlings.  For questions of pure ecology, and also of the conservation biology of endangered plant species, we need to know how crowding and other ecological interactions alter the links between pollination success and numbers of offspring surviving to flower one generation later.    This research project uses long-term experiments in natural plant populations to explore links between pollination and offspring survival and growth.  The study is centered on a native wildflower of the western USA, the scarlet gilia (Ipomposis aggregata), and its hummingbird and insect pollinators.  Past work with this system has shown that pollination success varies among weeks, years, sites, and individual plants at a site.  Previous research has also identified how pollination success translates into the number of seeds a plant produces.      To understand the link between seed number and number of  surviving offspring the investigators will carry out three new experiments.  First, they will sow seeds of scarlet gilia into study plots at a variety of densities that spans the 40-fold range that occurs in nature.  By mapping all seedlings that emerge subsequently and following them through several years until they mature and flower, the investigators can determine at what density offspring mortality begins to rise due to crowding.  Second, they will sow seeds at two densities chosen from the natural range of densities and from the first experiment, in this case replicating the treatments at several sites over two years.  The fates of individual mapped seedlings in \"low-density\" and \"high-density\" plots will be related statistically to local crowding and other environmental factors around each plant.  Third, the investigators will sow seeds with known genetic markers into replicate plots to mimic a situation in which one parent plant is attractive to pollinators and enjoys high success, whereas its neighbor is unattractive.  Offspring will later be assigned to parents based on genetic markers; this will allow investigators to determine how pollination success translates into Darwinian fitness (number of surviving offspring one generation later).      Finally, the information from these three experiments will be used to construct a computer model of plant population dynamics.  The model will enable exploration of the link between pollination success and offspring survival.  The aim is to produce a tool that other biologists and conservation managers can use to predict how population growth and Darwinian fitness will respond to pollination levels in their particular plant species.",
