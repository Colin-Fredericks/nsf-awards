The goal of the conference is to bring together  world leaders in the field of semiconductor heteroepitaxy to  discuss the most recent developments, stimulate collaborations  and identify critical issues for future research. International  invited speakers who work on different materials systems will  form the foundation of the meeting. An objective is to benchmark  domestic progress in this area against the international  community, and to stimulate collaboration and discussion between  researchers, especially between young professionals and  established experts. The conference also serves to bring together  industrial and academic scientists in an effort to encourage  collaboration between these groups. Support from NSF will be used  to partially compensate young scientists (junior faculty,  graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) for travel and  accommodation expenses. This will help the young scientists to  establish vital contacts with International academic and  industrial scientists working in the field. The conference is  expected to provide an effective forum for discussion of critical  scientific issues in heterovalent lattice-mismatched systems.  Along with the opportunity to assess the field and future  directions, it is expected that new ties will be established  between universities, research institutions, and industry.  %%%   Semiconducting lattice-mismatched materials have far reaching  economic potential since applications range broadly across  electronics and photonics associated with computing,  communications, and information processing. An evaluation of the  progress and status of this field along with current assessments  of the most important developments will be of great value to the  understanding and enhanced utilization of these materials in  applications beneficial to societ y.  ***",
