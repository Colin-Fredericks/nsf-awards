The theoretical approach employs displacement-based Finite\r\nElement Analysis (FEA), a well-established technique for\r\nobtaining solutions to engineering problems in nonlinear solid\r\nmechanics.  FEA is used to describe closed DNAs containing\r\nmultiple coplanar bends that are in-phase; containing bends that\r\ndo not lie in the same plane; and containing  bends distributed\r\nboth symmetrically and asymmetrically.  It is predicted that the\r\ntwist distribution is uniform throughout the regions between the\r\nbends; that the fraction of the linking number change converted\r\ninto writhe increases with the number of bends; and that the\r\nregional contribution to the writhe increases if the bends are\r\nclustered in that region.  Finally, it is predicted that the\r\nequilibrium configurations of DNA containing multiple bends fall\r\ninto two distinct classes of writhe behavior, depending on the\r\nratio of the elastic moduli and the number of bends, and that the\r\ninitial supercoiling process is completely different for the two\r\ndifferent classes.  Biologically, closed circular DNA is one of\r\nthe most important structural forms of DNA.  This includes not\r\nonly free DNA molecules, such as the plasmids used in all genetic\r\nengineering experiments, but chromatin as well, which is now\r\nknown to be divided into domains of supercoiling.  Bent regions\r\nin DNA appear to be significant in regulating the initiating of\r\ntranscription.  This project provides the physical basis for\r\nunderstanding the combined effects of these two structures.\r\n     DNA not only is a repository for genetic information but\r\nalso is involved in many aspects of the expression of this\r\ninformation.  For example, it is often necessary to bring\r\ntogether portions of the DNA molecule that lie at considerable\r\ndistances from each other along the DNA contour.  This\r\njuxtaposition of distant genetic elements makes possible the\r\nexpression of biological information that is not otherwise\r\npossible.  This process is accomplished by forming a loop, in\r\nwhich the two elements that are to be brought together interact\r\nat the site of loop closure.  The bringing together of these\r\ndistant genes depends in a sensitive way upon the length of the\r\nDNA piece that separates them, upon the helical periodicity, and\r\nupon the salt concentration of the cell in which the DNA resides.\r\nThis project shows how the presence of internal bends in DNA\r\nwithin the loop fundamentally changes how distant segments are\r\nbrought together.  The distribution of these internal bends can\r\nthus have profound biological consequences.\r\n\r\n",
