 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726229  Manson  This senior PI has enjoyed a long-standing support for  theoretical research on scattering of atoms from surfaces  and adsorbates.  He has developed a formalism to study an  important aspect of inelastic scattering, namely one which  involves creation of several lattice phonons of the target.  In this grant he is planning to extend this formalism to  include the presence of an adsorbate,  and in particular  complex multi atom objects, e.g. hydrocarbons.  He is  planning to study the role of the adsorbate internal degrees  of freedom in inelastic atom-surface scattering.  There are  in addition several associated projects of fundamental  importance.  One considers the development of surface  sticking in both quantum and classical regimes and which  leads to considerations of energy accommodation coefficients  and lift and drag coefficients .  In another project, the PI  plans to consider the scattering of a metastable Helium  atom.  This work will involve collaboration with  experimental groups at the Florida State University, the  University of North Carolina and the Max Planck Institute at  Gottingen.  %%%  This renewal grant to a senior PI is in support of  theoretical work on scattering of atoms from surfaces,  especially aspects of energy loss during scattering.  This  grant includes study of the role of atoms and molecules  present at the surface, especially as the energy is shared  between the internal vibrations and oscillations of these  atoms (or molecules) and the heating of the target.  He will  also consider the characteristics of scattering of highly  excited projectiles and the associated questions about  sticking and energy loss.  ***",
