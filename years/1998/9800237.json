 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9800237  German  The funds provided by the National Science Foundation in this program will be used to purchase a state-of-the-art rheological testing system for the study of polymer-powder mixtures, consisting of a torque rheometer with a twin-screw extrusion attachment.  This equipment will be used in the development of materials in areas such as powder injection molding, solder paste formulation, direct metal injection molding, and pressureless and centrifugal forming. It is crucial to understand the interaction of metal or ceramic powder with a viscous fluid in all of these applications,.   This equipment will allow the fundamental study of feedstock rheology and quantification of viscosity, yield strength, phase separation, mixing kinetics, the characterization of shear thinning and shear thickening, and many other phenomenon.  The twin screw attachment permits the collection of fundamental data relevant to the continuous mixing of polymer/powder systems, an area which is poorly understood.   This is a multi-user piece of equipment, which complements existing capabilities in polymer research. The equipment will be highly utilized by the many undergraduate and graduate students in the P/M Lab who are conducting research in particulate materials as part of their educational programs.  It will be used for in-lab demonstrations and the many active research programs currently being studied in the lab, thereby significantly advancing the current knowledge of the rheological behavior of powder-loaded systems.",
