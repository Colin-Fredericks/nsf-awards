 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this investigation is to understand the processes and systems by which effective decisions may-be made in the context of distant returns. The particular situation being studied is the conduct of in-house research in-science by firms. Three specific issues are being studied using field data. One, how do qualitative criteria and-behavioral and informal processes influence sequences of resource allocation decisions for-in-house research in science made over extended years? Two, how do evolving-systems and processes of strategic planning and management control influence such sequences of choices over the years? Three, how do firm strategies, capabilities, and-new knowledge created by research in science influence one another and co-evolve over the years?- Given limited prior research on these issues, the investigators will develop a grounded theory inductively, employing a-comparative, historical, case study methodology to study research decisions in a-pharmaceutical firm. Four projects for in-house research in science over roughly the same period will be examined in depth. They will be placed in the context of all projects in existence during the period of interest. The approach will allow the study of extended decision-making processes in their entirety,-and relate processes with outcomes to evaluate effectiveness. Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected from public and company records, as well as through open-ended, semi-structured,-and structured interviews with those scientists, mid- and senior-managers who are associated with the projects. Data-collection, analysis, and writing will proceed simultaneously. To guide-data collection, relevant constructs will be drawn mainly from the research literature in strategic decision-making,-resource allocation, real options, strategic planning, management control, firm strategy, and organizational capabilities.-The investigation will identify how highly uncertain but critical resource allocation choices are made,-over extended periods, for returns that accrue only in the distant future. It will offer the behavioral and informal-underpinnings of such choices to complement the existing literature that examines mainly their quantitative, objective, and economic aspects. In doing so, it will further theory development in the management of research in-science, longitudinal decision-making, and scientific capabilities development; and provide a basis for the design of-appropriate dynamic administrative systems and processes of strategic planning and management control.-Additionally, a decision-making framework will be developed to aid in making and managing-long term sequences of decisions for the conduct of in-house research in science. Findings will be reported in-journal articles aimed at both academics and practitioners. Cases written for the development of theory will be-modified into teaching cases and notes for R&D managers and senior managers of science based firms.-",
