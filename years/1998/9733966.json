Abstract      The proposed work is related to the development of three devices that exploit the high intrinsic mobility attribute of AlInSb and InSb heterostructures and quantum wells. The devices under investigation include magnetic field sensors, field-effect transistors with high-speed and low power dissipation, and spin-polarized FETs. The  educational component of the proposed work is related to the PIs involvement in an Engineering Physics students program and to the support of a number of senior projects in the area of device fabrication and characterization.    It is believed that if successful, the PI will make a significant contribution in the area of advanced materials and device research.  His partnership with GM was also noted and his strong commitment to educational activities was appreciated.    This is a well written proposal and presents a well designed research and educational program.  High risk areas were addressed with innovative possible solutions and to this  end it is felt that this proposal is worthy of funding.    Based on the written evaluations and the panel discussion, this proposal is recommended for a CAREER award at $200,000 for 48 months. The PI has submitted a revised budget without substantial change in the scope of the work.                 February 20, 1998",
