 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is carried out in collaboration with David Maier of the Oregon Graduate Institute. One of the key factors for object-oriented database (OODB) systems to successfully compete with relational systems as well as to meet the performance requirements of many non-traditional applications is the development of an effective query optimizer. This research addresses efficient query optimization for OODB languages. The research framework is based on a calculus, called the monoid comprehension calculus, which has already been shown to capture most features of modern OODB query languages. This effective, yet simple approach transforms the queries into an intermediate form, based on this calculus, that can be efficiently optimized. This research concentrates on two very important optimization problems and proposes practical, effective, and general solutions. The first problem is query unnesting, an optimization that, even though improves performance considerably, is not treated properly by most OODB systems. A framework is developed that generalizes many unnesting techniques proposed recently in the literature and is capable of removing any form of query nesting using a simple and efficient algorithm. The second problem is query optimization in the presence of side effects, i.e., queries that may contain object updates at any place and in any form. A practical method is developed that allows the same optimization techniques proposed for regular queries to be used with minimal changes for OODB queries with side effects. A prototype query optimizer is constructed to demonstrate that these optimization techniques considerably improve performance for queries as well as updates. The results of this research will help OODB vendors build better query optimizers, leading to better system performance. \r\n\r\nhttp://www-cse.uta.edu/~fegaras/opt/\r\n",
