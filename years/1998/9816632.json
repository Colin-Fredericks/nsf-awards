The conference will include 200 physicists, educators and other scientists who will discuss the future of undergraduate education in physics at two year colleges, four year colleges and universities.  This conference builds on several prior and continuing efforts by AAPT, the American Physical Society and the American Institute of Physics to assist physics departments to examine their curricula, the changing student body, evolving job requirements and career opportunities as well as accumulating research on student learning.  The products of the conference will be concrete action plans and guidelines that will help physics departments to undertake the kinds of revitalization that will benefit their students, their institutions, and the discipline.",
