 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recruitment success in infauna: geochemical cues  This study will address two questions about recruitment, an important  determinant of community dynamics: 1) what are the qualities of the  sediment surface to which recruits are responding? and 2) what processes  (physical, biological and chemical) control availability and acceptability  of sites? Recent experiments and models suggest that some new recruits  respond to substances common to a variety of habitats, namely porewater  solutes such as ammonium and oxygen. These solutes appear to be indicative  of habitat quality and disturbance history -- both of which may strongly  influence survivorship of recruits. Most biologically active sedimentary  systems are characterized by steep solute gradients within the top sediment  layers, driven by organic matter decomposition (diagenesis) and transport  processes (Bemer 1980). Most disturbances result in changes in chemistry  that render the surficial sediments more suboxic or anoxic in character.  The steep gradients in chemical properties in sediments and the changes in  surficial chemistry that accompany disturbance provide a broadly available  and potentially significant chemical signal for new recruits. This study  will examine the hypothesis that organisms use this diagenetic information  in the site selection process.  This study will examine the significance of surficial sediment chemistry to  the decision making phase for primary and secondary recruitment from an  experimental and mathematical point of view. The research will address the  following: (1) separate the signal provided by solutes from that provided  by other, more commonly evaluated factors such as grain size and organic  matter content; (2) evaluate the generality of the responses of new  recruits to solute signals both experimentally and mathematically, for  example, do organisms which as adults inhabit different sedimentary  environments respond similarly to solute signals as new recruits; and (3)  evaluate the implications of the disturbance-surficial chemistry link, for  example how do the severity of the disturbance and the steepness of the  solute gradients interact, and are the circumstances under which new  recruits will accept a given location predictable on the basis of the  solute profile and disturbance history?  The study is expected to develop coupled experiments and models with an  evaluative and predictive capacity; an understanding of the degree to which  new recruits of species with significantly different adult distributions  use solutes that are broadly distributed, but environmentally informative,  as chemical cues to habitat suitability; and an appreciation for the  influence of disturbance on surficial solute distributions and the adaptive  significance of the responses of new recruits to disturbance signals.  Overall, the  integrated modeling and experimental approach will provide a  predictive tool for evaluating recruitment patterns and choices in a  variety of nearshore habitats.",
