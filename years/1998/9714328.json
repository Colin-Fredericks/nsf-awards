 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of statistical overlap theory for the deconvolution of complex   chromatographic data is extended to applications including   two-dimensional (2-D) separations.  In the approach employed by Professor   Davis and his students at Southern Illinois University, the extent of   overlap of co-eluting components can be predicted as well as computation   of the required peak capacity to reduce the degree of overlap to   manageable levels.  A key component to this program is the distribution   of the generated  mathematic codes via the internet so that practitioners   can have direct access to the deconvolution methodologies.      Chromatographic separations are a vital component in many chemical   analyses.  Analytical separations remove some of the ambiguities present   in many detection methods, and thus the ability to identify the presence   of co-eluting species is of utmost importance.  The wide variety of   separation media and underlying phenomena make the development of   universal computational methods to deconvolve overlapping peaks very   difficult.  The continued development of the statistical overlap theory   and placement of the computational capabilities on the internet by   Professor Davis and his students may serve to address the needs of a wide   range of chromatography applications.",
