 "awd_abstract_narration": "ESI 97-31429  Oberhauser    This is a proposed three-year outreach that will engage teachers and students in long-term research partnerships incorporating NRC Standards.  It is designed to enhance the capability of both middle and high school teachers incorporate formal research practices into their science classrooms.  Project activities include experimental design, data collecting, data analysis, and science collaboration as teams throughout the eastern United States.    The research focus will be the monarch butterfly.  Results of the research into the monarch butterfly will provide baseline knowledge that will help and guide conservation efforts.  It will also enrich the body of monarch butterfly research data currently available.    There will be a total of 60 teachers and 120 students involved over the term of the project (i.e., three years).  Teachers and students will work in teams (i.e., one teacher and two students).  Special emphasis will be given to recruiting teachers with leadership qualities and in representation of urban, suburban, and rural schools, as well as a variety of cultural socioeconomic backgrounds.      Project evaluation will be undertaken by the University of Minnesota Center for Applied research and Educational Improvement (CAREI).  Dissemination of the project's work will be disseminated through presentations at local and national meetings, \"teacher best practices circles,\" development of a Monarch Monitoring Resource packet and CD-ROM, on-line resources, and a fee-based institute.",
