 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award supports US-UK cooperative research on algorithms for generating   nominal expressions, on the basis of corpus analysis and computational modeling in   different applications.  The collaboration involves Barbara DiEugenio and graduate   students at the Learning Research and Development Center at the University of   Pittsburgh and Dr. Massimo Poesio of the Human Communication Research Centre at the   University of Edinburgh.  Major issues, such as discourse and dialogue modeling, which   are involved in generating nominals, will be investigated.    The US investigators bring to this collaboration expertise on human-human computer-  mediated collaborative and tutorial dialogues and intelligent tutoring systems.  This is   complemented by expertise of the Edinburgh research group on implementation of   algorithms and the development of single speaker applications, such as the generation of   object descriptions linked to web traversal.  The Edinburgh group will implement the   algorithms, which will be tested and modified by the Pittsburgh Center.",
