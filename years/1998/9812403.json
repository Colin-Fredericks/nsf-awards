 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a coordinated experimental and theoretical program directed at understanding the characteristics of multi-dimensional shocks propagating in weakly ionized gases.  The aim is to understand the role played by the space charge and the shock curvature in modifying the shock characteristics as compared to neutral shocks.  A novel technique for generating these shock waves is proposed which will make it possible investigate the effects of transverse (to the direction of shock propagation) particle flows as result of shock curvature.  Moreover, the dimensions of the experimental chamber (50cm x 100 cm) as well as the techniques for generating the plasma will make it possible to greatly reduce the influence of the chamber wall and the discharge generating circuit on the charged particle distribution in the shock.  The data generated in the experiments will be used to validate the multi-dimensional shock code which will bedeveloped to assist in the interpretation of the results, and to provide a starting point for model-based control in future work.",
