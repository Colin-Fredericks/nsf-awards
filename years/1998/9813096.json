NCTM, Widmeyer-Baker and NACME are partnering to launch and deliver the Initiative.  NCTM has responsibility for ensuring that the mathematics conveyed throughout the Initiative is compelling, accurate, and appropriate for middle grade learners.  Their project contributions are entitled Math in the Media and the Public as Partners.  Math in the Media is the title of the Problem of the Week feature, which will be designed for weekly promotions around the country.  The problems will be developed across the following content strands: number, data, geometry, measurement, and patterns, functions and algebra.  Problem contexts will vary.  The problems of the week will be designed such that they will be simultaneously available in print and web-based formats.  The Public as Partners project component will be aimed at the general public and will develop printed materials to support and engage the public in actually doing mathematics. \r\n\r\n",
