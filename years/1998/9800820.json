 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Ralph Greenberg  University of Washington  98 00829    Professor Greenberg intends to study a variety of questions concerning local Galois cohomology groups, Selmer Groups and elliptic curves. Under his plan Galois cohomology will provide information about Selmer groups.  Selmer groups are key ingredients in our understanding of the arithmetic of elliptic curves. Professor Greenberg is ultimately interested in those points on elliptic curves that can be pinpointed using algebraic numbers.  Algebraic numbers are numbers that can be developed in a finite way from the integers we all learn in school.  The Selmer Group is specifically designed to study these points.    In one view, elliptic curves are shaped like the surface of a donut.  In this view, simpler curves are like the surface of a sphere, a donut without a hole, and more complicated curves are like the surface of a donut with several holes.  The arithmetical properties of the simple curves have been extensively studied since ancient times.  The more complicated curves have such a restrictive arithmetic structure that simply counting the points on one is a difficult research problem.  The one hole donuts are, however, just right. They have a rich and mysterious structure which this project will explore. Their beautiful mathematical structure makes elliptic curves very useful in such practical problems as the digital encoding of information and the security of communications.",
