Engineering process control procedures based on first-order and second-order dynamic equations will be used in the model to make adjustments to the system. A statistical process control procedure based on autocorrelation will be used in the model to monitor the system. The developed simulation model will characterize the dynamic process and the noise process that leads to out-of-specification product output associated with a startup. This research investigation will take place in partnership with a leading textile manufacturer. The simulation model will be designed and validated in the context of the finishing operations for textile manufacturing. Experiments involving new policies to reduce the scrap for the startup phase will be conducted using the simulation model.\r\n     If successful, the results of this research will lead to the establishment of new operational methods for the startup phase.  In practical terms, one expected outcome of this research is a reduction in the amount of waste carpet associated with the startup. This research also has general implications for other continuous manufacturing systems -- such as food and beverage, chemicals and paint, and pharmaceuticals -- as the number of startups continues to increase with the shift to make-to-order production to meet customer demands. Out of this broader, long-range concern, we plan to identify related projects and continue the industry involvement fostered by this partnership.\r\n\r\n",
