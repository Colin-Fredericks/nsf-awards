 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year project will develop and implement a 6-hour integrated, introductory college course in mathematics and computer science. Conducted in a PC laboratory setting, this course will be activity driven, with the professor as facilitator rather than knowledge dispenser and  lecturer. The course will teach teamwork and communication skills, and a sense of scientific inquiry through student projects and lab activities. Students will develop computer software  skills and judgment in using them within a context of mathematical content and problem  solving to increase their quantitative literacy. The course will customize and extend exemplary introductory courses in mathematics and computer science  5 , and adapt successful curricular  reform principles used by the PIs in calculus and other courses.   Freshman students from mathematically weak and technologically disadvantaged backgrounds will be encouraged to take this course, giving them a \"jumpstart\" in their collegiate experience. In particular, the Mathematical and Information Sciences Department will work with the Sam Houston State University cluster program for at-risk students.  The project will be evaluated on the basis of student retention, attitudes, and success in subsequent computer science, mathematics and science courses. Comparisons with the current general education classes in mathematics and computer science will be made.  The project materials and evaluation will be disseminated through a series of conference presentations, publications, and web sites.",
