The  research will focus on two areas of great current interest:  field theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect and  renormalization group for phase transitions.  A textbook is  also being written on the application of field theory to  condensed matter.    Since the remarkable discovery that the Hall conductance of  a two-dimensional electron gas is quantized to some  fractional values, there has been a steady stream of  theoretical work aimed at explaining many aspects of this  phenomenon.  While there is an impressive body of knowledge,  one still lacks a single microscopic theory that will  describe all these fractions, starting from just electrons  in a magnetic field, subject to Coulomb interactions and the  random substrate potential.  Chern-Simons field theories, in  which one maps electrons into either bosons or fermions  which, on the average, see either no field or a weaker field  in which they fill an integer number of Landau levels, are  one of the most promising options.  A framework based on  these theories has been developed.  It reproduces in a  coherent way many known results for some special fractions  (in which the net field vanishes) from the above mentioned  starting point and promises to yield more results for the  other fractions.  Being very different in many ways from  other techniques used, this analysis will either disagree  with some existing results or provide a totally independent  confirmation, especially for the half-filled case.    Some time ago a renormalization group scheme for fermions  was worked out in which one systematically eliminates modes  near the Fermi surface to extract the low energy physics.  In this scheme Landau's Fermi liquid appears as a fixed  point, while instabilities, to say, superconductivity emerge  as relevant flows.  Unfortunately, the method has been  limited to transitions that occur at zero couplin g.  Extension to finite coupling typically involves the fermions  one begins with as well as bosonic fields formed out of  them.  A scheme in which high energy modes of both are  eliminated side by side, and which has so far proven  elusive, will be investigated.  %%%  This grant will support research on condensed matter theory  as well as the writing of a graduate textbook.  The research  focuses on the application of field theoretical techniques  to problems of current interest in condensed matter physics.  These problems include the study of the fractional quantum  Hall effect - a new state of matter.  Successful completion  of the proposed work should have wide ranging impact on  condensed matter and materials physics.  ***",
