 "awd_abstract_narration": "9812994     \r\nXu\r\n     Today's manufacturing, communication and other operating systems are complex, flexible, and integrated. To improve the overall performance of these systems, various policies and protocols that emphasize coordination, synchronization, and operational concurrency have been introduced and implemented.  Examples of such systems include synchronized communication networks and  assemble-to-order manufacturing/inventory systems.  Most classical models, which are suitable under the premise that events occur individually and independently, cannot adequately capture the essential features of synchronized systems. This project intends to develop new analytical models and results for synchronized systems that can provide practitioners with helpful insights for the effective design and management of these systems. \r\n     The goal of the project is to systematically develop a theory for the new notion, use the new theory to analyze the dependence structures of synchronized queueing and reliability systems, and highlight its wide applicability in various operating systems. Specific objectives are to develop good computable bounds, efficient heuristics, and important characterizations of system performance measures whose explicit computations are either intractable or computationally intensive.   The insight gained from this  research porject  will be summarized into a set of design and control principles for the efficient and effective management of synchronized operating systems. The outcome of this project is expected to bear both theoretical and practical significance in diverse applications, including assemble-to-order systems, synchronized communication networks, and reliability systems with simultaneous subsystem failures.\r\n\r\n",
