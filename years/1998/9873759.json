 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the scientific challenges of extending telecommunication and electronic collaboration to more general \"activity at a distance\" and into physical and social (in contrast to virtual and individual) spaces. There is clearly a difference between an in-person visit and a telecommunication experience. This project will attempt to understand this difference and to reduce it, using and experimenting with robotic technologies called Personal Robot Presences (PRoPs): human proxies in real spaces occupied by other people. Such a robotic telepresence need not have an anthropomorphic form, but it may need a reasonable set of capabilities for interaction. Consequently, this project will seek to better understand the social and psychological aspects of extended human-human interaction. PRoPs are an excellent platform for studying computer- and robot-mediated human interaction because they operate in physical and social spaces, and can interact with a group of people. This social context sharply underlines the difference between this work and many studies of human-machine interactions.  the results of this work are expected to improve our understanding of physical and social interactions that are mediated by computer and robotic devices in real social and physical space, not simply virtual spaces. http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jfc/",
