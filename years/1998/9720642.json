 "awd_abstract_narration": "9720642     Benfield  The three South Dakota research universities, South Dakota State  University, the University of South Dakota, and South Dakota School of  Mines and Technology, will collaborate to develop infrastructure that  promotes competitiveness on the part of individual investigators.   Another partner in this project is the Earth Resources Observation  Systems (EROS) Data Center, a federal facility located in the state.   Infrastructure development and co-funding endorsement will be in the  context of three scientific areas and one supporting area, all chosen  for their relationship to the South Dakota economy, for the existence  of scientific talent in the state, and for the inherent potential for  independent fundability.  The scientific focus areas are:  (1)  Biological Response to Stress; (2) Geophysical Processes of the  Northern Plains; and (3) Materials and Processes for the 21st Century.   The supporting technical area is telecommunications and information  technology.  In addition, infrastructure development activities will  be carried out.  Such activities will include: (1) new faculty start-  up costs to assist new faculty members in establishing laboratories  for their research and for purchasing scientific equipment; (2)  investigator special travel awards provided specifically for faculty  to travel to funding agencies in Washington to discuss grant  opportunities and procedures; (3) Rushmore Conferences to host a  national conference in South Dakota in each of the three primary focus  areas as well as two special conferences on \"Native Americans in  Science,\" and \"The Scientist as Entrepreneur;\" (4) graduate  fellowships, nine special fellowships each year to attract the best  students to South Dakota; (5) undergraduate research fellowships, to  support a total of 30 undergraduates every year in summer research  involvement; (6) a joint industry program with North Dakota to place  students in industrial internships; (7) an annual state EPSCoR  conference held in the st ate, including a joint conference with North  Dakota in 1999; (8) a seminar series, enabling each primary focus  group to host two national speakers per year by bringing them to one  campus and broadcasting their visit interactively to the other  schools; (9) a proposal enhancement program to provide small grants to  faculty who submit proposals to major external funding agencies,  coupled with proposal-writing workshops; and (10) equipment funds to  purchase state-of-the-art research instrumentation related to the  above focus areas, which will permit South Dakota faculty to carry out  competitive research.",
