 "awd_abstract_narration": "9732275  The Eastern Illinois University (EIU) Zoology Department  will provide intensive research experiences for 9  undergraduate students during the summers of 1998 and 1999.  Student participants will form research teams to engage in  studies addressing conservation biology and landscape  fragmentation. The goals of this experience will be to  foster in each participant an understanding of the research  process, and encourage each student's growth from dependent  learner to independent researcher to interdependent member  of a scientific team.  Participants will be recruited  nationally and selected based on their professional goals,  motivation and maturity, and academic achievements.  Students will be fully immersed in the research process as  they choose their own research problem, write a proposal,  conduct the work, and report their results and conclusions.  Each participant will work closely with an individual  faculty mentor and team members. Opportunities to interact  and collaborate with other faculty members and research  teams will be provided through an orientation retreat,  weekly group meetings, and a series of formal workshops and  field trips.  In addition, visiting scientists, recognized  leaders in conservation biology, will each spend 1 or 2 days  presenting seminars, participating in informal discussion  groups, and critiquing research projects.  Students will  have ample opportunities to interact with mentors, fellow  participants, and visiting scientists in both formal and  informal settings.  EIU is strongly committed to  undergraduate research and will make important contributions  to this program, including provision of a block of dormitory  rooms and a common dining area for participants, waiver of  tuition for three credit-hours, and free use of campus  facilities, including the library, computer labs, and  recreation center.",
