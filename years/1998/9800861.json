 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Katznelson/Ornstein    Furstenberg, Katznelson, Ornstein, and Weiss will continue and expand  several long-term projects dealing with stability, as well as properties of  limit sets and other limit behavior, of dynamical systems. Among the projects  on stability:  1) We have devloped an alternative approach to problems that seemed  accessible only via the KAM strategy. In dimensions one and two we  obtained finer results both in the smoothness of the conjugation of circle  diffeomorphism (completing the pioneering results of Herman and Yoccoz)  and persistence under perturbation of twist maps of certain invariant circles  (Moser's theorem and extensions), as well as smoothness of curves invariant under surface diffeomorphism.  These methods   look promising as tools for the study of existence and smoothness of invariant tori in higher dimensions.  2) Establishing that a flow is Bernoulli not only characterizes it completely  as an abstract measure theoretic flow,  but also serves as the main step in  proving statistical stability. We are in the process of formalizing general  criteria for Bernoullicity of flows. Among the projects on limit behavior we  mention the study of multiple recurrence with polynomial times and problems  dealing with dimensions of fractals and other limit sets.    Dynamical systems are mathematical models of evolutionary phenomena  in both natural and social sciences. They  also provide  important tools in statistics, computer sciences, combinatorics, etc.  In this broad and broadening subject, we direct our main effort  to problems dealing with stability: to what extent are the perceived properties of a system robust, that is, will persist if the system is perturbed (modified) somewhat.  In any sort of practical application, where the data and the parameters are known only approximately, one can hardly rely on properties which are not stable. One of our main projects is to find conditions which guarantee the existence of surfaces invariant under the system. In  the right dimension, such (hyper) surfaces separate the space into invariant regions, or domains from which orbits cannot escape, and if the surface persists under perturbation-so do the domains. In other words, we can guarantee that some conditions will never evolve into some other (specific) type.",
