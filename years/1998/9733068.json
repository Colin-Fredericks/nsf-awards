 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733068  Grady    This EPSCoR co-funded CAREER award will use primarily X-ray  absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to examine responses in dynamics  and structure at the glass transition.  The glass transition is  one of the most important phenomena in polymeric materials.  The  fundamental microscopic structural changes that occur with the  glass transition are not well understood, and perhaps even more  importantly, the fundamental reason that Tg occurs at the  specific temperature it does for each polymer is not understood.  Other techniques, including NMR spectroscopy and neutron  scattering, show that local structural and dynamic changes occur  at the glass transition.  XAS will be used to obtain quantitative  and precise structural information.  Preliminary data show that  XAS can be used to examine local changes at the glass transition.  This proposal describes a broad range of experimentation which  will examine the important changes occurring at the local level  as a polymer progresses through its glass transition.  These  experiments will enable an evaluation of a Lindemann-type  approach to the glass transition, an approach suggested by others  and explored in this proposal.  %%%  The educational component of this project will involve the  Minority Engineering Program (MEP).  Almost 500 undergraduates at  the University of Oklahoma are members of the MEP, which is  limited to the historically underrepresented Black, Hispanic and  American Indian ethnic minorities.  One-on-one interactions  between faculty and students are one of the keys to recruiting  and retaining these students.  The PI's association with the MEP  program includes all facets of the undergraduate experience, from  the recruiting process to graduation.  It will involve travel to  primarily minority high schools and talks designed to help with  the recruiting process.  ***",
