 "awd_abstract_narration": "9730102  Swanson    This project investigates linear and nonlinear forecasting and model specification using time series which may or may not be strictly stationary.  The research will build on the foundation of results obtained to date, and is meant to extend, broaden, and deepen our understanding of forecast model construction, data transformation, and artificial networks.  The research consists of two different but related areas: data transformation and forecasting; and nonlinear model specification, estimation, inference and forecasting.    Preliminary evidence shows that commonly and widely applied statistical tests are severely biased when data are assumed to follow a linear model in levels, but logs are taken, and vice - versa.  The part of the project on data transformation solves the problem of choosing appropriate data transformation in a way that is simple to implement, involving only least squares regression, unique, and does not require knowledge of whether the variables are stationary or nonstationary.  The research examines a wide variety of issues related to data transformation, including: (1) the effects of data transformation on commonly applied statistical tests; (2) testing procedures for addressing data transformation; and (3) theoretical and empirical implications of data transformation in forecast model specification and construction.    The part of the project on nonlinear forecast specification focuses on artificial neural network (ANN) sieves, and the resulting class of estimators called ANN sieve estimators.  The project (1) examines the use of alternative activation functions for forecasting; (2) obtains convergence rates and normality results for loss functions other than mean square error, which may be discontinuous; and (3) obtains pointwise asymptotic normality for ANN models.      ??",
