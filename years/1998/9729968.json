 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9729968\r\nGiapis\r\nPatterned surfaces are frequently exposed to plasmas as in plasma characterization through minuscule sampling orifices or in applications ranging from etching, deposition, and ashing in microelectronics, to selective surface functionalization.  Frequently, the patterns consist of dissimilar materials (insulating masks, conductive metal or polysilicon, gate and field oxide), which charge up as a result of the directionality difference between ions and electrons at the plasma-sheath exit.  Plasma-induced charging may cause ion deflection with undesirable consequences; for example, mask charging leads to sidewall profile irregularities when etching high aspect ratio features.  \r\n\r\nIn this proposal, we seek to reveal the fundamental physics of plasma-induced charging \r\nthrough a combined experimental and theoretical approach focused on dense sub-micron \r\npatterns of insulators and conductors similar to those encountered during plasma etching.  \r\nLarge-scale Monte Carlo simulation will combine sheath dynamics,  microstructure \r\ncharging, electrostatics, reactions, scattering, electron tunneling through t n insulators, and \r\nsurface currents to shed light into a variety of conflicting reports on the influence of \r\nplasma parameters on charging damage.  In particular, we seek to understand the nature of \r\nthe so called \"electron shading\" damage, which causes catastrophic electron tunneling \r\ncurrents through the gate oxide in polysilicon-on-insulator structures. Significant modeling \r\neffort on pattern-dependent charging effects will be expanded to include tunneling effects \r\nand surface currents and will be used to predict:\r\n\r\na)\tThe influence of electron temperature, rf bias, and rf frequency on charging damage.\r\nb)\tAspect-ratio-dependent charging effects.  Is there a correlation between microloading and electron                   shadowing?\r\nc)\tMask thickness effects.  How will the use of thinner hard (oxide) masks impact charging                 damage?\r\nd)\tFeature- and wafer-scale effects.  Does charging of a particular feature affect damage in                      neighboring trenches?\r\ne)            Pulsed-plasma effects.  Why do pulsed plasmas reduce both forms of charging damage? \r\nf)             New device-layout rules for eliminating charging damage.\r\n\r\nThe simulation results will be validated by extensive etching experiments in a high density plasma produced in a helical resonator\r\n",
