The project will support needs concerning:  1) movement into  newly acquired space and 2) results from a self-evaluation  for accreditation by the American Association of Museums.  To address these challenges, basic changes in space  utilization, storage improvements, and minor modification of  facilities must be made.  These changes will facilitate  collection utilization, improve conditions for health and  safety of personnel, and accommodate current and future  growth.  These plans incorporate recently published  information about collection care, expansion, storage,  separation of preparation facilities from collection storage  areas, allocation of dedicated space for specific collection  areas (general collection, fluid-preserved collection, and  frozen-tissue collections) and operations (specimen  preparation, osteological processing, integrated pest  management, and supply storage).         Specifically, this project will support for the  following activities:  1) Reallocation of existing space and  expansion into newly acquired space.  This will enhance  utilization of facilities, allow for growth, and assist in  the implementation of subsequent stages of collection  enhancements.  2) Movement of the fluid-preserved  collections to a single, larger, dedicated facility, and  house the fluid-specimens in non-flammable lockers to  provide greater protection from fire to the collection and  personnel and facilitate collection growth.  Additionally,  replacement of old jars and lids in the fluid collection.  3) Movement of offices into newly dedicated space.  4)  Movement of the vital tissue collection int o a larger  dedicated space.  5) Transfer the osteological and specimen  processing areas to dedicated space distant to collection  storage areas to minimize the potential for insect-specimen  contact.  6) Upgrade the storage of dry specimens including  the replacement of wooden cases with a sufficient number of  mental cases to allow for upgrading storage of existing  specimens, as well as for the incorporation of newly  acquired collections, and for growth and expansion.  7)  Placement of specimen cases on metal racks for more  effective pest-control.  8) Installation of backlogged and  incoming material.         These changes will provide conditions that will serve  the interests of collection care, management, growth,  personnel health and safety, as well as facilitate the  museum's commitment to making these collections available to  researchers and for academic training of systematists and  museum professionals.",
