 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award in the Inorganic,   Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by   Dr. Patrick J. Walsh, Chemistry Department, San Diego State University,   on the mechanism of asymmetric induction by titanium catalysts.  Several   new chiral titanium bis(sulfonamido) complexes will be prepared and   tested for their effectiveness in the catalytic asymmetric addition of   alkyl groups to aldehydes.  They are expected to model the intermediates   in this reaction and so to provide guidance about important features of   the active site and about design of more effective catalysts.  In   addition to involving undergraduate students in this research, Dr. Walsh   will conduct an extensive outreach program to enrich chemistry education   in the San Diego-northern Mexico region.  Selective synthesis of compounds with a specific symmetry, that is, of   either a right- or left-handed form, is an important chemical goal.    Methods of this type are critical to the pharmaceutical industry and to   many biological studies.  In this research, a more detailed knowledge of   the way in which selective synthesis occurs will be achieved.    Undergraduates will be involved in this problem-directed research.  In   addition, outreach programs in science in collaboration with the   Instituto Tecnologico de Tijuana for US and Mexican students will be   undertaken.",
