 "awd_abstract_narration": "The brain of insects contains a prominent pair of centers known  as the mushroom bodies.  These structures have been implicated in  discrimination of odors important for feeding and mating behavior,  and the anatomical organization has been suggested to be a  repeated arrangement of an essentially simple wiring pattern.  More recent studies now suggest that the mushroom bodies play a  central role in a much wider variety of functions, including  integration of vision and smell, memory of place, and motor  control.  Along with these disparate functions, the structure of  the mushroom bodies may have far more internal partitioning into  locally functioning regions.  This project uses a combination of  anatomy, physiology, and behavior to examine the sensory signals  in uniquely identified nerve cells, and the connections of these  neurons to further processing pathways.  A novel marking method  will allow recording from single neurons in behaving insects, and  later recovering the location and form of those active individual  cells.     Using a comparative approach among species representing key  evolutionary lineages, these studies will clarify the  organizational ground rules of a brain center that has ancient  origins.  The demonstration of important roles for the mushroom  bodies in integrating sensory information leading to behavioral  action may suggest some bases for the extraordinary evolutionary  and ecological success of the insects.  The impact will extend  beyond neuroscience into areas of ecology and evolution, and  perhaps also to pest control in agriculture.",
