 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804313  Heiman  The aim of this research is to investigate the synthesis of  semiconductors that are ferromagnetic the overall goal is to  discover new device materials useful in the information age. The  project addresses the synthesis and properties of high-Curie-  temperature, ferromagnetic GaAs doped with Mn, which has the  potential to exhibit strong magnetic as well as electrical and  optical behavior. Magnetic semiconductors such as the europium  chalcogenides are good magnets but have poor electrical  properties and limited optical properties, while dilute magnetic  semiconductors such as manganese-doped II-VI materials show  better electrical and optical properties but weak magnetism. Thin  films and quantum wells of Gal-xMnxAs/Ga1-yAlyAs will be grown by  MBE. It is known that Mn2+ substituting for Ga3+ in GaAs leads to  deep acceptor states. When the hole concentration is above the  Mott criterion (~2x1019 cm-2) a metallic state is produced. It is  believed that a strong p-d exchange between the magnetic Mn2+  ions and holes generates ferromagnetism. A key issue is how to  control the number of holes in the material. The hole  concentration, and ultimately the Curie temperature, depend on  the degree of compensation of the holes by unknown donor-like  states. Proper control of the manganese and hole concentration is  expected to lead to increased Curie temperatures. Further  investigations will address the self-assembly of MnAs quantum  dots, and the feasibility of building multilayer structures for  giant magnetoresistance materials.    %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  materials science having high technological relevance. The  research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a  fundamental level to important aspects of  electronic/photonic/magnetic devices. The basic knowledge and  understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute  to improving the performance of advanced devices by providing a  fundamental understan ding and a basis for designing and producing  improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important  feature of the program is the integration of research and  education through the training of students in a fundamentally and  technologically significant area.",
