 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802756  Anlage  This award provides partial support for the acquisition and  development of a cryogenic scanned near-field microwave  microscope which will measure important materials properties  (such as surface sheet resistance, complex dielectric  permittivity, complex magnetic permeability, etc.)  at  microwave frequencies with a spatial resolution on the order  of 10 nm.  The cryogenic operation will allow us to develop  a superconducting near-field microwave microscope with  greatly enhanced sensitivity.  The microscope will also be  configured to measure microwave current distributions in  superconducting microwave devices at 100 nm resolution, for  the purpose of understanding the microscopic origins of  nonlinearity in these devices.  In one mode of operation, we  will obtain high spatial resolution microwave images which  will be free of the effects of sample topography.  In other  configurations, the microscope will also use a scanning  bolometer to measure spatially resolved temperature  variations in superconducting microwave devices.  A scanning  single-electron transistor, operating at 4.2 K, will be used  to sensitively image very small electric fields and charges.  Finally, the microscope will be used in conjunction with an  existing microwave network analyzer for imaging with  calibrated broadband electromagnetic field and conductivity  measurements.  %%%  ***",
