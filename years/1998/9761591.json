 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9761591  Vempati    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I deals with ZSM 5 synthesis, a siliceous and hydrophobic zeolite, from rice hull ash.  Environmental pollution associated with burning rice hulls, coupled with scarcity and landfilling cost, creates disposal problems to rice mill owners.  Rice hull ash (RHA) is siliceous and contains some aluminum, and therefore, it is a natural candidate for ZSM 5 synthesis.  This project will explore ZSM 5 synthesis from RHA in the absence of templating species, i.e., tetrapropylammonium hydroxide or bromide for industrial odor control.  Templating species account for as much as 50% of production cost because of chemical and disposal costs and calcination of the synthesized product.  Preliminary analysis indicates that ZSM 5 derived from RHA and without templating species may cost 1/3 as much as activated carbon and non-RHA ZSM 5.  Further, modified hydrophilic zeolite uses environment unfriendly chemicals for dealumination.    A commercially attractrive new source ZSM 5, i.e., manufactured from RHA, may have a potential for applications in permeable barriers for organic compounds and capture of volatile organic compounds.  This research is expected to ameliorate environmental problems and expand markets in the rice milling industry.        ***",
