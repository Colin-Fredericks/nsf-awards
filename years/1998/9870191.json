 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870191  Patterson    We propose to expand on-going surveys of mammals and birds in Peru's Manu Park and Biosphere Reserve to include collection and study of their associated parasites.  These diverse but under-studied organisms will be surveyed through a collaboration of vertebrate and invertebrate zoologists.  Over three field seasons, we will sample nine evenly-spaced elevations, from 400 to 3600 m, using opportunistic sampling to document as many species as possible at each elevation.  This part of our program relies heavily on diverse methodologies and extensive field experience of our field team.  We will also employ standardized sampling to provide information on relative abundance of vertebrates at each level.  Vertebrates obtained in both sampling programs will be prepared and preserved in ways that maximize their usefulness to both vertebrate and parasite systematics, biogeography, and ecology.  Internet access to database records will expedite communication between vertebrate and parasite researchers, as well as with outside scientists.  Participation of a US graduate student in field, museum, and laboratory work on these collections will afford him/her unique career training on these poorly known invertebrate groups.  Executing this project will also contribute to key training of Peruvian scientists and the sustainable development of their biodiversity resources.           Immediate results should include: (1) uniquely comprehensive collections of vertebrates and their parasite faunas from three distinct Neotropical subregions; (2) numerous new species and genera of various parasites, as well as highly probable discoveries of new mammal and bird species; (3) documentation of distributional, ecological, and host records of both vertebrates and parasites; and (4) baseline inventories for multiple groups in a globally significant biosphere reserve. The collections and  associated information on both vertebrates and parasites will be available within a year of collection for various deri vative studies, including: (5) parasite phylogenetics and biogeography, as well as systematics of their vertebrate hosts; (6) taxonomic congruence among elevational diversity gradients and regions of endemism; and (7) coevolutionary relationships.",
