 "awd_abstract_narration": "9807907  Horodyski  Neuropeptides are important regulatory molecules that control numerous physiological and developmental functions in vertebrates and in invertebrates.  As more information is gained concerning the function and distribution of neuropeptides, it is clear that many of these molecules have multiple biological roles.  The subject of this proposal, Manduca sexta allatotropin (Mas-AT), is an insect neuropeptide that performs a completely different biological function depending on the developmental time.  A crucial unanswered question is how Mas-AT acts on its various target tissues.  Specifically, the pattern of Mas-AT gene expression will be examined by Dr. Horodyski in different tissues throughout development to show how the synthesis of Mas-AT and other peptides may be regulated in different tissues as development proceeds.  An assay will be developed to quantify Mas-AT levels in nervous tissues, gut, and blood during development.  This will allow him to predict the means by which Mas-AT act on its target; whether it is released into the blood as a hormone or whether its acts locally at its site of release from neurosecretory or endocrine cells.  Finally, the synergistic effect of Mas-AT and other identified insect neuropeptides on midgut ion transport will be examined.",
