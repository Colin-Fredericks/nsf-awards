Explanations of the behavior of helpers based on future benefits resulting from their actions, particularly inheritance of the breeding position on the territory on which they help, have enjoyed considerable success when applied to North American species. In this study we test this theory on an Australian bird species. Cooperative breeding is far more common in Australia than anywhere else, so any theory of its origin must apply there to be at all general.  We also compare the biology of the species in fragmented habitat where it is declining to that in intact habitat where it continues to thrive in order to discover the basis of its sensitivity to habitat fragmentation.  Loss of species to habitat fragmentation is a universal problem, whose solution requires a better understanding of the biological basis of sensitivity to fragmentation.\r\n",
