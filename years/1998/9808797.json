 "awd_abstract_narration": "9808797\r\nStephens\r\n\r\nThe bacterial flagellum is an important structure for motility in many bacterial species.  The assembly of the flagellum involves the selective secretion of the components across the cell envelope by a complex pathway that is not fully understood.  In Gram-negative bacteria, a closely related pathway is also used for secretion of virulence factors.  These pathways are collectively termed Type III pathways.  The system for secretion of flagellar components in Gram-negative bacteria includes a pore complex in the cell membrane and one or more protein factors that are necessary to target the secretory proteins to the pore.  The overall objective of this project is to study the Type III pathway for flagellar secretion in Caulobacter crescentus, chosen in part because assembly, which occurs at a precise time during the cell cycle, can be followed in synchronized cultures.  Furthermore, the genes encoding all the components required for secretion by this pathway have been identified in this species.  This project will focus on how one essential component, FliI protein, is involved at the cellular and molecular level.  The working hypothesis is that FliI, which has no extensive hydrophobic domains to suggest it is a membrane protein, binds selectively to flagellar proteins in the cytoplasm and delivers them to the pore complex composed of several other elements of the Type III system.  Since FliI is also an ATPase, this protein may also provide the energy for translocation of the flagellar subunits across the membrane.  The first specific aim of the study is to define by mutational and biochemical analyses those sites in the FliI molecule that are necessary for its transport function, ATPase activity, and stability.  A second aim is to use suppressor analysis and co-immunoprecipitation as methods to identify other proteins of the Type-III pathway with which FliI interacts and then to characterize the binding.  The third specific aim is a collaborative effort to study the subcellular localization of FliI by immunofluorescence light microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy.  The studies are designed to involve 2-4 undergraduates each year in the various subprojects as a means to introduce these students to scientific research.\r\n\r\n",
