There are many research groups eager to have a student working with them for the summer, however, we expect that most students will join an experimental team associated with the very strong U.S. involvement in the LHC program, and in the ATLAS and CMS experiments in particular.  After an orientation week in the \r\nU.S., students will be sent to CERN where they will join the highly successful CERN Summer Student Program which has been available to European students each summer for many years.  This program involves not only membership of an active research team, but also a series of lectures on a variety of science topics - in particular both theoretical and experimental particle physics and particle detection techniques.  The special environment offered by CERN will allow the students to experience an international social and cultural dimension to their education in addition to the more formal physics research experience.\r\n***",
