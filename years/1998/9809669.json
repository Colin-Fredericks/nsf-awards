 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds a workshop on Shape Computation.  This event continues discussions began at an   earlier event on the same set of topics sponsored by UCLA in  May of 1997.Shape computation is focused   on the study and application of shape grammars.  Shape grammers were developed originally to compute   with shapes directly in pen and pencil, paper drawings and physical models, with no requirement for   intermediate stmbolic structures or abstract representations.  The approach is novel in that shape    grammars possibly allow for any arrngement of spatial elements (points, curves, surfaces, and  solids) to be seen and interpreted in many ways within a fixed computational scheme - shapes can be   divided into parts at any time within a computation.  Shape grammars have been successful in furthering   the process of design in many topical areas.  This workshop will concentrate on theoretical refinements,   computer implementation, applications in design sciences and applications in library and information   sciences.",
