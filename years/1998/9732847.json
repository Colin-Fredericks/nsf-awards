This \"poling\" process is in fact essential to the achievement of a macroscopically observable piezoelectric effect.  With respect to the emerging thin-film applications of integrated ferroelectric films ranging from nonvolatile memory to chemical sensors to piezoelectric microvalves, the understanding and manipulation of poling effects is limited at present to the manipulation of 1800 domain boundaries.  Other potentially important poling effects, including control of as-deposited film texture, thermally-assisted manipulation of non-1800 ferroelastic domain boundaries, and field-driven phase changes leading to shape memory behavior, have received comparatively scant attention.  It is the primary goal of the proposed research to elucidate, model and manipulate the distribution of spontaneous electrical dipoles in ferroelectric films and to understand the relationships between poling behavior, properties (ferroelectric and piezoelectric) and device performance.    With regard to poling, the primary differences between thin films and bulk ceramics are 1) the biaxial in-plane mechanical clamping effect of the substrate, 2) the much smaller grains in thin films, 3) the grain-shape anisotropy and crystallographic texture of thin films, and 4) the higher electrical breakdown fields of most thin films.            The following scientific objectives will be pursued: - Evaluate and model the combined effects of temperature and electric field on the manipulation of spontaneous polarization in Pb-based perovskite ferroelectric films  e.g., Pb(Zr,Ti)03 or PZT as a function of the degree and type of mechanical clamping. Determine the role of crystallographic texture on domain structure, poling behavior and properties.  Model and demonstrate poling via electric-field-driven phase transformations and the associated shape memory effects.  These objectiv es will be addressed by experiments that employ  PZT/metallic oxide/template/substrate combinations designed to yield ferroelectric films with microstructures ranging from nominally monocrystalline to uniaxially(fiber)-textured to random polycrystalline.  The effect of mechanical clamping will be explored by comparing the same prototype device structures before and after substrate removal.  Electric-field-driven poling effects will be investigated as a function of temperature by hysteresis measurements and in situ transmission electron microscopy.  Finally, the understanding attained by these investigations will be applied to the design and fabrication of prototype memory, sensing and actuation devices, with emphasis on both the initial device performance, and the role of microstructure on the reliability and stability of the devices.  The involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in projects that span the fundamental science to the device prototype under the constraints of manufacturability will prepare students for future careers in materials integration for functionally-enhanced Microsystems.    The Principal Investigator and his students have access to the facilities necessary to perform pulsed laser deposition, sputtering, four-circle x-ray diffraction, electrical testing, transmission electron microscopy (in situ, analytical and high-resolution), electron-beam lithography and all processes required for CMOS Si and Si-surface micromachining. These facilities are located in the Principal Investigator's laboratory and in the shared facilities of the Integrated Materials Laboratory (IML), the Berkeley Microfabrication Laboratory, The National Center for Electron Microscopy (NCEM/LBNL) and the Berkeley Sensor & Actuator Center (BSAC).  ***",
