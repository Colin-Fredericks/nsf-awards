The PIs' have shown that  1)  strong   directional  selection  occurs  within  hybrid   populations   that  eliminates  Mytilus  edulis  and  M.  edulis-like  hybrids,  2)  directional  selection  is offset by immigration from pure populations of M.  edulis,  3)  the  balance  between dispersal and selection is presently  stable,  and  4)  hybridization has been an important feature in the evolutionary  history  of  these  species. These studies focus future research in a new direction:  the  primary  issue  in  understanding the dynamics of this  hybrid  zone  is  to  determine  how pure populations of M. edulis are maintained. The maintenance  of pure populations of Mytilus edulis is an essential element of the dynamic  equilibrium  between dispersal and directional selection that maintains  and  shapes this hybrid zone.         The  PI  will  propose  to test the hypothesis that  M.  edulis  has  a  superior physiological capacity to cope with silt in its diet and that  pure  populations  of  this  species  are  selectively  maintained  in   estuarine  environments  where  silt  concentrations  are  high.  This  hypothesis  was  suggested  by  the  observation  that pure  populations  of  M.  edulis  are  associated with estuaries that have high silt loads and preliminary  results  from  separate studies that indicate that M. edulis may have a much  greater  absorption  efficiencies when exposed to diet containing high concentrations  of  silt.  The  PI will also propose a combination of laboratory  and  field  experiments  to test this hypothesis. Laboratory experiments will  test  for  the   proposed   physiological  differences  between  M.   edulis   and   M.  galloprovincialis while the field experiments are necessary  to  demonstrate  that these differ ences have significant consequences in nature.",
