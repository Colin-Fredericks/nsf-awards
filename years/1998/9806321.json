 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  CTS-9806321  Estella Blaisten-Barojas, George Mason University     It was observed that an inorganic precipitate (Dogtooth Spar) absorbed at the air-water interface bifurcates into two aggregation structures.  One structure develops into a two-dimensional fractal gel previously identified in literature, and another self-organizes into a two-dimensional colloidal periodic structure (lattice) of crystals that was observed for the first time by the P.I.  The new crystals have a distorted tetrahedral shape, do not aggregate, and spontaneously may arrange into the periodic structure.  The main focus of the project is the clarification of the conditions under which self-organization occurs, characterize the crystals formed at the air-water interface, and understanding the role of crystallites in the respective fractal growth at the air-water interface.  The P.I. proposed an initial model that includes the repulsive electrostatic forces and attractive capillary forces.  If this model is true, then the observed self-organization could be achieved in other systems.   Video microscopy and crystal interaction models will be used in the investigation.     If successful, the project will clarify a self-organizing mechanism with relevance to colloidal science and materials synthesis.  ***",
