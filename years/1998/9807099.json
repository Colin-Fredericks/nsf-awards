 "awd_abstract_narration": "9807099  Kodama    This grant provides partial support for the cost of acquiring a  sensitive magnetic susceptibility/anisotropy system for the  paleomagnetics laboratory at Lehigh University.  The addition of  the susceptibility/anisotropy system at Lehigh University will  allow sensitive measurements of magnetic susceptibility and  anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) by the PI (Kodama)  and his graduate students. These data will be important for  developing a technique to identify and correct inclination  shallowing of chemical remanent magnetizations (CRM) carried by  hematite in red beds. Detailed AMS measurements of natural red  bed samples and CRMs produced in the laboratory will be used in  conjunction with remanence anisotropy measurements to determine  empirical and test theoretical relationships between AMS and  remanence anisotropy. The results will be used to understand the  cause of anomalously shallow inclinations observed in Tertiary  and Cretaceous red beds from central Asia. AMS measurements will  also be important to a study initiated recently of the Nanaimo  Group sediments in Vancouver. The anomalously shallow  inclinations in these rocks have been used to provide support for  the Baja British Columbia hypothesis of major terrane motions  along the western margin of North America.  ***",
