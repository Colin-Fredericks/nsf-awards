 "awd_abstract_narration": "9871980  Koch    The focus of this research is to develop artifact-free  nanocrystalline materials by electrodeposition.  Electrochemical parameters that control the grain size and  chemistry of copper and zinc nanocrystalline films are a  central theme of the research.  The effects of chemical  addition agents to the bath and the waveform of a periodic,  pulsed-current deposition are studied.  For comparison  purposes selected nanocrystalline samples are also prepared  by mechanical attrition followed by powder compaction and by  pulsed-laser ablation.  Closely coupled with these  processing studies is atomic level characterization of the  nanocrystalline grain-boundary structure and chemistry using  high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and  analytical electron microscopy to provide feedback on the  effects of processing variables.  A goal of the synthesis  and characterization studies is the processing of the  nanocrystalline metals with a range of grain sizes from  about 2 to 50 nm and the introduction of nanodispersoids at  1 to 10 volume percent.  Into each nanocrystalline metal  \"hard\" and \"soft\" (polystyrene) nanodispersoids are  introduced during the electrodeposition process.  This  provides unique model systems to determine mechanical  properties as a function of nanocrystalline grain size, test  temperature, and strain rate.  The influence of the  nanoscale dispersoids on mechanical deformation and shear  banding is of special interest.  The data obtained should  allow us to construct better models for the deformation and  fracture behavior of nanocrystalline materials.  This award  is a selection under the NSF 98-20 initiative on Functional  Nanocrystalline Materials.  %%%  In comparison to more conventional means to prepare  nanocrystalline metals (e.g., gas phase condensation or  mechanical attrition), electrodeposition has the following  advantages: i) it is a relatively simple operation with low-  cost equipment; ii) dense, void-free deposits can be  prepared directly  without need for consolidation; iii)  current or plating-bath chemistry may be used to control  grain size, and hence properties, of the nanocrystalline  deposit; and iv) nanocomposites with unique properties can  be formed by codeposition of nanoparticulates within the  metal matrix.  ***",
