 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9801189   Allred    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will investigate the design, fabrication, and operation of a pilot-scale reactor and associated subsystems and the economics of recycling automotive feedstock.  A need exists for a cost-effective method for recycling scrap automotive plastic and composite materials. A promising approach for these complex mixtures is tertiary recycling. The tertiary recycling process cracks polymers into a mixture of low molecular weight hydrocarbons that are removed as a gas.  The gas is then condensed into liquid chemicals, monomers, and fuels. Remaining metals, fibers, and fillers are further separated for reuse.  An economic model for tertiary recycling of auto shredder residue prepared in Phase I shows the process to be highly profitable with an internal rate of return of 58%.  Conversion products and potential markets will be identified and separation processes developed. Throughout the Phase II program, data for a refined economic model of the overall recycling process will be collected, including scrap volumes and locations, processing costs, product markets and locations, and product values. The final tasks will incorporate the results of the Phase II program into a design for a commercial recycling plant and an estimate the economics of the process on a commercial scale.  An economic analysis of the process for recycling of scrap automotive plastics and composites to be used in the commercial development of the system in Phase II will conclude the Phase II project.    Successful results will lead to an economical, large-scale commercial tertiary recycling system for scrap automotive materials that are currently landfilled. These machines will also find worldwide use by municipalities, government installations, and industry for processing other plastic waste streams such as municipal plastic waste, scrap electronics and medical wastes.  ***",
