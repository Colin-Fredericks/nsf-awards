University of Denver    MRI: Development of State-of-the-Art Instrumentation for Advanced Distributed Computing Systems for Research and Research Training    This proposal outlines the development of a major state-of-the-art instrumentation for research/reserach training as well as integrated research/education within the departments of Engineering, Mathematics/Computer Science, and Chemistry at the University of Denver.  In particular, the proposed research instrumentation, identified in this proposal, deals with the development and construction of a High Distributed and Parallel Computing Engine composed of a cluster of advanced workstations (6) and a collection of multiprocessor PC-class machines (10) connected by a fast 16-port ATM switch.  The proposed instrumentation will support projects in several areas including: the design, study and application of distributed/parallel systems; application of 3D medical imaging and visualization; autonomous navigation of distrubuted intelligent multi-agents in unstructured and unpredictable environments; interactive distributed systems and networks and their relation to human perception and reasoning; electromagnetic digital calculations; simulation of large neural networks with application to Alzheimer's disease; electron high frequency structure simulation and calculation for electron paramagnetic resonance in paramagnetic images; numerical heat transfer; numerical stress and field calculation; and modeling and simulation of optoelectronic devices and optical systems.",
