 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is directed at enhancement of the undergraduate botany curriculum in the Biology Department at Western Washington University. A key feature of this effort is the development of a new course designed to encourage scientific inquiry, stimulate interest, and illustrate the scientific process, even as it teaches contemporary methods in plant developmental biology, including morphometric, cellular, biochemical, and molecular genetic techniques. This course, 'Projects in Plant Development'(Biol 453), is built around four modules of related lab skills, each used to address an 'original', open-ended question.  Additional goals are to improve the laboratory segment of Introductory Botany (Biol 203) by adding more quantitative exercises, and to update the Plant Physiology (Biol 479) laboratory, with a focus on investigating the principles of photosynthesis with modern instrumentation, using isolated chloroplasts and whole plants. These revisions are expected to better represent the many dimensions of the discipline, from organismal to cellular, and the several scientific approaches commonly employed, from the more reductionist analyses to whole plant studies.  New instrumentation would allow the formulation of more effective pedagogical approaches, and make it feasible to accommodate an expanded, and more contemporary, experimental repertoire. Support is sought for instruments that fall under three broad categories: image analysis software, photosynthesis measuring devices, and equipment for protein and nucleic acid analysis.",
