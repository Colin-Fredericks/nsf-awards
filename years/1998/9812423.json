 "awd_abstract_narration": "This facilities improvement project will support a new  generation of more up-to-date general use fire equipment  for Archbold Biological Station. Archbold supports  research and education by providing access to study areas  and organisms on its 2,000 ha globally significant  scrub preserve, one of the most distinctive regions in  the U.S.  This remnant xeric ecosystem lies  on a narrow, north-south ridge of relict, sandy dunes  running down the center of the Florida peninsula.  It is characterized by endemic shrubby scrubs, with  adaptations to droughty, nutrient-poor sandy soils. Fire  is the dominant ecosystem process in scrub, with extremely  high intensity, patchy, variable fire behavior.  Archbold  provides experimental manipulation, through large and  small-scale prescribed fire, to test hypotheses about  ecological responses to fire.  The prescribed fire program  has made Archbold one of the most exciting and productive  field stations for studying fire ecology.  The entire  scrub ecosystem at Archbold is fire-dependent, and  virtually all research relies on an active and effective  prescribed fire program.  Prescribed grassland fires at  the MacArthur Agro-ecology Research Center, a major  division of Archbold at a 4,200 ha cattle ranch, are  Archbold established in 1941, is a not-for-profit  independent research facility in central Florida,  dedicated to long-term ecological research.  Staff,  visiting investigators, and students conduct research  primarily focused on the organisms and environments of the  Lake Wales Ridge and adjacent central Florida.  Areas of  research strength include ecology and conservation  biology, in particular long-term processes.  A major  emphasis is the relationship between species and fire as  an ecosystem process.",
