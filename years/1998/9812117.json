This meeting is in response to recommendations that appear in the 1988 PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORKSHOP ON THE PRESENT STATUS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY AND MATERIALS, and in particular to \"a long term goal in synthesis in solid state chemistry to make materials by design: e.g. to make what is wanted instead of seeing what can be made.\"  NSF will support two female invited speakers, and 10 grants to facilitate the participation of graduate students, postdocs, and/or junior faculty.\r\n%%%\r\nThe rapidly emerging and changing field of solid-state chemistry and materials has undergone explosive growth over the past decade both in academic and industrial labsoratories.  Part of this trend is due to the discovery of new materials with important technoligical applications.\r\n***\r\n",
