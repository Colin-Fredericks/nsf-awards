 "awd_abstract_narration": "9806848  McHugh    The goal of this research project is to decipher the evolutionary  relationships among the  polychaete annelid orders Terebellida and  Sabellida, so that historical patterns of change in larval development can  be examined in this group.  The orders Terebellida and Sabellida together  form one of the most diverse and best known groups of polychaete annelid  worms for which larval developmental modes have been well-characterized.  They provide an excellent opportunity to address some fundamental questions  regarding the evolution of larval development in marine invertebrates,  because both feeding (planktotrophic) and non-feeding (lecithotrophic)  larvae occur in this group of worms.          I will use nuclear (elongation factor-1a and RNA polymerase II) and  mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase I) DNA sequence data to analyze the  phylogenetic relationships of the Terebellida and Sabellida.  Drawing on  the results of the phylogenetic analyses, the ancestral mode of larval  development will be inferred, and the frequency and direction of changes  among lecithotrophy, opposed-band planktotrophy, and non-metatrochal  planktotrophy throughout the history of the group will be examined.          The results of the phylogenetic analysis will provide the basis for  a re-classification of the Terebellida and Sabellida.  Character  optimization on the phylogeny will provide insights into the evolution of  larval developmental modes.  If it is shown that the opposed-band  trochophore of serpulids has been derived from an ancestor for which  non-feeding larval development is inferred, then homology of the  trochophore among spiralian phyla, a character upon which theories of early  animal evolution hinge, must be re-evaluated; if derived planktotrophy has  arisen more than once in the Terebellida and Sabellida, then arguments that  functional constraints on larval feeding have led to multiple parallelism  may be supported.",
