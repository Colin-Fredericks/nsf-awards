The nuclear protein encoded by the suppressor of sable gene (su(s)) is the focus of this work.  Su(s) protein binds to RNA and regulates the processing of mutant transcripts of several genes, including the vermilion (v) gene.  The mutant v transcripts are degraded in wild-type flies and stabilized in su(s) mutants.  Although the instability of these transcripts is related to their being poor substrates for splicing, it has not been established whether Su(s) functions directly in splicing, RNA degradation or another process.  Evidence has been obtained that Su(s) regulates processing of normal transcripts and must be present at a particular level for normal viability of Drosophila.  There are two main objectives of this proposal.  (1) Two functional domains of the protein will be characterized by in vitro mutagenesis of su(s) coding sequences, and analysis of the function of the altered protein derivatives after germline transformation.  One domain that will be studied is the RNA binding domain, and the other is a zinc-finger motif of unknown function.  (2) The mechanism by which su(s) regulates RNA processing will be further examined.  Potential candidates of regulation by su(s) have been identified, and RNAs produced by these genes will be examined in su(s) wild type and mutant flies.  In addition, nine new in vitro mutagenized derivatives of a v allele that is known to be regulated by su(s) have been made and transformed into flies for RNA analysis.\r\n\r\nThis work will contribute to the understanding of how the fidelity of pre-mRNA processing is maintained and how aberrant RNAs are targeted for degradation.  Furthermore, the analysis of functional domains of Su(s) will provide information of value to scientists studying proteins that regulate growth and development and that have similar structural features.\r\n",
