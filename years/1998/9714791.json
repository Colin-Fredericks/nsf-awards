 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) will develop an  exciting model program designed to interest girls and young  women in science.  Operated in partnership with the Girl  Scout Council of Greater New York, the program will build on  a highly successful pilot project to reach over 6,000 girls  throughout New York City over the grant period and thousands  more thereafter.    The Wildlife Science Careers Program will enjoy the full  support of the WCS's professional staff, which includes  environmental educators, animal curators, animal keepers,  veterinarians, conservation biologists, field scientists,  wildlife nutritionists, exhibit designers, and others, many  of whom are women.  Participating Girl Scouts will meet  these professionals, observe them at work, engage them in  dialogue, take part in hands-on projects, and experience  first-hand the excitement and dedication involved in working  for the survival of endangered species and natural habitats.    The three-year program will consist of five main components:  (1) Five-day Wildlife Science Career Workshops at the Bronx  Zoo for 315 Cadette Girl Scouts (ages 12 5o 14) that will  introduce them to careers in the wildlife sciences and  conservation biology; (2) Field experience for the  participating Cadettes at the WCS's four other facilities  (The Aquarium for Wildlife Conservation and the Wildlife  Centers of Central Park, Prospect Park and Queens), through  which the girls will engage in science exploration  activities and meet additional role models in science; (3)  Two-day training seminars for the Cadettes that will provide  them with the skills and materials to conduct career and  science awareness workshops for troops of younger Girl  Scouts, enabling the Cadettes to meet the requirements  necessary to become Girl Scout Program Aides; (4) Two-day  leadership training courses for 36 Girl Scout Leaders that  will enable them to oversee the progress of the  participating Cadettes and to continue key program  components after the co nclusion of the grant period; and (5)  An internship program for fifty Senior Girl Scouts (ages 14  to 17), who successfully complete the training workshops as  Cadettes to become Program Aides, that will give them the  opportunity to work side-by-side with scientists and other  professional staff in the WCS's five facilities.    The proposed Wildlife Science Careers Program represents a  unique means of increasing the participation level of girls  and young women in science.  Utilizing a non-competitive,  single-sex approach, the program will capitalize on the  enthusiasm children and young adults have for visiting  informal science centers, such as zoos, to engage the  interest of girls and young women in science learning and  careers.  Informal science institutions and Girl Scout  Councils have an important role to play in advancing the  interest, understanding and skills of women in science, and  in the proposed project, the WCS has developed an exciting  model that has the potential to be replicated nationwide.",
