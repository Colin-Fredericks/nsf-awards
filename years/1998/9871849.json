 "awd_abstract_narration": "9871849  Metiu    We plan to synthesize and assemble dilute magnetic semiconductor  nanostructures and study their transport and optical properties  by using near field optical microscopy.  It is well known that by  reducing the size of a semiconductor structure we can affect and  control the properties of the electrons in it.  We know  practically nothing about the way in which this size reduction  affects the magnetic properties of these systems, even though we  expect these effects to be considerable.  We will prepare  nanocrystalline \"dots\" of II-VI semiconductor doped with divalent  transition metal ions with magnetic properties (Mn(II), Cr(II),  Fe(II) and Cu(II) ).  We can thus study the effect of confinement  on the exchange interactions and the magneto-optical properties  of these materials.  We plan to use a near field microscope to  perform femtosecond and cw studies of the magneto-optical  properties of individual dots and to determine how these  properties depend on dot sizes.  We also plan to create ensembles  of such dots so that we can study the collective effects created  by the interaction between the dots.  One of our most important  tools is the near field optical microscope.  This is a wonderful  tool with many exciting uses, but the quantitative interpretation  of the measurements is hampered by the lack of a quantitative  theory of the electromagnetic fields produced in the structure  being studied.  We propose to develop new theoretical methods for  solving this problem.  %%%  The kind of studies proposed here are motivated by the need of  making smaller electronic devices and denser computer memories.  As the elements of these devices become smaller the properties of  the electrons in them are being modified.  We cannot design these  devices if we cannot anticipate and understand how the electrons  in them will behave.  Our work hopes to fill this gap in our  understanding.  The ultimate computer will be a device in which  the electrons themselves are computing elements.   The main  candidates right now are systems in which various spin states are  being excited, since they maintain the information imparted to  them (coherence) for the longest time.  This is one additional  reason why the study of spin behavior in small structures may  impact future technologies. \r\n\r\nThis award is being supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities; the Division of Materials Research, Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences; and the Division of Electrical and Communications Systems, Directorate for Engineering.***",
