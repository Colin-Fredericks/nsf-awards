Previous work in several invertebrate and vertebrate  systems has shown that the networks generating rhythmic movements are  functionally flexible. That is, the same neuronal ensemble generates  distinct rhythmic motor patterns when influenced by different  neuromodulatory inputs. We do not fully understand how any individual  motor pattern is selected for activation from such a network. Motor  pattern selection, however, is likely involve the coactivation of  distinct inputs from higher centers. This and related issues regarding  motor pattern selection are readily addressed in the stomatogastric  nervous system. This is a very well-characterized model system that  contains a set of distinct but interacting networks that generate the  motor patterns underlying rhythmic contractions of striated foregut  muscles involved in the ingestion, chewing and processing of food. As  is true for all rhythmically active networks, these networks can still  operate in the completely isolated nervous system, where all  experiments will be performed. The working hypothesis is that motor  pattern selection from a multifunctional neuronal network results in  part from different input pathways (i.e.- different sensory systems)  having distinct effects on overlapping subsets of modulatory projection  neurons. To examine the validity of this hypothesis, we proposed to  examine whether: (1) different input pathways evoke different motor  patterns from the same network; (2) these different input pathways  activate different subsets of projection neurons that influence this  network; (3) different co-transmitters released by an identified  sensory neuron are used to influence spatially separate neuronal  targets, and (4) an individual sensory pathway exhibits an activity-  dependent compartmentalization of action. Combining   electrophysiological, pharmacological and anatomical approaches will  attain these aims. This proposed study will provide novel physiological  information regarding how the nervous system selects different motor  patterns from a multifunctional neuronal network. This will be a  valuable model for comparable but less accessible events occurring in  the numerically more complex vertebrate nervous system. It will also  provide extensive technical and intellectual training for pre- and post-  doctoral students interested in the functional organization of the  central nervous system.",
