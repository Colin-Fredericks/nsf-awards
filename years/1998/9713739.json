 "awd_abstract_narration": "9713739  Jones  This project is to conduct the analysis of wind load and  structural resistance data from the Town of Southern Shores  (North Carolina) low-rise training facility structure.  With the  support of Project Blue Sky-developed by the Town of Southern  Shores and funded through FEMA and industrial sponsors-the- PI is  installing a full-scale measurement system in the Pitts Training  Center. The System will record the wind environment, pressures,  and structural responses for a multi-year period.    The analysis of the collected data will be made using state-of-  the-art procedures, and the tailoring and further development of  those procedures to the wind engineering context.  Specifically,  in addition to routine statistical analyses, the wavelet  transform will be used as a fundamental tool to improve  understanding of the physical processes involved in bluff-body  aerodynamics.  In addition, it is envisioned that these  techniques will improve our ability to model wind loads on bluff  structures through he use of wind tunnel techniques.    If the structure experiences Atlantic storms over the next two-  year period, the likelihood that high-quality data will be  collected under strong- (up to hurricane-) wind conditions is  high.  These data will be unique, and potentially will provide  insights into wind loading on low-rise structures that  have  heretofore been impossible.  ***",
