 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870710  DeLisi       This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training  (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a broadly-  based graduate training program in computational science and  bioinformatics that emphasizes computational approaches to  diverse biological problems, including functional and  structural genomics, bioinformatics, neuroscience and cell  motility. The program will be a joint effort of 26 faculty  drawn from the Departments of Biology, Biomedical Engineering,  Chemistry, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mathematics  and Pharmacology, whose research interests reflect skill in  both mathematics and experimental science.  NSF support will  provide stipends for 14 graduate students each year, and for  related costs of student research training.  Educational  opportunities will require that the graduate students have or  acquire basic knowledge of molecular biology and biochemistry,  developmental biology, computation and databases.  Advanced  coursework will be offered in areas as varied as molecular  evolution, biomechanics and engineering systems analysis.  Short tutorials will train students in the use and  modification of computer software and hardware needed for data  visualization and analysis.  The training program will offer  weekly seminars and evening research discussions, and will  host two national workshops devoted to leading edge scientific  or technological issues in computational biology. The training  program will include thesis research supervised by two  mentors, training in written and oral communication, visits to  industrial research labs and opportunities for extended  industrial internships.  Students will be recruited through  varied efforts including, in addition to standard avenues, the  use of the Science Engineering and Math Academic Support  Network of the New England Board of Higher Education and the  hosting of an annual, week-long workshop in databases and  software for teachers from 15-20 small colleges and  universities.  Th e progress of the program will be monitored  by an external advisory committee of distinguished industrial  and academic scientists that meets annually.       IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program whose goal is to sponsor  the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate  programs that will train a diverse group of new scientists and  engineers to be well-prepared for varied careers in the  private and public sectors.  IGERT provides an opportunity for  the development of new, well-focused multidisciplinary  programs that bridge traditional organizational barriers,  uniting faculty from several departments or institutions to  establish a highly-interactive collaborative environment for  both training and research.  In its first year, the program  will provide support to 17 institutions for new or nascent  programs that collectively span all areas of science,  engineering and mathematics eligible for support by the NSF.",
