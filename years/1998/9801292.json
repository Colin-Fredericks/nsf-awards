 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award was made as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research. The project investigates a possible link between cortisol and inhibitory or effortful control in young children. The PI (G. Kochanska) studies effortful control, self-regulation, affectivity, and temperament in young children. The co-PI (M. Gunnar) studies the role of cortisol in behavioral adaptation and its impact on the central nervous system and behavior. The two investigators will link their programs of research to study whether dysregulation of the daily rhythm in cortisol, and/or elevated cortisol responses to stressors might be related to poor inhibitory control in preschool children. Repeated assessments of cortisol levels (derived from samples of saliva) will be related to childrens' inhibitory/effortful control, also measured repeatedly over time. Preliminary data indicate that children who score consistently low on inhibitory control competencies over the preschool years show a marked suppression of the first morning cortisol values compared to other children. As a result, the daily rhythm in cortisol production is dampened in these children. It is not known whether the childrens' poor inhibitory control abilities preceded or followed the alteration in their daily cortisol rhythm. This project is designed to gain further insight into this relationship between glucocorticoids and attention regulation and inhibitory control.",
