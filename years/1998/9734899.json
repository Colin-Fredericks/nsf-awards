The frequency of these failures  can be  reduced by improved geotechnical site investigation prior to  construction.  The objective of the proposed study is to  investigate  and demonstrate the use of resistivity methods to increase  the  reliability of foundation design in karst areas with clay  soils.    At the present time, methods of site investigation in karst  areas with  clay soils are generally limited to borings and other types  of  intrusive probes.  The reliability of these methods for  locating  conditions which may lead to the formation of sinkholes is  poor.  The  research activities in this study will evaluate the  reliability of the  earth resistivity method as a tool for site investigation in  these  areas and demonstrate its use as a method to improve  foundation  reliability.    In this study, two areas of known subsurface voids and  frequent  sinkhole formation will be investigated.  Line surveys at a  number of  different spacings will be conducted using an earth  resistivity meter  with multiple electrodes.  Anomalies indicated by the data  will be  confirmed using boring methods or excavation.  The results  of the  testing will be used to develop relationships between line  and node  spacing and the probability of detecting an anomaly of a  given size.  ***",
