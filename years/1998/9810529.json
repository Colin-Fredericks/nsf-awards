 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This award is for the support of a collaborative research project between Dr. Steve Granick, Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois in Urbana/Champaign, and Dr. A. Levent Demirel, Assistant Professor of Chemistry at Koc University in Istanbul, Turkey.  The two scientists plan to study the role of polymer-solid interfacial interactions by direct quantitative measurement of interfacial rheology, relating measurements on model systems (at the University of Illinois) with more practical measurements of systems of more immediate practical importance (at Koc University).  Variables of interest include polymer molecular weight, degree of crystallinity, and intensity of polymer-filler attraction.   Scope: The problems to be addressed in this research are relevant to a wide range of practical problems in polymer processing and polymer structure-property relations.  This project will enable the researchers from the US and Turkey to work in each other's laboratories.  It fulfils the objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Turkey to combine complimentary talents and conduct research in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.  The US and the Turkish collaborators have track records of prior successful international collaboration.  This project is funded jointly by the Division of International Programs, the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems and the Division of Material Research.",
