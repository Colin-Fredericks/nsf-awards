The Education Development Center (EDC) working in collaboration with Wheelock College, Lesley College, the Boston Public Schools, and the Educational Collaborative for Greater Boston and national field test sites, will develop, pilot, field test, publish, and disseminate instructional materials and facilitator's guides to support school and district administrators' learning about issues in mathematics education reform.       The project seeks to involve 520 K-8 administrators and will create two 42-hour graduate courses entitled: Administrative Issues in Implementing New Mathematics Curricula and Teacher Supervision in Elementary Mathematics.  The project has plans to link with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), the National Council of Supervisors of Mathematics (NCSM) and the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD).  The courses are designed for university-based principal certification programs or as advanced courses for practicing administrators.  Course modules are for use by school districts or regional service providers.  A unique feature of this project is its focus on providing school and district administrators with the knowledge and tools to support teachers implementing reform-based mathematics initiatives and in helping communities to understand and support mathematics education reform.",
