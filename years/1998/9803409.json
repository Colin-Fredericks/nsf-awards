The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and  experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-four-month postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Henry L. Miller, Jr. to work with Dr.  Daniel S. McKenna at the Institute for Stratospheric  Chemistry in Julich, Germany.    Dr. Miller will use satellite temperature observations,  coupled with a three-dimensional stratospheric chemical  model to quantitatively validate model results with the  observation of ozone depletion trends, particularly in the  northern mid-latitudes.  Model runs can be used to examine  the likely future effects of variations in temperature on  the northern mid-latitude ozone column.  These theoretical  examinations can increase the understanding of global  warming.    A three-dimensional model called the Chemical Lagrangian  Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) is being developed at the  Institute for Stratospheric Chemistry.  This will provide a  framework within which the effects of small-scale  temperature fluctuations can be examined.  *  *  *",
