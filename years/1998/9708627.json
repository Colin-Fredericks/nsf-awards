 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708627  Sause    This project is part of the third phase of a coordinated  program of research on Precast Seismic Structural Systems  (PRESSS).  The PRESSS program, funded by the National  Science Foundation has two goals:  (1) to develop new  materials, concepts, and technologies for precast concrete  construction in seismic zones; and (2) to develop  comprehensive and rational design recommendations for  precast concrete construction in seismic zones.  The first  two phases of the PRESSS program are near completion.  He  remaining work to be done to achieve these objectives is the  testing of a large-scale precast structure design according  to preliminary design recommendations and analyzed using  models developed in the earlier phases of PRESSS program.    The PRESSS Phase III program requires three components to  achieve these objectives: (1) design studies; (2) analytical  studies; and (3) superassemblage tests.  Englekirk and  Nakaki, Inc. and the University of Washington will conduct  design studies, Leigh University will conduct analytical  studies, and the University of California, San Diego will  conduct experiments on the five story superassembage test  structure.    The objectives of the Leigh University component this  project of the PRESSS Phase III program are: (1) to use  nonlinear static analysis to predict the monotonic and  cyclic lateral force displacement behavior of prototype  buildings, and to assess this behavior of the five-story  superassemblage test structure using nonlinear dynamic  analysis, and assess the behavior; (3) to compare the  predicted performance and the experimental performance and  assess the models and methods used in the analytical  prediction; and (4) to develop design recommendations for  precast seismic structural systems.  Analytical models of  precast structures developed at Lehigh will be used.  The  dynamic analysis will use a set of earthquake ground motions  representing various site characteristics compiled at  Lehigh.  Comparisons with the  performance of the prototype  buildings anticipated in design, and with the experimentally  observed performance of  the five-story superassemblage test  structure will be made.  The analytical studies will be  carefully coordinated with the Phase III design studies and  superassemblage tests.",
