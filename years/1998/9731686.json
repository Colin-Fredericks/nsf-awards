 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731686  Trussell      An understanding of junctional mechanisms at synapses is a  central issue in basic neuroscience. It is also central to  understanding many pathological conditions of the nervous  system, since pharmacological treatments of nervous  illnesses usually target some aspect of synaptic  transmission.  The current intense interest in long-term  modification to synaptic strength as a model for memory also  depends on a thorough understanding of synaptic  transmission.  The award will support U.S. participation in  an intensive workshop on current progress and new directions  in synaptic transmission.  The principal organizers are  Professors Laurence Trussell of the Department of  Physiology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Stephan  Redman of the Department of Neuroscience, Australian  National  University.  The workshop will be held Jan 2427th,  1998, in Thredbo, Australia and supported, in part, by the  Australian Department of Industry, Science, and Technology  (DIST).  It will involve eight senior researchers from  Germany, Israel, England, and the United States in addition  to seventeen senior researchers from Australia.  The U.S. team will consist of four senior researchers and  eight promising young U.S. graduate students and  postdoctoral fellows who will interact with Australian  students postdocs, and faculty.  Bringing these senior and  junior researchers to this workshop will help foster new  opportunities for U.S./Australian scientific cooperation.  Moreover, it will provide a means for the relatively  isolated Australian students and younger faculty to interact  with scientists in their field from around the world.",
