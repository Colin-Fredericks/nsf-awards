 "awd_abstract_narration": "Avila College proposes a series of exciting summer programs annually  providing nine undergraduates with research experiences in tropical  studies. Participants will learn and develop skills by interacting with  faculty as they work on projects dealing with herpetological communities on  Hispaniola. To foster student development, a 3-phase program is planned:  orientation -- introducing students to research methodology and ecological  studies in the West Indies; apprenticeship- developing skills; and  individual research -- resulting in publication-quality reports. Seminars  on research and graduate studies are included to facilitate applications of  acquired knowledge and skills to participants' future academic pursuits.  Presentations will be made by scientists in both the United States and  Dominican Republic. Evaluation will be by participants, their academic  advisors, and one outside faculty member not involved directly with the  program.    This program is designed to induce participants to favorably consider  graduate studies and to increase the likelihood of their choosing careers  in science. The faculty will \"coach\" students, instilling a vision of  research by explaining the rules and delivering a feeling of the excitement  that comes with addressing hypothesis-driven questions with conceptual  orientations.    A focus on frog and lizard communities provides opportunities to apply  theories and methods widely used in ecological research while working with  organisms that are abundant, accessible, and remarkably well and visibly  adapted to their environment. Investigations will address aspects of niche  dimensions and/or conservation issues. Students may choose projects within  these topics or develop investigations of their own, including, but not  limited to, physiological or ethological studies of selected taxa.",
