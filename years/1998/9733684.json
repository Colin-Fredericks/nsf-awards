 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project emphasizes the use of multibody dynamic  modeling as a tool for designing complex dynamic systems via  low-order dynamic simulation algorithms, parallel computing,  and an efficient combination of heuristic genetic and  optimization algorithms. The methodology developed through  this research would automatically generate equations of  motion and associated simulation code for a specified  complex multibody system, and determine from these equations  the system design parameters that are considered optimal  with respect to some user prescribed design objective. The  education plan includes computer-aided mathematical modeling  and analysis oriented course developed, and their  application in undergraduate design projects such as SAE  sponsored electric car race and mini Baja competition. In  addition, graduate courses are planned with multibody  dynamics software used as a dynamic analysis and design  tool. Outreach activities include establishing a formal  student exchange program with Technische Hochschule  Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany; and strengthening pre-college  level programs in engineering and technology currently in  existence at RPI.",
