 "awd_abstract_narration": "Higher-order, typed, functional languages provide an  abstract view of computation that supports software  engineering activities elegantly, and that is amenable to  formal verification. Such languages do not, however, support  direct control over computational resources as is  needed in domains such as operating systems, the Internet,  and embedded systems. This project aims at augmenting such  languages with programming constructs, semantic models,  compiling and analysis tools for controlling computational  resources, particularly space usage. Despite its focus on  functional languages, the research addresses a problem  common to other modern programming languages like Java that  include automatic space management. All such languages  suffer from unpredictable space behavior, which causes  programmers to waste considerable resources on locating  suspected space leaks and optimizing space usage.  Furthermore, many of the methods, like the type-based  encapsulation of memory threads, are mostly language-  independent, and hence universally applicable. Two of the  potentially most exciting applications of this language-  supported encapsulation are the guaranteeing of safety for  mobile code on the Internet and the optimization of  parallel programs.",
