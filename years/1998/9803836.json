This project is a series of annual 3-week hands-on workshops  held in Telluride, Colorado.  Neuromorphic engineering is a  discipline which reverses the usual thrust of computational  neuroscience, orienting itself toward the derivation of  engineered devices from an understanding of the design  principles of the nervous system.  In so doing, it is having  a unique beneficial effect on neurobiology research. On the  one hand, it represents a departure from the usual  engineering principles based on linear analog devices or  unabashedly digital ones (e.g. most modern computers), and  hence is contributing to development of robots which perform  smoothly under highly variable external conditions the way  biological organisms do.  On the other hand, it drives  biological research because biologists typically cannot  supply (and may tend to avoid) the level of quantitative  detail of questioning asked about the way the nervous system  is designed.  The workshop involves tutorial-style lectures  on general as well as practical topics in neuromorphic  engineering, practical courses on VLSI, circuits, \"floating  gate\" technology; both short and long hands-on projects (e.g  building robots with neuromorphic control circuits).  Funding is partially supporting travel for faculty and  students for a total of around 60 persons (faculty,  students, staff).",
