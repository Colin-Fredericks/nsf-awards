 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 97-33006 WANG.  Working memory is an active form of short-term  memory. It is indispensable for any cognitive process where  information has to be maintained with attentive effort for a few  seconds, and manipulated \"on-line\", before it is erased and new  information is loaded. Examples are dialing a telephone number,  planning and executing a sequence of motor movements, reading, and  thinking. Experiments on behaving animals have started to uncover  the neuronal basis of working memory in the prefrontal cortex. Dr.  Wang will use theoretical approaches, in complement with  laboratory experiments, to investigate how the working memory  function can be understood in terms of the physiology of single  neurons/synapses, the cortical circuit architecture, and emergent  collective network behavior.  In particular, possible neuronal  mechanisms will be studied by computer model simulations for  sustained neuronal activity (in seconds) and its selectivity to  memory items, including         (a) reverberating activity across the cortical network,       (b) slow cellular and synaptic dynamics, and       (c) the role of recurrent synaptic inhibition.         Results from this research will help to understand the  functioning of normal working memory, its neuromodulation, as well  as its malfunctions.",
