 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern computers rely on memory hierarchies (which consist of  disks, main-memory and hardware caches) for high performance and  low cost. Technology trends, however, have continued to increase  the access-time gaps between the layers.  The gaps threaten to  reduce the effectiveness of memory hierarchies unless novel  techniques can be found to improve hit ratios and data movement  efficiencies. The research focuses on three such techniques:  adaptive virtual memory, near-optimal page coloring, and coherence-  miss reduction.  Adaptive virtual memory targets the disk and main-  memory layers.  It improves performance by observing applications'  page fault patterns and adjusting page replacement and prefetching  policies accordingly, and by integrating dynamic swap allocation  with page managements. Near-optimal page coloring targets the main-  memory and hardware cache layers. It increases cache hit ratio by  carefully placing the pages into cache sets. The research studies  the theoretical aspects of the problem and designs practical  algorithms including profile-based optimizations based on the  theoretical foundation.Coherence-miss reduction targets multi-  processor caches.  It uses a database system as a case study to  identify common data structures and algorithms that  contribute the most to cache coherence misses, and design and  evaluate alternatives that perform better.Combined, the three  techniques promise to improve memory hierarchy performance  significantly.",
