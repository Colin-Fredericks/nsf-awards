 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award provides funding for the creation of a prototype generative designer assistance tool that combines a function-based generation strategy with the geometric modeling capabilities of today's computer-aided design systems.  The prototype tool will integrate an existing boundary solid modeler with a graph-based function modeling system, providing a platform for the transformation of a functional description of a design into a solid model of the components that comprise a potential design solution.  Function-driven, hierarchical design algorithms with optimization modes, will be developed to transform an initial functional description of a design into an entire space of functionally feasible and physically valid designs.  A supporting algorithm to recognizing emergent functions and function sharing opportunities will be proposed and tested.  This award also funds the expansion of a current graduate-level course, Mechanical Design Formalisms, with new modules examining creative design methods to answer the question, `Is one design method more creative than another?`.  An undergraduate version of the Formalisms course will be offered in Year Two of the award.  In addition to coursework, this award fund the continuation of an undergraduate research project to develop a Mechanical Design Learning Tool, targeting students in grades three through six.  Through a visual interface, students will manipulate icons representing simple mechanical components in order to solve problems like `create a rolling cart`.  The tool will feature animation sequences that illustrate the mechanical concept discovered by correct icon manipulation.       Successful generative design tools will assist designers in completing routine or, on a more interactive basis, challenging design tasks.  Their design interpretation techniques can be used to preserve a company's design knowledge, a significant goal for a design environment characterized by geographically dispersed design teams and paperless design databases. Generative design tools will have impact beyond use by experienced designers.  They are training tools for novice designers and tools for engineering students in design classes.  Generative design tools also embody the foundational principles necessary for building design learning tools suitable to engage elementary students in learning mechanical engineering concepts.  The proposed work's impact will reach into the university classroom, eventually providing design learning tools to students of all ages, engaging them in engineering pursuits at pre-college and college ages.",
