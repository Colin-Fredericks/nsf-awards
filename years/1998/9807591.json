 "awd_abstract_narration": "9807591  Thomas    This proposal describes a research program aimed at developing  novel macromolecular materials for technological applications.  The first area is traditional:  morphology and mechanical  properties; and the second is completely new:  block copolymer  photonic band gap (PBG) materials.  Both areas depend critically  on the ability to organize block copolymers into well ordered  microdomain morphologies using composition, molecular  architecture, and careful processing.  Tailored self assembly  into new microdomain structures such as the double gyroid  tricontinuous structure in ABA triblocks is exemplary for  understanding how the microdomain structure of a glassy  continuous (polystyrene end blocks) and a rubber continuous  (polyisoprene mid block) system evolves with increasing  deformation and substantially recovers upon release of the  applied load.  The continued exploration of ABC terpolymers, both  linear and miktoarm stars, will undoubtedly reveal additional new  microdomain structures.  The object is to gain an overall  understanding of how composition, number of components and chain  architecture govern the resultant structure of the intermaterial  dividing surface of the periodic microdomains.  In the second  area, a new field will be explored, of potentially huge  significance for block copolymer materials and their interesting  topologically connected microdomains by using them in combination  with high dielectric contrast nanoparticles to create novel  photonic band gap materials.  PBG materials are a new class of  materials with enormous potential to revolutionize electroptical  and all optical applications.  Up to the present, this new field  has been pioneered using microlithography to pattern periodic  dielectric structures.  By sequestering nanoparticles into one of  the components of an appropriately high Mw block copolymer,  structures with excellent dielectric contrast and appropriate  length scale can b produced to control the flow of U.V. and  visible li ght.  %%%  These two projects are in the areas of polymer-based structures  for technological applications.  In addition to the basic science  and new technology, both graduate students and undergraduate  students will be exposed to multidisciplinary training in these  exciting project thrust areas.  ***",
