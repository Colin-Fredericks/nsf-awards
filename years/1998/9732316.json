 "awd_abstract_narration": "9732316  Cuhel    The  Research  Experience for Undergraduates (REU)  Site  at  the  University  of  Wisconsin-Milwaukee's  Center  For  Great   Lakes  Studies  (CGLS)  provides environmental aquatic science  research  training    for   10   students   per   year   in   a   cohesive,  multidisciplinary environment.  Students interested in chemistry,  geology,  and biology of lake and ocean settings are paired  with  mentors supervising active research laboratories.  Together  they  will  develop  a program of study compatible with  the  advisor's  interests  and  capabilities within one of the  interdisciplinary  research programs active at CGLS.  After an introduction to  CGLS  and  a  day of open Lake Michigan sampling experience aboard  the  research  vessel  R/V NEESKAY, they will begin a combined  field,  laboratory,  and  library investigation with  increasing  student  self-reliance.   Teams  of students working  within  an  umbrella  project  will learn the essential nature of collaborative  effort  and  the reward of applying their individual skills to accomplish  collective  goals.   Regularly  scheduled  student  and   faculty  interactions  at  both  formal  and  informal  levels   will   be  available.   Workshops on instrumentation,  graduate  school  and  career opportunities, writing and public presentation of results,  and  related topics will be offered.  At the close of the 10-week  session,  each of the students will present a poster,  a5  minute  oral talk describing their work to a public audience, and a short  but detailed paper in the format of a typical journal article.",
