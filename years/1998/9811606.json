Riehl of Michigan Technological University and by Professor Janina Legendziewicz of the University of Wroclaw.  These two research groups have common interests in the study of the molecular and electronic structure, excited state energetics, and solution dynamics of lanthanide complexes.  The long term goal for this research is the development and exploitation of lanthanide based materials as probes of biochemical structure, as luminescent assays, and as therapeutic agents. The research projects involved synthesis and characterization of lanthanide compounds, and complementary spectroscopic investigations at the two sites. \r\n\r\nThis research in chemistry fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
