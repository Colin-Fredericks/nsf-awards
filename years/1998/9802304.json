The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-one-month postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Michael H. B. Stowell to work with Dr.  Nigel Unwin at MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in  Cambridge, England and with Dr. Yoshinori Fujiyoshi at Kyoto  University on the investigation of the structural basis of  ligand-gated ion channel opening and desensitization. This  is supported jointly by the IRFAP and the U.S.-Japan  Program.    Specifically, they will be studying the structure of an  acetylcholine receptor (AchR), which is a membrane protein/  ion channel, which functions as a transmitter in the brain  which allows the transmission of neuronal signals so that we  may perform such functions as walking and talking.  Studying  the structure of this receptor, is like looking at a  blueprint for answering important biological and biophysical  questions about the functioning of this protein.  To do  this, Dr. Stowell will use a liquid helium cooled electron  microscope, developed by Dr. Fujiyoshi, a microscope thought  to be the only one in the world sophisticated enough to do  this research.  He will use techniques devised by Dr. Unwin,  helical crystal preparation and image analysis.  ***",
