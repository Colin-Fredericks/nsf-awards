Data from the 1999 cruise will be used in conjunction with previously classified data from cruises for the past ten years to investigate the possibility that the thickness of the ice pack has been thinning due to global warming.  This project is a very important contribution to global change studies because thinning of the Arctic ice pack could be one of the first indications of global warming.  The upward looking sonar data from submarines is the only way to examine retrospectively the ice thickness to determine if global warming is affecting the Arctic Ocean. The results of this study will answer a very important question in global change research.\r\n",
