Allgower \r\n\r\nThis investigation deals with the study and development of numerical\r\ncontinuation methods which intrinsically exploit symmetries. The\r\nintegration of techniques for exploiting symmetry in the solution of\r\nlinear systems, which have recently been developed by the\r\ninvestigators, into a numerical continuation method will provide a\r\npractical and efficient tool for detecting symmetry pattern breaking\r\nbifurcations while tracing a branch, and for following bifurcating\r\nbranches for secondary and multiple bifurcations. The continuation\r\nmethods which will be studied and developed will concentrate upon the\r\nhandling of large systems of equations such as those stemming from\r\ndiscretizations of systems of partial differential equations and\r\nintegral  equations.  Several techniques for numerically handling\r\nbifurcations will be investigated. These include the normal form\r\nequations of center manifold theory and the Lyapunov-Schmidt \r\nreduction. By applying symmetry reduction methods developed by the\r\ninvestigators, block diagonalizations are obtained which greatly\r\nfacilitate the bifurcation analysis. Among the applications to be\r\ntreated will be: nonlinear elliptic equations such as those which\r\nmodel the buckling of shells with symmetries, equations for spherical\r\nconvection which model planetary atmospheres, Ginzburg-Landau\r\nequations modelling the dynamics of travelling waves, and nonlinear\r\nboundary integral equations which are discretized via boundary element\r\nmethods. Integral equations of the latter kind arise in a natural way\r\nfrom exterior boundary value problems. It is anticipated that the\r\nprograms which will be developed will be disseminated via anonymous\r\nftp in the same manner as the investigator's programs for numerical\r\ncontinuation and symmetry reduction methods have been done.\r\n\r\nNumerical continuation for large structured systems, which will be\r\nstudied in this investigation, has a broad  field of important\r\napplications. In particular, numerical continuation can be used to\r\ncomputationally simulate how the variation of inherent control\r\nparameters causes qualitative changes in a physical system. Such\r\nparameters may represent loading, speed, temperature, viscosity,\r\naspect ratio, etc. The determination and analysis of critical values\r\nof control parameters is  of great significance to the scientist and\r\nengineer, because at these values decisive phenomena occur: stability\r\ncan be lost, structures can break or  go into resonance, ingnition\r\ntakes place, atmospheric flow patterns change, etc. Mathematically,\r\ncritical values of control parameters in physical models are\r\ncharacterized by bifurcation points. Numerical continuation methods\r\ncan be used to detect and calculate bifurcation points. The\r\ninvestigation  will concentrate on phenomena taking place in regimes\r\nwhich have geometric symmetry structures. The consideration of such\r\nstructures enhances the scientific understanding, but can also be\r\nexploited for more precise and efficient calculations. The computer\r\nvisualization programs which will be developed will assist researchers\r\nand students to simulate, study, and gain insights into the pattern\r\nchanges of physical phenomena under the variation of parameters.\r\n",
