 "awd_abstract_narration": "Durable goods monopoly theory provides a commonly-used framework of analysis for Industrial Organization economists. In most formulations of this theory, durability is a product characteristic that serves to restrict a seller's monopoly power. In spite of its widespread use, this theory has been subject to little empirical scrutiny.  This project utilizes laboratory experiments to evaluate predictions from durable goods monopoly theory.  Laboratory methods permit the researcher to control features of the environment (such as information about other agents' payoffs, time discounting, length of time horizon) that theoretical models identify as key determinants of market outcomes.  The design of experiments is based on an asymmetric information model in which one or more buyers are privately informed about their valuation for the good.  Durability is introduced into the experiments through a multi period trading structure and exogenously-induced time discounting. The equilibrium that takes the information asymmetries into account predicts prices below the static monopoly price and a high incidence of demand withholding (i.e., a buyer's rejection of a profitable offer).   Results from experiments are used to assess quantitative equilibrium predictions on pricing and demand withholding and qualitative, comparative-static predictions concerning the effects of durable vs. non durable product type, changes in the distribution of  buyers' values, short vs. long trading horizons, and contractual provisions that provide buyers with best price guarantees. An important part of the research is an examination of the roles of fairness perceptions and of learning in explaining observed behavior. The long trading horizon experiments permit evaluation of a striking theoretical prediction; the so called Coase conjecture, that the initial price offer of the monopolist will be close to marginal cost.",
