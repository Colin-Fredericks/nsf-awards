 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712765  Campbell  Quasi-one-dimensional  correlated electronic materials offer  a unique opportunity for progress in quantum many-body  physics.  The theoretical problems are tractable, better  than in higher dimensions.  The numerical and theoretical  techniques can be developed and compared with experiments  and often against available exact solutions.  This grant to  a senior theorist supports work on two related classes of  physically relevant 1D models, spin -Peierls and Peierls-  Hubbard models.  Both classes involve strong interplay  between electron-electron interactions and electron- phonon  interactions, including the quantum phonons.  The research  makes use of many of the state-of-the-art techniques, two of  the recently developed variants of quantum Monte Carlo, the  Stochastic Series Expansion and Constrained Path Monte  Carlo.  In addition,  use will be made of the exact  diagonalization techniques, exploiting Maximum-Entropy  techniques for analytic continuation and also boundary  condition averaging for extrapolations to the thermodynamic  limit.  The calculations will be carried out for the  physical observables such as, spin susceptibility, dynamic  structure factors, NMR relaxation rates which will also be  compared to the experiments.  %%%  With the advent of technological interest in conducting  polymers, the community of condensed matter theorists has  found a wonderful opportunity.  Here we have complex systems  with subtle electronic and mechanical properties in one  dimension.  The latter is mathematically the simplest  configuration to look for complex solutions.   It also  proves to be a remarkable touchstone, one where the complex  theoretical techniques can be tested for their applicability  and accuracy.  This grant is to consider some of the newly  discovered materials with novel properties and to search for  ways one can calculate them theoretically using cutting edge  techniques.  ***",
