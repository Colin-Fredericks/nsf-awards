 "awd_abstract_narration": "A mobile agent is a program  capable  of  migrating  autonomously from\r\nnode  to  node, to perform computation on behalf of a human user.  The\r\nmobile agent paradigm can play a significant  role  in current  and  future\r\nnetwork-centric applications, especially in the context  of  the  Next\r\nGeneration  Internet.   Security  and robustness  concerns about mobile\r\nagents are currently identified as the biggest obstacle preventing the\r\nwidespread deployment  and use of agent-based applications.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of the proposed research is to  investigate security\r\nand  robustness  issues  in  building  a  mobile  agent programming system,\r\nin an open distributed environment,  such  as the  Internet.  The proposed\r\nresearch addresses issues related to programming primitives and\r\nsystem-level mechanisms  for  building agent-based   applications.    The\r\napproach  presented  in  this proposal is based on supporting the mobile\r\nagent  paradigm  using mobile  objects.   This  raises  a  number of\r\nresearch challenges related to protection of host  resources,  protection\r\nof  mobile agents,  and  secrecy  and authenticity of information carried\r\nby agents. It also requires mechanisms  for  remote  monitoring  and\r\ncontrol  of  agents,  and recovery from failures. Another related challenge\r\nto be addressed by this effort is in building  scalable mechanisms  for\r\nnaming and locating objects in the network.  The proposed research will be\r\nbased on the Java language and will use cryptographic  techniques to design\r\nprotocols to solve several of the security problems.  The facilities\r\nprovided by Java (such  as object  serialization,  reflection, security\r\nfeatures, etc.) will be used in devising mechanisms for agent mobility and\r\nsupporting protection  domains  for  agent  execution  on  remote  hosts.\r\nA prototype implementation of a mobile agent system will  be  built to\r\nserve  both  as  a  research  infrastructure  as  well  as  a demonstration\r\nof the  mechanisms  to  be  developed  during  this effort.   The system\r\nwill be evaluated using both theoretical and experimental analyses.\r\n\r\n",
