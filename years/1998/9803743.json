 "awd_abstract_narration": "Meeting the requirements of dependable distributed real-time  systems poses considerable challenges. Many of the systems to be  built are required to be both hard real-time and to use off-the-  shelf commercial hardware and software components. The need for  using off-the-shelf components conflicts fundamentally with the  classical ``guaranteed response'' hard real-time design  methodology. The aim of the proposed research is to develop novel  services, algorithms and system design methodologies that are  applicable to the design of hard real-time distributed systems  built from off-the-shelf components. A second goal is to embody  these novel services, algorithms and design methodologies into a  prototype distributed fault-tolerant application development  environment that would allow hard-real time services and soft-real  time services to co-exist harmoniously. A third goal is to  investigate means for making such systems and services secure to  adverse attacks.  Initially the project will focus on continuing  an on-going exploration of the fail-aware design paradigm, as a  middle of the road approach between the ``guaranteed response''  hard real-time design methodology  and the ``best effort'' soft  real time paradigm. More broadly, it is expected that other  aspects of specifying, designing, securing and validating  dependable distributed real-time systems will be considered.",
