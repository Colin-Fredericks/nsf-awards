The  physics  associated  with  collossal magetoresistance and with cuprate superconductivity are  two  thrusts  of the work. The thin film samples are prepared  by  several  collaborators, with state-of-the-art  synthesis  methods  including  reactive  electron-beam coevaporation,  molecular-beam  epitaxy,    and    ultra-high   vacuum   pulsed   laser-ablation.  Measurements  of the real and imaginary parts of  the  electrical  conductivity  will  be made in the range from 100-3000GHz,  which  lies  in  a gap between ranges accessible by microwave  and  FTIR  methods.  A  further  aspect  of the work  involves  bilayers  of  magnetic   (M)  and  superconducting  (S)  oxides,  and  trilayer  configurations  in  which M and S layers are  separated  by  thin  insulating  layers.  The ultimate goal  of  the  research  is  to  understand  and control electronic transport in designed-to-order  multilayer thin films. This research program is interdisciplinary  in  nature  and  involves one or more postdoctoral  and  graduate  students,  who  receive  excellent training  in  preparation  for  careers in industry, government laboratories or academia.  %%%  This  experimental research project focuses powerful new  optical  pulse  methods  to  clarify the motions  of  charge  carriers  in  certain types of oxide thin films. The oxides under investigation  show  great  promise  for  applications as  magnetic  sensors  or  electron  devices,  or as superconducting elements  in  a  future  electronics.
