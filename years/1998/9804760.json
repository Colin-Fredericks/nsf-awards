 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information theory celebrates its 50-th birthday.   Although it  is a mature area of research by any standard, new challenges  arise due to new applications and new theoretical developments.  (For example, there is a resurgence of interest in source coding  for multimedia applications.)  In the 1997 Shannon  Lecture Jacob  Ziv presented compelling arguments for \"backing off\" to a certain  degree from the (first-order) asymptotic analysis of information  systems in order to predict the behavior of real systems where we  always face finite (and often small) lengths of sequences, files,  codes, etc.   One way to overcome these difficulties is to  increase the accuracy of asymptotic analysis by replacing first-  order analyses (e.g., a leading term of the average code length)  by full asymptotic expansions and more accurate analyses (e.g.,  large deviations, central limit laws).  We propose to accomplish  this goal by exploring problems of information theory by analytic  methods, that is, those in which complex analysis plays a pivotal  role.  Among others we propose research on lossless Lempel-Ziv  schemes, lossy extension of Lempel-Ziv schemes (based on  approximate pattern matching), context quantization (which aims  at extending context-tree weighting to the lossy environment),  prediction schemes based on pattern matching, and hierarchy of  redundancy rates.  Analytic methods discussed here are:  asymptotic analysis of functional-differential equations,  poissonization and depoissonization, and complex asymptotics.",
