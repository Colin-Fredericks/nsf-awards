Hammer\r\n\r\nNumerous problems in area as diverse as VLSI design, game theory, artificial intelligence, neural networks, operations research, statistics, reliability, and finance can be modeled by using set functions, i.e., mappings of the subsets of a finite set into the reals.  It was noticed in the mid-60's by the PI that set functions can be viewed as \"pseudo-Boolean\" functions, i.e., real valued functions with 0-1 variables, and can be represented as multilinear polynomials.  It was noticed along the years that beside their polynomial representation, pseudo-Boolean functions admit also other algebraic representations, e.g., as additive posiforms, as logical posiforms, etc.  It also turns out that various types of applications may lead naturally to various types of representations.  Also, it can be seen that the solution of some of the most important problems concerning pseudo-Boolean problems (finding a global optimum, finding a local optimum, approximating the optimum, finding a good approximation of the functions, finding a good majorant or minorant of the function) depends heavily on the particular representation used.  In this proposal the investigators will deal mostly with the optimization of pseudo-Boolean functions with a heavy emphasis on their representation.  They will consider separately various problems of optimization, majorization, approximation, etc., for pseudo-Boolean functions given in polynomial form, in additive posiform, as well as in disjunctive posiform representation.  Beside investigations concerning the algebraic problems of presentation, the investigators will lay heavy emphasis on the computational aspects of the problem, and plan to elaborate specialized algorithms for exact and heuristic optimization problems of pseudo- Boolean functions in various forms, on local optimization, and on the detection of efficient methods for particular classes of problems.\r\n\r\nIn numerous real-life situations, optimization problems have to be solved involving decisions and selections between various alternatives.  When, for example, locations have to be found for cellular ground stations, emergency facilities, warehouses, etc., the usual mathematical optimization procedures cannot be applied blindly, since they may recommend the location of say half a unit in one place and the other half in another.  Therefore, new mathematical techniques are needed to make sure that the solutions can only involve locating either an entire unit in one place or no part of it in that place.  Similar problems occur when selections are made between projects to be undertaken, people or equipment to be assigned to various tasks, or much more complex situations where a large company (e.g. an airline) has to assign its equipment (e.g. aircrafts) to its various activities (e.g. flights).  In such situations, the mathematical formulation of the problem requires the use of variables which can only take the values of 0 or 1.  In spite of its apparent simplicity, this requirement can cause major mathematical and computational difficulties.  This project deals to a large extent with the problem of finding various mathematical models describing situations like the above ones and developing optimization techniques for handling them.  A substantial amount of computational experimentation is part of the project and will complement the mathematical developments.\r\n",
