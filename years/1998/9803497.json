He will finish his joint work with Yair Minsky on\r\nthe  combinatorial group theory of the mapping class group.  This work\r\nincludes  solving the conjugacy problem and finding a biautomatic\r\nstructure.  The  method has been to use the hyperbolic structure of the\r\ncomplex of curves.   Masur will begin a study of the large scale or\r\nasymptotic geometry of the  mapping class group.  This study is related\r\nto the study of the  quasi-isometries of Teichmuller space.  Masur will\r\ncontinue his work on the  representation theory of the mapping class\r\ngroup.  He will study certain  functions called conditional negative\r\nkernels, with the goal of proving  that the group does not have Kazhdan\r\nproperty T. He will also study whether  surface groups admit\r\nhomeomorphisms to the mapping class group, which is  related to the\r\nstudy of surface bundles over surfaces, a problem in  4-manifold\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nThe field of surface topology is the study of those properties of\r\nsurfaces  that do not change under deformations.  The field interacts\r\nstrongly with  other disciplines within mathematics, such as complex\r\nanalysis, and with  outside disciplines such as physics.  The mapping\r\nclass group, which is the  group of self mappings of the surface, is a\r\nfundamental object of study.   Many mathematicians over the years have\r\nstudied the group from a variety of  viewpoints.  Recently, powerful\r\nnew geometric tools have been introduced to  study groups, which are\r\nthe objects of symmetry in mathematics.  The  principle investigator is\r\nworking to bring these new geometric ideas into  the study of surfaces\r\nand the mapping class group.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
