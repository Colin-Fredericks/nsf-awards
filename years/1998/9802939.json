 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on using combinatorial methods to elucidate the   catalytic activity of polyalkylamine polymers with carboxylic acid   functionalities.   To elucidate the mechanism by which these poorly   characterized heterogeneous systems catalyze ketone reductions,   elimination reactions and the Robinson annulation reaction, variables   known to affect both the efficiency and the induction period preceding   full catalytic activity will be systematically addressed by means of an   automated combinatorial protocol.   Synthetically modified precursors   will be used to elucidate substrate specificity in the optimized systems.      Graduate students involved in the research will be introduced to   combinatorial techniques and their application to elucidating and   optimizing heterogeneous catalytic activity.     The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research   and educational activities of Professor Fredric Menger of the Department   of Chemistry at Emory University.    Professor Menger will use an   automated combinatorial approach to determine and optimize the catalytic   activity of polyalkylamine polymers with appended carboxylic acid   functionalities.    Professor Menger's educational activities include   training graduate students in combinatorial methodology, and the use of   this methodology in identifying and optimizing the catalytic activity of   polymer substrates with different appended carboxylic acids.",
