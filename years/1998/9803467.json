 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803467  Damon       Professor Damon's research will apply infinitesimal methods from  singularity theory (originally introduced by Mather) to investigate  the topological structure of a general class of highly nonisolated  singularities arising as nonlinear sections of varieties.  This class  includes discriminants of mappings, bifurcation sets, nonlinear  arrangements of hypersurfaces, etc.  He will use analogues of Morse  singularities for sections of varieties to derive general algebraic  formulae for certain fundamental topological invariants.  He will also  apply these ideas involving sections of varieties to understand the  geometry of functions using the notion of \"relative critical sets,\"  which extend the notion of ridges and \"cores\" used in computer  imaging.  He will combine these geometric techniques with other  singularity-theoretic methods developed for determining generic  properties of solutions to partial differential equations.  Together  they will be applied to \"pixel intensity functions\" representing  medical images.  In conjunction with Gaussian blurring or nonlinear  blurring techniques, they will associate certain geometric structures  that can be used for addressing various questions in medical imaging.       The first part of Professor Damon's research project will concern  qualitative properties of spaces defined as the set of solutions of  specific types of systems of nonlinear equations.  The specific form  of the equations will allow the investigator to use methods from the  field of mathematics called singularity theory.  Specifically, this  allows the analysis of the set of solutions by perturbing the  equations and reducing to the analysis of certain basic cases.  The  total contributions from the basic cases can be determined  algebraically, yielding a qualitative understanding of the structure  of the set of solutions.  Second, such systems of equations will be  specifically applied to analyze medical images.  They allow one to  associate to a medical image a g eometric structure, which captures  essential features of the image.  The geometric structure is defined  using systems of equations of the above type, and it even allows one   first to remove \"noise\" from the image by applying appropriate filters.  The basic properties of the geometric structure obtained from the  first part will allow it to be used to address several questions in  medical imaging.  ***",
