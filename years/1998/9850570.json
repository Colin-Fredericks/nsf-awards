 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Learning for all Through Laboratory Enhancement \" project has been developed to strengthen and enhance the curriculum for the laboratory portion of the introductory physics class for non-science majors at American University. A serious need exists to update the existing curriculum to include technology currently available. The introductory lab as it currently exists is equipped with new computers. However, auxiliary equipment such as micro-computer based laboratory tools are not currently available. The proposed project outlines a strategy by which current technologies could be integrated into the laboratory curriculum. The strategy outlined in this proposal involves the adaptation of currently available technologies and teaching innovations into the laboratory portion of the course for non-science majors. In addition, emphasis will be placed on the development of inquiry-based and interactive laboratory activities. A key component of this project involves the assessment and evaluation of these various technological tools and teaching innovations in terms of student learning styles and current physics education research regarding how students learn physics. The anticipated outcome of this project is a package of laboratory experiments whose foundation is built on the philosophy that enhanced learning can occur when students are a more active part of the learning process. This package of laboratory activities and experiments would be disseminated to other physics educators who could then adapt the materials for use in their own curriculum. An additional anticipated outcome is that improvements and enhancements made in the introductory course for non- science majors would be the catalyst for systemic change throughout all introductory physics courses taught at American University.",
