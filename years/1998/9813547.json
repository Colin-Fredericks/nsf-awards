Reducing this aggression and enhancing victims' autonomy are legal goals with widespread public support. This colloquium is designed to bring together in a common forum, leading biological researchers, legal and sociolegal scholars to explore the insights biological science has that may be useful to legal scholars.  Those participants expert in the strengths and limitations of biological theories of  intraspecies aggression will report on and discuss predictions derived from an evolutionary perspective and suggest promising next steps in research.  Legal scholars specifically interested in sexual aggression will share with other participants the latest legal scholarship on this issue.  All participants will evaluate the current state of research in both biology and law and generate ideas for future research and articulate the implications (should there be any)  of the evolutionary perspective for the law.  In addition to advancing research opportunities, the participants will explicate the limits of biologically based thinking for sociolegal research and the possible misuses of biological insights by the legal system.  %%%  The prevalence of human aggression across and within the sexes poses difficult challenges for law and society.
