 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hannes Jonsson is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in the   development of computer algorithms for density functional theory   simulations and applications to semiconductor crystal growth.  Jonsson   will parallelize his own methods for finding minimum energy paths and   transition state activation barriers.  He will also investigate free   energy barriers which include anharmonicity, and algorithms which scale   linearly with system size.  His applications will focus on interpretation   of current imaging experiments by calculating adatom diffusion rates and   surface cluster formation rates for industrially relevant systems such as   silicon and silicon carbide surfaces, germanium-silicon interfaces, and   silicon dioxide overlayers.  Modern density functional theoretical methods will be developed and used   to study a variety of surface growth mechanisms of technological   importance.  In particular these methods will be extended to enable the   study of larger, more complex models of materials on new and emerging   massively parallel computers.   The methods involve the sophisticated   evaluation of accurate energetics for a number of complex atomic-scale   processes on semiconductor surfaces.",
