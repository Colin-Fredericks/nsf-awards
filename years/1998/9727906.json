 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727906  Morton    The influence of context, or neighboring base composition, on the pattern and rate of nucleotide substitution in the chloroplast genome will be examined.  Recent work has demonstrated a strong correlation between flanking base composition and both substitution rate and mutation bias in flowering plants.  This interdependency of sites has important implications for processes as well as analyses in many fields of molecular biology. We are interested in further expanding our previous findings in order to develop a better understanding of how much variation in substitution bias and rate is a function of context as well as how context dependency affects mutation spectra and gene evolution.  The proposed work focuses on the chloroplast genome and will analyze the influence of context on the rate of substitution with the goal of determining how context dependency - as opposed to natural selection - affects variation in substitution rate among genes.  The influence of context on substitutions in species other than flowering plants will then be tested.  Finally, the effect that observed context dependencies have on gene-level evolutionary features will be examined.  This will include the effect on variation in synonymous substitution rate (mentioned above), how context dependency affects the dynamics of amino acid replacement and the influence of context dependency on frequently applied methods in molecular phylogenetics that assume an independence of sites.      In addition to the direct applications, this work will also develop a strong basis for studies on other genomes and other groups of organisms as well as an understanding of mutation dynamics in this widely studied and analyzed genome.",
