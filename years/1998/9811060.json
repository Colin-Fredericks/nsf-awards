 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on understanding the central role of communications in developing customer relationships in the rapidly emerging and changing environment of electronic commerce. It examines how technologies can be applied to develop such relationships with a special emphasis on communications and methods that get customers involved in designing and measuring the effectiveness of applications and products.  The metaphor of making, accepting, and keeping promises is at the heart of mutually beneficial relationships between a business and its customers. Computing and communications technologies enable the compression of time and space in which customers can interact directly with the company. Formerly distinct functions such as marketing, communications, and sales transactions and fulfillment can occur simultaneously and in real time.  This research investigates what electronic servicescapes will enable and enhance relationships and whether effective electronic servicescapes have many of the interpersonal communication characteristics of excellent sales and service people.    A cross disciplinary faculty team will work with five companies: 3M's Baldrige Award winning Dental Division who has developed a web site specifically to foster relationships with its customers; General Mills who market to consumers through retailers and are leaders in EDI use; Unisys, an information technology supplier; and Periscope Marketing Communications, a relationship marketing company.",
