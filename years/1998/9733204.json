 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to the exponential growth in the demand for wireless communication services, new techniques for optimizing system quality and capacity are imperative. Our proposed research program strives to meet these challenges in the following areas: (i) Accurate channel modeling. New statistical models for multipath and shadow fading will be developed that are both accurate in describing the propagation environment and also useful in analysis. These models will provide a foundation for proposed optimization techniques.  (ii) Information theory for wireless links.  The goal here is to develop  useful information theoretic limits for wireless multiuser systems. An approach based on throughput analysis is proposed that will yield new insights into the optimization of wireless systems, particularly for  multirate applications. (iii) Optimization of Wireless Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems. Hybrid systems that combine the advantages of using long spreading sequences (R-CDMA) with those of  short sequences (D-CDMA) will be explored. Techniques will also be developed for the accurate analysis of CDMA capacity and coverage for both single-user and multiuser detection systems. (iv) Dynamic resource allocation.  The three primary resources for wireless access -bandwidth, space and power - need to be allocated efficiently and dynamically in a mobile wireless environment. A major goal of the proposed research program is to develop a mathematical foundation for dynamic resource allocation. The proposed decentralized dynamic decision making (DDDM) framework will be essential to this development.    The educational objectives of the proposed program are: (i) to promote meaningful learning in the classroom; (ii) to promote ties with industry so students are exposed to real-world needs; (iii) to exploit new technologies to expand classroom boundaries; (iv) to design classes that will better prepare students for new opportunities in telecommunications; and (v) to incorporate research in all educational activ ities.",
