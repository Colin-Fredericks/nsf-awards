 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 98-10505  PREMKUMAR      The N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is a subtype of a  class of proteins found in the cell membranes of neurons (nerve  cells) termed \"ionotropic excitatory amino acid receptors.\"  These molecules are involved in detecting the presence of the  amino acid  glutamate, in the medium bathing a nerve cell and  signaling the concentration of that amino acid  by opening a pores  in the membrane that admit especially calcium ions to the inside  of the cell.  In particular,  this receptor type plays a central  role in development, neuroplasticity (changes in the properties of  the nervous system, as in learning) and excitotoxicity (cell-death  due to over-stimulation).  Important properties of the NMDAR, when  compared to other channels are that it is highly permeable to Ca2+  and is blocked by Mg2+ in a voltage-dependent manner.  The amount  of Ca2+ entry is critical for the activation of Ca2+-dependent  enzymes which produces second messengers (other chemicals which  serve as signals to other parts of the cell), mediates cell death,  and leads to an increase or decrease in synaptic strength. NMDAR  is a potential target for modulation by second messengers,  phosphorylation, and other physiological/pharmacological agents.  The long-term goal of this project is to determine the modulation  of Ca2+ permeability and Mg2+ block characteristics of NMDA  receptors.  Since the cloning of the first NMDAR subunit (NR1),  eight different splice variants of NR1 subunit, four different NR2  (A-D), and an NMDA-like (NR-L, renamed as NR3) subunits have been  cloned. NMDA receptors formed by different subunit combinations  exhibit unique functional properties and play a critical role  during development. In spite of these significant advances, the  reason for the regional distribution and developmental regulation  of receptors formed with different subunit combinations is not  fully understood.  The functional properties of these receptors  are also not clearly understood. In this st udy Dr. Premkumar will  determine Ca2+ permeability and Mg2+ block characteristics of  NMDAR formed with different subunit combinations. Identification  of subunit specific properties will reveal the need for these  receptors to be expressed in a specific time-window during  development. Results from this study will give us a better  understanding of subunit-specific properties and provide insight  into regional specificity of CNS function.  This knowledge will  also aid us to understand disease conditions and design novel  drugs that can target specific brain regions. It has been clearly  shown that stroke patients, who have been treated with NMDA  receptor antagonist can recover faster compared to those who have  not received the antagonist.  It is suggested that the excess Ca2+  entry through NMDA receptors causes neuronal damage leading to  slow recovery, sometimes the damage is irreversible.",
