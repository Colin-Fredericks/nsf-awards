 "awd_abstract_narration": "Millions of dollars are lost when people fail to negotiate effectively. Ineffective conflict resolution takes its toll not only on negotiators' pocketbooks, but interpersonal relationships as well.  There is some indication that people are aware of the need for more effective negotiation skills.  It is commonly advertised that negotiation training, specifically through two-year MBA programs, can save executives and their companies hundreds of thousands of dollars through the creation of `win-win` deals and the avoidance of costly strikes.  But are these courses effective? How do we ensure that students will access the principles they've learned in the classroom when they need them in the real world?  Our research will examine the effectiveness of negotiation training methods.  The practical purpose of this research is to develop instructional and educational strategies that facilitate remote transfer, or people's ability to retrieve the right information when approaching a novel situation.",
