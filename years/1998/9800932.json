 "awd_abstract_narration": "DeLucia  9800932    The change in climate expected in the next century will challenge the  capacity of trees to acclimate to increased temperatures and aridity. The  dry atmospheric conditions of an and climate increase evaporation from the  leaf surfaces of a plant (transpiration), increasing moisture requirements.  The PIs used a geographic comparison of Ponderosa pine populations growing  on a climate gradient as a proxy for differences between the current and  future climate. The PIs found that trees growing in a warm, dry versus a  cool, moist climate increased biomass allocation to sapwood (water  conducting tissue) relative to leaves. To determine if these changes in  tree structure may be physiological and evolutionary adaptations to an and  climate, we propose to examine four research questions. First, does  increased allocation to sapwood relative to leaves increase transpiration  in and trees? Second, does increased allocation to sapwood reduce the  probability of dehydration during prolonged summer droughts? Third, does  increased allocation to sapwood provide greater water storage in and trees?  Fourth, does the physiological and structural response of Ponderosa pine to  aridity have an underlying genetic basis? The proposed research will  establish direct links between tree structure and function and permit  predictions to be made about the physiological and evolutionary potential  of Ponderosa pine to respond to climate change.",
