The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and  experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Elizabeth A. Nagy to work with Dr. Urs Scharer  at the Universite' Paris in France.    Dr. Nagy will do an isotopic study of igneous and  metamorphic rocks from suture and shear zones in Vietnam  using radioactive isotopes to assign absolute ages, which  will fill a significant gap in the geologic data for the  region.  She will also examine possible relationships with  the Mesozoic Indosinian Orogeny and the Cenozoic India  Eurasia collision.  This research will lay the groundwork  for continued sampling and future studies in central and  South Vietnam, and possibly in Laos and Cambodia.    Dr. Scharer and other scientists in his lab have spent many  years studying the geology of these regions and are well  known experts who have reconstructed and defined much of the  geologic history of Indochina that is known today.    ***",
