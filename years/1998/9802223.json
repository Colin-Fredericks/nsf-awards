New Mexico AMP will achieve this goal by increasing the quantity and quality of  students receiving baccalaureate degrees in SMET disciplines from 235 annually in  1992/93 annually by 2002/2003.    During the first four years of the program, New Mexico AMP laid the foundation for  exciting new opportunities that will strengthen the pipeline leading to baccalaureate  degrees and graduate study.  National Science Foundation (NSF) support for Phase II  of the New Mexico AMP will allow us to:  1) expand curricular reforms; 2) integrate  and institutionalize programmatic components; 3) disseminate results; and 4) extend  evaluation into the policy-making process.    Among the innovative features of Phase II are novel plans for tiered peer mentoring  and increased undergraduate research opportunities through internships and  assistantships.  New collaboration and synergy with related initiatives and industry  will fuel these endeavors.  New Mexico educational and political leaders are deeply  committed to fostering excellence in undergraduate education and increasing  opportunities for minority participation in SMET professions.  NSF s support for  Phase II will play a vital role in setting new directions that will build on the good  work that has been achieve during the first phase of this important program.",
