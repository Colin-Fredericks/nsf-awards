 "awd_abstract_narration": "9808433  Moore    The proposal outlines an experimental and theoretical study on  the structure and behavior of synthetic amphiphilic polymers.  The research plan calls for the design, synthesis, and  characterization of macromolecular architectures containing  oligomeric segments that adopt a well-defined secondary  structure.  These folded segments expose information-rich  surfaces that can self-organize into higher-order forms.  Five  different types of amphiphilic polymer architectures are  proposed.  Three of these will involve sequence-specific  phenylene ethynylene oligomers, either attached as grafts or end-  groups to water-soluble polymers, or, chain-extended with a  hydrophilic comonomer to produce a multiblock main-chain  architecture.  Two others contain conformationally restricted  phenylacetylene macrocyclic segments, which will either be  grafted as pendant groups onto a hydrophilic polymer or attached  to the ends of a water-soluble chain.  The architectures  containing macrocyclic segments are predisposed toward nano-  tubular organizations that result from face-to-face hydrophobic  association between planar rings.  In contrast to the macrocyclic  systems, architectures that incorporate oligomeric segments can  exist in either conformationally ordered or disordered states.  Thus it should be possible to design sequences that fold or  unfold in response to an external stimulus.  This may lead to  transient networks and gels that reversibly assemble or  disassemble in a prescribed fashion.  %%%  The proposed research is being performed to better understand the  structure and properties of amphiphilic macromolecules.  Amphiphilic polymers are used in many commercial applications  (e.g., detergents and waterborne coatings), and they show  considerable promise in a variety of medical applications and as  stimuli-responsive materials.  From a fundamental standpoint, it  is interesting to consider that proteins too, are amphiphilic  macromolecules.  Given the versatile functions perf ormaed by  protein molecules, it is a worthwhile endeavor to mimic their  behavior with synthetic substances.  ***",
