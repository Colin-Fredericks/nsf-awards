 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9803323    Tai-Ping Liu         We propose to study two fundamental questions for general   systems of hyperbolic conservation laws: The first is the well-posedness   problem. This is done with Tong Yang. For this, we already constructed a   nonlinear functional for the two conservation laws and are in the process  of doing so for the general systems. The second problem is to study   multi-dimensional gas flows. Lien and the author have succeeded in showing   that three-dimensional self-similar gas flow past a cone is nonlinearly   stable. We are generalizing the new approach of superpositioning local   self-similar flows to other problems. We expect this approach to yield   new qualitative information on nonlinear stability and instability of   multi-dimensional gas flows. Our second project is to study the viscous   conservation laws. With Zeng, we are in the process of studying the   stability of nonlinear waves for hyperbolic-parabolic systems such as the   compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Other problems in combustion and   MHD, and numerical analysis of shock calculations are being considered.   Of particular interest is the role of dissipative parameters on the   structure and stability of nonlinear waves. The pointwise approach the   author introduced is effective for these purposes.        The author plans to study basic questions concerning the invisicd   and viscous solutions for gas dynamics and mechanics.  One of the   fundamental questions concerns the validity of the Euler equations for   the gas dynamics. The equations were derived by Euler in the eighteenth   century. Only until recently the author and his collaborator are able to   show that the equations are mathematically valid in that small errors in   the data yield small errors in the solutions. This is of obvious   importance in the applications because there is always small error either  in the experimental data or numerical computations. Other problems of interest   to the author include the sensitive role of di ssipation parameters. In   combustion, magneto-hydrodynamics, nonlinear elasticity and other   continuum physics, dissipative mechanisms, such as viscosity, heat   conductivity, and species diffusions are important. The geometric   properties and stability of the nonlinear waves may depend sensitively   on these parameters. The author has recently introduced a pointwise approach,   which is effective in studying the nonlinear interactions of waves. The   role of dissipation parameters are being studied using the basic   conservation laws in physics.",
