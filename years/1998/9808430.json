 "awd_abstract_narration": "9808430  Gold  The overall aim of this project is to further understanding of manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP) from the lignin-degrading basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium.  The specific objectives are to characterize the structures, mechanisms, and functions of these enzymes.  Using a homologous expression system developed by the PI, they plan to construct, express, and characterize several site-directed mutants of MnP.  These include several mutations at Arg177, an amino acid residue which interacts with the Mn ligand Glu35, and additional mutations of Mn bindidng site residues.  They will determine the effects of these mutations on the function of MnP.  They also plan to continue to characterize  MnP Phe190 mutants by biophysical methods and to construct and characterize MnP Phe45 mutants.  To better understand how LiP oxidizes polymeric lignin, the LiP oxidation of a lignin model polymeric substrate, ribonuclease, will be examined.  In particular, the role of veratryl alcohol in this reaction will be examined. Using a series of dimethoxybenzyl alcohol LiP substrates, the PI will determine the requirements for forming and stablizing cation radical intermediates in the LiP reaction.    Lignocellulose comprises-95% of terrestrial biomass, and the presence of lignin greatly retards the microbial breakdown of cellulose; thus, lignin plays a key role in the earth's carbon cycle and is central to a wide variety of biotechnologies for biomass utilization.  This proposal focuses on several unresolved questions concerning the structures and mechanisms of the fungal enzymes which are chiefly responsible for catalyzing lignin biodegradation in nature.  The proposed work has important ecological and biotechnological applications.",
