 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will allow Bismarck State College, a community college serving the southwest quadrant of North Dakota, an opportunity to modernize its chemistry curriculum by introducing guided inquiry-based instructional methods into laboratories. By purchasing scientific and computing equipment, BSC will be able to integrate computer-interfaced equipment into its chemistry labs. This will allow BSC the following opportunities:    (1) To provide students with current technology by introducing guided inquiry-based labs that will include practical experience in computational data acquisition and analysis. (2) To prepare students with similar laboratory experiences as those conducted at four-year colleges and universities. (3) To improve the technical literacy of students entering the workforce. (4) To conduct a four-day workshop for approximately 20 area high school teachers. (5) To provide students with opportunities to design experiments that illustrate theory.    As a result of curriculum changes in general chemistry, organic, and biochemistry, about 800 students annually will be able to design experiments and manipulate variables allowing an opportunity to observe the relationships between theory and practice. In addition, they will be studying chemistry as practiced by professional chemists. This will help students compete more successfully when they transfer to four-year institutions or enter the workforce.  Approximately 20 high school science teachers will have an opportunity to experience these technologies by participating in BSC's summer workshops. These teachers will in turn influence at least 200 high school chemistry students each year.The academic achievements of this guided inquiry-based curriculum will be assessed. The results will be disseminated at conferences, through publications in professional journals and over the Internet.Assessment will include surveying students for their reactions to guided inquiry-based, computerinterfaced labs, and giving them the American Chemical S ociety's standardized test. High school teachers participating in BSC's summer workshops will complete evaluation forms. Faculty at transfer institutions and employers will also complete survey forms to assess students' level of success.",
