Mild singularities include quasiregular and nonscalar curvature singularities.  In the case of quasiregular singularities, particle paths end suddenly with no warning from infinitely-increasing tidal forces, while in the case of nonscalar curvature singularities some, but not all, particles moving near the singularity feel infinite tidal forces.  A Cauchy horizon is the boundary of the causal development of spacetime.  Cauchy horizons and singularities are intimately connect, including through the cosmic censorship conjecture, which continues to be debated.\r\n\r\nThis RUI research not only advances knowledge of the global structure of spacetime, it keeps the principal investigator, Prof. Konkowski, up-to-date in her field and improves her undergraduate teaching as a result.  The algebraic computing skills she gained in past NSF research has been directly applicable to her teaching activities.  The midshipmen who do work with her hone their mathematical skills and physical reasoning for graduate school.\r\n***\r\n",
