 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Optimization problems arise naturally in many areas of  science, engineering, and busi-ness. Some of these problems  are discrete, where the solution involves finding the best  configuration over a finite number of possible conformations  (for example, production scheduling problems in operations  research or circuit minimization problems in computer  engineering). Other optimization problems are inherently  continuous, where the solution involves finding the best  solution in some infinite space (for example, entropy  minimiza-tion in physics, portfolio allocation problems in  finance, or elasticity studies in civil engi-neering). Often,  useful abstractions exist which convert one type of problem  into a simpler problem of the other type.    Some of the most compelling optimization problems in the  biological sciences also dis-play this same kind of duality.  An obvious example is the problem of predicting a protein's  (continuous) three-dimensional shape- and, consequently, its  biological function-from its (discrete) primary structure,  expressed as the sequence of constituent amino acids {  Friesne~6 . Curren~y, protein structure is most accurately  determined by experimental means, such as X-Ray  crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. A primary goal for compu-  tational biologists is to be able to predict the tertiary  structure without resorting to experi-mental observation.    This project takes a new approach to the problem of  predicting protein structure. In partic-ular, the merger of a  novel distributed search technique for discrete  (combinatorial) opti-mization, and an efficient, polynomial  time, interior-point algorithm for solving continuous  optimization problems. Each approach will operate using  separate, albeit related, energy models, with the discrete  system \"proposing\" conformations for the con-tinuous model to  evaluate. The goal is to increase the efficiency of the  computation by exchanging information between the two  approaches while exploiting parallelism  in order to solve  realistically-sized proteins. Specifically the project will  construct a prototype hybrid computational tool, apply the  prototype to a protein conformation problem, and evaluate the  solution by comparison to both existing computational  approaches and physi-cal reality.",
