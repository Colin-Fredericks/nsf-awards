 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is designed to continue the development of three computer software projects  intended to improve accessibility to math and science by people with print disabilities.  One  project relates to research on audio display of x-y graphs.  With an audio display, a user  \"views\" the graph by listening to an audio representation of the y  value as x is swept  through its range during some time interval.  Methods will be tested that allow the user to  obtain a more complete picture than a very simple tone plot such as that provided by the  TRIANGLE program.  Audio graph reading should become a valuable tool for blind people  as well as for many people with visual dyslexia.  A second project will port the TRIANGLE  program to Windows 95/NT and make it self-voicing.  TRIANGLE is a reading/writing/  doing math program for blind users.  It includes a math word processor, a graphing  calculator, a simple audio graph viewer, a table viewer, and a viewer for tactile figures on  an external digitizing pad.  The DOS version is difficult to use with most speech screen  readers.  The Windows version should be much more user-friendly.  This program   that can  be used with Braille, audio, or viewed visually -- provides blind users the ability to read,  write, and manipulate scientific documents easily as well as compute and view graphs.   TRIANGLE should fill an enormous gap that has prevented access by blind students and  professionals to scientific information.    The final project is to continue development of the MathPlus Toolbox, a fully accessible  math teaching/learning program developed explicitly to meet the needs of students learning  very basic math, particularly students with learning disabilities.  When this program is  complete, it could be a powerful new tool for teachers of elementary math with students who  have various disabilities.  The software may also become popular with students without  disabilities.",
