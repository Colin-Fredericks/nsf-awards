 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program in photonics.  This activity is a joint effort of twenty-four scientists and engineers from the Departments of Physics, Chemistry, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Engineering Research and the College of Business at Oklahoma State; two government laboratories; and six industrial laboratories.  This group of scientists and engineers has established research collaborations through the Oklahoma State University Center for Laser and Photonics Research (CLPR) and the Center for Photonic and Electronic Materials Devices (CPEMD), and their collective expertise will provide the intellectual underpinning for the training of sixty graduate students over the five-year duration of the award.  The curricular platform for this IGERT activity is provided by the newly developed multidisciplinary Photonics graduate degree program at Oklahoma State that draws upon the extensive infrastructure of the CLPR and the CPEMD.  Features of the IGERT activity include a flexible core curriculum with courses in physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering; graduate laboratory courses; advanced research leading to the PhD in Photonics with specialization in nanostructure wide-gap semiconductors, ultrafast techniques, and photorefractive phenomena; multidisciplinary technical seminars; a business lecture series on technical management, marketing, intellectual property, and venture capital; and industrial internships.  The IGERT activity will be coordinated and administered through the CLPR.  IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program intended to facilitate the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of scientists and engineers to be well-prepared to take advantage of a broad spectrum of career options.  IGERT provides doctoral institutions with an opportunity to develop new, well-focussed multidisciplinary graduate programs that transcend organizational boundaries and unite faculty from several departments or institutions to establish a highly interactive, collaborative environment for both training and research.  In this first year of the program, support will be provided to seventeen institutions for new or nascent programs that collectively span all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF.",
