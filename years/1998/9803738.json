 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803738  Kramer    An experimental program is proposed to elucidate the processing  fundamentals needed to produce films with three dimensionally  patterned phase morphologies on micrometer to sub-micrometer  length scales.  The transfer of patterns from the confining  interfaces into films of both phase separating polymer mixtures  and ordering block copolymers will be realized by controlling the  interaction between the polymer components and the surfaces of  these patterns.  The interfacial patterns will be produced  principally using self assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkane  thiols on Au using a microcontact printing technique.  Control of  interfacial interaction will be exerted by using HO-terminated  alkane thiols, HOOC-terminated alkane thiols, methyl-terminated  alkane thiols and their mixtures to produce SAMs with controlled  surface energy.  These experiments will exploit the complementary  depth profiling capabilities of dynamic secondary ion mass  spectrometry (SIMS) and forward recoil spectrometry to provide  depth information, transmission electron microscopy, low voltage  scanning electron microscopy and scanning force microscopy to  provide imaging of lateral and cross-sectional film phase  structures and scanning Raman microscopy to provide lateral  composition profiling.  Emphasis will be placed on understanding  the kinetics of ordering and island (hole) formation of block  copolymer films through diffusional and flow processes as well as  the effects of topological confinement of such films by solid  interfaces that exert surface fields of various strengths on the  two blocks.  Similarly a major goal will be to understand how to  control surface directed spinodal decomposition process in films  of phase separating polymer mixtures to produce two phase  structures with patterned morphologies so that the pattern  extends in both the lateral and thickness directions.  Here again  topological confinement of these films by solid surfaces raises  important questions that will be  focused on.  %%%  These experiments have the potential to impact a range of new  processing technologies, such as new lithographic techniques, new  ways to produce selective membranes and new ways to form thin-  film optical elements.  ***",
