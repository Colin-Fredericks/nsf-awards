 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9801139  Liu    Virginia Tech and BWX Technologies propose to investigate the electromagnetic interactions between a superconducting coil and the power electronics interface for FACTS/Energy storage applications through industry presence at Virginia Tech.  The project will have the support of BWXT, Virginia Tech, and the NSF GOALI program.    The objective of this research project is to develop an integrated electromagnetic model of the superconducting coil, the power electronics and power systems using the EMTP (Electromagnetic Transient Program).  The modeling will involve a detailed representation of a multi-MW voltage source inverter and the DC-DC chopper including controls and protection.  The superconducting coil will be represented by distributed inductances and capacitances derived from a finite element electromagnetic analysis performed by BWX Technologies.  The transients, surges, and ripples superimposed to the DC voltages need to be controlled to avoid exciting resonances within the coil which can provoke voltages exceeding the capabilities of the coil electrical insulation.  The study will investigate the efficiency of multi-phase choppers, higher switching frequencies and protection measures to guarantee the proper operation of the integrated system.  Also external and internal faults will be simulated and investigated for their potential consequences, and protection measures will be proposed.    The outcome of the study will be a complete and integrated EMTP model for representing the power electronics, power systems (to the utility point of common coupling) and superconducting coil.  The study will determine the worst transient conditions and propose remedial and protective solutions.  Most importantly, through this process, we hope to bring industry's perspective and integrative skills to academe and exchange new ideas and knowledge.  Without this joint effort, neither VT or BWX would be able to carry out the proposal research alone.",
