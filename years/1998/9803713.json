Orr, are\r\npursuing several problems in low and high dimensional geometric\r\ntopology and exploring connections between combinatorics and\r\ntopology.  The problems in geometric topology include: cases of the\r\nBorel/Novikov conjecture and applications of the conjecture to\r\nmanifolds with infinite fundamental group; the classical topological\r\nknot slice problem, including geometrically interpreting old and newly\r\nconstructed knot slicing obstructions via Whitney tower constructions;\r\nthe problem of slicing knots in even dimensions and the underlying\r\nhomotopy obstructions; and better understanding the fundamental\r\nproblem of classifying topological four-manifolds within a homology\r\ntype.  This project also is constructing the foundations of the theory\r\nof oriented matroid bundles and their characteristic classes.  This\r\nrequires deep interactions between two fields, topology and\r\ncombinatorics and will be a step towards the understanding of a new\r\ncategory of manifolds, the combinatorial differential manifolds of\r\nGelfand-MacPherson.\r\n     All problems in geometric topology have their roots in the\r\nunderstanding of manifolds.  An n-dimensional manifold is a set of\r\npoints which is locally modeled on an n-dimensional linear space.  For\r\ninstance, a surface is a locally 2-dimensional linear space.\r\nSpace-time is locally 4-dimensional, but its global properties are\r\nharder to grasp.  The principal problem of geometric topology is the\r\nclassification of manifolds.  Two manifolds are the same if there is a\r\ncontinuous function with a continuous inverse between the manifolds.\r\nThis formalizes the notion of rubber sheet topology often discussed in\r\npopular science magazines.  Another natural aspect of manifold theory\r\nis the question of how manifolds can sit within other manifolds, i.e.,\r\nknot theory.  One pathway to understanding manifolds is through the\r\nfundamental group and homology theory, which provides a transition from\r\ngeometry to algebra.  Another pathway is to approximate geometry by\r\nfinite structures, which provides a transition from geometry to\r\ncombinatorics.  The interaction of these fields of mathematics reveals\r\ntechniques and perspectives that would otherwise be invisible.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
