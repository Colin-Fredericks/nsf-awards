 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726484  Paul    The rational development of multicomponent polymer blends (or alloys)  requires an understanding of the polymer-polymer interactions involved  and how to control them in order to generate materials with useful  mechanical properties, obtain optically clear mixtures. (miscibility),  disperse impact modifiers in a brittle matrix, reactively compatibilize  immiscible mixtures, etc.  This proposal outlines a program for  obtaining quantitative information on the interactions between pairs of  a number of important polymer repeat units. The methodology involves  experimental observations of the phase behavior of blend systems that  are analyzed in terms of appropriate theories of mixing combined with a  mean field binary interaction model.  The experimental methods involve  copolymer composition mapping, the critical molecular weight method,  quantitative analysis of phase diagrams, light scattering, and neutron  reflectivity.  Specific objectives involve (a) comparison of  interactions of acrylate and methaclylate monomer units having various  pendant groups with other polymers, (b) effect of bromine atoms in the  repeat unit on interactions with other polymers, (c) development of  reactive copolymers that are miscible with styrene/acrylonitrile  copolymers (SAN) for use in reactive compatibilization of engineering  thermoplastics with ABS materials, and (d) comparison of polymer-polymer  interfacial thicknesses measured by neutron reflectivity with those  predicted from theory using interaction energies determined in this  program.    The neutron reflectivity studies will be performed on pairs of  commercially important polymers like polycarbonate, poly(phenylene  ether), etc. with copolymers, e.g., styrene with acrylonitrile, maleic  anhydride, etc. The experiments will be done in collaboration with the  National Institute of Standards and Technology and industry.  In  addition, the research will make a systematic study of the kinetics of  phase separation of selected blends using  a recently constructed light  scattering apparatus.  This will provide accurate assessment of spinodal  temperature-composition curves for use in evaluation of interaction  energies as well as information about polymer-polymer diffusion  coefficients.  %%%  The results of this fundamental research will be quantitative  information about interactions between polymer repeat unit pairs for use  in designing homogeneous or phase separated polymer blends (or alloys)  that either are or may be of technological importance.  This research  will provide a valuable educational experience for students at all  levels including postgraduate, PhD, undergraduate, and high school.  ***",
