The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and  experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-four-month postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Denise S. Pope to work with Dr. John  Christy at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in  Balboa, Panama.    Dr. Pope will use fiddler crabs as a model system to study  the theories of sexual selection and animal communication to  understand the evolution of sexually dimorphic exaggerated  traits.  Using signal detection theory, she will study the  claw waving display of male fiddler crabs, which is done to  threaten other males and to attract females for mating.  Her  studies will use a video playback technique for the  presentation of stimuli.  She will present females with  videos of displays produced by males in different  situations, and against different backgrounds.  This test  will distinguish between female preference for detectability  and female preference for a more exaggerated signal.    Dr. Christy has studied sexual selection and communication  in fiddler crabs for twenty years.  The Smithsonian Tropical  Research Institute has well-equipped facilities, and  provides a location where these crabs are found in the  greatest diversity and where the genus is thought to have  originated.    ***",
