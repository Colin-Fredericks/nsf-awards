Research activities include study of several major  topics: (i) use of Mg/O or Be/O co-implantation to achieve high  (>10E18cm-3) p-type doping of GaN and AlGaN. By varying the doses  of each co-implanted species existing theory will be tested, and  the role of  O established by comparing its effect to that of  other species; co-implant species include N, Ar or F.  (ii) comparison of different acceptor dopants: Ca was found to  have a similar ionization level to that of Mg, i.e., ~170meV.  Zn, Cd, Be will be implanted, and C, Ge and Sn will be co-  implanted with group III species to assess their functionality as  acceptors. (iii) comparison of different donor dopants; the  doping properties of the group VI species, S, Se and Te are, as  yet, not established in GaN. (iv) use of ultra-high annealing  temperatures to achieve higher activation efficiency. Preliminary  data indicate higher doping can be achieved for annealing at  >1500 C. The major problem at these temperatures is preservation  of the GaN surfaces - various methods of AlN deposition will be  investigated as a solution. (v) investigation of new implant  isolation species, such as V, Fe or Co, which might create  thermally stable deep levels in GaN and have application to  produce device isolation. The significance of this work will be  the development of a more complete understanding of doping in GaN  and related materials providing a materials science basis for  selective area implantation in the development of advanced  devices.  %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  materials science having high technological relevance. The  research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a  fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic  devices. The basic knowled ge and understanding gained from the  research is expected to contribute to improving the performance  and stability of advanced devices and circuits by providing a  fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing  improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important  feature of the program is the integration of research and  education through the training of students in a fundamentally and  technologically significant area.  ***",
