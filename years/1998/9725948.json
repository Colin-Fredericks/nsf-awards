The co-organizers are Professors Akif Baha  Balantekin of the University of Wisconsin in Madison and  Professor Takaharu Otsuka of the University of Tokyo in  Japan.  The objective of the seminar is to bring together  researchers who work in the field of nuclear physics as well  as condensed matter physics to discuss implementation of  symmetry principles in many-body phenomena.  The focus will  be on symmetries in quantum systems which contain relatively  small number of particles.  In these systems it therefore  becomes important to consider the symmetries the system  possesses, in order to clarify the underlying dynamics of  the system.    The session will focus on six theme topics:  (l) dynamical  symmetry and supersymmetry in nuclear collective motion as  described by the interacting boson model and its extensions;  (2) symmetry in electronic many-body systems including  mesoscopic systems and micro-clusters; (3) chaos and broken  symmetries, quantum integrable systems; (4) utility of  symmetry concepts in nuclei near the drip lines; (5)  symmetries of relativistic problems; and (6) symmetries in  the scattering theory.  Results of the seminar should define  new directions in the field, start new collaborations  between U.S. and Japanese researchers and reinforce the  existing ones.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese  experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to  advance their own work, and will set the stage for future  collaborative projects.  Seminar organizers have made a  special effort to involve graduate students and postdoctoral  researchers.  The proceedings of the meeting will be made  available on the World Wide Web.  ***",
