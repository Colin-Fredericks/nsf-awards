 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Jeffrey H. Byers, of the Department of Chemistry and   Biochemistry at Middlebury College, is supported by a Research in   Undergraduate Institutions award from the Organic and Macromolecular   Chemistry Program for his studies of radical aromatic substitution via   atom transfer addition.  Professor Byers studies the reactions of   aromatic and heteroaromatic substances with a variety of electrophilic   radicals.  The electronic nature of the aromatic ring is modified through   the use of suitable protecting groups and through the formation of arene   chromium tricarbonyl complexes, thus providing aromatic substrates   reactive toward electron-rich radicals.  Professor Byers is also   exploring intramolecular reactions leading to the formation of mitocene   and pyrrolizidine ring systems, common structural features of a range of   biologically active compounds.  Although organic molecules containing an unpaired electron (`radicals`)   are often very reactive, they have until recently received comparatively   little attention as potential participants in the synthesis of organic   molecules.  With the support of a Research in Undergraduate Institutions   award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor   Jeffrey H. Byers, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at   Middlebury College, explores a class of radical-forming reactions known   as atom-transfer additions for their ability to facilitate the synthesis   of aromatic compounds.  Products potentially made accessible through the   discovery and development of this chemistry include aryl acetic acids, a   general class of compounds frequently used as analgesics and   anti-inflammatory medications, as well as a variety of more complex   structures representing common structural features of a range of   biologically active compounds.",
