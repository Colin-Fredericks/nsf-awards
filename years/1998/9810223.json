 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harmful algal blooms, commonly called `red tides` or HABs,  are a serious economic and public health problem throughout  the world. In the U.S., the most serious HAB problem is  paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), a potentially fatal  neurological disorder caused by human ingestion of shellfish  that accumulate toxins as they feed on dinoflagellates of  the genus Alexandrium. These organisms cause human illness  and death due to PSP, repeated shellfish harvest  quarantines, and the mortality of fish and marine mammals.  This phenomenon, which affects thousands of miles of U.S.  coastline and numerous fisheries resources, has expanded  dramatically in the last two decades, especially in the Gulf  of Maine. The ECOHAB-GOM addresses several fundamental  issues regarding Alexandrium blooms in the Gulf of Maine: 1)  the source of the Alexandrium cells that appear in the fresh  water plumes in the western Maine coastal current (WMCC); 2)  Alexandrium cell distribution and dynamics in the eastern  Maine coastal current (EMCC); and 3) linkages among blooms  in the WMCC, the EMCC and on Georges Bank. Utilizing a  combination of numerical modeling, hydrographic, chemical,  and biological measurements, moored and drifting current  measurements, and satellite imagery, we will characterize  the structure, variability and autecology of the major  Alexandrium habitats in the Gulf of Maine.",
