 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804472  Lowman      This project will sponsor an international symposium entitled \"Forest Canopies 1998: Global Perspectives\" at the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens in Sarasota, Florida.  Forest canopies serve as a critical interface between the earth's surface and atmosphere. regulating global climate as well as biogeochemical and hydrological cycles.  They are important centers of global biodiversity and provide food, medicines, building materials and other products for many cultures.  They are also important to indigenous people who have lived in association with forests for many generations.  High rates of deforestation have made studies of forest canopies an urgent priority for Science.    In 1994, the first conference of forest canopy biologists, educators, and conservationists was held at Selby Botanical Gardens.  More than 200 scientists from 26 countries convened to discuss the importance of establishing protocols for canopy research, and also to share preliminary results.  At this time, canopy biology was in its infant stages.  Four years later, canopy biology has grown into a comprehensive field of research, but is lagging in some countries.  The major goals of the second symposium are twofold:  1. to invite scientists from developing countries ( and countries where canopy science has not yet been initiated) to participate and share information;  2. to discuss how scientists can interface with policy-makers and forest managers to implement sound conservation practices for forests and their canopies.    The symposium will feature several public talks, keynote speakers, and ten sessions with canopy themes.  Special pre-conference workshops will be held to share field methods for canopy access, and invite regional school students and teachers to interact with scientists.  In addition, discussion sessions and poster displays will be scheduled throughout the four days, as well as post-conference field trips.  The talks will be published in a volume and summaries of each session and/or discu ssion will be published in the Gardens' journal, Selbyana.  Participants will formulate guidelines for future canopy research in developing countries and regions that have not previously had such initiatives, and explore ways for scientists to become more directly involved in policy making with reference to forest conservation.",
