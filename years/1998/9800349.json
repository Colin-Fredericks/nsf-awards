 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9800349  Wang       Considerable effort has been made in the past to analyze and optimize the process control in injection molding at the level of machine parameters, process variables or even part quality, such as weight or thickness.  Numerous methods have been tried, but results all depend on specific material/mold configuration and on a particular molding machine, i.e., the method is not generic.  No definitive correlation between any process variable and the part quality has been established.  Accordingly, system disturbances (e.g., uncontrollable material variation, machine-to-machine characteristics, etc.) still cannot be handled adaptively to ensure part quality. The objective of the research is to solve these problems by taking a novel three-pronged approach: (1) Determine the initial machine-setup condition based on rigorous process simulation rather than trial-and-error or ad-hoc experience; (2)  Develop and incorporate a physical model based on molding dynamics and incorporating basic material properties in the control loop for part quality to take care of any possible system disturbance; and (3)  Develop smart sensors and associated intelligence to monitor and control part quality on-line and adaptively without the need for elaborate and impractical instrumentation (e.g., flush-mounted pressure transducers in the cavity).       Successful completion of this project will have great impact on the injection molding industry in terms of ability to control product quality automatically and adaptively.",
