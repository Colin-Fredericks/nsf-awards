Existing prototypes have already proved general feasibility, but they have also highlighted the need for concerted R&D activities in order to develop problem-specific technical solutions.  This forum is intended to present the latest efforts by American and European researchers from academia, industry and government labs in areas where problem-specific solutions are either not yet available or not yet affordable.  Among the areas to be addressed are:  (1) computer aided configuration tools for the design and optimization of different kinematics for specific applications; (2) light-weight and accurate mechanical joints; (3) improved linear and rotary actuators; (4) improved position measuring strategies; (5) control concepts; and (6) appropriate CAD/CAM systems for the required machine characteristics.\r\n     To be held in Milano, Italy, August 31 & September 1, 1998, this forum is organized in cooperation with Professors F. Jovane and L. Tosatti of the ITIA-CNR Institute of Industrial Technologies and Automation National Research Council in Milano, Italy.   This forum focuses on the emerging concepts and enabling technologies for future manufacturing applications of PKMs.  Practically, it forms part of a strategy to reduce time-to-market, lower costs, and improve production flexibility for these kinds of machines.",
