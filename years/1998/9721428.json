 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funding for 12 months of a three-year  project in which the Principal Investigator will augment his  skills in geometry by adding expertise in computational geometry  and by studying applications to geographic information systems,  robotics and astrophysics.  At the same time he will create two  new graduate courses for students in mathematics, computer  science and environmental science to be offered in the Department  of Mathematics at Duke.  These courses will be coordinated with  other courses in Computer Science and the Nicholas School of the  Environment and will help train students to participate in  seminars and research projects of Duke's Center for Computational  Geometry.  (The Principal Investigator is co-director of the  center with his sponsors in computer science.)  In addition to  developing these new courses, the Principal Investigator will  begin to train Ph.D. students to work on applied problems in  coordination with the center.    During summer, 1998, the Principal Investigator will work full  time in the CS Department at Duke developing the first new  graduate course and studying applications to robotics.  In  academic year 98-99, he will spend 50% of his time in CS working  on collaborative research projects with his co-sponsors in CS.   The other 50% of his time will be in the Department of  Mathematics where he will serve as department chair and teach the  first course in the fall.  Then in summer of 1999 he will work  full time in CS and in the SOE, developing the second course and  broadening his knowledge  to include GIS.    This work is part of a broader effort by the Department of  Mathematics at Duke to expand the training of its graduate  students by focusing more on computation and applications.    This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
