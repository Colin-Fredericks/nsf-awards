 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major goal of these studies is to design and develop ceramic-  based multisite microsensors. At the present time, microsensors are  being   used  primarily  in  the  area  of  neuroscience  to  study  neurochemicals  and to measure the electrical properties  of  brain  cells.  The advantages of microsensors are the abilities to rapidly  (<lsec) measure molecules or electrical potentials on small spatial  scales  (microns)  to  understand  biological  signaling  processes  directly. In addition, such methods can be miniaturized to be  used  directly  in  the field. Current designs of such microsensors  have  been  expensive, fragile, subject to failure and limited  in  their  scope  of  applications. We plan to develop a new  type  of  sensor  based  on  the  concepts  of  the micromachining  of  ceramic.  The  resulting sensors may be cheaper to manufacture, stronger, and more  inert, and capable of measuring chemicals and electrical potentials  at  the  same  time. The potential uses of these  microsensors  for  chemical  measurements may be extensive. It is  possible  that  low  cost ceramic-based microsensors can be used to measure chemicals in  a  variety of situations such as brain recordings, used to  control  fermentation processes, for determinations of the purity of  drugs,  for  determining  harvest  time information  regarding  fruits  and  vegetables,  and  they  will likely have a  variety  of  additional  biological  sensing applications. These microsensors could  have  a  global  impact  on neuroscience, agriculture, industry,  government  and private labs, and the general public.",
