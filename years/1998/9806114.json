Novae ejecta are generally modeled as spherically symmetric shells, but observations of shells around old novae show that few, if any, are spherically symmetric. A large database of optical spectropolarimetry of Nova Cas 1995 has been obtained that has shown that this nova's ejecta had an aspherical structure soon after discovery. High-resolution spectra of Nova Cas 1995, which has recently entered the nebular stage, will be obtained at the Apache Point Observatory 3.5m telescope.  The preliminary analysis of high-resolution spectra showed that emission lines of different atomic species have different line profiles.  These atomic species exhibited distinct polarimetric behavior: polarization changes that were apparent in the spectra of hydrogen lines were not visible in the spectra of helium lines.  The combination of these datasets implies that the hydrogen and helium lines that are observed arise from separate regions of the ejecta.  The new data obtained will allow the further tracing of  the development of the structure  observed early in the outburst of this slow nova, allowing one to build a 3-dimensional picture of the ejecta geometry.  The results of the modeling will have consequences for researchers who model the ejecta of classical novae and additionally, for those who study the formation of outflow nebulae around other objects such as bipolar planetary nebulae.\r\n\r\nThe additional observations required for this project will be obtained in the coming year.  This POWRE award will make it possible to finish the reduction and analysis of the spectroscopic observations, and to complete the analysis of the spectropolarimetry.  Graduate students will be employed to assist in the reduction, data analysis, and observations.  The student will gain valuable experience in a variety of astronomical techniques that will be of use in any future research career.\r\n\r\nThe Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences is providing the funds for this award.\r\n***\r\n",
