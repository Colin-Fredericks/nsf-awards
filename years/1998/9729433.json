 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of the Chemistry Division, Magid will use light scattering and   small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) to investigate polyelectrolytes and   the formation of giant micelles that are self-assembled in aqueous   solutions from surfactants.  In selected cases the micellar solutions   will be studied in flow fields similar to those found in some of the   applications for which these solutions are used.  Both self-organizing   and covalent polyelectrolytes are to be studied, providing a valuable   bridge between what are often considered two different fields of study.    The SANS experiments proposed here will provide data on chain   conformations as a function of intrinsic stiffness of the polyelectrolyte   chains.  Of special interest are the changes in micellar length and in   spatial organization (conformation) that occur with changes in surfactant   concentration.  This work will produce the first quantitative numbers   concerning the concentration dependence of micellar growth parameters in   dilute solutions.  Micelles and polyelectrolytes are broadly found in biological systems,   where they have a variety of structural and functional roles.  They are   also ubiquitous in consumer and industrial applications such as   personal-care products, drug-delivery systems, viscosity modifiers in   foods and in processing of polymers, drag reduction and shear-thinning in   heat-exchanger fluids, paints, and surface modification of materials.    Several recent theoretical advances have pointed to the need for new   experimental data such as Magid will gather in her studies of thread-like   micelles and the influence of polyelectrolytes on them.",
