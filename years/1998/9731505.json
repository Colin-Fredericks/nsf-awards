 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this work is to understand, explain and justify the methods by which we learn from experiments in the face of uncertainty and error.  Standard statistical methods (that involve significance tests, confidence intervals, and the like) are in widespread use in science.  But despite their widespread and successful use in science and other spheres, such methods have been subject to enormous philosophical controversy and criticism, giving rise to the popular subjective Bayesian way in philosophy of science.  This stark contrast between effective research practice and philosophical analysis demands close scrutiny.  The PI will do this by applying a framework for analysis which she has developed in the course of several publications.  Briefly stated, this framework views experiments as efforts to learn from error, with statistics contributing a disciplined way to model patterns of irregularity that allow errors to be distinguished from background noise.  By weaving together strategies and techniques for learning from error that are employed in fields as diverse as statistics, engineering, physics, biology, and psychology, the PI is uncovering strikingly similar patterns of learning from error-patterns overlooked in the leading philosophical accounts of scientific inference.",
