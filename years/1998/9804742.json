A true lagerstatten, they have yielded over four millioon late Pleistocene plant and animal fossils that represnet nearly 600 species.  Although permeated with asphalt, the vertebrate skeletal material is little altered from its original state.  Ranging in age from 40,000 to 4,000 years before present, the fossils span a time of significant climatic and faunal change in North America.  Nevertheless relatively few time-transgressive analyses of biotic change have been done at Rancho La Brea.  This is largely due to a lack of basic information on its taphonomy and chronology.  Without an understanding of the biases that affected preservation, and without confidence in the age of the fossils, it is very difficult to use the collection for paleoecological and evollutionary studies.  The research proposed here will begin to rectify this problem by a thorough taphonomic analysisi and intense radiometric dating of a subset of the preserved material.  Three conditions favor the research at this time.  First, improvements in radiocarbon dating physics and chemistry over the last 15 years allow dramatically smaller samples to be dated with far better accuracy and precision.  Second, the science of taphonohy has advanced significantly and there now exists a large body of published methodologies and case studies that from a framework for the research.  Third, a modern excavation at Rancho La Brea has produced 47,000 specimens collected with detailed 3-dimensional and lithologic data for the first time, all entered into a database and available for study.\r\n\r\nThe accepted mode of accumulation of Rancho La Brea vertebrates is entrapment in shallow seeps of sticky asphalt.  However, both fluvial action and trampling have also been suggested to play significant roles.  In addition, it has been argued that carnivores were likely attracted to the site by trapped, dying, and dead herbivores.  It is unclear how long carcasses remained exposed and how often entrapment events occurred.  To better understand the taphonomic history of the tar pits, a detailed examination of the mammal material preserved in Pit 91, the modern excavation, is proposed.  All bones of mammal material preserved in Pit 91, the modern excavation, is proposed.  All bones of mammal species larger than 5kg will be examined by trained observers for evidence of carnivore modification, trampling marks, weathering, abrasion, insect damage, and rodent gnaw marks.  Skeletal part representation data will be collected for each taxon and examined to document biases in preservation.  The data gatehred on bone modification and representation will be used to produce the first quantitative analysis of the taphonomic processes that affected the deposits.  A second major question that will be addressed is that of temporal mixing within the deposits.  Because of the semi-fluid nature of the exposed asphalt, it has been suggested that bones move verticlly after deposition, thus destroying any stratigraphy.  To examine this issue, an intense molecular level AMS 14C dating of Pit 91 bones will be undertaken.  Multiple bones will be dated from the sme stratigraphic level as well as throughout the depth of the deposit to determine the extent of temporal mixing within a bone concentration.  The primary significance of the proposed taphonomic and chronological research is that it will lay the necessary groundwork for future research on the spectacular Rancho La Brea collections.",
