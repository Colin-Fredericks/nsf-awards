 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727150  Lilly        The boundary layer vortex, which includes the relatively well-known dust  devil,  generally takes the form of  a benign columnar atmospheric vortex.  It is less  well understood than its more dramatic cousin, the tornado, but recent evidence  suggests that it may be more common than originally thought and may be important  as a controlling factor of boundary layer structure and interactions.  An investigation  is proposed of the dynamics of the initiation and maintenance of boundary layer  vortices, in particular, the dust devil vortex.  This research will be primarily a  theoretical and numerical simulation study, but may include limited acquisition and  analysis of observational data, especially from mobile Doppler radar.        As with their larger scale relatives, the principal scientific question regarding  dust devils is their source of rotation.  A single answer probably doesn't exist.  An  ambient source of vertical vorticity may be found, in some cases, as an environmental  feature, or it may be generated locally.  In the absence of horizontal shear, the  vertical vorticity in a dust devil might form from tilting of horizontal vorticity, either  that of the mean shear in the surface layer or again by local generation.  In absence of  other environmental sources, pre-existing convective cells and their mutual  interactions have been evidenced as sources of both vertical and horizontal vorticity.   The study will consider all these possibilities, but the primary focus is on the last, due  partly to its mostly unexplained appearance in several laboratory experiments and  field projects.        By inhibiting dissipation and diffusion, highly helical dust devils may transport  near-surface air higher into the atmosphere than can non-rotating thermals. Thus they   may be important or even dominant in establishing the height of the mixed layer,  controlling or modifying heat, momentum and particulate transports.  These energetic   and transport properties of rotating ther mals will also be considered in this study.        The objectives of the proposed research are summarized as the following:  1.  To seek and compare mechanisms by which convective thermals acquire rotation  and become quasi-vertical columnar vortices in either the presence or absence of  horizontal or vertical wind shear;  2.  To examine the energetics associated with the maintenance of such vortices;  3.  To evaluate and compare the vertical transports of heat, momentum and  particulates by rotating and non-rotating boundary layer thermals        From this study, some necessary conditions for the formation and maintenance  of boundary layer vortices will be determined.  Results may shed some light on the  formation mechanisms of tornadoes.  Knowledge gained of the role that boundary  layer vortices play in transports of heat, momentum, chemicals and particulates may  have impact on /pollution studies, hazardous waste management, and the prediction of  initiation of deep convection.  ***",
