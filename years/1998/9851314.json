 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to integrate rapid prototyping into a fully networked CAD/CAM/Engineering environment while fostering shared use of equipment and curriculum collaboration between collegedepartments. Rapid prototyping is a key and final element in the full integration of computer technology in the teaching of the manufacturing process at Moraine Valley C. C., from initial concept to final delivery of the product.The major objectives of the project are: (1) to improve the learning environment by revising curricula in seven courses to include exposing approximately 300 students each semester to rapid prototyping in a modern laboratory; (2) to develop an interactive rapid prototyping laboratory that will enable hands on learning experiences for high school teachers from the twelve secondary schools that form the Moraine Area Career System (MACS) partnership; (3) to provide learning experiences for high school students through the MACS, and (4) to sponsor a two-part symposium incorporating distance learning and a hands on learning experience in rapid prototyping technology for faculty from thirteen colleges and universities plus seven additional high schools that form the South Met EdNet Consortium partnership.The immediate goal is to upgrade the technical content of the curriculum by incorporating rapid prototyping in the two college departments. New program outcomes move student learning from a design step with 3D geometric models to an actual prototype of the manufactured part followed by analysis and refinement of the product. Students will engage in the learning    experience in a real-world rapid prototyping environment.",
