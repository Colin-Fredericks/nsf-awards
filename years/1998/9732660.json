New types of doped quantum dots will be  designed, prepared, and characterized using synchrotron radiation  at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National  Laboratory. Various doped quantum dots, especially rare-earth  doped oxides, as well as thin films and nano-channel grids, will  be prepared and studied. Synchrotron radiation experiments will  include x-ray excited luminescence (XEL), extended x-ray  absorption fine structure (EXAFS), response time of doped quantum  dots to x-ray pulses, geometrical resonance, and studies of  coherent light emission in nanowires and nanodots. The XEL and  EXAFS measurements are expected to be particularly useful for  probing the local environment surrounding impurity atoms and for  understanding impurity-host interactions. The project is co-  supported by the DMR Electronic Materials Program and the MPS  OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities).  %%%  Basic research issues in a topical area of materials science  having strong technological relevance are addressed by this  project. The basic knowledge and understanding gained from the  research is expected to contribute to improving the performance  of advanced materials by providing a fundamental understanding  and a basis for designing and producing improved nanostructures.  An important feature of the program is the integration of  research and education by providing an important educational  opportunity through the GOALI aspect of the project for students  to experience both academic and industrial research approaches  and environments.  ***",
