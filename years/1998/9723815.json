Dr. Abut request funds for travel, supplies and student  support to carry out a cooperative project with his  counterpart at the Singapore Nanyang Technological  University to study the use of higher-order statistics to  find an optimal way to  prescribe radiation dosage for tumor  regions without exceeding the radiation tolerance of  surrounding normal tissues and radiation sensitive organs.  Dr. Abut and his Singapore counterpart are competent,  experienced and  respected in this field.  This study  addresses a practical question of using a statistical method  for optimal signal and image processing analysis.  The  result of this analysis could have great potential for  contributing to the development of  an improved application  of radiation therapy for cancer treatment.  The proposed  project combines theory, algorithm development and testing,  and application to real data and  provides an excellent  opportunity for a graduate student to learn image processing  and medical imaging.",
