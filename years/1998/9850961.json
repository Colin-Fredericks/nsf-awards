 "awd_abstract_narration": "A bench-scale continuous catalytic reactor with automated chemical analysis, data logging and control capabilities will be assembled from purchased components for use in undergraduate laboratory instruction in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Nebraska Lincoln. Students will design experimental protocols and operate this equipment in three different undergraduate classes: the current senior Unit Operations laboratory course; the sophomore Methods and Measurements laboratory; and the upper-class division independent directed study course taken by highly motivated students. For the Unit laboratory, reaction kinetics fundamentals and catalyst activity, selectivity and performance as a function of temperature and pressure will be taught by reactions such as n-butane over a platinum-loaded zeolite catalyst. For the sophomore measurements lab, experimental design, statistical analysis of data, introductory diffusional effects, and dimensional analysis will be taught with simpler experiments, such as trace analysis for residence time distribution and adsorption isotherm determination as functions of temperature and pressure. Independent studies depend on the students and professors involved. The addition of a continuous kinetics experiment is part of an ongoing updating effort which includes complementary sets of batch and continuous experiments in the undergraduate laboratory.",
