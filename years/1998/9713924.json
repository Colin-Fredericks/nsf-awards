 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide for the acquisition of a  standard bench top flow cytometer with argon laser  illumination, five parameter analysis, and cell sorting  capability.  Flow cytometry is an important tool  for interdisciplinary research on the dynamics of  microbial populations and biogenic particles that  participate in the cycling and flux of major elements in  aquatic ecosystems of the land-sea margin.    Flow cytometry was originally developed as a tool to  analyze individual cells or biological particles  in cellular biology and clinical  research.  It has more  recently found wide applications in aquatic biology,  because it can provide a level of temporal and spatial  resolution of the abundance and characteristics of  biogenic and non-biological particles in aquatic systems  that no other current technology can match.  This  level of resolution is currently needed to complement  largescale models of elements cycling in estuaries  and oceans, where the distribution and characteristics of  biological particles are the key factors that determine  the fats and flux of essential chemical components.  Thus, flow cytometry is no longer a technology restricted  to clinical studies, but can profitably complement other  techniques routinely used in aquatic ecology and  biochemistry. This proposal represents an attempts to  expand the use of flow cytometry in the study of the  density, distribution, cellular characteristics, taxomic  composition and trophic interactions of biogenic  particles in estuaries and continental shelf  ecosystems  of the middle Atlantic region.    The instrument will reside at the Horn Point  Environmental Laboratory which has made a major  commitment to the study of plankton dynamics, physical  oceanography, and physical-biological interactions in  estuarine and marine ecosystems.  The instrument is  extremely versatile and will be used in laboratory-and  ship-based studies as well as in laboratory course work.  Operation is relatively easy and user-friendly, makin g it  an ideal tool not only for ecological research, but also  for education.",
