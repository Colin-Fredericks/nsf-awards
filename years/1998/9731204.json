The co-organizers are Professor Adrian Bejan, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Duke University, Professor Peter Vadasz, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Durban-Westville, Durban and Professor Detlev G. Kroger, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Stellenbosch.  The focus of the workshop is on thermal sciences, heat transfer technologies, and environmental phenomena associated with energy flows and installations.  The purpose of the workshop is to promote scientific collaboration between the two countries by exploring opportunities for joint research in specific topics of high priority to the scientific community.    Among the topics of discussion are engineering thermodynamics and refrigeration, energy engineering, and heat transfer augmentation.  In the environmental area, the two major topics are the environmental impact of energy systems, and convection in porous media.  South Africa is the world leader in the commercial production of synthetic liquid fuel (converted from coal) for motor vehicles.  South Africa also has the world's largest installed capacity of dry cooling towers.  These and other areas of technological leadership will be discussed by the South African participants.  This award is supported  jointly by the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems and the Division of International Programs.",
