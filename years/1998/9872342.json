 "awd_abstract_narration": "9872342  Mahadevan  The objective of this study is to develop a practical method to  estimate the time-variant reliability of mechanical and  structural systems.  Currently used analytical methods have  several simplifying assumptions regarding the loads and the  resistance to deformation which lower their applicability to  practical structures.  The project will develop a simulation-  based methodology which has advantages of robustness, ease of  implementation and visualization, and the capability to model  realistic situations.  The methodology will be sufficiently  general to include ductile and brittle structural behavior.  An  adaptive importance sampling simulation technique will be  developed to estimate the system reliability at different  instances of time.  A significant failure sequence of the  structure is the starting point for the adaptive simulation.   This project will extend the idea of importance sampling to  structures with multiple failure sequences and time-varying loads  and resistance to deformation.  ***",
