 "awd_abstract_narration": "A solid background in working with mathematical models using calculus and statistics has become a necessary component of education in Biology, particularly in the sub-fields of Ecology and Evolution.  However, the importance of mathematical concepts to Biology is extremely difficult to convey to beginning students who are more comfortable with qualitative, \"natural history\" approaches.  The problem in understanding the necessity of math to biology is greatly exacerbated by the fact that most Math courses and Biology courses are taught independently of each other, even when one course is a prerequisite to another.  These difficulties are particularly acute in teaching these subjects in inner city environments where the students tend to have poor quantitative skills and limited exposure to science.         We are addressing this difficulty by developing two coordinated undergraduate courses, one in Ecology and Evolution and one in Mathematical Modeling, that are designed to be taken together.  The flow of topics is designed to reinforce each other.  The Math course clarifies underlying principles of models of calculus and statistics and the Biology course provides a context for their application.  We are developing computer simulations and exercises using the spreadsheet program Excel, which is readily available to all students.  A new textbook in Mathematical Modeling for the Life Sciences is being produced, and we are making our lecture notes, laboratory exercises and simulations available on line.  We have assembled a team of outside advisors helping us to evaluate our materials, and have constructed an assessment plan.",
