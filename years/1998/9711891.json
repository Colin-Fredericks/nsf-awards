 "awd_abstract_narration": "9811891  Sholkovitz    This ocean science technology development project focuses on the   design, construction, and testing of sensor systems for the   elemental analysis of aerosols on buoys at sea. These systems   involve field portable X-Ray fluorescence spectroscopy (FP-XRF)and   an Iron Aerosol Detector (FeAD) which uses fiber optic   spectrometry to measure Fe.  The primary objectives are sensors   which can measure, in an unattended manner, the aerosol   concentrations of dust and reactive iron (Fe) from ocean buoys.   Research areas that would benefit from real-time time-series   aerosol data from buoys include: measurement of off-shore dust and   contaminants transport, effects of mineral dust on the ocean's   biological productivity (the Fe Hypothesis), and the role of   anthropogenic mineral aerosols on the Earth's radiation balance   and climate.    This is a collaborative project between scientists and   engineers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, bringing   together expertise in buoy technology and instrumentation,   computer software development and marine geochemistry. Given that   aerosol sensors have never been deployed from buoys, this project   will involve designing, building and testing the individual   instruments and integrating these sensors through software into a   single buoy system. Bench and tower testing will be followed by   two seasons of field testing on a moored buoy off Woods Hole.",
