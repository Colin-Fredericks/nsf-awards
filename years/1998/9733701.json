 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported by the   Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focuses on the elucidation of   the mechanisms and dynamics of a number of molecular processes at solid   surfaces: diffusion, recombinative desorption, and bimolecular reactions.    Professor Zimmerman and his students at Rutgers University will utilize   state-resolved optical spectroscopy of desorbed species to probe the   dynamics of a number of gas-solid systems including hydrogen on silicon   and metal surfaces and the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide at   transition metal and metal oxide surfaces.  This CAREER research project   will also seek to further exploit the use of `Peer Instruction` in the   undergraduate physics curriculum as a means of overcoming negative   preconceptions that students have about physics.  Professor Zimmerman   will also develop laser-based laboratory experiments for physics   undergraduates.  The elucidation of chemical reaction mechanisms of small molecules   adsorbed onto solid surfaces is a key element in improving the   performance of a number technologically important processes.  Professor   Zimmerman and his students at Rutgers University will use optical   spectroscopy to study the dynamics of  surface chemistry relevant to the   catalyst and microelectronics industries.  This CAREER project will   provide students with a fundamental knowledge of chemistry with   broadranging implications.  Undergraduate students will benefit greatly   by both the pedagogical and laboratory innovations that Professor   Zimmerman will instill in the physics curriculum.",
