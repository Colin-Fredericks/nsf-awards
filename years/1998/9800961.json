With the construction of LIGO, a new era of sensitivity to gravitational radiation will begin.  After LIGO commissioning, the first detection of the effects of gravity waves on the strain measurements in the LIGO interferometers will come from careful analysis of noise-dominated data streams.  This will require a careful characterization of the noise, including the many sources of environmental noise, and the correlation of these noise sources among interferometers.  Environmental noise includes subtle effects such as stray magnetic field and cosmic ray interactions with detector elements that may limit LIGO's sensitivity after the initial phase of operation.  Prior to LIGO commissioning, during the next two years, the Oregon group will develop analysis techniques, analyze simulated interferometer data sets, and investigate the influence of environmental factors on this simulated data and the anticipated real data.\r\n\r\nFollowing the discovery and the initial tests of General Relativity, one can expect a new astronomy of detection of emitters of gravitational radiation to greatly expand our understanding of the universe.  By concentrating on data analysis and investigation of environmental influences on the interferometer data, the Oregon group will make an important contribution to the creation and exploration of this new frontier.  Successful observation of gravity waves will rely on detailed data analysis of an evolving nature.  Initially there is the identification of spurious noise and faulty performance of the instrument.  Success will depend on analysis tools that are able to isolate quickly sources for correction.  This also requires a good characterization of the surrounding environmental noise sources.  As the performance improves, the irreducible limits of performance will be explored.  Only with an advanced understanding of the character of the LIGO data will it be possible to develop new techniques to search for increasingly subtle sources of gravitational radiation, and to adapt these techniques to test new effects and ideas.  By developing tools to understand this data, the Oregon group will be in a position to exploit fully the science of LIGO after LIGO is commissioned by the LIGO Laboratory.\r\n***\r\n",
