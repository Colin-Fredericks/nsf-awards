 "awd_abstract_narration": "The tragic consequences of recent seismic events have stressed the importance of understanding the dynamic behavior of civil engineering structures such as buildings and bridges. Structures which are not able to withstand such severe dynamic loads suffer tremendous damage, or even  complete collapse. This problem is of great social and economic importance, both in the U.S. and abroad. Recently developed techniques in structural control offer exciting opportunities to mitigate the effects of earthquakes. This technology has the potential to revolutionize earthquake engineering, especially in vulnerable existing buildings which are characteristically difficult and expensive to retrofit.             Currently civil engineering undergraduates are seldom provided with an understanding of the principles of structural dynamics or exposure to the innovative new structural control methods.  Thus, the primary objective of the educational plans described herein is to systematically integrate these topics into the civil engineering curriculum. The requested equipment will allow this objective to be met by 1) integrating a series of \"hands-on\" experiments in structural dynamics and control throughout the curriculum, and 2) offering opportunities for undergraduates to participate in ongoing research programs. Students will be expected to tie the theoretical concepts discussed in class to the experimental observations. The plans are designed to provide exposure to structural dynamics and control in the freshman year, and then expand this knowledge through the senior year. Additionally, experiments in passive and active structural control will allow undergraduates to further explore the implications of various design and mitigation strategies. Moreover, students  at all levels will learn the fundamentals of using modern equipment and instrumentation, including sensors, actuators, and data acquisition/analysis systems.",
