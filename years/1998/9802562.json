 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802562  Marder    This project will study the dyanamics of cracks in brittle  materials, using single crystal silicon since it is the best  characterized material available, and single crystals of high  quality are plentiful and relatively inexpensive.  The PIs have  developed a set of experimental tools that improve significantly  the measurement of cracks in motion.  Using these tools they will  gather data that characterize brittle fracture of silicon, and  show how it is influenced by atomic structure.  These tools are  1) a dynamic potential drop method which makes it possible to  measure the velocity and location of a crack 120, 000 times in  succession at intervals of one twentieth of a microsecond and  with accuracy of plus or minus10 meters per second; 2) a loading  apparatus capable of applying rigid displacements to a 10 cm long  sample with accuracy of 0.1 micron; and 3) X-ray topography to  obtain images of subsurface conditions, before and after  fracture.  The research will measure how the speed of a rapidly  running crack in single-crystal silicon depends upon loading  magnitude, loading mode, crystal plane, orientation, and  temperature.  The structures left behind the cracks, both on and  below the fracture surface, will also be measured.  %%%  With a detailed understanding of how running cracks respond to  external and atomic-scale structures, several issues can be  resolved including how microstructural changes make crack  propagation energetically more expensive, and using this insight  to reduce the brittleness of materials; and using known  correlations between damage structures on or below fracture  surfaces with velocity to provide post mortem analysis of  fracture velocities.  This interdisciplinary project is co-funded  by the Ceramics Program of the Division of Materials Research and  the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical  and Physical Sciences Directorate.  ***",
