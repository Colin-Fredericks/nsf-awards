Rothermel, Gregg  Oregon State University    ESS:  An Experimental Environment for Integrating Testing and Debugging   in Form-Based Visual Programming Languages    Form-based visual programming languages (VPLs), which include commercial   spreadsheets and various research systems, are widely used by both   programmers and end users. Research shows, however, that form-based visual   programs often contain faults, and that their creators often express   unwarranted confidence in the reliability of their programs.    The goal of this research is to develop effective testing and debugging   methodologies for form-based VPLs. The strategy is to develop and implement   algorithms that combine program analysis techniques with highly interactive   visual techniques to support testing and debugging in form-based VPLs.   Experiments evaluating both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the   techniques will be conducted on various audiences programming with   form-based VPLs.    The widespread use of form-based VPLs makes it imperative that tasks such   as testing and debugging be supported in a manner suited to the users of   these languages; however, doing so may also yield new insights into ways to   facilitate testing and debugging in other kinds of end-user programming   environments and even in visual programming environments used by   professional programmers.",
