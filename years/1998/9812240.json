The study is directed by a primary task force made up of representatives of professional societies in the computing field, along with a labor economist, a human resources specialist, individuals familiar with issues of underrepresented groups, a representative from community college and four-year college activities and other appropriate individuals.  Evaluation of the data is being carried out by professionals experienced in the area of statistical data analysis.  A report of the task force is planned to be issued at a public meeting in 1999.",
