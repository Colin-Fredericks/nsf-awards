 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal: DMS-9800479  Principal Investigator: Bernard Shiffman    Abstract: Shiffman will continue his research on complex varieties and meromorphic mappings.  He will use techniques from his previous work on currents and Nevanlinna theory to study the dynamics of rational maps in several complex variables. His philosophy involves considering the sequence of iterates of a map and looking at the distribution of values for increasing numbers of iterations instead of for increasing radius, as would be the case in Nevanlinna theory. Shiffman will also apply some new techniques of value distribution theory and algebraic geometry to investigate uniqueness theorems in one complex variable, with a goal towards obtaining a better understanding of the concept of hyperbolicity for algebraic manifolds. He will continue to study the implications of his discovery that Polya's uniqueness theorem and some newer uniqueness results in one complex variable can be reformulated in terms of the relative hyperbolicity of certain quasi-projective surfaces.    Dynamics is the study of the time evolution of processes, which can be as simple as a damped pendulum or as complicated as the weather, governed by physical laws that can be mathematically formulated. The project is concerned primarily with non-linear systems; these are the systems that exhibit chaotic behavior, and understanding how chaotic systems behave is of fundamental importance in many areas of the biological and physical sciences, such as the study of turbulence of fluids, chemical reactions, and biological rhythms. Another component of the project involves understanding the geometry of complex algebraic manifolds, which play an important role in quantum field theory and provide models for diverse physical phenomena.",
