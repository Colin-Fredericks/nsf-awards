 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. McLendon is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and   Organometallic Chemistry Program to perform experimental studies of   electron transfer in metalloproteins.  McLendon has proposed to use   three-helix peptide bundles to probe structural relationships in   long-range electron coupling in proteins.  Having demonstrated a   synthetic methodology that allows systematic protein structural   variations, rigidly linked acceptor/donor moieties may be introduced at   known distances.  This advancement in the art will allow the examination   of distance dependence upon electron transfer along a helix.  A second   aspect of the proposal involves derivatization of hydrogen bonding sites   on the helix.  In the absence of significant perturbations to helix   structure or stability, the proposed modification will help determine the   role of hydrogen bonding pathways in electronic coupling.  Additionally,   electron transfer through side chains and the effect of aromatic residues   on the rate of electron transfer will be investigated.  Understanding electron transfer in metalloproteins has been limited by   the ability of chemists to control protein structure, particularly access   to redox mediating functional groups.  By coupling established   measurement techniques with systematic protein structural variation   methods, roadblocks to the full elucidation of this phenomenon may be   overcome.",
