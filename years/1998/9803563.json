 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803563 Werth The goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms of competitive sorption of organic chemical mixtures in soils and groundwater sediments and to predict its effect on bioavailablility.  Such understanding could lead to development of models and rate parameters to better predict results of in situ bioremediation of organic mixtures in soils and groundwater sediments.  Competition between chemicals in a mixture can dramatically alter equilibrium distributions and slow desorption rates from those measured for individual compounds; therefore, models based on studies of individual compounds do not accurately reflect observations in practice.  Specific objectives of this research are to:  1) determine the effects of competitive sorption on equilibrium distribution values as a function of soil composition and structure,  2) determine the effects of competitive sorption on fast and slow diffusion rates as a function of soil composition and structure and  3) develop a mechanistically based numerical model that predicts the bioavailability of mixtures in soils and sediments.  Results of the research are expected to allow decision makers to gauge if competitive sorption limits bioavailablilty and to evaluate the persistence and risk of sorbate mixtures in the subsurface.  It will also present an analytical tool to allow researchers working in related areas to measure long term desorption isotherms and fast desorption kinetics for mixtures.  Several new molecular sieves (UTD-1 and MCM-41) will be used to compare the effects of competitive sorption in micropores and small mesopores to the effects of competitive sorption in natural solids.  ***",
