 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Proposal:  DMS 9803623  Principal Investigator:  Anatoly Libgober    This project concerns mirror symmetry. It aims to clarify the  mathematical meaning and the scope of mirror correspondence and to  find applications of mirror symmetry. While from mathematical  viewpoint, the original discovery of mirror symmetry predicted a  relation between the enumerative geometry of manifolds from the class  of (Calabi-Yau) manifolds (i.e. the numerology of lines, quadrics,  twisted cubics etc) and differential equations or more precisely the  variation of the Hodge structure on another (Calabi-Yau) manifold,  more recent developments, mainly in physics literature, suggest  numerous additional properties of mirror correspondence.  Mirror  symmetry in the physical sense is a rather imposing condition on  manifolds, defined as a certain isomorphism of conformal field  theories associated with the manifolds and one would like to  understand its exact mathematical meaning.  The investigator is  planning to search for additional topological and geometric properties  of manifolds which will allow us to identify mirror partners, such as  behavior of their characteristic classes, elliptic genera, or other  properties which may facilitate identifying mirror partners in special  situations, e.g. for manifolds with automorphisms.  Another aspect of  the proposed study is the investigation of algebraic structures  associated with objects involved in the mirror symmetry such as  differential equations for the periods of the families of Calabi-Yau  manifolds.  As part of the study of these differential equations the  investigator plans to relate issues arising in mirror symmetry to  previous work on the fundamental groups of the complements, the  monodromy groups and the cohomology of local systems on certain  quasiprojective varieties.    Overall, the goal of the project is to attempt to bridge the gap  between physical and mathematical understanding found in the early  1990's of the phenomenon of mirror sym metry. This will lead to better  understanding of issues which have been the focus of mathematicians  since the middle of 19th century, such as enumeration of geometric  objects, using ideas from string theory, and we hope also to bring  additional mathematical ideas to the understanding of mirror symmetry  in physics.",
