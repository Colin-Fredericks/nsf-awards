 "awd_abstract_narration": "Douglas Dorset is jointly supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division and the   Polymers Program in Division of Materials Research to continue his   studies of direct methods for electron crystallography.   The overall   thrust of the research program is to continue the application of direct   phasing methods to electron crystallography.  Specific goals of the   current project are: 1) to improve methods for collecting more accurate   electron diffraction intensity data; 2) to optimize the use of direct   methods for handling undersampled reciprocal lattices; and 3) to develop   refinement procedures which circumvent the difficulties associated with   multiple scattering problems.  Although the proposal is primarily focused   on methodology development, various applications are also proposed on   small organic systems such as triphenylene, TCNQ, pyrene, quaterrylene   and anthanthrene, and polymeric systems such as whisker crystals of   p-oxybenzoate, spider drag line silk,  and oriented films of   poly(tetrafluoroethylene).    X-ray diffraction has had a tremendous impact on the fields of Chemistry   and Material Science.  It provides a direct experimental probe of   molecular structure at the atomistic level.  However, for many important   organic compounds, only small crystals can be grown that are unsuitable   for investigation by X-ray diffraction.  Electron crystallography   presents a powerful alternative for studying such compounds providing   that a number of technical difficulties can be overcome.  Dorset's work   in this area is directed at improving this alternative to conventional   X-ray crystallography to the point where it is precise and relatively   easy to use.",
