 "awd_abstract_narration": "9734115  Model checking is emerging as a practical tool for automated  debugging of complex reactive systems. In model checking, a high-  level description of a system is compared against a logical  correctness requirement to discover inconsistencies. This CAREER  research aims to enhance applicability and efficiency of this  paradigm by pursuing three objectives in research and education.  First, to make results in computer-aided verification more  accessible to nonspecialists, a modeling method called \"reactive  modules\" is developed as a unified framework. In addition, an  analysis tool that supports a combination of techniques, a  standard textbook on computer-aided verification, and an advanced  course on computer-aided verification will all be created.  Second, to develop techniques that can analyze systems beyond the  reach of existing tools, two new topics, open systems and  heterogeneous systems, are investigated. An open system is a  reactive system interacting with an unspecified environment, and  for analysis of such systems, novel specification paradigms such  as alternating-time temporal logics are studied. For analysis of  systems consisting of components with different synchrony  assumptions and described in different source languages, the  utility of reactive modules as a common semantic framework is  investigated. Finally, to integrate concepts in formal methods  into undergraduate education at Penn, changes to existing courses  in theory and systems are proposed.***",
