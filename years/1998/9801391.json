 "awd_abstract_narration": "Venable  9801391                 The selective forces responsible for the evolution of gender specialization  are being investigated in Lycium (Solanaceae), a genus of desert shrubs,   using a phylogenetic framework.  Lycium is unusual in possessing both   hermaphroditic and separate-sexed species and in having multiple   evolutionary origins of separate sexes.  Specifically, the importance of   selection for outcrossing will be estimated through investigation of   self-compatibility, inbreeding depression, and natural selfing rates.  Also,   whether females compensate for loss of male function by reallocating   resources and the importance of this compensation effect will be determined   using data collected for several reproductive components.  A model is   developed that enables us to evaluate the significance of these components   to the evolution of gender specialization.  These two hypotheses will be   explicitly tested by first inferring phylogenetic relationships (the   evolutionary tree) in the genus, using both morphological and molecular   data, and then making comparisons between dimorphic and monomorphic sister   taxa.     The evolution of gender systems is an important general issue in biology  that has intrigued evolutionary biologists for decades.  This research   project will elucidate the selective forces operating on the evolution of   gender specialization.  Plants make excellent systems in which to study the   evolution of gender, both because of their tremendous variation in gender   systems and their ease of study in the field.  Although gender   specialization is a relatively rare condition (occurring in <10% of   angiosperm species), its repeated evolution among many unrelated taxa makes   it an important evolutionary issue.  Comparative data have frequently been   used to study the evolution of gender in plants, but the analyses have   usually been flawed.  There have been repeated calls for a more careful   analysis of comparative data.  The approach taken here, of  combining field   studies of function with sound phylogenetic comparisons, is one answer to   this call, and will provide an important contribution to the evolutionary   interpretation of gender specialization in plants.",
