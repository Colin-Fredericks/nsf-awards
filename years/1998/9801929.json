This proposal consists of various segments  addressing GLOBE Program needs: support for existing  protocols, development of new protocols, and scientific  research with GLOBE data.  This proposal will support the  current set of GLOBE hydrology protocols, develop a new set  of protocols for freshwater macroinvertebrate biodiversity  data collection, strengthen the metadata submission  standards, and carry out research in seasonal variation in  pH and alkalinity due to snowmelt runoff, climate  variability, and land use change.  Calibration and  validation of remotely sensed data on water transparency  will also be pursued.  This proposal will also support the  development of materials for education that will include  hydrology in the context of Earth Systems Science.  Scientists, students, and the general public will be able to  better understand the role of water in ecosystems and their  role in the care of our natural resources.
