 "awd_abstract_narration": "9871864  Tissue    A systematic and extensive study of the physical, optical, and  dynamical properties of lanthanide-doped metal-oxide  nanostructures will be performed.  These novel materials have  potential applications as materials for lasers and optical  amplifiers, and as phosphors for flat-panel displays.  This work  will assist in developing a theoretical and practical framework  to optimize the optical properties of metal-oxide nanocrystals  and nanocomposites.  A reduction in particle size for micron-size  materials has often resulted in a reduction in optical emission  due to quenching by surface defects.  There are experimental  indications that finite size effects in nanocrystals can  significantly enhance the oscillator strength of impurity  transitions.  In addition, modifications to the phonon  density-of-states, and to the strength of the electron-phonon  interaction, will undoubtedly influence non-radiative relaxation  rates in nanoparticle systems.  Applications in the display  industry require smaller particle size for both high-resolution  and low voltage flat-panel displays.  At the same time, they also  require rugged and high-efficiency materials.  Therefore, the  optical and dynamical properties of the nanocrystals will be  characterized both alone and after passivation by surface  modification or by embedding in a matrix.  The approach will be  to prepare nanostructured materials, and characterize their  structure and morphology by X-ray diffraction,  transmission-electron microscopy, atomic-force microscopy, and  fluorescence spectroscopy at Virginia Tech.  Well-characterized  nanostructured materials will then be studied at the University  of Georgia using high-resolution spectroscopic techniques to  determine how fundamental properties such as oscillator strength,  optical dephasing, non-radiative relaxation, phonon dynamics, and  energy-transfer processes depend on particle size or surface  modification. The collaboration between Virginia Tech and the  University of  Georgia brings together expertise in  nanocrystalline synthesis, processing, and characterization, with  expertise in high resolution and nonlinear spectroscopic  techniques.  The close collaboration between synthesis and  spectroscopy groups will allow the PIs to systematically grow and  characterize new materials, with property measurements providing  rapid feedback to guide material preparation and processing.  The  synergism of this collaboration will allow much more progress in  preparing and understanding very complex nanostructures than if  the groups were working alone  %%%  Novel lanthanide-doped metal-oxide nanostructured materials have  potential applications as materials for lasers and optical  amplifiers, and as phosphors for flat-panel displays.  The  results of this research will provide feedback to engineer  nanostructures to improve the properties of these materials.  The  interdisciplinary nature of the collaboration between Virginia  Tech and the University of Georgia will provide an excellent  educational experience to train future scientists for the  multidisciplinary teamwork that is increasingly characteristic of  scientific research and technological development.  This project  is funded as part of Nanotechnology Initiative by the Ceramics  and the Solid State Chemistry programs in the Division of  Materials Research, the  Physical Foundations and Enabling  Technologies program in the Division of Electrical and  Communication Systems, and the Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.  In addition, the Division of International Programs has provided  funding for travel in order for the PIs to perform collaborative  research with their counterparts in Russia.",
