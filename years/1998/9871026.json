 "awd_abstract_narration": "9871026  Clark  The National Nanofabrication Users Network (NNUN) proposes the acquisition of capital equipment at three NNUN sites to significantly increase our ability to serve the microelectro-mechanics (MEMS) user community.  NNUN is a consortium of five leading university nanofabrication facilities providing nanofabrication user services to the R&D community.      MEMS comprises one of the most technically exciting and commercially attractive areas of nanotechnology. MEMS entails the application of nanofabrication techniques, similar to those used for fabricating electronic devices, to the fabrication of micro- or nano- sized moving parts and systems.  While still embryonic, the potential for MEMS to impact a wide number of technologies is huge.  These applications include motion sensors, alignment systems for integrated optics, steerable mirror arrays, microwave components, high Q electromechanical filters, miniaturized scanning probe microscopes, microanalytical instruments, and a large number of biomedical devices, for example, hearing aids biomimetically based upon insect systems.    Currently over 50 MEMS projects are supported within the NNUN.  It is one of the most rapidly growing areas of user interest.    In this proposal, the PIs provide justification for the acquisition of the following equipment which will enable the NNUN to better serve the MEMS community:    *Cornell                           High Density ICP Plasma Deposition System  *Penn State  Enhanced Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope  *Stanford  Laser Pattern Generation System, High Density ICP Plasma Etch System  ***",
