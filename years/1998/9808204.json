 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 98-08204 KELLER.  The goal of this research project is to  provide a deeper understanding of how the brain controls movements  in response to visual inputs.  The eye movements used to examine  the visual surround are called saccades.  Saccadic eye movements,  which rotate the line of sight in two- dimensional space, are  among the most rapid and accurate movements that humans are  capable of executing. At the same time the mechanical system in  the orbits consisting of the eye and its muscles is relatively  simple compared to multi-jointed limb control systems.  Therefore  the saccadic system has served as a model system for exploring the  general problem of how sensory input is converted to motor  behavior.  In the current project Dr. Keller will develop  distributed models of the sensorimotor processes underlying the  control of saccades.  The model is distributed because no single  dynamic processing element in the model (elements in the model are  meant to represent simplified single neurons in the brain) codes  the control signals needed to transform visual inputs to saccades.  Rather such signals are represented by large populations of active  elements at each stage of the transformation.  The hypothesized  connectivity between various elements within layers of cells and  between layers of cells are determined in the model by an  optimization process that uses a biased random walk algorithm.  The algorithm is generally considered to have biological  relevance.  One common sign of disease in motor systems is that  the trajectories used to move, for example, the hand from one  point to another, or the eye from one direction to another, become  highly curved instead of following the straight-line approach seen  in normal movements. The underlying basis for curved trajectories  will be explored by placing simulated lesions in the connections  or processing elements in the model. The type of feedback used in  the saccadic system to insure accuracy of the movements in the  face of long proce ssing delays in the visual system will be  explored with the model.  The model will help to unify and explain  large amounts of complex neurophysiological data currently being  gathered in other studies, and will also provide guidance for  further anatomical and physiological research into the operation  of the saccadic system.  In addition, emergent properties of the  model may reveal general principles applicable to distributed  motor control with large ensembles of neurons.",
