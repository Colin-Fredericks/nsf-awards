 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800817\r\nGramopadhye  \r\n     The research addresses issues related to human-machine systems design specifically as it applies to inspection system design. As part of the research three different types of inspection systems will be developed: the human, the automated and the hybrid (human + machine) inspection. Following this step, controlled studies will be conducted which will evaluate the performance of the inspection systems for various experimental factors (e.g., number of defects, defect types, defect contrast, etc.).  Performance on the inspection task will be measured using speed, accuracy, signal detection theory measures, and subjective evaluation measures. The development of the different inspection systems and the follow up studies conducted on the three systems will lead to an evaluation of the relative merits of the human, automated and hybrid inspection systems. Moreover, the research will also investigate issues related to dynamic function allocation in hybrid inspection systems. As part of this step, various human-machine communication alternatives will be considered. Specifically, explicit and model based communication will be considered.  Finally, it will lead to the development of a framework for human-machine function allocation in an inspection system as a step toward establishing the best system performance.\r\n     It is anticipated that the results of the research will lead to a better understanding of the issues related to human/machine inspection system design. This will provide system designers to make the best use of the respective advantages of humans and machines in designing  the best performance inspection systems, ultimately leading to improved inspection performance, and therefore, improved quality. The generic nature of this research will facilitate in applying the results not only to a wide variety of inspection tasks within the manufacturing environment such as printed circuit board inspection,  etc., but also to other tasks with significant visual search and decision making components (e.g., real-time military target acquisition, display monitoring).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
