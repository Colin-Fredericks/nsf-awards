Within the modules, each basic tour, including narrative and images, emphasizes the major science concepts needed to understand \"a big idea.\"  The tours are produced in three levels: K-4, 5-8, 9-12, each in English and Spanish.  Within any given classroom, student levels vary, so teacher can assign students to a tour at an appropriate level.  Included are embedded activities, side trips for more depth, and a visit to a research lab where students learn the processes of science first-hand and develop research skills.  Each module includes an on-line Teacher's Guide that contains: teaching strategies, instructional activities, connections to Standards, assessment, and resources for further teacher understanding.  All materials are available through Web access or on CD-ROM.  The project models state-of-the-are research and technology and employs instructional strategies that are encouraged in K-12 classrooms where science is taught in a connected, conceptual, and constructive approach.  Open-ended inquiry allows students to be actively engaged in their own construction of the concepts and story.   Cost sharing is 17%.",
