 "awd_abstract_narration": "9734102  Large software projects produce many documents of many  different types that, together, describe the plans for,  implementation of, and experience with the program. Ensuring  that these documents do not have serious conflicts with each  other is a critical task in any real software system, but  requires a level of integration among the different types of  software documents that is not possible with current  development tools. This research project is working to  identify the document representations, software tools, and  user interface services that are required to integrate  program source code and all other software documents into a  seamless, interconnected whole. The project is producing a  prototype development environment that allows arbitrary  multimedia documentation and hyperlinks inside program  source files and additional tools for managing and  understanding the relationships between software documents.  This research is significant because it is breaking down the  barriers that currently exist between program source code  and the natural language documents that motivate, evaluate,  and explain it. The educational component of this CAREER  project seeks to attract students from underrepresented  groups to the study of computer science through outreach and  a summer program curriculum and is also enhancing the  department's software curriculum through new graduate course  offerings.  ***",
