 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This award is for support of a cooperative project by a US team including by Dr. Sherri Bale and Dr. John G. Compton of theGenetic Studies Section, Laboratory of Skin Biology, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, Bethesda, MD,  and Dr. John DiGiovanni of Brown University Department of Dermatology, and an Egyptian team led by Dr. Nemat Hashem, Professor of Pediatrics and Genetics, and Chief, Ain Shams University Medical Genetics Center in Cairo, Egypt.  They plan to pursue genetic studies to identify the genes that cause a number of severe skin disorders.  This work is facilitated by the high incidence of recessive disorders affecting the skin which occur in an inbred Egyptian population.  They also plan to develop superior methods for detection of genetic mutations which cause these disorders.  These methods will be refined and eventually transferred to clinical laboratories at the medical schools at Ain Shams University and Brown University in Providence, RI     Scope:  This project will involve strong teams in each of the two countries.  These include human geneticists and clinical physicians at Ain Shams University and at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  The opportunities available in Egypt include the relatively less mobile population, and the marriage patterns which allow a fairly uniform genetic database for the Egyptian population.  Dr. Hashem has maintained an extraordinary database of pedigrees on patients with inherited diseases, which will be used in this work.  The US scientists have extensive experience in the genetic and clinical examinations required for this research.  The two sides have had joint activities in the past, and will be able to resume their collaboration smoothly.  This proposal meets INT objective of supporting US-foreign collaboration in areas of mutual benefit.  The project was generated as a result of a workshop on biotechnology organized by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Egyptian Government.  NIH was involved in the evaluation of the project and in recommending its support.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, administered by the US Department of State, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out cooperative activities.",
