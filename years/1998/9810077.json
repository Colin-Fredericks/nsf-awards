 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in International Programs and the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Chemistry Program supports collaborative research by Dr.   Alice E. Bruce of the University of Maine and Dr. Dmitri Lemenovskii of   Moscow State University (Russia).  The goal of the project is to design   gold complexes that will be useful in new materials, such as liquid   crystals.  Organogold compounds containing rod-shaped molecules will be   synthesized and structurally characterized.  Lattice effects in liquid   and solid phases formed from the compounds will be studied.  Both groups   are experienced in the synthetic aspects of the research, but will take   advantage of the University of Maine's capabilities in testing physical   properties of new materials.  Chemists at Moscow State University will   develop methods to deposit metallic gold by laser photolysis of the gold   compounds.  This is the first collaborative research project between the   two principal investigators.  The award will enable an exchange of   graduate students between the University of Maine and Moscow State   University.",
